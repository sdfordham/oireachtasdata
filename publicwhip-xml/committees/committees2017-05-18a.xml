No. 475B, correspondence dated 10 May 2017 from Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, is a briefing document on the Comptroller and Auditor General reporting framework.  This is a very important and useful document and I suggest that all members read it.</p></speech>

We were discussing FeedHenry and the potential to report on it.  I made the point that I would have to do a value for money report if I was to report publicly on it.  I was explaining the difficulty in reporting a single issue other than in a value for money context.</p></speech>

That is useful information for committee members to have.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p> Nos. 477B (i) and (ii), correspondence dated 10 May 2017, from Professor Patrick O&rsquo;Shea, president of University College Cork, providing follow-up information subsequent to the university&rsquo;s appearance before the committee with information of the gender breakdown and the Irish Management Institute&rsquo;s pensions which is now owned by the university.  This information will be reviewed next week along with documentation from the other third level institutions, the Higher Education Authority and Department of Education and Skills.  It will be noted and published.</p> <p>  No. 480B, correspondence received from Caranua, regarding liaison officers.</p> <p>  No. 481B, correspondence dated 10 May 2017 from Mr. Sean &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, on the signing of a lease agreement by Caranua.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#B01500"><p>Under the Act, the Minister has the responsibility to give permission or not for each contract for leases.  It is not clear whatsoever if the Minister gave permission in this case.  That is the question we have asked.  I do not know where that answer is.  We have got answers to parliamentary questions.  We have got an answer from Caranua which is totally and utterly confusing.  The message from the committee was that the agency should not waste survivors&rsquo; moneys on signing a rent agreement.</p> <p>  The second message was whether the Minister had given permission.  At this point, having read it, does the Office of Public Works, OPW, own the building in which Caranua working?  It is not clear.  One is pushing the other.  The OPW is talking about a signing a new lease on behalf of Caranua where it is the third party as it were.  Why is the OPW signing a new agreement?  Does it not own the building?  I have no idea what is going on.  The reason for that is not through any lack of diligence.  I have read about it and tabled questions about it.  I have no idea.  I do know when Caranua was here; it said it did not pay rent.  I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office if Caranua paid rent.  It said it did not pay rent but was about to because it had to move.  Now it looks like it was obliged to pay rent of over &euro;100,000 from 2016 onwards.  Now, it will pay even more rent.  On top of that, it seems to me it was outfitting premises.</p> <p>  At this point, I am appealing to the Chairman that this is a limited fund.  There is absolute upset over the way the survivors have been dealt with.  We know the agency&rsquo;s chairperson said when he went into the organisation that it was a mess and a shambles.  There is currently no board.  Its term finished in March and its last meeting was on 23 March or 24 March.  This organisation is functioning without any oversight.  It would seem it has delegated permission to the chief executive officer and the chairperson to sign a lease.  I have gone through the minutes and it is extraordinary at a time when the board was more worried about the level of pay-outs rather than their own costs.</p> <p>  This committee is of the opinion that Caranua should not be paying rent.  We asked it to clarify and not to sign a lease.  We do not know if it is value for money.  No business case was ever presented through any of the minutes.  We have asked the Department of Education and Skills to clarify what is going on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#B01900"><p>As it feeds into a broader issue, I want to make this point.</p> <p>  I agree with everything Teachta Connolly said on this issue.  We ask questions to get clarity.  Unfortunately, we have not got clarity.  There is more confusion now than there was before we got the correspondence.  Obviously, that is problematic for is.</p> <p>  We are juggling many issues which is quite difficult for us.  We have the issue of the Garda training college, as well as the third and fourth level sectors.  We are going in the right direction in putting a focus on many of these issues.  Caranua is a good example.  I have said a number of times that we are holding hearings.  The hearing was also in respect of the special report the Comptroller and Auditor General did on the redress schemes.  Many were issues were raised by members with the Secretary General as to how the scheme was devised in the first place, false and mistakes and so on.  Where is the follow up for the committee?  If one looks at the structure we are putting around the third and fourth level area and the Garda training college, we are moving in the right direction.</p><p>Maybe we can do something similar here so that we know exactly what the follow-up is.  Teachta Connolly has raised serious issues.  I am not sure how it is best for us to proceed.  It is not good enough that we have hearings and ask questions to which we receive inadequate responses.  We just go back and forth in correspondence and do not get anywhere.  We need to give some thought to dealing with this.  It is somewhat similar to the other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00200"><p>These services were designed to provide for a particularly vulnerable group.  Survivors bring up the issues of the legal costs and the fact that it was supposed to be mediated, along with other overheads.  When an organisation is asked a specific question by the Committee of Public Accounts and does not answer it, the only conclusion we can draw is that the organisation does not want to answer the question.  The group receiving services from Caranua is most vulnerable and is relying on us to get responses.  We have to be very clear with Caranua that we want a yes or no answer.  We do not want to go around the houses.  We want clear responses and a commitment that we will not have lease arrangements hoovering up funds that will not be replenished, as Deputy Connolly has said.  As the Deputy has also said, the timeline is important here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00300"><p>I agree with everything the Deputies have said.  Bord na gCon is coming in later and we have the issue of money spent in Limerick.  Now we have a situation with the lease for Caranua.  I have a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>discussing these topics, which concerns me.  Would the committee consider having a private meeting in which we set out how we are going to approach each of these questions that have not been addressed?  I feel we are having the same conversation all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00400"><p>To be fair to Caranua, it has replied to us.  The difficulty is that the reply is not easy to interpret.  The more serious difficulty is with the Department of Education and Skills and the Office of Public Works.  I do not know who told Caranua it had to move.  It seems to have been both the Office of Public Works and the Department.  One or other of them is telling Caranua it has to pay rent and cannot have a building for nothing.  That seems to be the position.  The board of Caranua, however, also seems to want a new building.  I am not sure where the truth lies.  Neither the Office of Public Works nor the Department of Education and Skills has clarified it for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00500"><p>The main thing is that we do not want money spent unnecessarily when it is needed for the more urgent issues of redress.</p></speech>

We will give them the transcript of what has been said and cover the points we need clarified.  That letter from the Department of Education and Skills does not clarify the matter at all.  It is actually confusing because on the one hand, it claims that the legislation states they shall pay their own costs, while in the previous paragraph the impression is given that they had it free for a period and are now being charged for a lease extension.  They are even contradicting their own stated position in their letter, on the face of it.</p></speech>

If he will allow me, when the Department official was here he said he would go away and check.  That in itself was disingenuous because they have been involved with Caranua from day one.  It has come up repeatedly in the minutes from 2013 in respect of the premises.  The Department of Education and Skills is part of this process.</p></speech>

We need proper clarification.  That letter does not satisfy the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of clarity.  We want the issues raised here and the transcript given to them.</p></speech>

I also want to record apologies from Deputy Alan Farrell who is not here this morning and has sent me a note.</p> <p>  The next correspondence item is No. 478B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing the committee with the terms of reference of the independent investigation being carried out by the University of Limerick.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has asked that the independent review consult with members of the Committee of Public Accounts on their involvement in the process.  In order to assist this, I would ask the secretariat to forward a transcript of our meeting and ask members to submit any proposed additions or changes to the terms as they are.  The secretariat will be happy to compile them.  This gives us an opportunity in addition to what we said as per the transcript to have other items considered as part of the investigation.  Members should submit any such proposals to clerk to be compiled and sent on.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 489B(i) and (ii), further correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; in follow-up from the committee meeting on 13 April 2017 on the cost of redress and Caranua's financial statements.  The areas covered include meetings with religious orders, a note on Barnardos service, a list of all institutions contributing to the redress scheme, a list of property and lands offered by the Sisters of Mercy, property offered and transferring under the  2002 indemnity scheme, properties offered on a voluntary basis, and a note on the Christian Brothers playing fields.  There are many pages in this correspondence.  Have members had an opportunity to read them?  While we note and publish the correspondence, I think we will hold it over as part of our consideration of the Caranua issues.</p></speech>

It concerns section 4(b) of that long document, properties offered to the State and State bodies on a voluntary basis in 2009 and accepted for transfer.  Do I take it that they have now been transferred and accepted?  That is good news.  However, being parochial, I do not know if St. Anne's, Lenaboy Castle at Taylor's Hill in Galway, the former industrial school, has been transferred and accepted.</p></speech>

We had a case in Portlaoise in which a property was offered and taken back and then they offered money.  There can be a lot of legal impediments to completing the actual transfer, even after people accept and agree to do something.</p></speech>

I mix up the reformatories and industrial schools although I should not.  It is lying idle.  I was only there on Sunday.  The former residents come back and visit it every year and go to the grotto.  We have asked in the past for it to be transferred to the city council.  At the time, they offered it to the Health Service Executive, which did not want it.  If there is a chance for the city of Galway to get that building, it is an absolute golden opportunity.  We have many ideas about how to use it.</p></speech>

We will ask for clarification as to whether all those properties that have been accepted for transfer have been transferred.  There is a quite a difference between accepting and completing a transaction.</p> <p>  The next item is Nos. 494(B)(i) and (ii), from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General in the Department of Education and Skills, replying to the committee's request for information on the purchase of Harold's Cross stadium.

It is just the greyhound board resuming the discussion.  We can follow up items by way of subsequent requests afterwards.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 497B, dated 16 May 2017 from Bord na gCon, provides follow-up information from our meeting two weeks ago on pensions, employment details, Harold&rsquo;s Cross stadium, the marketing strategy and a note on the organisation review.  We note and publish this and will discuss it with them shortly.</p> <p>  Category C is individual correspondence from persons, not Government Departments.  No. 476C is correspondence dated 9 May 2017 from the UK Public Accounts Committee Network, informing us that the conference to be held in June has now been postponed until September.</p><p>We will note that.<br/><br/>Nos. 478C(i) and (ii) are correspondence received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a holding answer on a reply regarding the wards of court issue sent to it for a response.  We are still waiting for that and will note that.  <br/><br/>Nos. 479C and 486C are correspondence dated 12 May 2017 received from an individual regarding the evidence given by the former president of the University of Limerick.  As an independent review has begun, I suggest we seek permission from this individual to send this letter, along with a copy of the transcript mentioned, to Professor Richard Thorn, who is leading the investigation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  <br/><br/>Nos. 482C(i) and (ii) are correspondence dated 18 April 2017 from an individual wishing to remain anonymous regarding the inability of the HEA to carry out its functions.  I think the matters raised deserve some consideration by members when considering matters related to the third-level sector.  We will come back to complete our consideration of the third-level sector so we will note it and hold it over for exercise.<br/><br/>No. 483C is correspondence dated 9 May 2017 from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health, in reply to the committee seeking information on Novartis.  I suggest that we note this correspondence and forward a copy to the original correspondent who wrote to us.  <br/><br/>As for Nos. 484C(i) to (iii), inclusive, 485C, 490C and 491C, this is correspondence received from Deputies Alan Kelly, Catherine Murphy, David Cullinane and Mary Lou McDonald and myself, respectively, with recommendations for the committee on potential witnesses and how to structure the forthcoming examination into the Garda College in Templemore.  We will discuss this in private session before we go into public session.  <br/><br/>Nos. 488C(i) and (ii) are correspondence dated 12 May 2017 from NAMA in reply to correspondence regarding the sale of the Savarin portfolio in the Czech Republic.  We will note this response and forward a copy to the original correspondent.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  <br/><br/>No. 492C is correspondence dated 11 May from George O'Callaghan, chief executive officer, the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, ETB.  The correspondence is a reply to the committee on the late presentation of accounts of the ETB.  Can we see that on the screen?  It is saying it expects to have its 2016 accounts submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by September 2017.  The 2017 accounts will be submitted in the first quarter of 2018.  That seems reasonable.  There is background information regarding the difficulties but at this point, we just want to make sure it gets up to speed now.  It seems to be but we will check that as time rolls on.  It is a reasonable response.<br/><br/>The next item concerns Nos. 493C(i) to (iii), inclusive, correspondence dated 5 May 2017 from Patricia Quinn, managing director of Benefacts, with a copy of its annual report and a report on non-profit sector analysis.  The report is very interesting and I suggest that all members give some time to read it.  <br/><br/>No. 495C is correspondence dated 15 May 2017 from Deputy Alan Kelly.  This is an email containing a reply from the T&aacute;naiste's office on a matter raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Kelly on the finances in the Garda College and related matters.  We will discuss that shortly when we discuss the issue relating to the Templemore issue.  <br/><br/>No. 498C is correspondence dated 16 May 2017 from Deputy Alan Farrell stating that he wishes to discuss the Department of Defence's disposal of the naval vessel, the <i>LE Aisling</i>.  Deputy Farrell is not here so we will hold it over.  Obviously, we will want to get information from the Department.  In the absence of Deputy Farrell, we might agree on his behalf because we know what he is looking for, which is to write to the Department for a full briefing on the matter.  His letter is on the record.  </p></speech>

A copy of the document was requested by another Member of the Houses.  Is it agreed that we make this document available to the Member?  Agreed.  The Library and Research Service has a protocol.  If somebody asks it to do a body of work, it does so but before a third party seeks a copy, it must get the consent of the person who asked for the work to be done.  We have no problem regarding making a document on the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts widely available.  We will note and publish that ourselves.  I think it is doing some further work on it.  It is a very useful document that is helpful to us.  The last Committee of Public Accounts went to the trouble of getting a document produced so I ask members to read it in their own time.  We will give the Library and Research Service permission to release to whoever requested it.  </p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is statements and accounts received the last meeting, of which there are only a couple.  The first one is the Revenue account.  As the account of State revenues and income received, it is only a slight matter of &euro;66 billion in total revenues to the State in 2016.  The Revenue Commissioners are scheduled for a visit and we will deal with that then.  There is a clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Irish Museum of Modern Art for which there is a clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority for which there is a clear audit opinion for 2015.  The next item is the National Library of Ireland for which there is a clear audit opinion for 2015.  In respect of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the National Library of Ireland, it is 17 months after year end.  That is an excessive period in all three cases.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General know when they were presented to him?  </p></speech>

We tend to prioritise the bigger accounts so that is why the 2016 Revenue account is done.  We will be doing the audits of the smaller entities over the summer.  We try to spread the work over the year and to prioritise the bigger accounts.  It is a difficulty.</p></speech>

We are joined from Bord na gCon by Mr. Phil Meaney, chairman, Dr. Se&aacute;n Brady, interim chief executive officer, Mr. Michael Murnane, chief financial officer, Mr. Colin Walsh, director of commercial operations, Mr. Pat Creed, board member, Mr. Pat Herbert, board member, and Mr. Joe Lewins, director of IT and tote.  We are joined from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine by Mr. Brendan Gleeson, assistant secretary.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be either switched off or set in aeroplane mode.  Silent mode is not sufficient to prevent signals from interfering with the recording of proceedings.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind those in the Public Gallery that they are in the Houses by special permission and should not make any comments or distract from the proceedings in any way.  If they do so, they will be asked to leave.  None of the witnesses may be approached after the meeting, during the break or while they are in the Houses of the Oireachtas or the vicinity thereof.  I insist on full co-operation on this matter.  Following incidents two weeks ago, this matter is being taken very seriously by the Captain of the Guard and Superintendent of the House.</p><p>We will resume proceedings at the point at which we concluded the previous meeting.  Deputy Catherine Murphy was questioning the witnesses when the meeting adjourned.  When the Deputy has concluded her contribution, members will be taken in the following sequence: Deputy Shane Cassells, Deputy Catherine Connolly and Deputy Alan Kelly, after which we will have a second round of contributions commencing with Deputy Cullinane followed by Deputy Marc MacSharry.  Deputy Bobby Aylward has also indicated.  I am confining each member's contribution to ten minutes as it is intended to complete proceedings before the voting bloc commences in the Chamber.</p></speech>

There is a debt arising in Limerick greyhound stadium and another debt carried on overdraft which was related to the site.  Is the overdraft facility still in place or is the overdraft now a loan?</p></speech>

There is a &euro;12.5 million loan for the Limerick stadium, which was drawn in December 2009.  There has always been an overdraft of &euro;12.5 million that has been effectively closely drawn to the limit of each year for the past long number of years.  In 2015, AIB required those facilities to be renewed and split the overdraft into what is considered a hard core because it has never fallen below that level.

The Department of Education and Skills was the only party that walked the site in 2016.  The site was not up for sale or anything of the sort.  During that timeframe, Bord na gCon was exploring the option of getting the stadium rezoned for alternative uses.  The Department approached us and asked if its representatives could look at the site and walk through the stadium.  I think they did that on Monday.  I was there the morning on which they were there.</p></speech>

I wish to start by reflecting on some of the evidence which we heard at the last meeting and comments from Dr. Brady in respect of the importance he placed on vacant possession in the matter of the disposal of the stadium at Harold's Cross.  Obviously, that was motivating factor when it came to the manner in which he moved in the Valentine's swoop.  I wish to examine a number of areas in this respect.  On the manner in which it was conducted, given the importance that Dr. Brady has placed on vacant possession from the point of view of the banks and disposal, was there any part of the IGB's debt written off by the banks as a sweetener to ensure it would get vacant possession of the stadium at Harold's Cross?  Was Dr. Brady motivated to act in the heavy-handed manner in which he did?  He admitted here the previous day that he was wrong to do so and that he would revisit the decision if he could.  It is obviously causing a lot of agony.  It is also the central motivating point in respect of this dispute.  If there was a write-off, is that now in jeopardy because of the stand-off?  As has been confirmed in the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, no moneys have passed into the accounts of the IGB at this point.  Obviously then, no money has been passed on to the banks in respect of paying the debt.  Will Dr. Brady begin on that point please?</p></speech>

Perhaps our director, Mr. Pat Creed, will take the second part.  Certainly, I am an outsider with 30 years of management experience.  On my eighth day in the job I went to the head office of AIB and met the people from AIB.  On the way out of that meeting, they informed me that if the IGB did not sell the site, the bank would.</p><p>That informed our approach, or at least my approach, given the level of debt.  The organisation was skin and bones thanks to that straitjacket of debt.  That informed my decision on the eighth day of my working for the organisation.  Mr. Creed will deal with the second part of the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

It is important that questions be answered today.  Let me remind the witnesses of something, given the seriousness of what is involved.  People are watching these proceedings who are concerned for their sport.  Many of them listened to "Drivetime" on RTE Radio 1 on Tuesday and would have been shocked by the fact that this sport received &euro;300,000 per week in taxpayers' money.  Mothers who cannot get occupational therapists for their kids because of a lack of resources, elderly people who cannot get medical cards and people who are under financial pressure are watching a sport for dogs that have less meat on their bones than I do, yet the witnesses are talking about the payment of such sums.  These are serious issues and significant payments into the sport, so I would appreciate answers.</p> <p>  Regarding the &euro;23 million - we could not get that figure the previous day, but thank God for the Department of Education and Skills, which can give us a three-page report - secured from the sale of Harold's Cross to the Department, we have clarified that the land has been zoned as Z9 - open space.  No local area plan, LAP, was prepared in advance, but Mr. Murnane's comments were interesting, in that departmental officials walked the site in 2016 and alternative uses for it were explored.  Do the witnesses believe that a proper price was paid for this land?  We have just completed an investigation into Project Eagle and whether there had been losses on land.  I wonder whether the Comptroller and Auditor will have to audit "Project Greyhound" and whether too much has been paid for this land, given that it was zoned as open space.  The amount magically hit the debt figure incurred by the IGB and the Department of Education and Skills suddenly paid a composite amount for the purchase of the property.  Does Mr. Gleeson believe that this was the correct amount of money?  There is no guarantee that the land will be rezoned or that there will be planning permission, yet &euro;23 million has been paid for the site.</p></speech>

The process is that the Valuation Office provides a valuation for the site.  I cannot say more about the valuation than that.  The Valuation Office valued it.  That is all that I know about it.</p> <p>  There was a second aspect to the Deputy's question.  A zoning process is under way.  As I understand it, that process will involve getting sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It will also involve the provision of a contract that will be subject to zoning, in that the Department of Education and Skills will sign a contract subject to the appropriate zoning being obtained.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

At our previous meeting, Dr. Brady and Mr. Gleeson referred to circular 17/2016, the process since 23 March and the interaction between the Departments on the purchase of the site.  Would it be fair to say that the board had at the very least been hamstrung by that circular?  Despite the offer from the Department of Education and Skills, was there any examination by the board?  Mr. Murnane has indicated that alternatives were explored in 2016.  To what depth?  Given that Dublin City Council was entering into a new city plan at the time, the IGB could have approached the council and sought an LAP for the site.  That is now being done retrospectively.  The IGB could have applied for commercial zoning and, in doing so, possibly realised a greater value and more funds for the sport.  What alternative uses were explored in 2016?</p></speech>

Does Bord na gCon propose to become a niche market?  Will it lose its footprint in rural regional areas?  The track in my home town of Navan closed 20 years ago and Lidl has built on it now.  By selling off the dog tracks, I know the sport lost a footprint in a regional town and lost the local patronage.  If Bord na gCon takes a decision to go for regionalisation it will narrow its footprint.  Bord na gCon admits in its marketing strategy that stadia once seen as a key hub have become less connected to the community.  If the board continues with the strategy of narrowing the market rather than expanding is it not on a slippery downward spiral?  The GAA succeeds as an organisation because it is in every single parish in the country.</p></speech>

I believe we are getting closer to that but I cannot say when it will happen.  We have put in long hours.  The CEO stated earlier that the IGB is losing &euro;30,000, that is not counting the amount of money the dog owners are losing in that period.  It is very obvious that we need to get racing back in Dublin.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Department would agree with that, it is for the update of the Power report.</p></speech>

It is because I have so many reports before me.  The problem was that the recommendations were not implemented.  Had the Dalton report been implemented and acted upon in 2006, or any of the reports been acted on, we would not be in serious trouble.  I am specifically asking the witnesses about this but I get an answer that they have been implemented except one.  I go back to the first recommendation and I ask about it and I am told it has not yet been implemented.</p> <p>  We have 11 recommendations.  The first one is very important, but all of them are very important.  I will now turn to recommendation 11, which I thought was a misprint, where it states, "The Committee recommends that the ongoing issues concerning the breeding of greyhounds with dogs deceased for two years or more, registered in the stud book by the ICC, must be addressed immediately".  Has that been addressed?  I now know what it means because I made inquiries; the semen from a dead dog is kept for two years and its use is allowed for the two year period for the purposes of breeding in four studs throughout the country.</p></speech>

There was a new regulation introduced.  The decision to introduce the rule was made in 2005.  The board made the decision to revoke it in 2008 on the basis of practicality, but it did not.  In 2014 the rule was revoked but it could not be made retrospective.  We now have a provision in the Bill, currently with the committee, to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

It is a splintered industry and it always has been.  In December 2015 we individually brought in all the stakeholders.  During 2016 we brought together the stakeholders on two or three occasions &ndash; I am unsure of the exact number.</p> <p>  Not all stakeholders accepted our invitation, but we invited all stakeholders in.

The first meeting of the national greyhound forum was hosted on 15 March 2016.  There were representatives from a cross-section of groups.  I have before me a list of the groups, including various people from throughout the industry.  There are details of the matters discussed and there are minutes.</p> <p>  The second meeting of the national greyhound forum took place on 14 July 2016.  Again, there were representatives from a cross-section of groups.  The details can all be furnished separately rather than going through the whole list.</p> <p>  The third meeting of the national greyhound forum took place on 10 November 2016.  It was attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle and an official, Rebecca Chapman, who is responsible for the horse and greyhound racing division, and Teagasc.  An overview of proposed legislation was discussed at the forum.  Representatives attended from a broad cross-section of the industry.</p> <p>  These are structured meetings that are agenda-based.  Minutes are taken.  Different people have different views on them.  Some people choose to attend.  Some choose not to attend.  A structure is in place.  There is a commitment that the next forum will take place one month after the re-opening of Shelbourne Park.</p></speech>

Indecon did not state that Harold's Cross should be sold.  Is that not right?  It made a recommendation that Bord na gCon would look at selling a number of assets.  The word "consider" was used.  The recommendation was that Bord na gCon would consider looking at a number of assets, including land in Cork, Harold's Cross and other assets.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

The only three tracks making money were Cork, Shelbourne and Harold's Cross.  Bord na gCon has come back and said that Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park are not viable because they are so near each other.  Both were making money.  Those three tracks stood out.</p> <p>  What assessment has Bord na gCon done?  Let us consider the track in Galway?  What assessment has the board done in respect of the loss there?  What plans does Bord na gCon have?  Mr. Meaney should clarify the position in respect of the company running each race track.  Is a separate company in place for the purposes of operating it?  Do these companies have any other decision-making powers?</p></speech>

I would also like to apologise to Deputy Aylward, because he asked a question that completely threw us the last day.  I am unsure whether you were here at the time, Chairman.  He asked about 2003 and 2017.  We were thrown by that.  In fact, there was an error on the recommendation, in my opinion, anyway.  It was for 2013.</p> <p>  A strategic plan was prepared in 2013.  It was followed by the Indecon report.  Then, in 2015 a detailed plan was submitted to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in May 2015.  We are following that plan.  As a point of interest, the sale of Harold's Cross was one of the items in that strategic plan.</p></speech>

The Indecon report goes through it meticulously.  It says that the Bord na gCon targets were not met.  The report pointed out serious concerns for what Bord na gCon could expect in 2013.  For example, the first year of the strategic plan ended with a total group surplus of &euro;40,000, compared with the planned figure of &euro;238,000.  The report states that the most significant aspect of the 2013 performance was the non-achievement of the target for net turnover from the racing facilities.  It also states that the plan appears to be approximately one year behind and so on.  Why am I raising that?  It is because there were concerns over the strategic plan.  Indecon hoped that Bord na gCon would meet its targets further out or later on in the period.  Did the board meet them?  We do not know.  The Bord na gCon representatives are not even sure of the years of the strategic plan.  I am simply quoting from what the taxpayers have paid for.</p> <p>  The aim was to restore confidence.  I realise the value of the greyhound industry.  Serious issues around welfare arise that I might come back to.  Anyway, the purpose is to restore confidence and integrity.  Then, Bord na gCon goes on to sell one item, Harold's Cross.  It does not account for the empty premises in Limerick.  There is a call centre in Thurles.  What is the cost of that?  Bord na gCon is paying for a call centre in Thurles.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I am surprised the witnesses are back here because I did not expect them to be back in their positions.  Do they realise how bad the evidence they are giving looks to the people who are watching at home?  Do they realise the number of contradictions in their evidence?  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a constitutional committee, the most important in the Oireachtas and the evidence the witnesses are giving here is the worst I have ever seen.  Do they realise what I am saying to them?  It is the worst I have ever seen and it is getting worse today, in reply to the questions asked by my predecessors.  I would like the witnesses to reflect on that.  I mean this: does each of the witnesses stand over the evidence given to date?  If somebody does not, please say so now.</p></speech>

Perhaps everybody did not pick it up, but the Chairman picked it up very clearly.

I was not even referring to the contradictions in respect of the reports and dates.  Does each of the witnesses stand over the evidence they have given to date?  I will presume if I do not hear anything else, the answer is "Yes".  Do the witnesses have confidence in each another and in the board?  If I do not hear anything else, I will take it that, yes, the witnesses all have confidence in each another and in the evidence given to date.</p> <p>  I see what has happened in recent weeks in respect of the sale of Harold's Cross, given the board that is in place, as a cross-subsidy.  I do not have confidence in the board and I feel that this is double jeopardy in respect of this action.  Deputy Cassells' questioning of Mr. Creed about the bank situation leaves me totally bewildered.  There is certainly something that needs to be added.  The witnesses need to reflect on that.  Will Mr. Murnane provide evidence of what he said on the previous occasion about the sale of the Meelick site?  I would like to check it.</p></speech>

I was there.  There were over 700 people - virtually the entire industry - in Horse and Jockey.  Mr. Meaney is right about one thing.  There are different sections in this industry, there is fragmentation, there are different groups and they do not always agree with one another but they agreed that day.  The 700 people there could not fit into the room, some had to stay in the lobby and the car park but they agreed that they did not have confidence in the witnesses.  The fact that Mr. Meaney thinks there is only a certain view shows he is not living in the real world if he cannot see what is in front of him in the context of what the industry is saying.  It is united on that.</p> <p>  On 5 April, Mr. Meaney stated "IGB is under pressure to manage a legacy debt now reduced to &euro;20.3 million, which preceded the current chairman, board and executive of IGB."  Is that true?</p></speech>

So there was nobody on the board during this period which, as already stated, "preceded the current chairman, board and executive of IGB".  Would Mr. Meaney now like to reflect on what he said?  Is there a serving member of the board who was on the board during the period in question?</p></speech>

The figure I gave was based on the average attendance per meeting.  There was a 5% reduction in the number of meetings that year as part of the Indecon recalibration.  The figures at the bottom of page 19 show a reduction in the number of races held in 2015 relative to the number held in 2014.

However, if one were to look at what was said at a meeting of this committee attended by Mr. Meaney and the former CEO, Mr. Neilan, several years ago which I had the pleasure of watching recently, you spoke about 30 contracts being signed in regard to expanding the capacity of the organisation to grow markets in Austria, Spain, and several other places.

That is a significant contract.  In terms of the commingling international wagering deal which is being referred to, there have been approximately ten to 12 of those contracts signed since Mr. Neilan gave evidence to this committee in 2013.</p><p>The more correct figure would be in the region of 15 or 16 and not just four contracts.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh continued:</p><blockquote>Therefore, when one compares on-track Tote performance, there is a very similar level of decline.  HRI has managed to offset the on-track decline with an exceptional performance in international markets, which would include the US, South Africa, Canada, France, Germany and Italy.  Of those markets, IGB is only allowed to operate in the US.  It is precluded legally from trading in terms of Tote.</blockquote> <p>I have a few questions.  The organisation has signed 16 contracts.  Where are they?  What are the jurisdictions involved?  Why has the measure not had a huge increase in the board's revenue?</p><p>The connotation of what Mr. Walsh said is that the HRI has offset the decline with an exceptional performance in international markets.  I looked up the HRI.  The HRI's total tote betting in 2015 was &euro;79.3 million with international pools making up &euro;5.4 million.  Of the totality, the sum generated by international pools is not a huge amount.</p></speech>

In a previous life I was a business manger in Bord F&aacute;ilte or F&aacute;ilte Ireland so I know a little bit about marketing and online space.  To say the strategy is poor would be an understatement.</p><p>Before I conclude my round of questioning, I would like to ask Mr. Meaney a specific question.  Obviously Mr. Meaney has had some engagement, significant or otherwise, with the industry given the situation we find ourselves in over the past number of weeks or months.  He has had to deal with the industry.  Let us call a spade a spade.  He has probably had difficult conversations and different people in touch with him or <i>vice versa. </i>I presume the situation has not been easy because we are dealing with a very difficult situation.  If any of what I have said is unfair or inaccurate then please say so.</p><p>I have permission to state the following name.  Does Mr. Meaney know a Miss Clare Hanley?</p></speech>

Those who have indicated have asked their first rounds of questions between our previous meeting and this meeting.  Some members have indicated to make a second contribution.  We will start with Deputies Cullinane, MacSharry, Aylward and Burke.  However, before we proceed to the second round, I have three brief questions to put to the witnesses.  I was not at the previous meeting, so if some of this was covered then, I apologise for going back over it.  These are points that came to my attention as the meeting went along.</p> <p>  Deputy Connolly mentioned the consultative forum.  When is it next due to meet?</p></speech>

It has been a difficult time, as we said at the previous meeting here.  We often have two board meetings in a week.  It has been a very difficult time.

I have just been listening to the two of them this morning.  I did not have any prior knowledge of this.</p> <p>  Perhaps I will ask Mr. Creed the second question.  It is about the bank.  The witnesses have confirmed that the bank has not offered any write-down on the debt but did IGB raise, or will it raise, the question of a write-down?  IGB owes a bank a lot of money.  This debt goes back and has been building up over a decade.  If IGB is coming in with an ability perhaps to clear the decks, I would expect the board to expect some element of write-down.  While one has not been offered, does IGB expect it will look for one?</p></speech>

This is where I was trying to be helpful to Deputy Cassells earlier in his questioning.  The bank has not offered a write-down, but the second half of the question was whether the IGB has sought one.  Mr. Creed said IGB has sought a write-down, which I understand, but that discussions are still ongoing.  In other words, IGB has sought a write-down but it has not been offered.  It is still in the melting pot.</p></speech>

Four weeks ago, we had a bank debt of &euro;20-odd million and had no idea what the realisable value of the sale of the asset was.  We now have a sale of an asset, pending process, of &euro;23 million.  I am sure the bank will take a different view on it now on the basis of sales proceeds, but discussions are ongoing at this point in time.</p></speech>

It was said 30,000 a year are being lost in Dublin.  Obviously, there is racing going on.  How many venues are still having racing?  There are people in this room and people watching with an intimate knowledge of the industry; there are other people who do not have that level of knowledge.

Mr. Meaney said that when one decides, one divides.  Obviously, some people are most unhappy with the situation.  I have no idea of the numbers.  I am just being logical in my question.  Obviously, if there are people going to the other 15 venues for meetings, they are still continuing to go to their meets.  What I want to establish is the attendance at the meetings in 2017 to date in those areas and how the figures from those 15 tracks compare with the same period last year.  The witnesses should be able to do up rough figures-----</p></speech>

First, I want to be very fair to all of them who have come back on a second occasion.  My questions are solely in the context of process and decision-making.  I appreciate that many of the mistakes, as I would see them, that were made in the past were made by a previous board.</p> <p>  Second, it would be helpful if the witnesses answered as frankly as they can the questions that are put.  If they do not know the answer to a question, they should just say as much because it rules out unnecessary conflict.  If I ask a simple question about valuations or whatever it may be, if they have the answer at their fingertips, that is great; if they do not, they can forward the information.  It is just a more efficient way of doing our business.</p> <p>  I must put it to them first, though, that there is a reading of the facts as they were presented at the last hearing and a narrative, which may or may not be true or fair, that the sale of the Harold's Cross stadium is essentially a Government bailout of a failed Government-appointed quango.  That is one of the narratives or readings out there, and they must accept that.  Obviously, they might have a different view.  What they need to do is work with me to counter that narrative and answer the questions I put to them.</p><p>What is the current level of debt within the organisation?

In that context the situation would be that we would not be able to meet the level of debt that was outstanding at the time.</p></speech>

He was the one who said that.  We all live in the real world.  If an organisation has a debt of over &euro;20 million that is a real issue the bank has to deal with.  If it wipes out its debt, it is an issue the bank does not have to deal with.  Whatever negotiating hand Mr. Creed believes he has, once a decision is made to sell Harold's Cross, everybody can see that the Irish Greyhound Board's negotiating hand in terms of getting a bank write-down is significantly weakened.  Saying that is not to weaken its hand, it is just a fact.  It is a reality and Mr. Creed has already accepted that.  I will move on from that.</p> <p>  It is remarkable that the valuation again hits the bull's-eye here.  It essentially completely wipes out the debt.  The valuation of the land is almost identical to what would be required to wipe out the debt.  Can Mr. Gleeson see why that would at least solicit questions from us on the Committee of Public Accounts?</p></speech>

People may think they are the same process: rezoning is a function of a development plan process, material contravention of a development plan is a different issue.  What can happen is that if the zoning on the site is not appropriate to the planning application being considered, the application can go in as a planning application and the local authority, with the consent of the planners and the elected members can agree to grant a material contravention for that site for that specific purpose.  It is a separate process from opening up the rezoning in a development plan.  A material contravention is normally how these things tend to happen.</p></speech>

If my reading of the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills is correct - Mr. Gleeson seems to be of the same opinion - the deal is subject to rezoning.  I want to be certain about what "subject to rezoning" means.  I acknowledge that Mr. Gleeson cannot answer for the Department of Education and Skills but he can give me the perspective of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Is it the case that an application will have to be made by the Department to the local authority seeking the rezoning of the site?  The local authority will have to follow a process before making a decision.  If the decision is favourable the sale will go ahead, but if it is not rezoned the sale will not go ahead.  Is that Mr. Gleeson's understanding?</p></speech>

The Meelick site cost &euro;1 million but another &euro;900,000 was spent on the Meelick site so the liability was actually &euro;1.9 million and a further &euro;200,000 was used to use the site maps for the current Limerick stadium, so the net loss arising from Meelick at this point in time is &euro;1.7 million less the realisable value of the asset.</p></speech>

With the appropriate zoning to allow for institutional use, the market value is probably &euro;1.5 million an acre, which is very substantially less than &euro;23 million.  Dr. Brady mentioned the Rehab site.  That is ironic because, similarly, while those values would apply, and I believe that site was in Sandyford, which would not be as good an area in terms of property values, the Department of Education and Skills paid more than &euro;5 million per acre for institutional zoning for a site on which there was a listed building.  To my mind, that is a multiple of the value per acre.  There is a major value for money issue here and there is also the coincidence of Bord na gCon's entire debt having to match broadly the profile of the proposed purchase price.</p> <p>  In terms of the split of the &euro;13 million and the &euro;10 million to be worked out subject to contract, as Mr. Murnane said, is there a structure to the deal in that if Bord na gCon does not get zoning, it will get &euro;13 million and not the additional &euro;10 million?</p></speech>

When we consider that we are not long finished with Project Eagle, this would seem to indicate that between Rehab and this particular purchase, we are overpaying.  That is something that needs to be noted.  I imagine the board would be very happy with &euro;23 million, and I would suspect that the Savills valuation, which is naturally commercially sensitive at this time, is substantially less than that.  That is why it will be interesting to see it after Bord na gCon closes its sale.</p> <p>  In terms of a write-down from the bank, does Dr. Brady not believe that at this stage Bord na gCon has a snowball's chance in hell of getting a write-down on the basis that it is in the public domain and it is getting &euro;23 million?</p></speech>

In terms of natural fairness and justice, why should Bord na gCon get a write-down?  Home owners throughout the country have been pinned to the wall for every ha'penny, and they have been pursued after the fact.

However, that is an aside.</p> <p>  I want to put on record my view of the valuation, which is &euro;750,000 per acre on its current zoning and about &euro;1.5 million per acre if it gets zoned for institutional use.

In terms of the narrative around the call centre, there have been calls recently for the sales centre to be closed and for the nine jobs in Tipperary to go.  The call centre is an integral part of our commercial infrastructure.  While our online transactions, bookings and so on are growing strongly, the nature of our business is that we take the payments up-front.  Most of our bookings are group bookings of different sizes.  We have bookings with many tour operators as well, so we have to have a team of people at the end of the phone dealing with the people making the bookings.  Someone might ring to book a group of five or ten people.  They have to get the money from all the people, work out the package they want and the part of the restaurant they want.</p> <p>  The other element of the business that has changed somewhat in recent years is that we try to manage yield and revenue.  We manage a mix of sales packages in order that we are maximising the yield and the revenues from the sales mix daily and weekly.</p></speech>

As set out in one of the commentaries I read, if the sales centre moved to Dublin, we would be looking at increased labour costs, increased rental costs and redundancy costs for the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.</p></speech>

It spelled out what was wrong in the industry four years ago.  According to it, people had been witness to the virtual collapse of the Irish greyhound industry in the preceding few years, with a decreasing tote, attendance level and dog pool evident.  It asserts that the people administering the industry tried to dismiss the figures and that promises of a bright future appeared to lack credibility.  Trainers up and down the country were feeling a financial pinch, it reads, with individual trainers frustrated at the IGB's apparent lack of direction.  The reduction in spending on track maintenance was clear for all to see, as were the escalating levels of serious injuries at tracks coupled with malfunctioning equipment.  According to the invitation, there appeared to be no transparency or accountability in the IGB as it limped from one crisis to the next.  The main issue was the repayment of &euro;25 million in 2016, which was growing closer on the horizon.  This invitation shows that breeders and trainers saw these problems in the industry in 2013.</p> <p>  The trainers association held a meeting that night in September.  Approximately 80 people attended.  However, another meeting was held where 30 professional trainers were brought into a room on their own and the rest were locked out.  It was stated at that meeting that the board had offered professional trainers a bonus of &euro;10 for every dog they raced.  This meeting appointed a chairman on the night, but no meeting has been held since.</p> <p>  When I asked Dr. Brady at our previous meeting about how important it was to meet stakeholders, he stated that a forum had been set up.  However, that forum has not met for six months.  This forms part of the problem with the industry.  The board is not playing ball with stakeholders and those who matter, namely, the breeders and owners of dogs.  It is not bringing stakeholders and people who have concerns along with it.  The board seems to be aloof and not playing ball.  Will Dr. Brady comment on what I have said?</p></speech>

The organisation is down to its skin and bones as a result of the debt burden.  It is caught between a rock and a hard place with the threat of insolvency.  The IGB should look forward, not back.  It is a time for unity, growth and investment in the industry.  When the deal is concluded, it will create a new vista for the organisation.</p></speech>

It is leaving them behind and not negotiating with them.  It seems to be aloof in its decisions.  The IGB cannot run a good business unless it brings those on whom it depends along with it.  The IGB has lost the confidence of breeders and racers in the greyhound industry.  That is my personal opinion based on what I have heard in the weeks since we last had the IGB appear before us.</p></speech>

They were difficult times.  I accept that, given the decisions that were made, some people have become disenfranchised.  When you decide, you divide, but we had to get the industry back on a good, solid footing.  I echo Dr. Brady's remarks.  We are effectively court case free and have sorted most of our problems.  Our debt at the end of 2015 and start of 2016 was &euro;20.3 million.  We are now debt free.  Those decisions had to be made.</p></speech>

We can keep looking back, but the problems were not imaginary.  Some people in the greyhound business believed that we could magic away the problems.  We could not.  They were real problems that had to be faced.  The board had the opportunity to kick the problems down the road, but it chose - the last few board members who joined in 2015 in particular - to face up to those problems in the belief that doing so would make for a better industry.  Deputy Aylward knows that he and I are from the same constituency.  I am committed to the greyhound industry.  I knew that the problems existed when I joined.  I did not join for an easy ride.  God knows what I get out of this, but I joined with the belief that we could solve the problems.  I accept Deputy Cullinane's point but, on the assumption that the deal goes through, the business will be in a terrific place.  If we all stopped talking about what happened in 2005, 2013, 2011 and 2009 and got behind the industry, it could be a great one.</p></speech>

They were difficult times for everyone - owners, trainers and breeders.  When we had small amounts of money available, we gave certain concessions on occasion to try to keep everything on the road and the industry going.  It was from that that we decided to set up a forum so that people might have an input into where the money at our disposal should go, be it to owners, breeders or trainers.  I am anxious to get all stakeholders going in the same direction, but that will be very difficult to do.</p></speech>

It was virtually impossible, but we got it up and running.  We held three meetings last year.  As someone mentioned, we held a get together at the end of 2015.  A meeting was set for 23 February, plus or minus some days, but the next thing there was a protest in Dublin, so we did not go ahead with the meeting.  That was not to make life easier for us.  It was just the wrong time to have a meeting.  People were uneasy.</p></speech>

Every time a pup won a race, &euro;15 went back to the breeder.  There were several small initiatives that we put in over the years.  I am certain of the &euro;15 prize and it is still in place.  There was &euro;10 for the trainer.</p></speech>

The breeder of the winner gets &euro;15 paid by IGB into his account.</p> <p>  Again, it is not elitist.  A trainer has to train 100 dogs.  Once he trains 100 runners, as opposed to winners, then whether the person is an owner, trainer, private trainer or public trainer, that person gets the award.  I do not in any way agree with the Deputy that there was anything untoward about it.  It was a small attempt by the board in difficult times when we were murdered with debt-----</p></speech>

We had the defined benefit pension scheme.  We had massive bank debts that needed to be sorted.  We had some issues around needing a laboratory machine.</p> <p>  In early 2016, we went to Limerick and met every constituent of the greyhound industry for the entire day.  The trainers and owners and so on came in.  We met them all for the whole day.  It was one full day.  I am keen to refute the fact that we are not talking to people.  We had three consultative forums during 2016.  The last was attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle.  We have met the industry on a consultative basis right through 2016.</p></speech>

That came out of the consultative forum.  We agreed to have a sales event in Shelbourne Park.  It was a major success.  Many dogs were sold for big money.  It was a great boost for the industry.  I hope the problem is gone now, but some people seem to be saying "if".  The problem is that with the debt gone, we can now look at rewarding the people who are keeping this industry going, including the owners, breeders and trainers.  We will have substantial funds to do that in the current year.</p></speech>

I could not let it go without saying something about Harold's Cross.  It is closed and locked up at the moment.  A dispute has arisen.  Bord na gCon is losing &euro;30,000 per week according to the documents I have before me.  That is a great deal of money.  Has any progress been made on that?  In hindsight, would it have been better to do it differently?  The sale to the Department of Education and Skills of Harold's Cross might not go through for five or six months.  Would Bord na gCon not have been better off to have left open the gates of Harold's Cross?  It was one of the top three earners in the country.  Would it not have been better to keep in going and keep people happy and then have the sale and close it, rather than the way the board did it, which was by stealth?</p></speech>

AIB told us that if we did not sell the site, then the bank would sell it.  That informed the decision.  The sale of Harold's Cross also formed part of the strategic plan for 2017.  The sale of Harold's Cross and getting it ready for sale was absolutely fundamental to the future of the industry.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;50 million was put in by 2015 and that went down to &euro;20 million in the Tote.  The figure for Horse Racing Ireland went from &euro;50 million up to &euro;80 million in the same time with the recession and everything included.  Can the deputation explain why?  The Tote is a major money spinner for the Irish Greyhound Board.  Why did the figure go from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million?  What were the reasons?  The figure for Horse Racing Ireland went from &euro;50 million to &euro;80 million.  Why is that?  Can the deputation explain why the Tote went so badly for the Irish Greyhound Board?

What way is the money divided?  It seems 80% of the fund goes to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% goes to the Irish Greyhound Board.  Can Mr. Gleeson explain why it is 80:20 and why it is not more evenly divided, perhaps 40:60 or 50:50?  Why is it 20:80?

Aidan O'Driscoll stated at a meeting of this committee in February that the IGB raised quite a bit of income.  My understanding is that recent years have been more successful in raising funds through the operation of the food and beverage offering at race tracks.  Has the Secretary General and the Department looked at IGB's accounts for recent years?  This is coming back to what we asked about with regard to oversight and making sure everything is above board.  At one stage, a representative of the Department was on the board.  Why was this discontinued?  Why is the Department not a member of this board about which there is all the controversy?

We are speaking about &euro;14 million being given in the coming year to the IGB.  Would it not be right and proper to have someone from the Department on the board to ensure the board is spending the money properly and can report directly back to the Department?  Mr. Gleeson said he meets the IGB only once a year.  Only for the Comptroller and Auditor General no one would know what was going on.  Only for the fact he presents it here to us we would never know what was going on with regard to oversight and proper management.  It would be a good idea to put someone from the Department on the board.  That is why I am asking the question.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses because I know it is a very long day.  In respect of the Indecon report and the projected savings over 20 years, the first item that was suggested concerned the renting of the existing sales centre in Thurles.  I think it cost &euro;25,000 per annum.  What is the reasoning behind that?  Why are we renting an office independently of HQ to sell tickets?</p></speech>

A lease broadband line costs &euro;12,000 bringing it up to &euro;25,000.  Relocating from Thurles would involve a fairly significant outlay in redundancy as staff may not wish to travel and would be entitled to redundancy so it would not be affordable and it would be questionable as to whether value for money would be achieved if that decision were taken.</p></speech>

Advances in technology meant that we could centralise that in one location.  There were a number of independent agents before 2007.  The catering was outsourced at that stage so it was their personnel who were taking the bookings of Irish Greyhound Board so it was a case of centralising bookings in the sales centre in Thurles.</p></speech>

As Mr. Creed said, there are a lot of board meetings.  I worked in Greencore which had four times the turnover of the IGB.  At that time, it had six board meetings per annum so we tend to have a lot of board meetings.  They are also longer than I would expect.</p></speech>

I know the witnesses have been here for a long time, but if it is any solace to them, another thing was happening relating to a certain leadership race.   I am not sure how many eyes are on us today, so the witnesses might be lucky in that sense.  I jest.</p><p>In 2007, prize money stood at &euro;12.23 million.  In 2015, it had declined to &euro;6.67 million, which is a substantial change.  In total, in terms of prize money, &euro;30 million was taken out of the industry between 2007 and 2015.  Prize money is what makes the industry tick so I genuinely welcome Dr. Brady's comment that it will be increased.  I hope all of us have one thing in common, namely, a wish to see the industry survive and thrive.</p><p> A proposal was made to renominate Mr. Neilan who had delivered &euro;21.08 million in operating surpluses between 2007 and 2011.  We keep seeing the surpluses but really it is just the fund going in one door and partially coming out the other.  Ultimately, taxpayers' money is going in one side and coming out the other.  In the meantime, a large number of salaries have to be paid and prize money is declining sharply.  Prize money is the reason the industry will thrive but it is going south.  There is an operating profit, however.  As Dr. Brady stated, the operating profit is there because Bord na gCon has to repay its debts and so forth.  My impression is of an industry in crisis.  We heard in evidence that prize money increased before being reduced again.  However, the fact that it is tumbling shows the extent of the crisis. </p><p> I will ask some quick-fire questions.  From a commercial point of view, was it not crazy to close Harold's Cross stadium on the date chosen?  Was it not madness to close the gate on the night in question when St. Valentine's night was approaching, bookings had been made and a large meeting was planned?</p></speech>

On 4 May, Mr. Gleeson stated: "The reality is that between 2014 and now, there has been a roadmap outlined for the development of the sector and its preservation, to be frank, and that has been the Indecon report."  The Indecon report is titled, Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon.  The reason the words "certain matters" are used is that it is not complete.

All of those issues were covered in the Indecon report.  The proposition of Indecon, and it seems to me it has been borne out by experience, is that even with this new business development platform, they were not going to generate sufficient margins to close off the debt.  Indecon recommended that these avenues be pursued but it also said in addition to that-----</p></speech>

Indecon identified the elephant in the room, if one likes.  It did not ignore the other business generating possibilities but there certainly has been a focus on the implementation of the Indecon report.

In so far as the issue of the semen from dead dogs was concerned, it was the non-application of regulations since 2005.  It was quite an intractable situation so what we said was, "Look, this rule has to be either changed or implemented."  At the time, the decision was to change the regulations.  That could not be done retrospectively.  We did take a number of steps on foot of what Mr. Moore said.</p></speech>

What I will do, through the Chair, through the committee, is forward them on instead of taking up any more time because they are detailed questions.</p><p>This is my last question, the witnesses will be pleased to know.  I was very taken by Mr. Meaney said earlier on his passion for the greyhound industry, which I accept.  I accept everyone's <i>bona fides </i>on their passion for the greyhound industry, including everyone in the Gallery, the witnesses - everyone.  As I said at the beginning of this process a few weeks ago, I have no agenda here except what is best.  He said he is totally committed to the industry, and in fairness, he did issue an invitation - he said he wants the industry to get back, for everyone to engage, co-operate and to see Shelbourne Park open in the future.  We talked before about issues which I saw in the Horse and Jockey which was incredible.  There is obviously no confidence and I have expressed my own view in relation to that.  We know that Dr. Brady is an interim CEO and that issue will be dealt with in the future - I presume he does not want to stay in this job forever - so that will change.  We acknowledge his love for the industry, but if it came to it that as part of this process the result was that Shelbourne Park did not open again, if that meant the industry getting back going in the right direction, does he feel if he moved aside and facilitated that, it would be the right thing to do?  I am not trying to make this personal, because none of this is personal, but if that would facilitate the industry re-engaging, Shelbourne Park opening and everything, would he be willing to do that?  </p></speech>

That was in 2015 and related to anti-doping and medication.</p> <p>  The Indecon report was related to governance, finance, regulation, animal welfare, the reduction in the number of dogs being bred, etc.  I am particularly interested in animal welfare, but I have not even got to that issue.  As I have told most organisations, the representatives of which have appeared before us, taxpayers' money is being spent, including on the reports produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  It would be easier to appear before us and point to the recommendations made and what bodies had done.  It seems that has not happened in this instance.  When I asked the witnesses about the recommendations of the agriculture committee, no clear answer was given as to what had been implemented.  It would be easy to tell us what had been improved in terms of governance.  It could be a list of what the IGB has done, for example, employing a governance officer, a risk assessment officer and so on, indicating what the risks are, etc, but none of that has been made clear today.</p> <p>  My next question is to Mr. Meaney.  I am sorry, but this happened on his watch.  At the previous meeting he referred to what he called a legacy case from 2010.  It was related to a dog that had run under the influence of an illegal substance.  Is that right?</p></speech>

Five thousand samples have been tested in the laboratory and new legislation has been introduced to control the outcome in order that, if there are adverse findings, the matter will be addressed.</p></speech>

The IGB has established an international scientific committee and SIS contracts were signed in December 2015.  Tote revenue increased by 5% and attendances by 4.1% per meeting.  Gate and food and beverages income increased by 11%.  There have been some achievements in the organisation.  I will pass the other question to the chairman.</p></speech>

As a result of the bad decisions, plus the downturn in the economy, the other properties are charged.  AIB then moves in and says it is selling the golden egg, which is the Harold's Cross stadium.

As I mentioned to Deputy Kelly, there has been a reduction in the contingent liability regarding pensions, and the extra prize money has come out as an expense, but there has been an increased allocation from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  In respect of the tracks, since I joined the board there has been a continuous downward decline.  As the committee will be aware, revenue was a bit behind last year, which was in turn a bit behind the previous year.  There has been very much a stabilisation of the trade, even at some of the more rural parks.  Deputy Connolly mentioned Galway.  Galway had it fairly okay this year compared to previous years, and we were seeing some significant growth in the Dublin market, duly supported by Shelbourne Park.</p></speech>

Those projections, obviously, form part of the discussions with the bank.  From that point of view, they are projections, not the narrative of a strategic plan.

This was not something that was pulled out of the sky.  The establishment of a stakeholders forum was a strong recommendation.  It was recommended that all relevant stakeholders be on it, including the Department.

It has been a long day.  I cannot remember.  The forum was established on a formal basis.  There have been three meetings.  The first was on 15 March 2016.  A range of representative groups, a cross-section representing the industry, attended.  There was an agenda agreed in advance and there were minutes and notes taken at the meetings.  The second meeting took place on 14 July 2016, at which again a cross-section of representative groups of the industry attended and there was an agenda.  The meeting was carried out in a formal, structured way.  The third meeting took place on 10 November 2016.  It was attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and other representatives from the Department.  Again, representative groups and other different groups attended.  It was a structured, minuted, agenda-led forum.  That formal forum exists.</p></speech>

There is a number floating around of &euro;31 million that was lost.  That presumes the economy, which was booming in 2007, would have continued to boom all the way through to 2017.  I will use an analogy from a business I am very familiar with, which is the Irish motor industry.  It is often used as a barometer of economic growth and macroeconomic growth.  The Irish motor industry was selling nearly 200,000 new cars in 2005 and 2006.  It sold 57,500 new cars in 2008.  It crawled its way back to 140,000 new cars in 2016.  Mentioning the &euro;31 million figure is like saying if the motor industry continued to sell 200,000 cars in 2008, 2009 and 2011, the available revenue would be a particular amount.  That never happened because we had a massive recession so the number does not stack up.  We have a debt problem that needs to be cleared.  We cannot generate enough revenue or EBITA to meet that debt.  We have a bank that wants to get paid back because the debt is seriously in default.  There is only one option to substantially increase prize money and put the industry back on a solid footing and that is to discharge the outstanding debt.  It is the only option, namely, to do it and do it now.</p></speech>

What can be done to get over this hump and the strife that is going on?

We have gone around it enough.</p> <p>  There have been a number of requests for documents and questions.  I would appreciate if the board would supply them through the secretariat.  Instead of taking up time in the meeting, some detailed information on the pension, racing test and other things will be supplied.  Does the committee agree to dispose of the 2015 financial statements of Bord na gCon?  Agreed.  </p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome you here today and look forward to hearing about your work with the OCHA in co-ordinating a global humanitarian response, humanitarian financing, policy development and humanitarian advocacy.  This committee recently heard presentations from members of D&oacute;chas and M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res on their work in these areas in Africa and Yemen, particularly regarding famine, and they presented to us first-hand accounts of the unimaginable suffering that people are going through on a daily basis.  Indeed, it seems that every week we hear of desperate and indescribable cases where urgent humanitarian assistance is required, not only in Africa, but also of course in the Middle East, in the Mediterranean, and up to the shores of Europe.  We also have under-reported and forgotten crises in other areas.</p><p>We are very glad, Mr. Ging, that you were able to join us and I apologise for the meeting being delayed due to votes in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  We  hope to be also joined by other committee members.  Some other committees with which we have an overlap of membership are currently meeting as well.  The format of this meeting is that we will hear your opening statement, before going into a question and answer session with members of the committee.  </p><p>Before we begin may I remind members, witnesses and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of this meeting, as even on silent mode they cause interference with the recording and broadcast equipment in the committee room.  I also remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or makes charges against a person or body outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Mr. Ging, I call on you to make your opening remarks.</p></speech>

I also express my appreciation to Ireland for its steadfast support, both politically and financially.</p><p>I also express my appreciation to Ireland for its steadfast support, both politically and financially, in helping the most needy people across the globe, and I will be pleased to provide evidence in that regard.</p><p> We opened 2017 with what was regarded as the greatest case load in humanitarian need since the Second World War.  Unfortunately, that case load has continued to increase through the first half of this year.  Sadly, 80% of the case load can be found in conflict-affected states.  This is the result of man-made crisis, which means it could be prevented.  It was preventable and it most definitely can also be ended.  There is a very important message around the urgency to bring the drivers of this deplorable humanitarian situation in so many of these countries that are affected to an end through better political processes where we can resolve and end conflict.</p><p> To give the members a sense of the scale of the global challenge we face, we opened the year with 128.6 million people from 33 countries requiring international humanitarian assistance.  Some 65 million of those have been forcibly displaced by conflict.  The humanitarian community opened the year seeking and appealing for US$22.2 billion to respond to the needs of 92 million of those 128 million who are targeted as the most vulnerable and the most dependent on assistance.  Since the start of the year, the numbers have continued to increase.  We now have a global appeal which amounts to US$23 billion to reach 99.3 million people in 37 affected countries.  So far this year 26% of that global appeal has been funded.</p><p> I will briefly outline some of the key crises and give the members a sense of what the people are suffering and the scale of their plight in those countries.  I will group, in the first instance, four counties, which are in peril of famine and one of which has already been affected by famine.  They are South Sudan, Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen.  In the case of those countries, 20 million people are on the brink of famine and in the case of South Sudan 1 million people have already been affected by famine.  In all of these cases, these countries are affected by conflict.  Famine is the result of people not being able to access their livelihoods, particularly agriculture.  It is an entirely preventable and recoverable situation.  It is not driven by drought and while it is exacerbated by harsh climatic conditions, particularly in Somalia, at the root of the issue is the fact that these countries are affected by conflict.  </p><p> The largest number of people affected in these countries is in Yemen.  Among the global landscape of countries affected by humanitarian crises, Yemen does not get adequate attention.  It does not have the level of realisation and understanding that is required because it is the largest single case load in humanitarian need, coming from a very poor base in terms of its humanitarian status, even prior to the conflict that is now impeding the conduct of normal life in Yemen.  People in Yemen are suffering not only from food insecurity but from a lack of medical care.  There is an outbreak of cholera there and it is one of the fastest deteriorating situations that we face.  </p><p> South Sudan is also a very large and fast-moving crisis because conflict there is intensifying and much of the state infrastructure is collapsing whether it be law and order, the economy or people being able to engage in their livelihoods and so forth.  South Sudan is the one country where famine has been declared.  Equally, it is the country where the special representative of the Secretary General has highlighted the ominous threat of a genocide such is the intensity of the conflict being conducted and the gravity and barbarity of the violence being visited on the civilian population.  It is a truly appalling situation.</p><p> Regarding the other large-scale crises, the members will be familiar with Syria, which has been in crisis since 2011.  It continues to deteriorate year on year.  It is the seventh year of the conflict.  A total of 13.5 million people have been in humanitarian need in that country, including 6.3 million people displaced internally and 5 million refugees in the neighbouring countries and beyond.  There are some of the worst practices of conflict anywhere in the world inflicted on the civilian population in Syria, including mediaeval sieges affecting more than 625,000 people.  That means they are cut off from all assistance and access to assistance.  The members can imagine how dreadful their subsistence is in such circumstances.  It is about the killing of civilians, the suffering arising from the lack of access to medical care, basic social services and the deterioration in the livelihoods.  </p><p> The members will also be aware of the crises in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Central African Republic, across the Sahel in Mali and South Sudan.  These crises have been driven at their core by conflict.  They have been protracted, which means that they have been going on for many years.  In every single case we see a measurable large deterioration, with an increased number displaced and an increased number who are subjected to unnecessary human suffering.</p><p> I have just returned from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea, which is in the headlines for another issue.  While we hear much in the global news media about the missile and nuclear issue, we do not hear anything about the humanitarian situation and the human suffering.  I want to bring to the members' attention that 30% of the children in North Korea are stunted.  That means that the population is chronically under-nourished.  We are proud of the work the United Nations is doing in North Korea, helping people at a very subsistence level to survive in what is another of these very difficult circumstances.  When one goes to that country one sees the human toil there.  It is a country that is cut off form the rest of the world.  It does not have much mechanisation, agricultural machinery and so forth, which means that human beings are hand-planting the corn in the fields.</p><p>They leave the cities at the planting season to hand-plant the corn.  It gives a sense of the scale of the challenge that they all face in that country.</p><p> I want to take this opportunity to thank Ireland for its support.  Ireland has been at the forefront in leadership on the sustainable development goals.  This is an agenda that has been adopted by all member states, to end need and leave nobody behind by 2030.  Ireland's ambassador in New York is co-chairing, with the Kenyan ambassador, the development of those goals and also shepherding through very strong global commitment for action.  We commend Irish leadership on that issue.</p><p> Turning to action, we have many actions that are urgently required in the humanitarian field.  I have given numbers of those affected and for funding.  I thank Ireland for its generosity to date.  Ireland is, for us in the humanitarian field, one of the most generous donors proportional to economic wealth.  It has been in the top ten of the donors to the central emergency response fund, which is a very important mechanism that enables us to respond rapidly to escalating crises, and also to respond to the crises that are chronically underfunded.  It gives us this resource and we hugely appreciate Ireland's support to that fund, but also to the very many crises across the world.  I know that the committee has a paper on that, so I am not going to read out every single case.  I want to highlight that.</p><p> We have a G20 of financially rich countries, and then we have a different list of the financially generous countries.  Here in Dublin today, I am very proud to be an Irishman as well as a UN official, since Ireland is on the list of the top 20 generous countries, even if it is not on the list of the top 20 financially rich countries.  I would urge Ireland to continue on this track.  Please also recall that if the sustainable development goals are to be achieved, we have to get to 0.7% of gross national income, GNI, in overseas development aid, ODA.  There are only five countries in the world that reach that - Ireland's next-door neighbour, the UK, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.  I would encourage Ireland to join them and set a global standard for this.  It is in every country's self-interest to contribute to an end of global need.  It will contribute to a better world for everybody, everywhere.  It is all there in the documentation that has been adopted.  With that said I will conclude my opening remarks with a high level of appreciation for this opportunity to engage with the committee.  It would be most productive to give the committee the chance to raise the issues and questions of most interest to it.</p></speech>

During this committee and over the course of the previous D&aacute;il, we had a very good exchange with Mr. Donoghue here in advance of the September meeting, when development goals were being finalised.  Mr. Ging's contribution is comprehensive, graphic and sobering in regard to the many crises in so many regions throughout the world.  I think the fact that Mr. Ging mentioned that, at the start of this year, there was the greatest caseload of humanitarian need since the Second World War, and that in the meantime, that caseload is increasing, it is not even remaining static or decreasing.  I think Mr. Ging also makes the valid point that the crises are arising from conflict which could be avoided.  I presume he does not want to go into the general political scene.  I appreciate that, but I am sure that the political instability throughout the world, be it in Europe, in the United States, or elsewhere, is not helping to advance decisions that would try to eliminate these conflicts or at least reduce them.</p> <p>  We recently had presentations here from M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, and other NGOs.  There was one very striking presentation by a midwife, an Irish nurse who had returned from working in South Sudan.  Her description of the absolute poverty and suffering of the people in those areas was alarming.  One of the messages that the nurse, Ms O'Connell I think it was, and her colleagues brought to us is that there are a number of areas where no humanitarian assistance reaches.  She referred in particular to north east Nigeria and Yemen.  Assistance is not even reaching the most deprived people to any extent to try to improve their lot.  Does the OCHA see any way of trying to improve the provision and distribution of aid, particularly to areas that have been inaccessible to date?  I think Mr. Ging mentioned Syria himself and so many people there being denied access to assistance.  It is very much the same picture that the MSF people painted for us that day as well.</p></speech>

We have seen much political transition in many countries as well.  All of us have to be aware that that may cause leadership to be distracted from the type of issue I am raising here today.  At the heart of what is driving the misery, the death and the killing in so many countries is conflict, which is the product of political failure to resolve disputes, which requires external support to resolve.  If countries could solve it themselves, then it would already be done.  All of us need to continue to raise the profile and awareness among global leadership, in whatever format, whether the European Union format, the Security Council format, or in other bodies that come together to mobilise effective political action.  They have to have what is driving these humanitarian crises on their agenda, beyond hand-wringing that there is not anything that they can do.  There is much that we can do globally.  We need to do much more than we are doing across the board.  We need to do much more politically.  We need to do much more in financial support for humanitarian action.</p> <p>  On the Chairman's second point, which is the question of gaining access to people who are dying due to the lack of basic supplies - whether medicine, food or so on - we find in too many of these conflict settings that there is no respect for innocent civilians.  In fact, what is even more alarming is that there is a deterioration in respect for aid workers.  I would like to commend the heroic aid workers who are not just risking their lives, but losing their lives in so many of these countries.  We see, year on year, an increasing number of humanitarian colleagues - doctors, nurses and aid workers - losing their lives.</p><p>They are being killed because the parties to conflict do not respect the responsibility or duty of care to people who are doing nothing more than coming to help to save lives.</p><p> Irish NGOs are to be commended as they are at the forefront of humanitarian effort in all the crises I have mentioned.  I do not believe I have gone to any country where I have not found the presence of Irish NGOs.  This is part of the best tradition of the State.  We should, however, be alarmed about the attacks on aid workers, on medical facilities and on other aid facilities.  We are finding this to be an escalating challenge.  In addition, and the Chairman made reference to it, there are so many places where we cannot get to the people because those who conduct the conflict prevent us from getting there.  Their denial of aid is a weapon in the conflict.  They have the view that the aid will help people but they want the people to surrender and give up.  This has been said publicly.  They use the prevention of access to aid as part of their weaponry in the conflict.  This is in violation of international law and of all things decent and humane.  It takes us to a very bad place in our current world where there are so many violations of the laws of war, of international humanitarian law and of the principles that make us civilised in how we conduct ourselves.  There is no justification at all for the starving of people, now or at any time.  Yet, this is what we see happening in too many places.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1336" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017051800002#G00200"><p>It is very good to hear of the critical work that OCHA is doing and Mr. Ging has outlined the caseload in that respect.  Mr. Ging spoke of staff and I believe that staff are crucial.  I hear, however, that some of the staff appointed by OCHA are on short--term contracts and do not enjoy the same conditions as staff who are on longer-term contracts.   Mr. Ging spoke of duty of care but I would like to hear of OCHA's duty of care to all staff regardless of whether they are on short-term or long-term contracts and to acknowledge that the staff are in extremely difficult situations, as Mr. Ging has said.</p> <p>  The work of OCHA is humanitarian and emergency.  Let us consider the offices it still maintains in the Philippines and in Myanmar, with large staff numbers.  I know there are humanitarian needs there but those areas do not have the emergency needs that, for example, Nigeria or the other places as cited by Mr. Ging have.  I am involved in African issues and it is my understanding that at the early stages there was very poor co-ordination in Nigeria, the quality staff was not there, the leadership was not there, although I know it has changed now, and this exacerbated the difficulty.  The question must be asked as to why staff who were not in emergency situations could not have gone to Nigeria.  I presume that in time OCHA develop the skills of local people and national staff so they can take over.</p> <p>  I would like to hear about the management structure of OCHA.  Perhaps the witness will also outline exactly what OCHA is doing in Yemen and how that happens.  I note from Mr. Ging's biography that he worked in Rwanda.  We do not hear about Rwanda and I presume it is a good story, but I am interested to hear if there are other issues in Rwanda.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1337" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Ging" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017051800002#G00300"><p>On the question of UN Staff contracts, Deputy O'Sullivan is absolutely right.  When I say that the global humanitarian appeal is only 26% funded, it puts a lot of pressure on all parts of the endeavour.  It means that we only have a quarter of the money we need for the food, medicine and so forth.  The people who are working in the United Nations and elsewhere on the aid effort also have to adjust their budgets according to the global shortfall.  For our organisation, the UN entity that co-ordinates humanitarian action, it means we have had to reduce our budget in line with the reductions that have been suffered across the entire system.  It has been very tough.  As one of the senior leaders in our organisation we must address this with our colleagues, all the time and every day.  We would like to be in a more financially sustainable situation</p> <p>  I am delighted that Ireland is taking on the chairmanship of OCHA's donor support group.  To have the office that co-ordinates humanitarian affairs on a more financially sustainable basis will be welcomed by everybody and it will put us into a position where we would be able to make long-term commitments to staff.  We cannot make long-term commitments when we do not have the long-term funding.  There is a direct correlation between being able to give a staff member a short-term contract with today's money versus having the confidence that we will have the money next year and the following year.  We only get our budget each year; we do not have a multi-annual budget.  We are voluntarily funded and are not like other UN entities that have an assessed contribution, which is where member states pay their percentage as long as the entity is in place.  It is a different formula.  The humanitarian component is every year and is voluntary.  We have regular funding from countries like Ireland, but there are countries whose funding goes up and down depending on their spending decisions.  We must then calculate what cadre of staff we can have on longer term contracts and what cadre of staff we must be honest with and say that we cannot guarantee that we will have the funding in the next year for their positions.  Crises in different countries come and go and that is part of the emergency nature of the organisation also.</p> <p>  Deputy Sullivan asked about Myanmar and the Philippines.  We had an annual mission in Myanmar by our leading donors involving the donors who give most money to OCHA.  As the co-ordinator we invited them to come to Myanmar to see what we do there and to see that it is value for money.  Myanmar does not get the same degree of attention as Syria or Yemen in respect of its humanitarian caseload.  We must look at the caseload globally, not just from a numbers perspective but also with regard to the gravity of the situation and the catalogue of issues being faced.  In Myanmar there are 1 million Rohingya people who, by any international measure, are living in appalling circumstances.  There is also a conflict raging in Kachin in the north of the country.  This has created huge displacement of people, as conflict always does.  Notwithstanding the humanitarian caseload within the country, Myanmar is on a positive trajectory.  In Myanmar we are endeavouring to transition from the international humanitarian effort to a more sustainable effort in partnership with its government on the development side.  This is not progressing as quickly as would have hoped because the plight of the Rohingya people has been deteriorating at quite an alarming rate over the last year.  Two years ago we thought we would have a smaller configuration in Myanmar but we must also react to the situation we find.  We had also hoped for more progress in the north east of the country where the conflict is raging.</p> <p>  We have just three international staff in the Philippines.  As members are aware, in December 2013 the Philippines experienced a massive and devastating cyclone</p><p>In the Philippines, we are working with the Government to build that national capacity Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about for our exit.  As I said, we have now reduced the number of our international staff to just three.  We rely on Philippine staff, building their capacity and transitioning that capacity over to the national structures, particularly the national disaster management structure.  It is very much a matter of working with a country that is very committed to stepping up its own capacity but needs our global help in doing so.  Therefore, the work we do there very much concerns the capacity-building, disaster risk reduction and preparedness for crisis that come from natural disasters.  As I said, we are on an exit trajectory from the Philippines, but we do not want to have to return because we did not finish the job we should have done of building the capacity there.</p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan is absolutely right that we must be able to rationalise across the world where the international staff and limited resources we have are deployed.  She is also correct that the speed of scale-up in north-east Nigeria was not what it should have been.  However, while I will embrace, as one of the managers of the global effort, the responsibility and accountability for areas where we fall short, wherever they might be, I must tell the committee that with 26% funding, we will not get 100% result.  It is just not possible.  Therefore, if the committee's expectation is that we will deliver 100% with 26% funding, I ask it to adjust that expectation.  I am not hiding behind the shortfall in funding; I am just referring to it as a starting point.</p><p> Can we do better?  Yes.  We have stepped up in some areas but we have also as a consequence scaled down elsewhere.  Deputy O'Sullivan could also have raised with me the question why we are absent from Zimbabwe with such a high caseload and why we have exited countries across southern Africa where climate change has had a devastating effect.  The answer is that we have made a calculation that those countries do not need the international presence of my organisation because they have their national capacity.  They would benefit from our presence, for sure, but they do not need it.  Therefore, we transition that resourcing into places such as north-east Nigeria and, as I said, we are doing that all the time because the situation there is not stable at present.  We did not have at the start of the year the four famines we have now.  We must scale up for those famines in an environment in which resourcing does not follow.  We are not seeing the scaling up in resourcing with the scaling up of the need.  Therefore, hard choices - impossible choices - must be made, and I am very grateful to Deputy O'Sullivan for raising the consequences of what happens when those choices must be made.</p><p> Yemen was an incredibly impoverished country before this most recent round of conflict.  Some 80% of the food was imported.  The numbers in poverty were among the highest in any country in the world.  All of this has now been exacerbated by conflict.  What does my organisation do in Yemen?  We facilitate the working of humanitarian organisations; the composition of appeals for humanitarian action; access; engagements with the various authorities on the ground, negotiating with them to get the aid effort into the conflict-affected regions; and the provision of support to the humanitarian organisations on the whole range of operational issues they face.  Most importantly, we help them with the fund-raising they need to be able to do the good work they do.</p><p> I have been through Rwanda in recent times, and it is fantastic to see a country that was completely and utterly devastated by genocide in 1994 now doing well.  Economically, Rwanda is doing well.  We should always recall that there are ways forward out of these awful situations.  I do not want to oversimplify the politics of the situation in Rwanda or be misunderstood at all in that regard, but Deputy O'Sullivan's simple question was whether a difference can be seen.  Yes, a very positive difference can be seen for people in their daily lives in a country that was completely ruined by a genocide.  Again, this is why we should never give up.  I also feel that sense of fatigue in hearing about crisis after crisis, but we should not get tired.  We should redouble our efforts because, as I said, these crises are also in the majority of cases preventable.</p></speech>

He talked about the danger to staff, people being killed and so on, and that is the environment under which people work.  It is also true to say that more and more people around the world are coming out of poverty.  It is a very slow process, but if one considers the number of conflicts in the world ten or 20 years ago, it is a safer world, even with all the current conflicts.  It is important we give that hope to people as well, that the work carried out by NGOs and organisations such as OCHA is successful and does deliver for people on the ground.</p> <p>  Mr. Ging mentioned that Ireland is taking on the chairmanship of OCHA's donor support group.  What difference does he think this will make?  He mentioned the number of donations pledged but not delivered.  I suppose most of us and the people listening at home to these proceedings will not be able to get their head around this.  Why would a country bother making such a pledge at a conference and then not deliver?  What is Mr. Ging's assessment of the system of pledging?  How might an improvement to it be achieved?  Is it the case that countries make pledges and are discouraged afterwards from following through on them or told it was a mistake to make the pledge and that they should not get involved in certain countries?  Is this part of the difficulty?  If the targets are not met, instead of getting two meals a day do people literally only get one?  In the work OCHA carries out on the ground, is it involved in education or medicine?</p> <p>  Regarding refugees, the readmission agreements with the EU have been raised in the committee.  I am thinking particularly about the agreement with Turkey, designated as a safe country of origin.  We met an MP from the Halklarn Demokratik Partisi yesterday who talked about the awful things happening in Turkey: 130,000 people arrested, 47,000 in jail, the near genocide that has gone on against people, people being burnt alive in buildings, members of the political opposition being arrested, newspapers being closed down and so on, yet this is seen as a safe country of origin.  It would not sound like one to most people hearing this catalogue.  I am a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which has agreed to monitor Turkey on the basis of some of the things that have happened there such as the recent referendum.  Does Mr. Ging agree with my comments?  Is he allowed to comment on such matters?</p><p>I am not picking on that country; there are others as well.</p><p> Mr. Ging mentioned North Korea.  How does UNOCHA operate in that Orwellian society?  He mentioned stunting.  I am sure the regime would not be too pleased that such a high percentage of children are starving to death and suffering from malnutrition.  </p><p> There are areas generally that are not safe, and an increasing number of countries are moving against NGOs.  Does that impact on Mr. Ging's organisation?  NGO representatives who have appeared before the committee say they are being labelled as working with terrorists when they work in a particular area the regime is not happy with.</p><p> Reference was made to the Horn of Africa and the figures are staggering.  Ireland has a long-standing relationship with countries in this region and Mr. Ging mentioned the positive work we do.  Are we punching above our weight in those countries?  What could be done differently?  There is criticism of funding and it is believed there is better monitoring if funding is channelled through Irish Aid or if Irish Aid is involved in projects.  I recognise the pluses of pooling resources and delivering projects more cheaply and so on but, as part of that, less attention is paid to some projects.  If I am asked whether I can stand over Irish Aid projects, I can say I have visited a number.  I have visited countries where the system is not working and it is leaking.  How can that be addressed?</p><p> Mr. Ging talked about man-made crises.  I am conscious of what is happening in Palestine.  There were reports earlier of an Israeli settler opening fire on a peaceful protest and people being killed.  What is happening in Gaza?  This is a man-made humanitarian crisis and conflicts keep breaking out in the area.  The UN reports say the area will be unliveable in by 2020 as a result of Israeli of military operations, an almost decade-long blockade and economic and infrastructural issues.  How important is it that organisations such as the UNOCHA, politicians, and other NGOs go into conflict zones such as Gaza, Syria and Iraq?  How important is it that politicians who are comfortable in Dublin or Europe obtain second-hand information as through meetings such as this rather and visit those areas? </p><p> Reference was also made to Yemen, cluster bombs and the number of meeting facing starvation as a result of another man-made conflict.  There is, however, clearly a link between countries that supply weaponry and so on countries such as Yemen and the refugee crisis.  What can be done differently?  The cluster munitions agreement was adopted in Dublin and signed by 120 countries.  It bans the use of cluster bombs yet countries are supplying them.  There is something missing in the middle.  Has the UNOCHA recommendations in this regard?  Does Mr. Ging agree that Ireland and the international community must challenge the Saudi regime about using these bombs?  How can they be challenged?  Does he agree that weapon sales to these countries should be suspended?  That would be a solution but will it happen?  There are borders going up in Europe and the arms trade involving many European countries is contributing to these conflicts.  Many of the people fleeing these conflicts are travelling to these European countries seeking support and safe haven.  That is the eternal cycle.</p><p> My questions are negative.  Has Ireland still an important role in securing the cessation of these conflicts?  How important is its role in not only sending aid but also in trying to assist in the transition from conflict to peace?  Perhaps we should redouble our efforts in this regard.</p></speech>

I will concentrate on one area, although other areas are equally important.  I was in Somalia 25 years ago with a few Members.  It was one of the most devastating experiences I ever had.  When I returned, I said if anyone mentions the word "poverty" to me in Ireland, I will scream.  What I witnessed was unreal.  When I read through the documentation for this meeting, it stated Somalia is facing a crisis again.  I am worried when we discuss these countries that whether &euro;25 million or &euro;55 million is provided, the money is not solving the problem.  The witnesses have given up their lives to look after these countries and they must be more frustrated than I am because they are at the coalface.  My vivid memory, as if it was yesterday, is of walking into Baidoa where we had troops who were responsible for bringing aid from Mogadishu to Baidoa.  They were protected by an Indian force that was there.  No building in Baidoa had a roof on it.  The doctor who dealt with the Irish troops was the only medical person in the region.  It was so horrific that one could not explain it to people unless one saw it.  Is our policy of doing bits and pieces in different areas the wisest policy or should we concentrate on one or two areas until they get up and running?  After 25 years, one submission states, "Somalia is the most fragile state in the world".  It seems that despite all the attention and all the aid, nothing has been sorted.  Many of these problems are the result of the regimes in these countries, which are not being tackled.  There is a flow of people trying to get into Europe and drowning in the process.  The whole thing is frightening and I am lost for words.</p><p>I congratulate Mr. John Ging on the work he is doing.  Can he advise us on how we should tackle these problems?  Even if we were to sort out one or two regions over a period, would it be better than throwing bits here and there and not really getting anywhere?  Does Mr. John Ging believe there is an urgent need to change policy or direction?</p></speech>

It has made a difference.  It has saved a significant number of lives and reduced suffering.  However, it has not solved the problem of conflict.  There is no humanitarian solution to a conflict.  The humanitarian response in a conflict has a single objective, namely to save lives and reduce humanitarian suffering.  It will not solve the conflict, however.  It will go on as long as the conflict creates the suffering and the need.  That is why we say we have to have political resolution to conflict.  We also have to have investment in development to ensure we are actually helping people out of a dependency on aid in order that they can work towards a better life and livelihood.  This is why the sustainable development goals, signed up to by global leadership for a 2030 target, are important.</p> <p>  In the meantime, we cannot take our foot off the accelerator in mobilising the life-saving.  If somebody needs medicine, clean drinking water or food to survive, then we have to do that and the other stuff.  First, one has to save the life.  Then one can actually help to rebuild their livelihoods and life in more general through conflict resolution and sustainable development.</p> <p>  My fear is that as we see the failure to resolve conflicts, which are raging on and intensifying, their consequences are immediately felt by civilian populations who either have to flee with their families as a life-saving measure in the first instance, not to be killed by the bullets and bombs, or, as their whole livelihood infrastructure collapses because the economy collapses, they are left with nothing, as Deputy Barrett witnessed in Somalia, trying to scratch out an existence with some support from international assistance, praying for the day when the conflict will end in order that they can start rebuilding their lives, put their children back in school and so forth.</p> <p>  What must we do?  We must not distract ourselves from our responsibility to help people in such circumstances.  No matter how many of those circumstances there are, we cannot ignore any of them.  We cannot say to the people of north-east Nigeria that we are focused on Somalia and whatever happens to them does not concern us because we are going to do a good job in Somalia.  We have to extend ourselves on the basis of where are those who are suffering most and in most peril of death.  With the limited resources we have, we have to be accountable to those we are not helping.  We have to say to them that because we are only 26% funded, we are not giving a little bit everywhere but actually giving absolutely what we have to give where it is most urgently needed.  That will translate into giving a little in a lot of places and not just because we are handing it out to be present.</p> <p>  In many places, many people are dying unnecessarily.  For example, in North Korea, 400,000 children are suffering severe acute malnutrition.  We have the funding to help 125,000 of them.  What happens to the other 300,000 or so kids?  Over time, if they survive, they will be stunted - that is why 30% of the North Korean population is stunted - or they will die.  Thousands of them die just from malnourishment.  It is not a matter of access but of funding.  We have the access, we know where they are, we can get to help them but we do not have the money to do so.  It is up to us globally to answer to those kids.</p> <p>  That comes back to Deputy Crowe's point about whether politicians should visit conflict areas.  Yes.  I am now in UN headquarters for my sins but I spent most of my career out there.  When I was out in the countries myself, there was nothing like a visit from decision-makers to see for themselves.  One will be confounded by the simplicity of the situation and the complexity of the briefings one will receive before one goes.  No matter how complex the situation that might be represented, at a human to human level, one can do lot more.  That is why it is important that visits by political figures engage directly with the people.  There is also the accountability issue in showing how money is used.  Committee members are the decision-makers.  They have to be convinced that the way the funding is being decided and utilised is the right choice on behalf of, in this instance, the Irish people.  I encourage members to do that.  I myself have a long experience of Irish politicians going out there on to the front line, taking the risks physically to engage with the people who are being helped.  I know those politicians who did so have also heard back from the people who are being helped how much they appreciate the assistance coming from Ireland and the other countries.</p> <p>  Ireland has a high reputation because Irish Aid is delivered with integrity.  We should continue to strive to ensure to keep that standard.  Ireland assuming the chairmanship of the donor support group is significant.  Ireland will bring its values to this position.  It will bring the integrity on its side in terms of how it conducts its aid effort, including aligning its words and commitments with its actions.  The Deputy was correct on pledging.  If we get a pledge from Ireland, we can actually start the actions because we know that money is real.  With other pledges we receive, we have to figure out if that is old money that was pledged previously or money going through different mechanisms which are not the multilateral or NGO mechanisms.  One really has to get into dismantling what that pledge actually means when we have asked for new money for the humanitarian appeal we have presented and not for international action in the given country.</p><p>We have a humanitarian response that we want to provide.  It is correct to say there is frustration about these pledging events and that we must all work to simplify matters.  We must also ensure that when we communicate that we have received "X" amount for "X" country, the money will translate into activity in that country in a specified timeframe.  Ireland can be very influential in that regard.  The major benefit is that it leads by example.  As I said in my opening remarks, there is a G20 of rich countries and a G20 of generous countries.  There has to be greater alignment of the two because unless those who have the financial capacity actually live up to their responsibilities, the gap will not be filled by those who do not have the financial capacity or means to do so.  Ireland provides leadership aligned with its means that encourages others with greater means to step up to the plate.  We are leading by example.  </p><p> I encourage the committee to drive on towards meeting the global commitment to provide 0.7%.  Five countries have met that target and have done so not with an altruistic agenda but with a rational agenda.  They have recognised that this is the way to have a better world for everybody.  The consequences of not meeting the target will be felt in the countries that do not live up their responsibilities, as well as in the countries where people are dependent on aid.  We did not step up and help Lebanon and Jordan to cope with a massive influx of people in the early days of the Syrian crisis.  Lebanon has a population around the same size as that of Ireland, but it became home to 1 million refugees.  Imagine the impact that had.  The impact of 1 million refugees was keenly felt in Europe, which has a population of 350 million.  Lebanon which has a population of 4 million people received 1 million refugees, but we stood back.  We did not step up to the mark and help the Lebanese to develop the infrastructure necessary, including health clinics, schools and so forth, to cope with such a massive influx of people.  Then we wondered why people got on boats and risked their lives to cross the Mediterranean, so desperate were they to get out of that hopeless situation.  We needed to do better and need to do better in so many other places.  </p><p> There were many questions about the drivers of conflict, including the arms industry, politics and so forth.  I have my opinions, but I have come here to talk about the humanitarian crisis.  If I stray into offering my opinions on politics, I will be doing a disservice to my humanitarian message.  It is not that I am hiding behind my humanitarian message, but that is my job.  I have to convince people to mobilise on the humanitarian front.  However, I will answer the questions posed in the following way.  </p><p> There are many entities that have to work a lot harder at their jobs.  I will work on my mine, which is saving lives and reducing humanitarian suffering.  In doing so, however, I will communicate that it is not a solution.  It is, of course, a life-saving response that is urgently and desperately needed, but it is not a solution for the people.  We help by providing food, medicine, clean drinking water, sanitation and the very basics of life like blankets and shelter.  That is what we do.  We do not educate the children who are displaced.  We should do so, but we do not even have the money to feed them.  That is the travesty for them.  They do not get a second chance.  If one takes the seven years of war in Syria as an example, half of the kids are not being educated.  What future do they have?  How do we recover from those seven years?  As it is not possible, we need to speed up the mobilisation of much more than humanitarian action.  My plea is to those entities that have responsibility for mobilising political solutions at the global level to move much faster and much more effectively because what we are seeing on the ground is a direct consequence of their failure to do so.  We absolutely need to align our responsibilities with global peace and development and the actions that will contribute to them and stop the actions that are undermining them and promoting, supporting or sponsoring conflict.  Too many conflicts are about not just the people who are fighting in the country concerned but also about the external assistance they are receiving in resources and other supports.  There must be a step change in the way we address conflicts for which there is no humanitarian solution.  However, the fact that there is no humanitarian solution does not mean that we are forgiven for not mobilising a humanitarian response.  We absolutely must do so.  The first thing we have to do is mobilise a humanitarian life-saving response, but we should, in parallel, be mobilising much more effective political engagement in resolving the issues that are driving the conflict.  We must look honestly at how conflicts are being supported externally by the provision of resources, weapons and so forth.  I am fully in agreement with what was behind the questions posed about conflict.  </p><p> Questions were also asked about the Irish role.  I grew up in this country at a time when a lot of the rhetoric held that the conflict on this island was unsolvabl.  There was a lot of evidence to support that argument, yet I have had the privilege of seeing that conflict addressed successfully and the transition away from violence to a political process and so forth.  There are lots of lessons that can be translated and utilised elsewhere.  One of the key lessons is that if one is coming from afar, one is not going to bring the solution.  The solution is home-grown.  The question is how do we support the people who have it in their hands to deliver the solution from within.  That was experience of those who delivered peace on this island - it was not imposed externally, although it was supported externally.  The solution was home-grown.  Ireland has a lot of experiences to share in conflict resolution.  Its complexity is also lost in the simplicity of global politics today.  Oversimplification, a black and white and right and wrong view of conflict, takes no account of the complexities involved.  An awareness must be brought to bear by practitioners and people with experience who can see how one can navigate through the complexity to a place where there is common ground and start to build out from there.  That is a very important point that should be promoted.  </p><p> Of course, the more Irish politicians who go out and see situations first hand and engage, the more they will be able to bring back.  Throughout human history the first casualty of conflict has been the truth.  People create a narrative to support their side of the conflict.  Dismantling these narratives is the first step towards the correct narrative to start driving actions.  As long as there is the wrong narrative, we will have the basis for the wrong actions.  As we all know, however, it is easier said that done.</p><p>The more people who have influence, credibility and impartiality who can start promoting the more honest narrative around what are the drivers and issues, the more likely we are to have more effective actions because they will be based on honesty and a reality with which we can then connect.  I hope this gives at least some of the answers sought.</p><p> A question was asked as to how anything can be done in the DPRK.  What is very interesting is we have a situation on the ground in the DPRK where the humanitarian organisations have free access to 95% of the country whereas several years ago we had access to approximately one quarter.  On a mantra of no access no aid, the government has had to adjust and now we have access.  Our problem today is we do not have the resourcing to deliver the aid to the people we can actually access.  In terms of the integrity of aid delivery, there is no country in the world where our aid is more scrutinised, and that is fine.  We have very sophisticated aid monitoring with the full-time deployment of international monitors who spend all of their time out in the countryside monitoring on a daily basis what is going on.  They do this with a very sophisticated computerised system, which reports outside of the country and not within the country, because, again, we want no doubt there is any issue with what is being done, where it is being done, who is getting it and how it is being monitored.  It would be a very convenient soundbite to state nothing can be done in North Korea because everything is controlled by the government.  Our aid effort in North Korea is not controlled by the government.  It is controlled by us and we are happy to demonstrate this to anybody and everybody, because it is extremely important that everybody knows it and we can prove it.  The other thing I would say about the aid effort I witnessed in North Korea recently is it is having a significant positive impact.  Simple activities are having a significant positive impact.  We can also speak to this, which is extremely important, that if money is put in this is what we get for it.</p><p> Deputy Barrett spoke about Somalia.  What a travesty and a tragedy 25 years on.  There has been no political solution since he was first there.  It has rolled on and on.  The absence of a political solution, which could put the country back on its feet and get out of the conflict it has been trapped in for so long, leaves us today, 25 years on, speaking about the same issues.  The country should not be in peril of famine but, unfortunately, because we did not have the political will to stay the course over the past 25 years and do the things with the Somalis to help them get to where they needed to be, this is the situation they are in today.</p><p> I would also say in answer to all of the questions, if the aid effort were not in the four famine affected countries they would all be in famine.  They are one step away from famine because the aid effort has kept them in that situation.  If they did not have the aid effort they would all actually be in famine.  Committee members know it is not just about the loss of life and the human suffering when it comes to famine.  The financial cost of recovery from famine is eight times higher than preventing it.  Feeding the children before they becomes severely malnourished is eight times cheaper than feeding the therapeutic feeding required to help them recover from severe acute malnutrition.  We still have to continue to feed them after this except, of course, they will have lost cognitive ability because there is no recovery from some of the devastation caused to the body, including to the brain, when people fall into severe acute malnutrition.  It makes sense from all aspects no matter how it is calculated.  I would argue in the first place from a human perspective, but I can also argue the finances on this.</p></speech>

It is absolutely inspirational to sit here and listen to the passion and compassion he has for the people on the ground with whom he deals in such an important and strategic way.  The work he carries out on a humanitarian level is absolutely phenomenal.  I apologise that I did not get to hear the presentation.  I was at another meeting.  I am not a member of this committee but I wanted to come in to hear about some of the work.  Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien, who is a committee member, contacted me because he knew this is an area in which I am interested.  It is refreshing to hear on a number of different levels the impact of Irish Aid and the fact it is so well monitored.  I have seen some experience of this and I certainly add to this.  There is also the fact that the work Ireland carries out as a small country is very much appreciated and held up to a very high standard.  Accountability is hugely important in terms of where our funds go and to ensure we have the optimum impact for the money spent.</p><p>Bringing it back a little to the Irish record on the current crisis with refugees and the migration crisis, the Oireachtas passed a motion eight or ten months ago that we would bring in 200 unaccompanied minors, those who have been left devastated without family, country or any support.  To date there are only four here, which is hugely regrettable.  It is a poor indictment on the Government.  There is also the fact it was agreed we would take 4,000 refugees from the Syrian crisis.  To date we have taken in only 760, 241 of whom are refugees and 519 are under the resettlement mechanism.  We are moving at a very slow pace and I and my party believe we need to do far more in terms of bringing refugees and those whom we can resettle to the country and ensuring the conditions are there for them, so schools have the appropriate places and can give the appropriate support to these people who are fleeing from their homes carrying nothing but the shirt on their back and taking hugely arduous journeys which many do not survive.  I am always conscious that while those on the <i>LE Eithne</i>did a wonderful job saving people in the Mediterranean, for which they have been awarded medals, we need to do far more than just pull people from the Mediterranean.  As a country we absolutely need to step up and do so much more at a humanitarian level.  I accept what Mr. Ging said about the political and conflict resolution side of it being different, and it is a huge part of the story, but on a humanitarian level as a country we absolutely should and need to do far more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1347" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Ging" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017051800002#M00300"><p>I wish to make a point about Irish politicians visiting.  When I worked in Gaza I had the privilege to be visited by Deputy Enda Kenny, the now Taoiseach, the leader of Fianna F&aacute;il, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, the leader of Sinn F&eacute;in, Deputy Gerry Adams, and the President, who came to Gaza prior to being elected to that position.  I want to highlight we have had so many important visitors.  I could list many others but I just want to give the committee some examples of people, who also came in other capacities.  When Deputy Kenny came he was not the Taoiseach at the time, and when he became Taoiseach he had it in his understanding.</p><p>As Deputy Barrett knows from having gone to Somalia 25 years ago, it does not leave one.  It is an impression that stays with one.  I want to re-emphasise the importance of this.</p><p> There is much talk about aid integrity, accountability and so forth, and rightly so.  However, we must also talk about our responsibility to the people who are dying and suffering in, I would hope, even greater measure because as I go to committees around the world, they keep talking more and more about how we guarantee that we did not lose a bag of flour,  and that every dime and dollar went to where it went.  It is like asking the fire brigade if it realises there is a global shortage of water, while it is putting out the fire.  The reaction one get is: "Do you want me to put out the fire, or do you want me to save water?"  In the Somalia scenario, in 2011 there were such restrictions on the so-called aid integrity issue that the aid remained, in large part,  in warehouses in Nairobi.  This was because we could not meet those standards, because if anybody at a checkpoint were to steal a bag of flour, it would be denoted that we were supporting terrorism.  The reality on the ground is that if zero loss in a conflict scenario is the standard, then we cannot deliver aid.  What happens?  The kids on the other side of that armed group's checkpoint starve because one cannot get through effectively.</p><p> It gets much more difficult when one has to deal with reality on these issues.  Is one sack out of 100 okay to lose?  In pubs, there is a spillage allowance that is written off every day, not as theft, just as the reality of the spillage of beer.  Yet there is no understanding of the equivalent situation in the delivery of humanitarian assistance, between the truck travelling 100 miles and the truck arriving with a bag of flour broken, or whatever, because the assumption is that if any loss must be fraud.  This issue has been overly politicised.  I again ask the committee to help us on this issue as we try to stay with the reality of saving lives in a conflict setting.  We have to make sure that there is the highest possible standard of accountability that any normal man, woman or child would expect for their funding for the aid effort, but that this standard does not go into a stratosphere which is disconnected from reality.  This is what resulted in the shame that we had in the Somalia famine back in 2011 where, because the restrictions were so zero-tolerant of the risk and reality that one faces day-to-day in a conflict zone, the aid was not deployed.  Over 200,000 people died because we could not send the aid in under those circumstances, and that is not acceptable either.</p><p> I just wanted to take the opportunity to bring up this issue because I know that this committee is very grounded in reality.  There more members that travel and see at first hand, the better.  We also have to address this issue in a way that does not allow anybody to hijack it and does not leave us so that we are fully accountable on the one hand, and then we are just doing a paper exercise that is disconnected from the reality on the ground on the other hand.  As everybody knows, that prevents one from actually doing the job that one should be doing.  As I said, in the example of a fire brigade, at that moment it is about water conservation or putting out the fire.  The task is to put out the fire.  We have a task to save lives and there will be certain loss in that endeavour, which is a genuine reality of getting to help people and save their lives.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

The picture outlined for us of the huge number of crises throughout the world is very stark.  We wish Mr. Ging and his colleagues well in the very important work they are undertaking in so many difficult areas in the world.</p> <p>  I also want to record our appreciation of the work of our NGOs and their sister organisations around the world, whose personnel are working in the most difficult and dangerous situations, bringing great relief and help to so many people who are destitute.  I would further like to record our appreciation of the work of our ambassadors and their support staff in the partner countries because it is very important.  Mr. Ging gave a clear message that Irish aid is well directed and put to very good use.  That is a message that we want to send clearly to the taxpayers who make it possible to deliver that aid.  Again, I thank Mr. Ging very much for his presentation.</p></speech>

Let me start by introducing myself and my colleagues.  I am the Government Chief Information Officer and I am accompanied by Ms Evelyn O'Connor and Mr. Pat Keane, both from the Government reform unit, and Mr. Owen Harrison, from the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.  The committee will have received a short briefing note in advance of today's session.  Given that it is our second visit, I propose to keep the opening statement brief to maximise the time available for discussion and questions.</p> <p>  As previously advised, the principal aim and core focus of the Bill is to provide a generalised legal basis for the sharing of data between public bodies while also setting out appropriate principles and safeguards under which such sharing should take place.  I will begin by outlining the three major drivers behind this Bill.  These are the general data protection regulations, GDPRs, the digital Single Market and eGovernment action plan, and the national eGovernment strategy.</p> <p>  Beginning with the GDPRs, we believe this legislation is necessary to help the Government achieve its ambition that Ireland should be seen as an exemplar in data stewardship and data protection.  GDPRs set out to protect the individual with regard to the processing of personal data.  However, they also recognise and provide for the importance of the free movement of personal data within the European Union for the purposes of better government, better health care, economic growth, etc.  We believe that the Bill being discussed today provides the regulation, especially governance, required to ensure full compliance with GDPRs.</p> <p>  As members know, the digital Single Market is being promulgated as an essential initiative to promote the economic growth of the Union and the prosperity of its citizens.  The eGovernment action plan is a key aspect of digital Single Market and obliges governments to put plans in place to ensure government services can not only be accessed digitally but also ultimately accessed by any part of any member state.  Governments are also expected to simplify government services by not expecting citizens to provide information to one agency that has already been provided to another and by implementing means of secure identification and safe cross-border access to goods and services.</p> <p>  I would like to touch on the national eGovernment plans.  In the 2017 Civil Service customer satisfaction survey, conducted by Ipsos MRBI, 61% of those consulted agreed or strongly agreed that they would be more inclined to use online Government services as their preferred way of initial engagement with the Civil Service provided they were easier to find and easier to use.  In the 18-34 age category, the total figure was 76%.  Sixty-five percent felt a single digital identity would be very convenient or fairly convenient.  In the 18-34 age category, the total figure was 82%.</p> <p>  All these initiatives require us to improve our data sharing between Departments, with other public service providers and ultimately with other states.  We need to drive inaccurate or erroneous data out of our systems.  We need to make it easier for the citizen to access our services and the data we hold on them and we need to ensure we do not duplicate or request data unnecessarily.  We believe that the data-sharing and governance Bill helps create the platform for these things to happen.</p> <p>  I would like now to move on to the Bill itself.  The initial draft proposals for this legislation were put out to public consultation in 2014.  There was a significant response from a wide range of stakeholders to the consultation and the views aired during this process have made a substantial contribution to the development of the Bill, especially in regard to the governance of data sharing.</p> <p>  The key issues to be addressed by the Bill can be summarised in the following way.  First, it ensures public bodies share data where it is appropriate to do so.  At the moment, some public bodies can be reluctant to share data with other public bodies in cases where it would otherwise be beneficial because it is not clear to them that they have the authority to disclose such data.  This Bill addresses this problem by establishing an unambiguous legal basis for data sharing between public bodies as well as specifying the conditions under which it can take place.  The Bill also provides that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, with the consent of any other relevant Minister, may direct public bodies to engage in data sharing when necessary.</p> <p>  Second, the Bill puts mechanisms in place to ensure data are collected and shared only where there is clear purpose and justification.  A key part of the legislation is to provide governance over the data sharing agreements that must be put in place and published before the data sharing can take place.  The Bill provides a mechanism for requests for data sharing to be rejected or ceased if there is no longer requirement for the data sharing to take place or where it might be inappropriate.</p><p>Third, it makes who whole process considerably more transparent.  Specifically, it will be easier for citizens to find out what data about them is being shared, easier for them to correct data, and easier for them to challenge or complain about data sharing that is planned or has taken place.</p><p> To conclude, data is fundamental to the effective performance of public bodies and is one of the most important resources available to them.  We believe that this legislation will deliver a number of concrete benefits to citizens, businesses and public bodies.  Widespread data sharing between public bodies avoids the need to provide the same information multiple times to different bodies.   The implementation of an "ask-once, use-many" approach can help to significantly reduce the administrative burden on citizens and businesses and allow them to avail of higher quality, more efficient and seamless public services on a cross-sectoral basis.  For public bodies, data sharing provides efficiency gains and cost savings by reducing manual document checking, removing unnecessary registration processes and providing more and better data for control activities.  Sharing of data also supports better evidence-based policy analysis and policy making and improved service planning and design.  This challenge is not unique to Ireland, as I have demonstrated earlier, and is recognised and being addressed across Europe.</p><p> In a digitally dominated age, it is important for Ireland to retain its place as an EC exemplar and leader.  The governance provisions in the Bill and enhanced data management arrangements will give data subjects greater confidence that data concerning them is being managed and shared in a responsible manner and in compliance with national and EU data protection law.  Publication of data sharing agreements will also ensure transparency of data held and shared by public bodies.  The Bill will help public bodies comply with data protection requirements under national and EU law.  I hope my opening statement has been helpful.  We are happy to listen to the committee's views and answer any questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1361" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051800002#C00300"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to meet to discuss the provisions of the general scheme of the data sharing and governance Bill.  I am Dale Sunderland, deputy commissioner with responsibility for the consultation function of the data protection authority.  My colleague, assistant commissioner Cathal Ryan, is the office's head of consultation for the public sector and health.  The Data Protection Commissioner, DPC, recognises the intended benefits of the proposed Bill and is supportive of the aim of developing more efficient and customer-centric public services.  We accept, therefore, the rationale for the proposed Bill in so far as it will provide a legal framework for public sector authorities to carry out the requisite analysis and balancing tests that respect the fundamental EU right of individuals to have their personal data protected.  The proposed legal framework should have the benefit of providing confidence to all public sector bodies to explore and carry out legitimate data sharing opportunities.</p> <p>  Of itself, the sharing of data is neither good nor bad.  Quite clearly, it can have benefits in some cases for the public in not having to supply the same information multiple times.  In other cases, however, data sharing can lead to public bodies holding excessive and unnecessary data on individuals.  In contemplating data sharing initiatives, it is important to start out with the understanding that Government does not represent one data controller under data protection law.  Each Government Department has its own individual responsibilities under the law.  Sharing of data between public bodies may only occur where it is provided for by law and the core data protection principles of purpose limitation and transparency, in particular, to the public are met.  This fundamental principle of data protection compliance has been underscored by the ruling of the ECJ in the Bara case.  Therefore, it must be clearly understood that the general scheme of the Bill before the committee cannot create a new legal basis for sharing data in any given case that does not otherwise exist.  Instead, the Bill seeks to provide a process for public sector managers to assess whether sharing can lawfully occur in respect of purpose limitation and transparency and with appropriate safeguards.  It is the assessment process in the proposed Bill that is key and the outcome of that assessment will dictate if sharing of data can occur and on what basis it can occur.</p> <p>  I emphasise that legislation on its own is not sufficient to prevail over data protection law in light of its status in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.  In accordance with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, each data sharing arrangement envisaged under this Bill will require a careful balancing test to justify why the right to data protection must cede, in a proportionate manner, to the legitimate interests of the public body concerned.  While the DPC welcomes the safeguards set out in the proposed Bill, we believe it would benefit from the addition of further provisions underpinning the responsibilities of public sector bodies in carrying out adequate and robust data protection assessments.  The Bill would benefit from the inclusion of a requirement for a statutory instrument to legally underpin each data sharing arrangement in addition to the memorandum of understanding.  This would provide public bodies with the additional legal and administrative certainty to pursue legitimate sharing of personal data within a framework that provides for the proper data protection assessments to be undertaken and the necessary safeguards applied.  While we welcome the provisions of the Bill to provide for screening tests and privacy impact assessments, we recommend in the interests of transparency to the public a provision in the Bill for the publication of the results of any screening assessment or privacy impact assessment.</p> <p>  While it is our understanding that the Bill is not intended to provide a legal basis for large structural data sharing Government projects, which would still need specific primary legislation, the general scheme is not sufficiently clear in this regard.  We recommend that provisions be included to clarify the scope of the legislation and the data sharing arrangements to which it will apply.  For the avoidance of any doubt, we also recommend that further clarity be provided on the agencies and bodies that will fall under the scope of the Bill.  The Bill must also comply with the new general data protection regulation which comes into effect on 25 May 2018 as well as being consistent with the general scheme of the data protection Bill as published last week by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality.  There may be further amendments our office suggests as the drafting continues.  We are quite happy to share further detailed proposed amendments with the committee if that would be helpful.</p> <p>  In summary, the DPC accepts the rationale of the general scheme to support lawful sharing of personal data where justified.  I acknowledge the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's open and engaged approach with our office in seeking our observations on the proposed Bill.  We commend the Department on undertaking a public consultation to inform the drafting of the Bill.  As I have outlined, we believe further enhancements are necessary so that the Bill will achieve its intended objective by providing a robust legal framework whereby public sector bodies have the authority and clarity to confidently engage in legitimate data sharing initiatives.  I thank the Chairman and committee members.  I am happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Carroll" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051800002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the opportunity to attend and participate in discussions on the data sharing and governance Bill.  I am Seamus Carroll from the Department of Justice and Equality and I am accompanied by Ms Noreen Walsh and Mr. Conor O'Riordan from the civil law reform division of the Department.  Reference has already been made by Mr. Lowry and Mr. Sunderland to the general data protection regulation and I will start by saying a few words on it.</p> <p>  Following several years of intense negotiation, agreement was reached in early 2016 on the content of the general data protection regulation, or GDPR.  It was published this time last year and will take effect from 25 May 2018.  Its purpose is to update and streamline data protection law across the EU.  Broadly speaking, the GDPR strengthens the rights of individuals to the protection of their personal data, clarifies the obligations on bodies that process personal data in both the public and private sectors and greatly expands the functions and powers of data protection authorities, including in our case those of the Data Protection Commissioner.  These extended powers include a power to impose substantial administrative fines for infringements of data protection law, albeit not generally in the case of public authorities and bodies.  Adoption of the GDPR has been accompanied by adoption of a law enforcement directive which contains rules that will govern the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences, or the execution of criminal penalties.  This directive must be transposed into national law by May 2018.</p> <p>  While an EU regulation is a directly-applicable legal instrument and does not normally require any national law to give it legal effect within a member state, the GDPR contains a number of provisions which allow member states a limited margin of flexibility.</p><p>For example, it recognises that reconciling the right to protection of personal data with the right to freedom of expression and information is a matter for national law.  The same applies to reconciliation of the right of access to public documents, in other words freedom of information with the right to protection of personal data.  As Mr. Sunderland has said the Government has approved the drafting of a data protection Bill last week and the draft has now been forwarded to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality for pre-legislative examination.  It is a lengthy text, running to more than 95 sections and contains provisions which are intended to give further effect to the GDPR in areas in which member states retain some flexibility; transpose the law enforcement directive into national law; and to equip the Data Protection Authority with effective mechanisms and procedural safeguards in order to perform the expanded range of tasks and exercise the enhanced powers set out in the GDPR and the law enforcement directive. <br/><br/>The<i></i>General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR, emphasises the need for greater transparency in relation to the processing of personal data; Article 5.1(a) provides that personal data must be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner.  Article 26 goes on to provide that where two or more bodies are involved in determining the purposes of processing, they become joint controllers and they are required to determine their responsibilities for compliance with general data protection regulation, GDPR obligations in a transparent manner. <br/><br/>Provisions in the proposed data sharing and governance Bill will help to promote greater transparency and ensure that individuals are aware of sharing arrangements between public authorities and bodies.  This will help to facilitate effective exercise of their data protection rights. <br/><br/>Data processing by public authorities and bodies is normally undertaken on the basis of one of the following: first, processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or second, processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.  Article 6.3 of the GDPR requires that this basis must be laid down in EU law or national law.  It can be expected that the provisions of the Bill will promote consistency of approach and coherence in respect of data sharing across the entire public sector. <br/><br/>The Bill has been in the drafting process for some time and it contains references to our law, the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.  This legislation will be largely overtaken by the GDPR.  The text of the Bill will need to be updated to have regard to the text of the GDPR in order to ensure the necessary level of coherence and consistency. <br/><br/>I thank the Chairman and members.  The Department of Justice and Equality is available to answer any further questions on the data protection dimension.</p></speech>

I wish to question Mr. Sunderland on his submission.  If I am reading between the lines correctly, there is a sense that there is a great deal more work to be done on the Bill before the Office of the Data Commissioner is satisfied that it passes muster.  Is Mr. Sunderland confident that the issues he flagged are being dealt with at present?  If so, how and what is the level of engagement around the issues he is talking about?</p> <p>  In the course of his address Mr. Sunderland stated, "It is our understanding that the Bill is not intended to provide a legal basis for large structural government projects which would still need specific primary legislation provision for any data-sharing that would be required".  Will he elaborate on this?  He also states, "We would also expect to see significantly more detail to provide clarity in terms of how the governance ... and security arrangements ... are to be dealt with".  Will he also elaborate on this and give us a sense of where or how his concerns or flagged issues are being dealt with?</p></speech>

We have had very good engagement with the Department of Justice and Equality, as I mentioned already on the drafting of the heads of this Bill.  We are quite certain that engagement will continue and the Department has very positively received all of our views to date.</p> <p>  As I said at the outset this Bill is about giving certainty, clarity and confidence to public sector managers and public sector policy makers to actually engage in data sharing but it does not address some of the issues that are required under the data protection law, such as the lawful basis for sharing information in the first place, the transparency requirements and the data minimisation that one only shares as much data as is required.  They will always need a legal basis but also a proper assessment and that will be in part carried out by a privacy impact assessment.  The issues we have raised and suggested we believe will enhance and underpin the clarity and certainty that is required, for example a statutory instrument proposal will give that further legal certainty to Departments and agencies that what they are doing is based on a proper legitimate legal basis.</p></speech>

That is what we are thinking of, something large-scale in terms of the information to be shared or the national data infrastructure plans.  In our view it would need a proper assessment and primary legislation to give it the legal certainty that is required under EU and national law.</p></speech>

I speak from the research perspective and specifically in the health space to which Mr. Sunderland referred.  I am going a little bit off kilter and am not speaking directly to the legislation here, but I am a great believer in the idea that if we are talking about longitudinal studies and anonymising data and so on, there is a mine of information that could be used effectively for positive societal outcomes, particularly in the area of health.  I am trying to understand at present if there is a move or an initiative that would allow for that.  We have the unique patient identifiers but is there a mechanism that we can drive in a country that is open and has a very strong research infrastructure, where we can begin to look at data and analyse it and drive positive outcomes?</p></speech>

What our office wants to ensure is not to inhibit in any way the sharing of information or we recognise fully, as is set out in European law, that data sharing and processing of personal information is to serve mankind.  It is there for good societal reasons.  What we are concerned about is that it is done in the right way.  That is why we emphasise the importance of doing the proper analysis, the proper privacy impact assessments and the proper balancing tests.  If they are properly worked into any project and the proper assessments are worked through, one will make the right decision on whether it is possible to share the data on the existing legal basis or whether a new legislative basis is required and whether that respects EU law.</p> <p>  There is certainly scope to allow issues such as Deputy Sherlock raised to be progressed but from our view what is important is the way in which they are progressed and that the proper assessments are done.</p></speech>

The Bill provides for what Mr. Sunderland describes as an unambiguous legal basis for data sharing between public bodies.  Can any of the three witnesses articulate exactly what is meant by that?  What are the underpinning conditions for an unambiguous legal basis?  I have not yet read the legislation as we have not had sight of it.  I am taking that on trust.  I presume that in order to derive an unambiguous legal basis, one will have to be very prescriptive as to how that is done.</p><p>In other words, he will be kicking the tyres to ensure the consumer, whose data are being used, will have the requisite protections built in.</p></speech>

It depends on the level of interference with an individual's privacy rights.  It may be that if there is a low level of interference, the legislation under which a body is established will be sufficient in processing the data.  However, if the level of intrusion is much greater in terms of the protection of an individual's privacy rights, it may be the case that more specific legislation will be required.  That is part of of the analysis.</p> <p>  It is important to note that the core themes of the new general data protection regulation are accountability and transparency.  It is essential that there be transparency for the public and the individual on how their data are being used, the purposes for which they are being used and how they will be kept.  That is an essential core aspect of meeting compliance requirements under data protection law.  Accountability in an organisation relates to how it meets the requirements under the law.  We recommend - it will be an absolutely essential requirement under the GDPR - that every organisation approach its data protection obligations from these two perspectives and ensure it meets the necessary standards.</p></speech>

Effectively, the Bill involves the creation of a framework in which to carry out the appropriate assessments under data protection legislation leading to a legal, lawful data sharing arrangement.  While the Bill will set out various steps to be taken in a privacy rights impact assessment or a screening assessment to meet transparency requirements by publishing a memorandum of understanding or agreements, we also believe that while it allows for that framework, a statutory instrument should be created to underpin the process.  For example, if a privacy rights impact assessment is carried out and shows that the risk cannot be mitigated or that the data protection rights of an individual cannot be ceded in the light of the objectives of a Government body, it cannot go any further, irrespective of the legal basis.  That is because one has not shown that the justification has been necessarily proportionate.  The Bill creates a framework in which to explore these issues as regards design, analysis and implementation of a data sharing arrangement.  The statutory instrument will provide the legal certainty for data managers in being able to act on it in the future.</p></speech>

The question, therefore, is what constitutes an adequate legal basis.  In section 66 of the Civil Registration Act 2004, for example, entitled, Power of the Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheoir to give information to others, it is made clear that the Ard-Chl&aacute;raitheoir, after consultation with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, can give such information as may be prescribed on births, marriages, civil partnerships, decrees of divorce, decrees of nullity of marriage, decrees of dissolution or decrees of nullity of a civil partnership to the Minister for Defence for the purposes of the administration of schemes under the Defence Forces Pensions Acts or the Army Pensions Acts; to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the purposes of registration under the Electoral Acts; and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the purposes of determining entitlement to a passport, etc.  Here, therefore, is an example of a specific legal basis which allows for data sharing.  There is something similar in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which contains provisions on the sharing of information with other bodies.  The data exchange provision, for example, allows the sharing of information with the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></speech>

There are different ways of doing it.  This is primary legislation.  The possibility of introducing regulations has been mentioned as an alternative and there is now the possibility of there being memoranda of understanding which have been agreed.  I assume that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has received the necessary legal advice to the effect that this would meet requirements under the GDPR.</p></speech>

It seems, therefore, that there is still a little bit of work to be done in underpinning the robustness of the legislation to protect the consumer, which is fair enough.  This meeting has been useful for me personally in understanding the dynamics.</p> <p>  I want to ask one last question about complaints that might be made a consumer, client or citizen.  What protections are built in?  Mr. Lowry might wish to answer that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1387" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Lowry" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051800002#E01600"><p>I might perhaps assure the Deputy by outlining some of the layers of governance in this process.  As Mr. Sunderland said in his submission, it would be wrong to treat government as a single entity with regard to the GDPR.  For its purposes, therefore, each Department should be considered as a single entity.  Under the GDPR, each Department is required to establish the role of the data protection officer.  Article 39 of the GDPR clearly sets out the responsibilities of the data protection officer.  We expect any requirement for data sharing to be closely monitored in terms of its purpose and the amount of data to be shared, as well as the reason for sharing and the period of time for which the data will be held.  All of these things will be carefully scrutinised by the data protection officer in any Department.  In fact, they will use the instruments set out in the GDPR, such as privacy rights impact assessment and screenings, to inform their judgment.  At this point the data sharing may be underpinned by a data sharing agreement.  That is the view of the Attorney General's office.  For standard, benign purpose data sharing, things that are in line with good e-government such as not asking a citizen to retype information already held will be underpinned by the use of these instruments.  The role of the legislation and governance is to ensure compliance.  In sensitive areas of data sharing - the Deputy mentioned health care as a primary example where benefits and risks are significant on both sides - specific legislation is planned because the Government recognises its importance in terms of public profiles.  We believe there is a governance framework in place and planned that will handle most data sharing requirements without the need for undue bureaucracy and pressure on the system.  Equally, it is to be carried out in a transparent, simple and understandable way.  </p> <p>  On the second point concerning complaints, the objective is that transparency requirements will mean that data sharing agreements will be published and will be open to challenge.</p><p>Obviously individuals have the right to ask not only for the data that any specific public body holds about them, but also with whom the body has been sharing that data.  Again, there is a very clear framework, through the Data Protection Commissioner, where complaints can be made, escalated and investigated at an appropriate level.</p></speech>

It is correct to say that this is neither good nor bad and much will depend on how it is used.  I find the way in which data is used in this country quite fascinating.  I welcome anything that will protect the citizen.  The citizen is looking for transparency, simplicity and confidence in the system.  I welcome the fact that data sharing agreements will be published.</p> <p>  In terms of the original base register, peoples' main concern is about what information is held on them and whether that information is accurate and up to date.  In that context, is this framework going to reassure people that the information held on them is accurate and updated?  Is there going to be different data held by different Departments?  Let us take the Department of Health as an example.  One of the greatest bugbears for anyone who has ever attended a hospital is the fact that one is asked 20 times for the same information, over and over again.  Is there anything in this framework that will stop that from happening?</p></speech>

In assessing how Government, Departments and public bodies currently deal with citizen data, I would not use the term "bad" but I would use the phrase "could do better".  The role of this legislation and specifically the governance around it, is to help in the journey of getting to a much better place.  Through the national e-government strategy, which will be published next month, the vision is a single place that anyone can go to and find out the data held by a body, what that data has been used for and with whom it has been shared.  The individual will also be able to either correct the data, ask for it to be removed or no longer used, or challenge its use.  Obviously, with the investment the State has made in the systems that it has, this will not be available overnight but we will start to develop processes and mechanisms through the governance associated with this Bill, to start to deliver that over a period of time.  The vision is very much that government will use data appropriately for the citizen's benefit and absolutely have checks and balances in place to make sure that the data is not used inappropriately and not retained any longer than necessary.</p></speech>

The compatibility of the information management and IT systems will be crucial and if there is not a coinciding investment in upgrading and protecting all of that from cyber attacks and so forth, then this in itself will not mean anything to the citizen.  Are there many complaints about breaches of data protection in the system at the moment?</p></speech>

I guess the answer is "too many" because any complaints at all are too many.  That said, as a percentage of the number of transactions, the number of complaints would be relatively low.  In terms of the Senator's previous point, one must consider the investment that the State has made in setting up the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  Government has also set up a cross-departmental body chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, which has been tasked with trying to accelerate good data protection at departmental level and across all organisations in the State.</p> <p>  One must also consider the investment the State has made in the public service card and the MyGovID initiative, which was launched by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, a month ago.  The key principle behind this is that the worst possible scenario would be if I asked for data about me but was given data about somebody else.  The whole robustness behind MyGovID, the public service card and the SAFE process is to absolutely provide assurance to citizens that their data will not be erroneously provided to someone else who has similar data but not a full data match.  Huge investment is being made by all Departments and across Government to try to not only provide these assurances, but to also provide robust audit processes so that we know that we are doing the best that we can and are checking constantly that we are getting the positive outcomes from that work.</p></speech>

Such things are happening all of the time and that is why this legislation is so urgent.</p> <p>  Let us take the example of a local authority where hundreds of emails from public representatives are being read by the chief executive or some other senior manager.  What sanctions are in place to deal with that type of behaviour?  If an audit is done and that information is uncovered, what happens?</p></speech>

I am not well placed to talk about a local authority specifically but so will use the example of the Department of Social Protection.  That Department has had procedures in place for many years to ensure that people cannot browse welfare records just to see what their neighbours, friends or relatives are getting and there are very clear disciplinary rules and regulations that underpin that.  The State has had those in place for some time and they will continue to be there and will be enhanced.  That provides a level of assurance but the Senator is quite right, in that errors do happen and they are invariably human errors.  There has been a lot of investment made in training and so on to ensure that people are aware, as State employees, of their individual obligations under the Act, of what they are supposed to do and what they are absolutely not supposed to do.</p></speech>

Obviously, the general data protection regulation, GDPR, will address organisational deficiencies if they are found out.  The GDPR is very strong on penalties.  As Mr. Carroll said, it approaches the private and public sectors slightly differently in terms of penalties, but the GDPR looks at the organisational role in good data stewardship.</p><p>Individual organisations such as the Department of Social Protection and Revenue will and have always had procedures and disciplines in place and so on for individual responsibilities within that system.</p></speech>

Obviously, the whole governance model and the ability to challenge under GDPR makes sure that there are appropriate checks and balances in place at State level, individual Department level or indeed public and private sector level.

For example, if one looks at the Department of Agriculture, the role of agents in certain dealings with the Department have long since been established.  Departments' specific legislation will take care of requirements for data sharing with agents and the permissions that need to be given by the individual and so on.  This legislation would not get into that level of detail.  As Mr. Sutherland said, there is an expectation that there would be specific legislation for that level of sharing.</p></speech>

This is quite technical and not necessarily information that is going to hit the front page of any newspaper, initially at least.  Could the witness outline a real-life situation that this particular legislation is going to change and compare what is happening now with what will happen if and when this legislation is passed, or is the legislation just a general kind of tidying up of what is already happening?</p></speech>

To give a specific example, when we did the customer survey for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that I referred to in my opening submission, one of the frustrations that really came across was that the public does not like being asked for data that we have already collected from them.  If someone is applying for his or her first driving licence after he or she has applied for a first passport, we already know all the data about the person.  For us to populate fields, etc., on the person's behalf is simply good government.  Many of the European initiatives are very much aimed at governments making that happen.  That would be an example of where we would put in place the mechanisms in order that if an individual provides us with obvious data about name, address, marital status and so on, we will reuse that information.  The other really important part of the legislation is to ensure that no one Department can hold data that is not required for the purposes of their business.  For example, sexual orientation is a piece of data that only very specific bodies would be entitled to hold and use.  The legislation provides a framework where data like that would simply not be used and not be shared.</p></speech>

Is that correct?  Is that the public sector in its broadest meaning or more narrow meaning?  Does that include Irish Water, the ESB and other 100% State-owned entities?  The ESB is obviously a commercial semi-State company.  We are not sure exactly what Irish Water is at the moment, but it is probably neither one nor the other.  Is it in or out of this?  For example, one could understand the TV licence body wanting data.  I think it is able to get it already from cable companies, Sky and so on to work out if a house has a television service subscription and whether there is a requirement to have a TV licence.  Cross-matching there would make sense, but is it covered by this arrangement or is it purely public sector related?</p></speech>

In terms of data, we are all concerned about garbage in, garbage out.  At the moment, almost a million random breath tests that never happened have appeared on a system.  That is something that would frighten many ordinary members of the public as to whether they can rely on the systems.  Unfortunately, the systems have been letting us down in terms of giving the ordinary public that we represent confidence in knowing what is there.  The witness is saying that there will now be a system by which anybody can access their own information in the broader sense more than they ever could before.  With a PPS number and a password I could see what the Department of Health, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or the Revenue Commissioners have on me.

That is obviously a requirement under GDPR as well.  In delivering those services, we are basically aligning ourselves with the requirements of the legislation.  There is also the issue that goes back to the first example I gave of actually being a good government and providing good government services.  To provide a good government services, if someone tells one State agency that he or she has changed address and forgets to tell another agency, we should know that information and should be able to automatically update that address in all of our records.  That is where the legislation will help to start to encourage data-sharing where appropriate.  There are obvious areas in which we can share to the benefit of the public data that is not contentious and would not cause concerns by being shared.  The Senator gave a few examples earlier in which there would be a strong argument for the sharing of data.  Those are specific areas that would need to be looked at and legislation enacted for to allow that data-sharing to take place.</p></speech>

I am not sure.  It is regarding audit trails and the track being kept of what everyone is looking at and inputting.</p><p>Is that all included in the legislation?  It emerged when somebody won &euro;120 million or whatever it was in the EuroMillions lotto that approximately 70 people in the Revenue Commissioners decided to investigate the individual just because he or she had became interesting.  It would frighten most people to hear their next-door neighbour who happens to work in a particular part of the public service or down the road is checking to see who they are, what age they are, what is in their bank account and the tax they paid.  These data are relevant to certain people, but not to everybody.  People expect to have a right to privacy.  Are there controls in place?  If there are audit trails being planned, will they be monitored?  Much of the activity might be recorded but may never be flagged or examined.  Are flags supposed to appear on the system if an employee who generally works in a certain area suddenly starts looking at information that has nothing to do with him?  Will it be asked why this is happening?  Is that all built into this or not?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dale Sunderland" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017051800002#H00200"><p>Under data protection law, there are very onerous obligations on data controllers to protect and use information in accordance with the law.  This is about protecting all of our personal information so it is not used in inappropriate ways.  In any organisation, it must be ensured that anyone who accesses data has a legitimate reason for doing so.  Looking up information about somebody because they have won the lotto or to see who they are would certainly be inappropriate.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh referred to outcomes, implications and the Department of Social Protection.  We have initiated a number of investigations into private investigators inappropriately and unlawfully accessing data about individuals from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Department of Social Protection, in particular.  We have taken a number of successful prosecutions.  We understand, however, a number of persons in the Department were dismissed.  One, in particular, was dismissed from her post because of her gaining inappropriate access to personal data.  This is about protecting individuals.  We want to ensure legitimate data-sharing can take place, however.</p> <p>  To return to a point I made earlier, every public sector body is a data controller in its own right.  If Department A collects information for a particular purpose, it cannot share that, without a lawful basis, with Department B unless there is approximate use.  If it is shared for a reason that is in no way related to the reason for which it was originally collected, it may not be shared automatically.  There would need to be a proper, lawful and legal basis for that to happen.</p> <p>  While we want to facilitate legitimate data-sharing, it is very important that the principles and requirements of data protection law be met.  For example, the data must be accurate.  A concept known as the "digital footprint" or "digital shadow" is now being built up.  That will potentially be built up through data-sharing.  What the Government knows about one is not absolutely accurate in respect of one's individual circumstances.  If one Department shares information with another that is not correct or accurate, thus affecting an application for a grant, for example, it could have implications for the individual.  That is why we are really emphasising that this Bill will provide the legal mechanism to allow for the sharing of information, but in accordance with all the proper data-protection impact assessments and the law, as in making sure one transfers only information that is relevant and accurate and not providing information to another Government body that one has no lawful reason to share.  These principles are very important and must be adhered to under the data protection Acts.</p></speech>

It is true that individuals already have data-protection rights and that the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has certain remedies.  The GDPR, however, strengthens the rights of individuals.  It also strengthens the range of remedies of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  If an individual wants to exercise his data subject right at the moment and wants to find out whether a particular body has his personal data and what it is doing with it, he may apply to the relevant agency or Department and it will tell one.  It will not necessary tell one, however, that it has shared that information with another Department.  One is actually obtaining information on the processing that has taken place in the first Department but not necessarily on where the data has been shared.  This legislation will make it transparent, through these memoranda, that the data have been shared.  On the basis of that information, one may go to the other Department or agency and exercise one's rights.  This will be very important in bringing about increased transparency so individuals can exercise their data-protection rights against all the agencies that are processing their personal data.</p></speech>

It is data-sharing but is there a suggestion that there will be a central database to which the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will have access to parts and the Department of Health to other parts, for example?   Are we still talking about 20 different databases with my address in each?  If one is updated, are those responsible for the other 19 supposed to check whether information has been changed so they may update theirs?  What will be the actual impact?</p></speech>

The State has invested a lot of money in legacy systems so we cannot just replace those systems overnight.  It would not represent the best use of public money if we did.  The role of governance, particularly as outlined in this Bill, is to start the process.  First, it is a question of our having procedures in place for doing the things that public bodies need to do.  In other words, it is a matter of making sure the data are accurate and that data changed in one area are updated in others.  Ultimately, we would like to have electronic connectivity of databases so master records would be held in one area from which agencies would pull data, as appropriate, in order to use them for the purpose for which they are set up.  That would be a significant improvement.  As I said earlier, one of our immediate objectives under the eGovernment strategy is to create a portal where citizens can, at least, start an easier process of engaging with the public bodies that will hold their data and more easily find out how these bodies connect up.  As Mr. Carroll stated, data-sharing agreements will be published so it will be easy for an existing customer of the Department of Social Protection to check the State bodies with which that Department has shared data and then inquire of those bodies as to whether they actually have data on him or her.</p></speech>

Most of us realise these regulations exist.  Is it required that every single user of data on a system must have his or her own audit trail based on what he or she looks at?  One hears of passwords being shared and of people being able to access data on general terminals.  Is everybody protected in this regard?  If my account is being examined, is there an audit trail indicating everybody who has examined it?  Are there checks so people in Limerick cannot look at data related to people in Donegal unless they have a particular reason for it?  Are there flags and checks in the system such that every employee using the public service databases, in their various locations, can log in individually and that there will be a record of their updates, activity and amendments they make?  Is this all being recorded?  If it had been recorded in the case of some of the circumstances we are now talking about, we would have a record of the 937,000 tests, who inputted them and where the base data came from.  Do we have the safeguards in place?  Will we have them if they are not in place already?</p></speech>

It would be a demonstration of how a data controller would meet its obligations.  We in the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner do not necessarily set precise obligations because the law is principle based and there are general high-level obligations on data controllers.  The onus is on each individual organisation to work out what systems, governance measures, protections and audit trails it needs to make sure it meets all its data-protection obligations.  What the Senator is talking about is certainly an example of good practice, and we would certainly advocate that every organisation be able to demonstrate to us how it protects data and prevents unauthorised accessing of information by its employees where they have no grounds for doing so.</p></speech>

The obligation from day one was that key systems, especially systems that dealt with sensitive or public data, had audit trails within them whereby it was possible to produce reports on who had input which information.  I expect that most of the high profile, sensitive systems that power the State have similar measures in place.  Certainly in the examples we discussed earlier the computer systems and the audit trails of those systems played a big part in identifying individuals who made errors.  That is what one would expect of a computer system.  All high profile computer systems are subject to various programmes of audit, and one of the key objectives of an audit is to assess the risk of data breach or data misuse.</p></speech>

I do not wish to labour the point about the 1 million breath tests but I still do not understand how somebody somewhere or many people all over the place were putting these non-existent records into these systems, effectively making them up as we are told.  They did not just arrive by accident.  They got into the system in some way and there must be a record of how they got there.  If there is none, how could there not be?</p></speech>

I am sure the role of the computer system will be investigated and if there are weaknesses in the system they will be fixed.  In terms of the what the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, CIO, is doing, we are working with the Departments to compile a list of systems that will require verified public identifiers.  We are developing timelines for how those systems will start to use the MyGovID, the SAFE process, the public service card process and so forth, because that is the most robust means available to the State to ensure that somebody online who claims to be a person is actually that person.  It is important that we use those systems.  However, that is a considerable improvement step from where we are today, and I am not saying that where we are today is not a reasonable position.</p></speech>

I believe you have too much information.  It concerns me greatly that the State is collecting and sharing information, given what I know about what is generally described as a failure of the system or systemic failures whereby people are able to access information they should not be able to access.  It also concerns me given the example of Tusla.  I am not asking you to comment on an individual case but on the general case.  It is shocking that what we discovered Tusla had on file about individuals - not just one but a number of individuals - was totally concocted.  Were it not for a mistake being made which led to the individual seeing this information, those who knew about the information could have considered that he or she was a criminal.  I worry, therefore, about the amount of information that the State has on individuals, to be honest.  I particularly worry about agencies such as Tusla, because nowadays anybody can access all sorts of information about an individual.  If the State collects it in an organised fashion, I do not believe it should have the information unless it has robust audit trails and IT systems.  It concerns me greatly.  I have seen some of the files that were created, obviously deliberately, where the individual did not even know they existed.</p> <p>  The other issue is the action that is taken as a result of the discovery of information.  I will give a comparison and use my experiences with the Data Commissioner in two cases.  One concerned the HSE and public access to files relating to people's medical records and so forth.  I made a complaint to the Garda and I made a complaint to the Data Commissioner.  I have not heard anything back since.  When that loose, hard copy information about patients' records was available for the public to see I did not see the type of concern I would have expected.  In comparison, the reaction of the Data Commissioner to using your database at election time, which is a concern for all of us, would be over the top in my opinion.  I respect people's privacy.  I am simply making the point that there is an imbalance in terms of how the State reacts to different things that happen.  It is easy to act or react in a public way against a Member of the House, because we all scurry around the place trying to ensure that what we do is within the law, yet what happens in respect of bigger issues such as the Tusla files, the HSE files or other information relating to breath tests and so forth?  We do not know.  Gathering and sharing information is a very sensitive area.</p><p>I am not convinced we have the type of robust IT systems or understanding required to police it, if this legislation is passed.  </p></speech>

If we look at the GDPR itself, one of the reasons it became such a priority at European level were the concerns, not only of State bodies but organisations such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, and statements regarding what they were doing with people's data.  The state should not be given any more privilege than those companies to do things that are inappropriate.  This legislation very much aligns with the GDPR.  The Chairman is correct that bodies hold too much data and one of the key parts of this legislation is to ensure that bodies do not hold data that they do not need to hold.  It is to ensure that the data they do hold is accurate and that there is means for the data owner, the citizen, to check that is accurate and that there is means for it to be challenged if the subject feels it is being used for inappropriate purposes.</p></speech>

As Mr. Lowry says, there is already extensive information within Departments or agencies about individuals.  There is also misinformation, or incorrect information, created within organisations and agencies about individuals.  I do not know who has information about me and I can name the individuals who are concerned about Tusla and say they did not know the information existed - the wrong information, the misinformation - they did not know it.  That information was shared.  If one is sharing information, who is the person inside the Civil Service who will decide that does not seem to be correct information?  One could be sharing information that might look relevant, because it tells a particular story, but could be totally irrelevant because it is untrue and the person out there does not know.  It is down to human beings in there, using these systems, some being nosy or inquisitive, and wanting to know about their neighbour and some deliberately creating files that can damage individuals, but what if they do not know that they are there?  That is the case.</p></speech>

While I do not want to say too much about Tusla, we are conducting an examination of the systemic processing of personal data in Tusla within the organisation itself and with other data bodies or organisations.  That is an important piece of work which we have initiated and is under way.</p> <p>  On the HSE and access to files in public areas, in hospitals by both doctors, patients or individuals, we have initiated an investigation across the hospital sector into how personal information is handled within the hospital setting.     </p></speech>

It started earlier this year.  We do take these things very seriously.</p> <p>  Also, while we understand, as does EU law, that there is a need for legitimate data sharing and data processing, we believe there is much greater need for transparency about what is happening at the moment.  A fundamental part of data protection law is that the individual is fully aware of what data bodies hold about them, how they are using it, how they are protecting it and we are not convinced there is enough transparency into how Government itself is sharing data and for what purpose it is being used.  This is a matter which we have raised with the Department and with the Department of Social Protection in particular, in relation to PPSN and the public services card.  We believe much greater clarity needs to be provided to the public about how their data is being used across the Government sector.  We are engaging with them on that matter at the moment.  </p></speech>

I will use my own situation as an example.  I was elected in 1997 and now have 15,000 files, not created randomly, but created by people who gave us their birth certificates, wills, medical circumstances, the whole lot, and they are there in hard or soft copy on files.  The Data Commissioner is asking individuals like me to come to that high standard that it is talking about.  We operate a standard, it is moving to a different standard and there is no recognition of the cost necessary to get to that standard and comply with what is going on.  There is a need for anyone creating this kind of legislation to understand the agencies or the individuals it is dealing with to assist them to have the appropriate storage and appropriate command of the data it holds.  That is essential.  As much as I think it is important for people within agencies to have access to information, to access it on a professional basis only and not merely to nose around, because one gets that.</p></speech>

There will be an officer at a fairly high level in the organisation whose task is to focus on the data protection obligations and accommodate the exercise of rights by individuals <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>that organisation.  The regulation goes into a lot of detail on the qualities required.  It says that &quot;the data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities, and in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks of the data protection officer&quot;.  It goes into quite a lot of detail about what the tasks of the data protection officer would be and one is to inform and advise the controller or processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations under the regulation and under other EU and member state law in regard to data protection.  It goes on to emphasise the independence of this particular individual within the organisation.  It says that the controller or the processor - that is the public body - shall ensure that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of the tasks.  He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the agency for performing his or her tasks, and then, crucially, &quot;the data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level within the organisation&quot;.  The data protection officer will not be reporting up through his line manager in a hierarchical structure in future, but will report directly to the highest level within the organisation.<br/><br/>Why have all these provisions been put in place?  It is because there is a perception, not only in Ireland, that when it comes to public authorities and bodies there is need for further reassurance that data being held is being processed properly and used only for the purposes for which it is intended.  I return to the point I made earlier on this Bill, this will improve the transparency because if an organisation is sharing personal data with another organisation, now for the first time it will be clear from these memorandums agreed within the bodies, what information is being shared and that will facilitate the exercise by individuals of their rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>these public bodies.</p></speech>

The risk managers in banks have legal obligations.  They report to the highest level in the banks and thereafter to the Central Bank.</p><p>If they had all been doing their jobs, we would not have had the crash.  It is fine to define it in legislation, but when it comes down to organisations and people, the system has to be strict in how a person interprets what it is attempting to achieve.  One also has to take into account the size of agencies and operations.  I am a public representative and the data specialist in my organisation.  I report to myself and I am subject to the Data Protection Commissioner.  That is what is happening in the country.  We are creating wonderful agencies and introducing legislation without giving consideration to what actually happens in some of the entities that are lower in the pecking order than a well placed company or agency.  I invite the delegates to come and spend a week in my office to see at first hand the information we have available and then tell me what they would do with it.  I ask them to consider accepting that invitation.</p></speech>

I will try to provide some reassurance, if I can.  While we are obliged to implement the law as it is - it will now be direct effect regulation - it is a risk-based law.  Therefore, we approach our work in terms of determining where are the biggest issues in terms of systemic risk and the largest volumes of data processing and data sharing.  We will continue to allocate our resources accordingly.  We are interested in dealing with the areas which involve the greatest risk.  There are, nevertheless, obligations on everyone who collects data to be compliant with the law.  However, the obligations should be much more straightforward and less onerous in low-risk data processing.  Our office is trying to get the balance right in that respect.  We emphasise and focus our resources and efforts on the areas which involve the greatest risk.  I am not sure if that provides the Chairman with any reassurance, but it is something of which are conscious.  We are trying to improve how we do our work and carry out our regulatory functions.</p></speech>

Under the current law on data protection such as, for example, security purposes, it is up to the data controller to choose the level of security that is appropriate to the data he or she is processing.  Among the factors to be included are the resources that can be used to protect data.  A lot of it is subjective.  Organisations need to consider the resources they have to protect data.  They must also consider the nature of the data they collect.  Certain data will involve no detriment for an individual if left on top of a car and found, whereas other pieces would.  Organisations may need proper security measures to protect certain sensitive data rather than for general data that involve no detriment for an individual.  What we are trying to achieve in the office is to have a pragmatic common-sense approach.  A recent Latvian case contained a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice and the Advocate General, in its opinion which is not legally binding, started to discuss the common-sense approach to data protection.  There is a recognition at European level and in our office of the application of a common-sense approach and understanding the resources the data controller has available in order to meet his or her obligations under the Data Protection Acts and the GDPR when the system goes live in May 2018.</p></speech>

Organisations must be able to collect data as part of their functions.  The Bill will allow the sharing of such data only where an organisation complies with data protection law and the GDPR.  That means that the data an organisation holds and shares must be relevant, proportionate and so on.  All of the security provisions about which the Data Protection Commissioner has talked will all be relevant.  We need to improve public services.  Before the Chairman came to the meeting, Mr. Lowry outlined the findings of a customer survey which found that a very high proportion of the public wanted to see improvements in public services and were happy to have data shared online.  They will be allowed certain rights and to make complaints.  The GDPR and the need for public bodies to comply with its requirements will ensure those rights will be met.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Both witnesses are very welcome.

Perhaps it would help if I began by telling the committee something about who we are.  I am the professor of human rights law in the School of Law at Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast.  My colleague, Mark Bassett, is a barrister at law in Northern Ireland.  We have been working on this particular issue for a number of years and doing quite a bit of research on it.  I spoke on the issue at the Constitutional Convention in 2013.  Mr. Bassett and I have delivered a number of presentations on this particular issue.</p> <p>  The main point we would like to make today, and which I have hopefully made clear in the opening statement, is that we think that this is a reasonable constitutional step to take.  All the evidence at which we have looked and all the work which we have undertaken has led us to the conclusion that it is a reasonable step to take constitutionally.  Obviously, I will not stop there, I will say a bit more, but we think that voting rights are fundamental civil and political rights.  They are fundamental to the democratic system.  The Constitutional Convention, as members of the committee will know, made its recommendation in 2013 and, having looked comparatively around the world and at what the Constitutional Convention came up with, I welcome that conclusion and recognise that it is a relatively modest initiative and step to take.</p> <p>  We also welcome the announcement of support for this initiative by the Government and also the very helpful and detailed options paper which was delivered in March.  We welcome that but, like many people, we have noted that there tends to be general support for the idea and the principle in debates but that one of the endemic problems has been actually moving it forward, in the sense of naming a date for the referendum and when it will actually happen in practice.  Our sense is that is largely the situation at the moment.  In terms of the Irish system, Ireland has a comparatively restrictive system with regard to citizen's rights, which is largely residence based.  That is very notable when one looks at the international experience.  </p> <p>  In a sense, we have concluded that this is really an emergent international trend around Europe.  Many states are doing this.  Certainly one can see that from the 1980s and 1990s onwards many states have taken the decision to grant external voting rights to their citizens.  In taking that step there is a recognition of equal citizenship, but also a recognition that it can actually be done.  If one looks at the recent French presidential election, one can see examples of people outside of France voting in those elections in Ireland and Britain.  There are examples of people who are living in Northern Ireland voting in presidential elections elsewhere.  I could give example from Romania, Poland, etc.  This is happening.  People are doing it.  What we have seen from the evidence is that it can actually be done.  The options paper gives many examples of that.</p> <p>  It is important to underline, and we really want to underline it today, that this debate should, and must, transcend party politics.</p><p>It is a debate about equal citizenship, and I think it should remain at that level.  Without question the hard questions should be asked about how to make this happen; in practice it is a fundamental principle of equal citizenship that does and should transcend party politics.  <br/><br/>In conclusion, I will outline three principles.  First, there is an argument about equal citizenship.  There is an argument that in relation to a fundamental civil and political rights, like voting rights, that all citizens wherever they happen to reside should be treated equally.<br/><br/>Second, it seems clear to me that the criteria of using residence as a basis for excluding citizens from voting rights is increasingly being questioned as a matter of basic civil and political rights.  The worry would be that people will increasingly start asking hard questions about Ireland's current nearly blanket exclusion of citizens on that question of basic civil and political rights.  <br/><br/>Third, questions are increasingly being raised about European Union law in the sense that people by exercising their EU free movement rights may, oddly, end up becoming disenfranchised when they move elsewhere in their country of origin.<br/><br/>For a number of principles, on equality citizenship, on civil and political rights grounds and, increasingly, with questions of European law, profound questions are being raised about Ireland's near-blanket exclusion of citizens who are resident outside of the State in this context.  <br/><br/>I attended the Constitutional Convention in 2013.  Although I am speaking today with my academic hat on, I am also somebody who is personally affected by this matter.For somebody like me it is not an academic matter, and this matter affects my children as well.  I was not going to say the following but I have decided to do so.  This morning, as I got ready to leave my house, my daughter asked me what I was doing today.  I told her that I was going to the Oireachtas to talk to a committee.  She asked me to do a better job explaining that than I had done, which she often says to me.  I responded, although not in such grand words, by telling her that she had a right to vote in her own country in the future, and she is nine years old at present.  For me, there is an academic argument but there is also a principles argument.  It is not just an academic matter for somebody like me.  In a sense, the evidence exists to support this but there are also personal perspectives.  The question on my mind, which I am keen to explore with the committee today, is when a date will be announced for a referendum on voting rights.  We rather optimistically, as the committee will see from our opening statement, expected a referendum to take place last year.  We probably should have said &quot;may happen&quot; but that is our sense of where the debate might have reached. <br/><br/>My colleague, Mr. Mark Bassett, will continue our presentation.  <br/><br/>. <br/><br/><b>Mr. Mark Bassett:</b>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I will begin by speaking about the Presidency and how it is an ideal institution to open up voting rights for non-resident citizens.  <br/><br/>The Presidency, at its heart, is a symbolic office.  It represents, which is largely accepted, the citizenry as a whole rather than just the State.  I recall the inaugural address made by President Higgins.  He said that part of his hope was to represent all citizens.  The Presidency is an office that is largely insulated from controversial political choices.  It is an institution that best represents nationality and citizenship.  We would advocate a system of election that matches that situation.  <br/><br/>Although our focus is on presidential elections, the types of election where external voting may apply can vary too.  For example, the Legislature, presidential elections, referendums and sub-national elections.  The committee can see from our opening statement that there are a number of different electoral franchises in Ireland.  They all have a separate legal basis and a distinct character.  They seek to achieve different objectives.  None of those franchises aligns completely or neatly with any of the predominant principles of granting political rights in a democracy.  They do not seem to be based on an all contributing or all subjected principles since those resident in the State but who do not hold Irish or British citizenship can be excluded. <br/><br/>Our focus is on the voting rights of Irish citizens wherever they are located.  We have a particular interest in the Northern Ireland context.  It seems to us the exclusion of Irish citizens in Northern Ireland from voting in presidential elections should not be sustained.  There is nothing in the Irish Constitution or the proposed amendments that should be a source of anxiety for those who do not wish to avail of their entitlement to Irish citizenship in the North or who do not wish to participate in an Irish presidential election.  The Good Friday Agreement is a constitutional bridge between Ireland and Britain.  On previously contested issues of sovereignty and identity the two states are in agreement.  <br/><br/>A very important aspect of the Good Friday Agreement was the clear right to Irish citizenship for those who wish to avail of that right in the jurisdiction.  At the core of that is the entitlement to Irish citizenship.  It is our argument that that right must allow for some participation.  It is not meant as a token acknowledgement or placebo or just limited to the availability of a passport.  It should involve some level of contribution or participation because without that citizenship is devalued.<br/><br/>Professor Harvey has explained that there are good human rights reasons to extend the franchise.  He has said that there is a possibility that the current restrictions are at least suspect, having regard to European Union law.<br/><br/>The best argument for an extended franchise is to consider the principles and values contained in the Irish Constitution.  Every constitution tells a story.  It is more than just law.  It is part-philosophy, part-sociology, part-history and outlines hopes for the future.  The Irish Constitution specifically recognises partition, citizenship and the diaspora.  The Irish Constitution speaks of the diaspora and citizens beyond the State's borders in very warm terms but they need to be recognised.  There needs to be a way in which those citizens can contribute to and participate in the political life of Ireland.  <br/><br/>The Presidency is a very good example of the breadth of Irish citizenry.  Irish Presidents have come from Ulster, Connaught, Leinster, Munster, London and, most famously, from New York.  A franchise that reflects that breadth of citizenry can only be a good thing and should not be feared.</p></speech>

I do not have the percentages with me.  There has been talk of personal, postal, proxy and electronic voting, although we should not dare to mention electronic voting.  The franchise in the Twenty-six Counties does not allow anybody to vote by proxy.  It is amazing that one can vote by proxy in the North.  Equally, for somebody to achieve a postal vote in the South one must be housebound or a diplomat.  In terms of personal voting, an awful lot of people are disenfranchised before we ever start.</p><p> I have no issue with the proposal on the presidential election idea, but I have yet to be convinced.  The delegates have studied it, probably intensively.  Is there a danger, or is the country so small, that the diaspora or others could actually influence the result unduly?  Mr. Bassett is obviously suggesting the franchise expand beyond presidential elections, but it is a good example with which to kick off.  I have no difficulty with that, but I have yet to be convinced.  Where local elections are concerned, local election constituencies are such that people could actually be elected, based on citizenship, who are not even resident in the country.  The delegates have studied this.  Is the size of the population an issue in that we could allow people living outside the State to overly influence decisions at national or local government level?</p></speech>

They have destroyed my ambitions to become Uachtar&aacute;n na h&Eacute;ireann because, if the diaspora were to be included, the &euro;1 million I believed I would need to win a presidential election would become &euro;1 billion.</p> <p>  Professor Harvey has made the point that to do this we need to take the matter off the political agenda and move it beyond party political issues.  She is correct.  If this is ever to happen, it will have to be taken away from the political parties and driven by the Independents.  My colleague, Senator Billy Lawless, is pushing this agenda all the time, but the truth of the matter is that we live in a very political state.  In a nutshell, there is a great fear that if we allowed the diaspora to vote in presidential elections, for example, those political entities with the greatest representation in the United States, for example, would take every election for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, there will be natural resistance to extending the franchise beyond the island of Ireland.</p> <p>  Let us go back to the issue of Northern Ireland.  Every citizen in Northern Ireland, apart from the 100,000 expats who are British and not entitled to an Irish passport, is entitled to an Irish passport.  I very much favour the view that if one holds an Irish passport, one should be entitled to vote in the presidential election, at least.  I acknowledge Deputy Declan Breathnach's point, however, in that we have great difficulty in getting people to vote, even in local elections.  How the implementation of the proposal could change the political landscape here remains to be seen.</p> <p>  I accept the delegates' point on equal rights for citizens in the election of a President. and I do not have a difficulty with it.  I also accept the point on our being very residentially minded in our view of those who are entitled to vote.  If one is resident in the Twenty-six Counties, one can vote and if one is not, one cannot, with the exception of personnel on service overseas who have a postal vote.  Nobody else I know of overseas has the right to vote.</p> <p>  Professor Harvey mentioned European law.  If somebody were to explore it, where would he or she go with it?  On what legislation would he or she rely regarding the right to vote in any election on this island?</p> <p>  My final question is for Mr. Bassett.  I refer to the notion of electing the President through the diaspora or anyone who can claim to be Irish or is the holder of an Irish passport.  To me, it makes perfect sense, but I understand what Deputy Declan Breathnach is talking about.  I was not joking when I said that to get to the diaspora, a potential candidate would need to have substantial funds available.  Canvassing in the United States alone would cost an absolute fortune.  That will be the main point that will militate against extending the vote beyond the island of Ireland.  What European legislation is being relied on?  I would like an answer to that question.</p> <p>  Are we talking about the island of Ireland which is one problem, or are we talking about the entire diaspora?  If we are talking about the latter, do the delegates envisage election results being slanted by those with political representation outside the State?  I would like an answer to my question on the financial aspect of trying to elect somebody from among the diaspora?  Some 70 million people now claim to be Irish.  That would be a problem.</p></speech>

Someone who has exercised the right to free movement and moved to another member state no longer has the ability to vote in Irish elections because of residency rules.  His or her right to vote is not recognised in the other member state.  There is at least a possibility of an action being taken against Ireland on the grounds that there has been an unjustifiable restriction and that the exercising of free movement rights has been made less attractive because of our restrictive national law.  I would much prefer to see a change in the law for the right reasons because it is consistent with the Constitution and a good idea, rather than a change in reaction to the stigma associated, perhaps, with the decision of a court - it could be in Luxembourg or the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg - to the effect that Ireland was out of step with its contemporaries.  We have seen that Ireland is almost uniquely restrictive in its adherence to limitations of residency.  There is the potential for a successful challenge in the European Court of Justice by somebody who has suffered detriment in exercising free movement rights.</p> <p>  With regard to the diaspora, the figure of 70 million is often mentioned.  I imagine that quite a limited number of them would ever wish to exercise the right to vote in an election here.  Very many of them will not be entitled to Irish citizenship but will instead just have an ancestral fondness for this island.</p> <p>  As the options paper sets out, we can expect a high level of participation in Northern Ireland.  All of the evidence from non-resident citizens in other contexts suggests there is very often a limited take-up.  I advocate to the committee that the idea of the swamping of an election is not one that should put off the consideration of a constitutional amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Bassett" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017051800002#G00500"><p>Typically, voting rights are attached to citizenship.  As an Irish citizen, someone would be expected to participate at some level in the member state of his or her nationality.  Where he or she has exercised his or her free movement rights, he or she is excluded from voting in elections to the national Legislature.  He or she has a vote in European Parliament elections.  There is at least the possibility of a challenge to the rule on the basis that it is making the exercising of these rights less attractive.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Colin Harvey" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2017051800002#H00100"><p>To follow on and agree with what Mr. Bassett said, what we are suggesting is to in a sense pre-empt some of those challenges.  Increasingly difficult questions will be asked about the Irish system, which looks like a blanket exclusion of citizens who are resident outside the State.  In a sense, there is a direction of travel towards doing this and we want to pre-empt those challenges being questioned on human rights and European law grounds.</p> <p>  The swamping point is interesting.  If we look at the evidence we see that there are a number of steps to the process.  There is eligibility, registration and then actual voting.  If we look at comparative practice around the world and as those steps go forward, some of the scare stories and concerns that are often spread about it do not transpire in practice.  In fact, the actual turnout can be disappointing and much lower than expected.  That is not a great reason for not proceeding with it because we want people to participate.  If we look at the history of voting rights, people always said at the time that if voting or democratic inclusion was extended it would have consequences or costs but in terms of the principle of equal citizenship they are not great arguments for not taking that path.</p> <p>  The second point I would like to raise is that if we are thinking about the democratic spirit, it is not a great argument to start that discussion around profound distrust as to how voters might actually vote because there is then the work of persuading people.  I would not want to start an argument about democratic inclusion from the premise that we do not trust how voters might vote.  It does not sound very democratic to me.</p></speech>

I am all for democracy, as is everybody, but I could not help but think of the phrase "Bono for President" because they would all be out with the diaspora looking for the vote.</p> <p>  On the issue of challenging the court on the right to vote, I understand where the witnesses are coming from but surely if somebody lives in a particular jurisdiction, they have the right to vote in other countries, whether in a local election or various other ones depending on the country one lives in, and not just because of the citizenship.  In my view one cannot have dual opportunities.  That is happening in this country where people move North and South for elections, and they are registered in both locations.  That is illegal.  The Chairman is smiling at me but that is the reality, and it works in terms of North and South and South and North.  Surely we would have to have some sort of joined-up thinking within the European Union that if we allow members of a diaspora to vote, and they are living in, say, Germany, they cannot exercise the right in the two locations.  They cannot say they have two masters.</p></speech>

They are not able to vote where they want.  Second, we would like to underline that this is increasingly common practice.  We have seen the French presidential elections being facilitated in Ireland and in Britain.  It is being done.  It can be made operational and done.</p> <p>  This is a clear recommendation from the Constitutional Convention from 2013.  We are a number of years on from that so would it be fair to say that the debate on principle has been won but that many of the questions now are to do with making the principle operational?  We would like to underline that we believe the options paper that was published in March is a useful contribution to that debate.  It contains useful information on issues such as costing, for example, and comparative practice.  We are a fair way on from 2013.  We are in 2017, and the interest now is about when a referendum will be held.</p> <p>  From my perspective, although we are talking about voting rights today, it is part of a bigger picture emerging from that Constitutional Convention.  In the human rights area I work on issues that arise around social and economic rights too.  This has been recommended.  We are a long way on from 2013.  The Government has published an options paper.  Warm words have been spoken about it but we are waiting now for a date for when the referendum might be held.  That is our sense of it.</p></speech>

I take the opportunity to thank the witnesses.  It is good to have people talking about voting rights in this building other than me or Senator Billy Lawless.  Bringing more voices to the concert is important and positive.</p> <p>  The witnesses made the argument coherently and passionately as to why the issue is symbolically important but also constitutionally and politically important.  Senator Craughwell rightly acknowledged that this is a political issue.  I have made the point during a number of debates in the Seanad on this matter that when the Good Friday Agreement afforded us Irish citizenship, it was not partial or conditional.  It certainly was not second class.  There needs to be a political, societal and civic discussion about what Irish citizenship means for those of us who live in the North but also for emigrant community.</p> <p>  I wanted to raise a couple of issues but I am sure the witnesses have covered them in terms of Senator Craughwell's contribution about who would qualify for voting rights.  That was a very useful part of Senator Lawless's recent event in Buswells Hotel where he held a diaspora focused discussion.</p> <p>  I want to ask a brief question on the witnesses' opinion.  I appreciate that I am throwing this at them but we were given a briefing, as is the practice, from the Department in advance of the meeting.  I do not believe I am breaking confidentiality but under one of the headings of the Good Friday Agreement it states that it is worth nothing that while both the Irish and British Governments confirm through the Good Friday Agreement the right of the people of Northern Ireland to hold both Irish and British citizenship, it is the respective legislation in each jurisdiction that governs entitlement to citizenship.  I am not sure what that means in this instance in terms of how it impacts on us because the options paper and the position of the Government, and the position outlined in the Good Friday Agreement, is fairly clear on the rights of citizens.</p> <p>  There is a political consensus in these Houses that we have won the argument on the need for voting rights to be extended to the diaspora and to citizens in the North.  However, I share the witnesses' concerns about the mechanics of when that will happen.  While appreciating that is not a simple task, I have always made the case that there is an existent register, electoral office, electoral commission, polling stations and so on in the North.  I appreciate that when we are dealing with a community overseas it is a much more logistically complex arrangement, but I do not believe it is one that cannot be overcome.  I do not accept the need to hold a referendum, although one would be reasonably confident going into that referendum that the make-up in these Houses would reflect society.  I would share the witnesses' concern about wanting to have that date and clear statement of intent from the Government.  It has been a very worthwhile discussion.</p></speech>

The part that is relevant to us as the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is voting rights in the North, but are the witnesses also advocating for voting rights for people in, say, America and other countries where Irish citizens reside?  Is it just for presidential elections or something that should be extended to a general election also?</p> <p>  I am not sure if Deputy Breathnach's question on postal votes and proxy votes here was answered.  It can be very difficult for people here to get out to vote, particularly if they are elderly.  The rules are so strict, the reality is that many of those people lose their votes and hence they are disenfranchised.  Have the witnesses done any work on that or what is their opinion?</p></speech>

The one we would be most in favour of is the simplest and most consistent with the recommendations of the convention, which is that all citizens, regardless of their place of residence, should contribute the election of the President.  That is a first modest step.  The Constitutional Convention did not address further voting rights, but that is something one would hope would follow afterwards.</p> <p>  In regard to postal voting, it is correct that it is a very restrictive system.  Proxy voting and postal voting seem to be motivated by a desire to protect the integrity of the election.  If postal voting is to be employed for citizens outside of the State, it would be a good thing if there was a greater extension of postal voting within the State.  Other states make much greater use of postal voting.  It is not seen to undermine the integrity of those elections. </p> <p>  My principal concern with Irish electoral law does not centre on fraud.  Rather, it is exclusion.  A very large number of Irish citizens outside the State cannot contribute.  That has to be addressed through the greater availability of postal voting or some measure of posting in person in locations outside the State.</p></speech>

We need to have a conversation about the language of the Agreement, and whether all of the things we think have been legally tied down in the Good Friday Agreement are in fact legally tied down in both jurisdictions.  That is not clear to me.  In the past couple of years we have found that things we had perhaps taken for granted in terms of mutual respect and other things are not legally tied down within the UK system in the way we might have thought.  That is a matter of urgency that needs to be addressed, whatever discussions are ongoing.</p> <p>  We are very focused, in being respectful of the Constitutional Convention, on the fact that this is about presidential elections.  In a sense, we are honouring the convention by taking forward the recommendation and concentrating on it.  We are simply pointing out that Ireland would be in step with what is a clear and international trend.  We have seen it happening and it can be done.</p> <p>  There is another conversation for a separate day.  We want to advance this issue.  There is a conversation to be had about voting rights in Ireland in general, including who does or does not get to vote, and who is excluded or included.  There has been a discussion around the electoral commission and other things.  This is one part of a bigger conversation.  We want to focus on advancing this matter now.  There is a bigger conversation to be had about voting rights in Ireland.</p></speech>

I agree that it is a reasonable constitutional step to take.  I have two brothers who live in San Francisco, and they may as well be living in Ireland because they are involved with the GAA and listen to Irish radio stations.  They would love to be able to vote.  I worked with a man from Boston who was able to vote in the American presidential election.  A change in the voting laws would be most welcome.</p> <p>  In terms of the work the witnesses have done, have they found any negative impact or effects?  If so, what would they be?  Do they have any question marks about anything?  What are they concerned about?</p></speech>

It strikes me as extremely surprising that somebody living on the island can hold an Irish passport but not have a vote.  That is something that perhaps needs pretty rapid investigation.  Without extending the vote to the wider diaspora, if a person on the island of Ireland carries a passport he or she should be entitled to vote in at least a presidential election, irrespective of the issue of distrust that was raised.  We cannot second-guess what an electorate would do or how any citizen in the North of Ireland, irrespective of his or her colour, would vote.  Nothing is certain in that regard.</p> <p>  I am inclined to agree with my colleague.  I am not sure a referendum would be needed to extend the vote across the Border.  I am not legally qualified, unlike Mr. Basset.  Perhaps he would have a view on that.</p></speech>

That would have to change.  The key point of any constitutional referendum would be to extend the franchise to all citizens, not just those resident in the State, registered as D&aacute;il electors.  It would involve breaking the connection between voting in a presidential election and being registered as a D&aacute;il elector.  As well as a constitutional amendment, legislative changes would be required to various provisions of the Electoral Acts, which is set out in some detail in the options paper.  There would have to be a constitutional referendum.</p></speech>

I have no difficulty in extending the franchise for presidential elections.  However, we still have not grasped the issue of directly elected mayors in local authorities from a 26 county perspective because personality politics are involved.  I do not mind saying we could end up with somebody who has a very high profile, such as Bono, being elected.  That could happen if we extended voting rights to a large number of people who ultimately might vote and high quality personalities were looking to be elected to positions for reasons to do with their profile.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that the Presidency was not an overly important job.  I certainly view it as a very important job.  I said that one could not be a master to two individuals.  We all talk about one man, one vote.  The witnesses have expertise in this area.  We have moved into a discussion involving other elections, but perhaps we should have stuck with the presidential election.</p> <p>  A French citizen who is entitled to vote in French elections may have the opportunity to vote in various other countries, such as Belgium.  How can we ensure that such a person, who has voted in a French election, does not then vote in a Belgian election?  Such a person is exercising a franchise I do not believe he or she should be entitled to. </p> <p>  For example, I do not believe I have an entitlement to vote in England because I am not a resident there.  We need to tease out the issues.  Every citizen is entitled to one vote in one particular element of the election.  Verification is a major issue.</p><p>That is why I said people were constantly crossing the Border in both directions and voting and exercising two franchises, which is illegal.  Will Professor Harvey comment on this?</p></speech>

It is symbolically and practically important and we will not say anything to the contrary.  In a sense, we are involved in thinking and arguing about voting rights because of the importance of the presidency.</p> <p>  The Senator has asked a question about the things that have been identified as issues.  When it moves to operationalising and making it real in practice, issues emerge in trying to ensure it happens at the level of practicality and organisation.  This is widely and successfully done in many states around the world with regard to both registration and making it happen.  We have seen it happen recently on this island in the case of the election in France.  It has, therefore, been happening and can happen.  Many of the questions being raised arise in any electoral process, including ensuring we verify what is happening in order that everything is done appropriately and properly.  It is an area of practicality that will need to be looked at, but there are ways of dealing with it.  In the context of the presidential election, it will be a democratic experiment for Ireland.  One thing that can be done is keeping it under review to see what lessons have been learned and refine it over time.  We should not rule out a process of democratic inclusion because it may cause difficulties.  Otherwise, we might not have elections.  There are always issues, but there are processes in place to try to ensure the integrity of the process.  There are ways that are better than others for ensuring that happens.  It should not present us with an obstacle in taking forward a fundamental issue of principle on which the constitutional convention is very clear.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051800002#B00100"><p>I thank the Acting Chairman.  I have circulated some slides and if it is okay, I will take approximately ten minutes to give the committee an overview of our perception of the scale of the challenge of compliance with the EU directive on urban wastewater treatment and the issues in respect of the case before the European Court of Justice and how we are going about dealing with the problem.</p> <p>  Slide three shows that we have more than 1,000 wastewater treatment plants across the country.  Some 173 schemes cover areas with a population of 2,000 or more, which qualify under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 91/271 EEC.  The 38 locations notified in the case represent a sample from the 173 schemes for more than 2,000 population.  This is a significant decrease in the number of cases in recent years as investment has proceeded.  This year we expect the number to decrease further, as the schemes have been upgraded in Clonakilty, Clifden and Carrigtouhill.  Work on the Carrigaline scheme was recently commissioned and we propose that work will be commissioned on Youghal later this.  There is a lot happening to schemes on this list.  However, there are other schemes that will take longer.</p> <p>  I will set out the reasons that these schemes are non-compliant.  The effluent standards in Ringsend in Dublin, which is clearly the most significant of all the schemes with almost 2 million population equivalent is an overloading problem in addition to phosphorous and nitrate levels.</p> <p>  There is no treatment whatsoever in Arklow, where there is discharge of raw sewage into the Avoca River.  Work on that scheme has been significantly delayed over the years by the statutory process and court challenges.  We have had to start from scratch again.  A new site has been selected and that will go An Bord Plean&aacute;la later on this year.  In Youghal, there is a problem with the bathing water as a result of the lack of treatment of sewage.</p> <p>  There are significant high quality receiving waters, such as the Broadmeadow Estuary, to which effluent from Swords is discharged.  We need to have higher standards in those schemes.</p> <p>  All these issues are reflected in the European Court of Justice's argument that has been put forward along with overflows from the networks, which are a much larger problem in the long term for this country to tackle.</p> <p>  In the next slide we set out a number of things we are doing to combat the problem.  Irish Water is investing very substantial amounts in new plants and upgrading existing plants.  We are also putting a lot of effort into optimising existing plants, improving operations and doing small scale investments that bring them into compliance.  This is satisfactory in many cases.  We are also looking at source control, because many of our plants are significantly affected by industrial, commercial and trade discharges which can overload the plant and cause it to fail.  These three distinct work streams are contributing to solving the problem.  Very often high profile incidents arise from emergency overflows and spills when pumps break down and so on.  There is a great deal of work going into assessing critical assets from a risk point of view and trying to put in more secure storage and so on, so that it does not lead to fish kills.  Members will have noticed that fish kills often featured in prosecutions.</p> <p>  Slide five will give members some sense of the scale of what is being done in the short term.  Given the scale of the wastewater challenge, it is important that in the first full investment cycle by Irish Water from 2017-2021 to prioritise in particular the ECJ cases and also those 44 plants with no treatment facilities.  Under our minor upgrades programme we will spend &euro;320 million and the one off larger plants will cost more than &euro;1.2 billion, which is more &euro;1.55 billion in the period.  We would expect to be very close to completion of all works on those 38 sites by that date.  That is something we will be conveying through the Department to the European Commission.  Equally, we think we will get the vast majority of those untreated sites dealt with in that period.</p> <p>  The ongoing European Court of Justice case is quite complex because there are three drivers of non-compliance.  There were in some cases data issues as the European Union Commission was not satisfied that it had the necessary evidence to show that there was compliance.  There are some situations where we may be able to get schemes addressed through more evidence of the quality of treatment and the receiving water.  Cork city is an example where we believe there is evidence that it may not be necessary, for example, to spend a significant amount of money taking out nitrogen and phosphorous.  We must provide that evidence to the EPA in the context of a licence review and that would allow that issue to be dealt with, if that evidence is accepted.  It is important that when we spend money, we spend it on the back of solid evidence that it will produce an environment dividend and not simply because there is misinformation or misunderstanding.</p> <p>  As I said, on the area of networks there is a long-term challenge because many of our urban networks leak in and out and spill when it rains.  The spills in places such as Athlone, Thurles and Roscrea are the cause of the breaches that we have to address.  They are very complex to deal with because one has to go back and survey the networks to find out the information.  It can be quite difficult to come up with solutions.  There is a problem with the overloaded plants and the plants that were never designed in the first place to meet the standards.  </p> <p>  Slide eight shows the distribution of all plants across the country and the places indicated with a brown dot are the treatment plants in this category.  In slide nine, one can see the locations that are impacted by the network issues, the basic treatment issues or the nutrient issues.  One can see that some of the locations are marked with little green dots, and that is to signify that we think we have done the work there but we have to produce the evidence, the commissioning reports and so on to demonstrate that they are complying.</p> <p>  In slide ten, we have set out that we have spent &euro;179 million on wastewater treatment in the years 2014 to 2016.  That will be significantly ramped up in the remaining period.  It is fair to say that we invested more money into drinking water in the early years.  There was also a factor that these major capital wastewater schemes take a great deal of time to bring through the planning process.  Arklow is a very good example of this.  When one has to go back to square one, the first thing is that one has to go through a very elaborate site selection process because at the end of the day, one's application will not succeed in An Bord Plean&aacute;la unless one has gone through a very rigorous and transparent process around the picking of the site, the environmental studies and so on.  One is talking about a very significant lead in time, if there are no plans ready to go to site.  That is reflected in the fact that the balance will tilt back to wastewater treatment in the next number of years.  At the bottom of the slide one will see a visual representation that we expect to be very close to a full resolution of these issues by 2021.  One can also see the sequence over the period since 2012, when this issue first came to light as a pilot case.  It has moved on in Europe to a reasoned opinion and it looks like that it will go to the European Court of Justice pretty quickly.  We would expect we will be given a period of time by the court to fix the problem.  Obviously, the challenge is to ensure that we comply and deliver on the plan within that period of time.</p> <p>  The four remaining slides illustrate what is going on.  In the case of the Ringsend wastewater treatment plant upgrade project Irish Water will have to spend approximately &euro;360 million to completely refurbish the Ringsend plant to bring the capacity from 1.6 million population equivalent up to 2.4 population equivalent and to meet the nitrogen and phosphorous standards.  It is a really massive project within an existing site.  The State has already invested &euro;250 million in that site.  In the Ringsend plant, we are using a new technology that we identified in Holland, which has been proven on the site in pilot studies and that has saved us about &euro;150 million because we intend to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to omit a major tunnel that was intended to be put in beneath the bay.  I hope that scheme will be fully approved and we will get it fully delivered.  We are at the tender stage for a major part of the scheme, which will bring the basic treatment capacity up to 2.4 million population equivalent for &euro;160 million.</p> <p>  The Cork Lower Harbour was an area that had been neglected to a large extent.  The Cork Lower Harbour towns all discharged relatively untreated sewage into the lower harbour.  The wastewater treatment scheme is being delivered at a cost of &euro;117 million.  The first phase has addressed Crosshaven and Carrigaline and the treatment plant is working.  We are now on-site to collect in Passage West, Monkstown and Ringaskiddy.  It is a very complex sewerage network project.  The last leg will be to bring the waste from Cobh across the estuary and into the treatment plant.  It will probably be 2020 by the time that scheme will be fully completed.</p> <p>  Ultimately, we will invest &euro;52 million in the Arklow sewerage scheme, because it needs a whole network to collect from the various outfalls to the Avoca River and it needs a substantial new treatment plant.</p> <p>  Irish Water inherited Gweedore as a problem to be addressed in terms of urban wastewater, but it is in fact a very densely populated rural area, with 600 to 700 houses.  A traditional scheme would cost in the region of &euro;35 million to &euro;50 million, which is clearly unaffordable and would be very difficult to operate.  In that case we have come up with an option based on what we have seen in Denmark and New Zealand, which involves putting small pump systems on every septic tank and having small bore pipelines to connect the system up to a treatment plant.  We are doing a pilot project in Gweedore in the next five or six months.  We have been talking to the local community and getting very good support for the scheme.  That demonstrates that in some cases, it needs quite novel and innovative solutions in order to come up with cost effective ways of addressing these problems.</p> <p>  To summarise, Irish Water is committed to delivering on the plans we have set out to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and to the Commission on Energy Regulation, CER, for the resolution of all these cases together with all the other issues involved.  We make the point that there are significant other issues out there, in  particular in the networks, that will come to light over time and will have to be address in future cycles of investment.</p> <p>  The plans are in place.  There are always issues and risks around statutory process, we intend to deliver that programme.  I thank the Acting Chairman and members.</p></speech>

Our primary role in this regard is to protect the interests of customers of Irish Water.  There are a number of routes by which we do that, but of primary relevance to today's hearing is that we approve Irish Water's proposed water charges plan.  In that regard, we set Irish Water's revenue, both its capital and operational expenditure, basically, the amount Irish Water is allowed to receive or earn for the services that it delivers.  In addition, we also approve Irish Water's codes of practice on how it deals with all the users of its system.  Finally, of relevance today, perhaps, we also co-operate with the Environmental Protection Agency.  In fact, we have a memorandum of understanding in place which sets out our respective regulatory roles from both an environmental and an economic perspective.</p> <p>  Turning to slide 3 of our presentation, we have carried out two revenue controls in respect of Irish Water to date covering two two-year periods.  We are in the middle of the second two-year period, which ends at the end of 2018.  We review Irish Water's capital investment plan and we look at a number of issues, including its approach to how it balances and prioritises projects, essentially, the order in which the projects will get delivered.  We also look at how it manages and governs its projects and at the costing of its submissions.  We do an audit of some of its projects to determine that it has, in fact, identified an appropriate solution and that it is appropriately costed in terms of what it will deliver.  On that basis, we determine an allowed revenue that Irish Water is permitted to earn for a set of defined targets and outcomes during the same period.  This amount of money that we allow it also incorporates an efficiency challenge, both in terms of its operating expenditure and capital expenditure.</p> <p>  I turn to slide 4, specifically of relevance to the infringement.  The CER allowed a total capital expenditure for 2017-2018 of &euro;1.152 billion to Irish Water.  We noted that, as part of its capital planning process, it had identified all the agglomerations that are the subject of this case as being mandatory.  It knew it had to do these.  Based on the evidence we received, 29 of those were still requiring work at the end of 2016.  Based on the submission from Irish Water in terms of its costings, it has allowed &euro;243 million in 2017 and 2018 as part of an overall &euro;1 billion programme to address the issues in relation to wastewater treatment.</p> <p>  As part of our overall function, we will continue to monitor Irish Water's delivery of this capital programme against its targeted outcomes over the two-year period and beyond.  That is all I propose to say at this stage but, obviously, I would be happy to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. Dara Lynott, deputy director general of the EPA, and Mr. Noel Byrne, senior manager in the wastewater enforcement area.</p> <p>  The EPA has been the regulator for wastewater treatment since October 2007.  Initially, we supervised the 34 local authorities.  Since Irish Water came in in 2014, we have been its environmental regulator for both wastewater and drinking water.  On wastewater, we have assessed and licensed 1,047 sites and there are a further 21 currently at assessment stage.  In our role as environmental regulator, we work closely with our colleagues in CER and we have a memorandum of understanding with CER in that regard.</p> <p>  I distributed some copies of the presentation to the members.  Our role involves the monitoring and supervision of urban wastewater services, as I stated, for 1,000 villages, towns and cities.  These are called agglomerations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.</p> <p>  Our regulatory system comes from the 1991 Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and the 2000 Water Framework Directive, so it has been in place for quite a while.  The objectives include the appropriate treatment, such as second-level treatment for most wastewater treatment plants and more stringent treatment for environmentally sensitive areas.  Generally, these are coastal estuarine areas that require higher levels of treatment.</p> <p>  Where the EPA detects significant non-compliance with the regulations or conditions on licences, it takes enforcement action in line with its policy.  This can include court actions.  We have taken 13 such cases since we became regulator.</p> <p>  On public reporting, we publish an annual report each year.  In our most recent report published in the autumn of last year, we again called for appropriate capital investment in wastewater treatment.  That is primarily the issue here, that sufficient money is made available.  Very significant sustained funding is required to improve the wastewater systems if these pollution and health risks are to be avoided in the future.  In 2015, the latest year for which we have a full set of reporting data, 142 large towns and cities complied with the EU's wastewater treatment standards, while 29 failed.  The preliminary data we have for 2016 shows there is no significant improvement in this rate of compliance.</p> <p>  While new sewage treatment plants have been built in many areas, for example, at Ardmore, Dunmore East and Ballylongford, as the committee heard in the earlier presentation, raw sewage continues to be discharged from 45 different areas across the country.  The planned delivery of treatment plants at half of these areas has now been delayed by more than two years.</p> <p>  In comparison to the European averages, our national treatment performance has improved a lot over the past decade and a half.  However, we still perform poorly, when compared to other European countries in terms of the 26 year old directive which brought in strict deadlines for the upgrade of treatment, and these are now between 12 and 19 years behind these deadlines.  The overall compliance with the basic standards was 51% in Ireland in 2015 while the EU average was 92%.  As one can see, significant improvement is required.  Most of this non-compliance is down to Dublin city's Ringsend treatment plant.  There are plans to upgrade the plant and that would bring us nearer to the European average.  For sensitive areas, it is worse again, with Ireland at 25%.  In comparison, the EU average is 88%.  One will see those figures on slide 6 in the pack.</p> <p>  In terms of the present ECJ case, there are 38 sites listed by the European Commission.  Of these, the EPA considers that 27 agglomerations remain to be resolved.  The other agglomerations have largely been addressed, either by the local authorities or by Irish Water since it has taken over.  There is one further situation, which Mr. Grant mentioned, which is Gweedore.  This is currently not regulated by the EPA.  Our assessment of the case is that most of the outstanding 38 sites can be resolved by 2021, given the application of sufficient funding and resources across that period of time.  Our latest information from Irish Water is that there will be three sites remaining beyond 2021, at Cork city, Thurles and Roscrea.</p> <p>  In terms of the EU list, however, I would highlight to the committee that there are wider problems beyond these 38 sites and the 27 that remain to be resolved.  One will see on slide 8 that there are 100 further sites listed on the EPA's national priority list, that is, 127 sites overall that the EPA is prioritising.  The list highlights significant issues to be addressed to avoid environmental risks, such as the raw sewage, which I mentioned, discharges near bathing water which the committee would have heard about this morning in the latest bathing water report, and areas threatening shellfish areas or pollution of rivers.  The assessment of collection systems is also continuing and we anticipate a significant bit of work will arise out of that assessment, as we learn more about the networks and the impact of discharges from combined sewer overflows.  </p> <p>  In short, the pace of resolving wastewater needs to improve.  The EPA analysis has found that better operational practices could resolve approximately one fifth of the problems.  However, it is simply the case that most of the existing infrastructure is not capable of meeting the standards required.  In order to meet these standards, we need increased capital investment, improved efficiencies and the delivery of outstanding infrastructure needed to protect rivers, lakes and coastal waters.  I thank the committee.</p></speech>

This meeting stems from a previous appearance by representatives of the Environmental Protection Committee at the Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services on 15 February, the day on which the European Commission announced it was initiating a court action.  This issue has been ongoing for a long time with little Oireachtas scrutiny of the underlying causes and progress or otherwise in addressing them.  Members considered it important, therefore, to bring all the relevant stakeholders before the joint committee to scrutinise and highlight this issue and add to the pressure the EPA is exerting as it seeks to have these issues addressed.</p> <p>  I am disappointed that officials from the Department are not in attendance.  The original request from members sought to have officials attend this meeting alongside representatives of the relevant organisations.  The Department has key responsibilities in this area.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1215" speakername="Eoin &Oacute; Broin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051800002#D00300"><p>When I requested this meeting I asked that officials be invited to attend.  It is regrettable that officials are not in attendance.  They should be present at the next meeting we have on this issue because it is vital that the Department is part of this conversation.</p> <p>  One of the frustrating aspects of this issue is that, as Mr. Flynn stated, it is 26 years in the making and is clearly not a new problem.  The directive was issued in 1991 and the compliance date for the relevant agglomerations was 2000.  My understanding is that this is not the first enforcement action.  I have some questions about previous enforcement actions, on which I will seek an update.  Will the Environmental Protection Agency outline how the enforcement procedure operates?  It commenced in 2013 when notices were issued, after which warnings were issued in 2014 and 2015, with court actions ensuing subsequently.  I understand the European Commission does not come in with a sledgehammer threatening court action and fines but seeks to work with the member state in question to try to resolve problems that have arisen.  If it is the case that the Commission seeks to work with member states to resolve problems, why is it taking Ireland to court?  Notwithstanding Mr. Grant's views on progress, the Commission's view is that progress has been too slow or is not being made in the correct manner.  I am interested in hearing the EPA's view on the reasons for this. </p> <p>  I am very concerned by the graphs presented by the EPA, both in terms of the level of non-compliance and the number of priority sites.  The 127 priority sites identified by the EPA include the 38 sites on which legal action may be taken and fines imposed.  If the focus is on the 38 sites, will some of the other sites fall behind by the time the 38 sites have been addressed and will we end up in difficulty with some of the remaining sites because they have not all been addressed at the same time?  What is the EPA's view on that?</p> <p>  I am also interested in the EPA's warnings to the Department and Irish Water.  I understand the EPA produces an annual report in which it publishes data on the sites.  What level of engagement did it have with the Department and Irish Water in terms of flagging these issues before enforcement commenced in 2013 and subsequently?  Members of the public have a right to know how often the EPA has been raising the alarm in this area with the Department and Irish Water. </p> <p>  I note media commentary indicating there is a disagreement over funding levels for both the 38 agglomerations and the remaining 89 locations on the priority list.  Is funding increasing annually, in other words, was more money spent last year than in the preceding years?  How is funding tracked?  This is an important measure on which I ask both the EPA and Irish Water to provide details.</p> <p>  My next question is a difficult one.  The Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services focused considerable attention on fines arising from breaches to the water framework directive.  Infringement proceedings have not commenced under that directive.  How seriously should we take the issue of fines?  Are the witnesses aware of similar cases in other member states that would give members an idea of the level of fines member states may face for significant levels of non-compliance?</p> <p>  In September 2008, the European Court of Justice issued judgment C-3I6/06 in an earlier enforcement action taken following breaches of the urban waste water directive.  Will the EPA provide an update on the judgment?  I understand it related to a set of agglomerations or sites different from the 38 sites at which breaches have been identified?  If so, have the problems at these sites been resolved or do they remain?</p> <p>  On the national inspection plan, the EPA provided a series of detailed inspection reports.  One of the figures that caught my eye was the number of non-compliant inspections, of which there were 489 in total.  Will the EPA explain the significance of this figure and how it relates to the list of 127 priority sites and 38 agglomerations?</p> <p>  Mr. Grant's statement that some of the non-compliance is related to data rather than actual problems in treatment plants is worrying.  One would expect data to be the easiest issue to sort out and Irish Water would be able to notify the Commission of such problems at an early stage.  Why were data issues not resolved by the time the Commission got fed up and decided to take Ireland to the European Court of Justice?  Is it a complicated issue or is it straightforward?  How does Mr. Grant explain it?</p> <p>  In terms of cost, the European Commission, in an environmental implementation report, estimated the cost of tackling the problem in the 38 agglomerations at approximately &euro;443 million.  More recent figures from Irish Water provided by the Minister put the cost at &euro;1 billion.  The figures from the Commission and Irish Water were given about one year apart.  Will Mr. Grant explain the difference between them?</p> <p>  We raised the Shannon to Dublin pipeline previously with Mr. Grant.  If and when the project proceeds, it will deliver a significant increase in the treated water coming into the Dublin water region and, therefore, a significant increase in the amount of sewage being produced.  In the context of significant levels of non-compliance to date, will Mr. Grant provide an assessment as to how or why any of us should be reassured that even more compliance problems will not arise given that the level of water and sewage discharge will increase significantly in the Dublin region?  This is not an argument against water being piped to Dublin from the River Shannon.  What assurance can Mr. Grant provide in this regard?</p> <p>  A graph in the Irish Water document projects a significant decline, from approximately 30 to roughly five, in the number of agglomerations with problems between 2020 and 2021.  Compliance in earlier years is projected to improve at a much slower pace.  What is the reason for the projected dramatic improvement in compliance?  Is this a deliverable target?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1506" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051800002#D00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for coming before the joint committee.  They set out their stall very well.  It is clear we have an infrastructure deficit and it will cost &euro;1 billion to remedy the problems.  I will focus for a few moments on the Ringsend treatment plant.  It has been known for a long time that capacity issues would arise as economic development progressed throughout the country but specifically in Dublin.  During my time as a member of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Mr. Grant made presentations to councillors on capacity in which he stated that planners had to stop granting planning permission.  This was a profound statement, particularly during a housing crisis.  While I am in favour of economic development, the plant in Shanganagh cannot even pump out waste.</p> <p>  We are hearing stories about capacity in the Ringsend treatment plant, including about solids occurring in the attenuation tanks and water being released, albeit on a tidal basis.  We heard on "Morning Ireland" today about conditions on Merrion Strand.  We know where the problem lies given that the beach is right beside the Ringsend plant.</p> <p>  We are discussing a serious case being brought before the European Court of Justice for breaches to the urban waste water directive.  In simple terms, the case relates to the failure to ensure that urban waste water at 38 locations across the country is adequately collected and treated to prevent serious risk to human health and the environment.  That is the essence of the case.  In setting out their stall, the witnesses made clear that significant investment is being made in this area.</p><p>Ringsend has a projected budget of &euro;363 million, of which costs of approximately &euro;51 million has so far been incurred.  There is a huge amount of money to be spent there.  How will it be funded?  Is funding holding back the roll-out?  I know there are some planning issues, they are complex, they too must be addressed and they are stringent and strict.  I am fully aware of all of that but are necessary funding and resources preventing a speeding up of the process of addressing all the problems Mr. Grant outlined?  That is the kernel of it all.<br/><br/>I echo what my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Broin, said about the Department.  It would be important to have the Department before the committee for some future debate and hear what it has to say.  I would like to hear more about how the witnesses engage with the Department and <i>vice versa</i>, that is, how the Department responds to them.  That is very important if we are to analyse forensically what is happening and what constraints are being put on the witnesses.  I would like an honest exchange with them.  What is the big issue?  All of this can be addressed.  Is it simply down to the money?  Is it simply down to specific planning issues in some of the specific issues which have been referred to?  Mr. Flynn has told us that our rate of compliance with basic standards is 51%.  That is a disgrace.  It is factual and it is not a criticism of Mr. Flynn but it is a disgrace and it clearly needs to be addressed.  I will keep it simple.  Can Mr. Flynn explain what the constraints and frustrations and other things are that are holding the EPA back on delivering on what he has clearly identified as major problems?  How can we get on track again regarding compliance with the directive?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1385" speakername="Grace O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051800002#E00200"><p>I echo the points made by both of my colleagues on the lack of a Government representative from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government at today's meeting.  In the end, the buck of compliance stops with the Government.  As the Government is ultimately responsible, it is a bit of a failure that someone from the Department did not attend today.</p> <p>  In general, when do the witnesses expect a judgment in the current action being taken against Ireland?  If the court finds against Ireland, which seems inevitable, how long do they anticipate Ireland will have to comply based on other, similar cases?</p> <p>  I note that Irish Water's presentation proposes full compliance by 2024.  The Irish Water 25-year water services strategic plan proposed 99% compliance by 2027 and 100% compliance by 2040.  Does Irish Water have a better idea now of what exactly is needed, and is the 2024 projection of 100% compliance accurate?  Senator Boyhan referred to the Irish Water funds.  Are they guaranteed?  Does Irish Water have sufficient funds to achieve its targets and objectives?  If not, how much extra do Mr. Grant and Ms Higgins think is required to meet the Water Framework Directive deadline by 2021?  It seems that we are, at best, 24 years late, which is shocking.  There must be a sense of urgency regarding compliance.</p> <p>  How soon do the witnesses envisage daily fines?  It is important to point out that the urban wastewater treatment directive is an old directive and is essentially the bare minimum to prevent the worst of sewage pollution.  The Water Framework Directive requires discharge standards that will bring us to a modern level of safe, healthy, clean water, and according to the water services strategy plan, only 60% of discharges will be compliant by 2021.</p> <p>  I echo the comments of my two colleagues.  There really is a sense of urgency that Ireland comply for multiple reasons - environmental, health and economic in terms of the cost of fines, so I hope we can move as fast as possible to ensure better standards.</p></speech>

The Department was not invited to today's meeting, and that is why it is not here.  However, there are some members of the Department in the Public Gallery taking notes of today's meeting.  At the private meeting next week we will ensure we invite them to the meeting the next time.</p> <p>  I will call the witnesses in the order in which the presentations were made, starting with Mr. Grant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1510" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerry Grant" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22017051800002#E00400"><p>I will try to make sure I capture the various points that were raised, starting with those of Deputy &Oacute; Broin.  He raised the number of sites defined by the EPA as priority sites.  This is the bigger canvas we must address.  All these sites are within the work programme.  Not all of them will be delivered in this period but much other work will be delivered along with the 38 ECJ cases.  For every one of those projects, we now have a plan and a programme, but some of them extend quite some time.  I acknowledge what David Flynn said, that some of them have been delayed in the programme information to the EPA because when we inherited all of these projects, many of them had to be rescoped, many had to go through statutory process, and what we have tried to do is put realistic and deliverable dates on them.  There are plenty of trips and falls along the way that can happen and we try to notify the EPA of any of these - for example, statutory or court objections - so that we keep the dates realistic.  I think we are getting better at that.  We probably were not very good at it to begin with.  Some of these sites are being tackled.  Mr. Flynn also mentioned, very fairly, that there are plants that fail for operational reasons, and we are working our way through those cases.  We send in a process team, we have a minor capital programme that goes in behind it and we have brought a number of plants into compliance.  Shannon town is not necessarily compliant but it has improved significantly through controlling industrial discharges and upgrading the plant, and we have much more work to do there.  Birr needed a big upgrade.  We have been able to get it compliant again by examining the discharge coming in and carrying out a &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 upgrade of the plant, so there is much happening at that level as well.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin talked about data.  This is very interesting because many of these schemes did not have working flow measurement or sampling equipment, which is the prerequisite for data.  One of our current programmes is to retrofit across our plants flow measurement and sampling equipment and then to collect data.  Of course, a decent interval of data is needed.  One needs a 12-month period of data to have any meaningful information.  This is all in hand and we are improving and investing in the information systems that will track all this information.  We are modelling this on the EPA's systems so that we can become better at communicating in a systematic way in delivering data.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Broin asked the very interesting question what we need to do if we bring the Shannon pipeline to Dublin and so on if we have more capacity.  It is a much bigger question, but to deal very quickly with it, we will need to spend, between water and sewerage for the greater Dublin area, about &euro;2.5 billion in order to secure the region for the long term - say, the 20-year horizon.  On the wastewater side, the priority in the very short term is to increase Ringsend's capacity by 50%, or from 1.6 million population equivalent to 2.4 million, and make it compliant at the same time with the higher standards.  However, that is not enough.  We also must increase the capacity of a number of sewers.  For example, the Blanchardstown sewer must be duplicated - a very big scheme of almost &euro;50 million - so that we can get the sewage into Ringsend.  At the same time, the committee may be aware that we are planning a later scheme to follow, hopefully to be in place by the mid-2020s, namely, the greater Dublin drainage project.  This involves a new treatment plant in north County Dublin, at Clonshaugh, and an outfall to the Irish Sea.  This scheme will probably go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in 2018.  It is another very significant investment and is designed to pick up from the situation whereby Ringsend will be limited to as much as it can deal with in the long term.  There are medium-term and longer-term plans and they must all fall into line in a proper sequence.</p> <p>  The big improvement in the latter end of the current investment plan largely arises from the fact that many of the schemes had to go through both rescoping and redefinition and then planning.  Arklow is one example where we had to go back to square one, but many of these schemes had to be rescoped and then taken through the tender process so that many of them will be on site.  This is why the wastewater spend in particular will rise significantly in the immediate years to come, from 2018 into 2019 and 2020.</p><p>There will be a significant bulge at that point.</p><p> Picking up on Senator Boyhan's questions about the deficit, the point here is that we are only talking today about a subset of a much bigger problem because when we did the water services strategic plan, WSSP,  we estimated the total deficit across the infrastructure, water and wastewater, to be approximately &euro;13 billion.  We will review that as we do reviews of WSSP every five years and that will take account of the river basin management plans, which will undoubtedly drive further investment needs.</p><p> Senator Boyhan referred to the Ringsend plant and the scale of the work required.  That plant is currently trying to manage an overload of approximately 25%, which obviously puts pressure on it.  We have spent approximately &euro;50 million on this already and we have made significant improvements in the process, which are helping.  The next stage of expansion will be to build the new capacity.  That will get us into a much better position from the point of view of capacity and will also get us very close to compliance, but we will then have a number of years of retrofit work in the older part of the plant to fully complete the job.  We hope to be compliant before that, but we need to complete all the work so that we have a sustainable scheme.  I referred to the greater Dublin drainage to follow.  Ringsend cannot be the long-term enduring solution for Dublin, growing as it is expected to grow, and therefore the further greater Dublin drainage scheme is an important part of the longer term infrastructure.</p><p> The Senator referred to Shanganagh, but Shanganagh as a wastewater treatment plant is very comfortable on capacity.  It has a lot of spare capacity to deal with the whole Carrickmines area and I am very comfortable with both the performance and the capacity of that plant .  The Senator also mentioned Merrion Strand.  This really illustrates how complex these issues are, because there is no evidence that the Ringsend discharge is actually having any impact on beaches in Dublin Bay.  In fact, Dollymount is safe.  What is hurting Merrion Strand and many other places - I notice Clifden, for example, failed today even though there is a new treatment plant - is the fact that there are storm water discharges that are pollutives.  For example, the Elm Park stream, which comes into the sea there, is picking up an awful lot of pollution which is then discharged on to the strand when it rains.  That is what is causing the problem.  When one starts digging into that, of course, it is a much bigger, longer term problem.</p><p> With regard to funding, we have set out a business plan up to 2021 and we have Government support for that.  The money has been committed and I expect that it will come through because the commitment has been given.  We are working on the basis that money will be available.  People sometimes ask if one had an extra billion or two if one could spend it next year or the year after.  The reality is that we should really should have three or four years sight of additional funding, and it will be critically important that in the next cycle, beyond 2021, that the necessary level of funding is committed.  It really is down to sustained funding.  That is crucial.  There may be other one-off costs, like the Shannon pipeline, for example, which would come in as a significant one-off generational investment that may have to be specifically dealt with.</p><p> We engage on a continuous basis with the Department but it expects us to deliver the programme.  There is a clarity now about the way these projects are carried out that is a big improvement on what it was, because we have the responsibility to deliver the work, our regulators have oversight of us and the Department's job is to provide the policy.  However, the Department also, of course, provides the interface with the European Commission.  We simply provide information to the Department and it, in turn, provides it to the Commission, so there is continuing engagement.  The Department asks us to account for how we are performing on the various programmes because it does not want give false information to the Commission either.</p><p> To address Senator Grace O'Sullivan's questions, which are linked to those, I can give the Senator no indication of the timelines of the judgment or, indeed, of fines.  I have no information on that at all.  What I can say is that I believe that the Commission has to be convinced that we have credible plans.  It has to see evidence that we are delivering on those plans within the timeframes that we say.  When this matter goes to court and the court makes a decision, it will be critical at that point that we can show the court that we have a plan and that we will look for a period of time.  The courts in general are reasonable if they consider the plans coherent and fully-funded, and that they are being delivered.  That is as much as I can say on that.</p><p> Senator Grace O'Sullivan referred to various compliance targets in the WSSP and compared them with what we outlined today in respect of this particular case.  We are relating there to the broader compliance challenge across all of these sites.  This has to do with the river basin management plans and more particularly to the licences we have been given for all the plans, which are consistent, not with the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, necessarily, but with the broader range of requirements from the river basin plans.  One can have all the numbers in the world talking about this, but sometimes one is comparing apples and oranges.  </p><p> I have covered the question of funds.  The joint committee has obviously done its work on that, and there should hopefully be a lot of security there for citizens.  There is a basis there for committing funds.  This is really a question of consistent funding at the right levels over the long term, which is really three or four investment cycles.</p></speech>

One of the things we do as part of our scrutiny of Irish Water is that when it puts forward its proposal for its investment programme, we ensure the efficiencies can also be achieved while delivering the outputs.  That frees up additional moneys, whether it is for operational or capital investment.  That is part of our function.  In addition to that, we have a performance assessment framework which we have now published.  We will now be working with Irish Water to gather the data so that there is visibility around Irish Water's ability to deliver against a series of ten performance metrics.  Similar to what happened in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, that will demonstrate whether and how Irish Water is delivering against its obligations.  The final thing to point out is that, from our assessment, Irish Water has a very significant capital investment programme in comparison to other utilities.  It is carrying out a huge capital expenditure investment programme in comparison to the English and Welsh utilities, and it is probably worth noting that in the overall context here.</p></speech>

The relationship around infringements is directly with the member state and the Department deals directly with those.  This is carried out through correspondence, package meetings and so forth.  The EPA then comes in to support with the evidence and its regulatory role on it.  It has to be said that the 2007 legislation that was brought in to license all these wastewater treatment plants was itself also a result of an infringement.  At that point the negotiations included a period of time by which all the wastewater treatment plants would be licensed.  That was completed in late 2016.  From that were set out the timeframes within which the upgrades had to happen and what we are hearing about today are the delays in meeting those timeframes.</p> <p>  Like in every court case, it obviously has to come to court, it has to be argued, it has to be decided on and then, depending on guilt or innocence, fines have to be dealt with.  Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked a question about fines and timeframes.  We do not know but obviously we will put forward all the evidence we have collected through our annual reports as part of any submission that goes through to the member state.  Regarding our experience of fines, I was involved with the septic tank regulation and that resulted in fines of about &euro;15,000 a day.  These continued until the Commission was satisfied that the appropriate legislation had been put in place and that it included national inspection plans.  To reiterate what other speakers have said, there is a need to get proof that there are valid and sustainable plans of action in place.  I imagine the same process will be gone through here.</p></speech>

It was &euro;15,000 a day and it went on for a number of months.

Spain faced a fine of &euro;46 million.  It is quite substantial, depending on the level.  That is all I have to say on that.

Regarding our priority sites, we are regulating just over 1,000 different sites.  Of those, we have identified 127 as the most important sites that we feel need to be addressed upfront.  That is not to say there are not issues with the other sites.  We see all those sites but obviously some sites within that number are more important than others.  The reasons for highlighting the 127 is to ensure that there is equal funding.</p><p>That is not to say there are not issues in the broader population of sites.  Some of those sites are more important than others.  We are highlighting the 127, some of which have an impact on bathing water, which we are hearing about today, shellfish areas and so on, to ensure equal funding and effort is put into them and not just into the 27 EU cases.  Our efforts cover a broad range, rather than focusing on the EU Commission cases as outlined earlier.</p><p> In terms of setting out the need for action, and going back to reports in 2006 at least and probably further, the EPA has consistently said what level of investment is needed in this area.  The move from 34 local authorities to one utility has made responding to cases such as this easier in that we are dealing with one central planning and investment.  Part of the issue we had previously was dealing with the varying capabilities and funding capacity of individual local authorities.</p></speech>

That dropped off in the intervening years.  It has recovered since 2013 up to approximately &euro;200 million.  The plans set out here are back up to &euro;300 million a year.  Irish Water or CER are probably better placed to talk about the individual figures.  It is important from our point of view in the EPA that those plans are delivered on and that money is made available at that level because the solution for the 27 by 2021 is extremely ambitious and needs sustained financial and human resources applied to it.</p> <p>  In respect of the inspection plans, the monitoring data from all Irish Water sites are submitted to us annually.  We also conduct inspections of approximately 100 sites a year and then we take samples of 250 sites in addition.  We are out on the ground visiting the sites and getting information back on that.  We also publish every one of those reports.  All those inspection reports are publicly available.  </p> <p>  Other witnesses have dealt with the situation at Ringsend.  </p> <p>  In response to Senator O'Sullivan's question about the standards, she is right to say the Urban Waste Water Directive deals with a very basic standard of treatment.  EPA licences take into account wider aspects covered by the Water Framework Directive, which brings in a broader set of standards, and other directives, such as the Shellfish Waters Directive and the Bathing Water Directive.  The EPA licence sets out the conditions required to meet all of those.  That is the primary tool we use as our engagement with Irish Water on any individual plant.</p></speech>

I would be amazed if we get any coverage of this, or it will be very limited coverage, despite being in the middle of court proceedings facing a potential fine of thousands if not millions of euro.</p> <p>  Could Mr. Flynn for the committee's benefit talk us through an infringement process, from the initial communication from the Commission, through to the warnings and the court?  It is important for that to be on the record so that people have a sense of it.  As he explains that, can he tell us how frequently the EPA raises the concerns before and during the enforcement proceedings with the Department?  I think the public will want to know how much notice a relevant Department or Minister have prior to the different stages of enforcement.  My understanding is that the EPA does a six-month review or report because we are in the infringement proceedings.  It might be useful for this committee to schedule a six-monthly review meeting.  We could invite the various players in after the EPA has done that review to give us updated information.  </p> <p>  In respect of Irish Water, Mr. Grant says plans are in place for all 38 agglomerations.  Is it his understanding that the European Commission is not satisfied with the plans or with their implementation or speed of their implementation?  Does Irish Water have plans for the other 127 EPA priority sites, even though they are not part of a court action?</p> <p>  He has said before that even if Irish Water had more money it might not be able to spend it.  If we go back to what he said about data and flow metres, planning permission is not needed for those.  I would have thought that for many of the smaller agglomerations that is an area of capital expenditure where Irish Water could do with more money in the short term.  If current investment is between &euro;200 million and &euro;300 million I would have thought relatively small increases in that, particularly in terms of flow metres and assisting with data collection, could make quite a big difference but I would be interested to hear what Mr. Grant has to say about that.</p> <p>  Could he outline the year-on-year capital investment expenditure in this area of Irish Water's capital investment programme 2017-21?  If he does not have it in front of him could he send it to the committee because we would all be interested in that?</p></speech>

First, do we know what impact the surface water accessing wastewater treatment plant has on the plants?  If it is having a significant impact is there any way of mitigating it?</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned a wastewater treatment plant in my constituency, Arklow.  I suppose they are right, that was not a result of lack of investment.  It was a result of a process dragged through the national and European courts.  It begs a question because that case has gone on for 20 years.  One individual has held up the common good of Arklow because the person has the financial resources to drag a wastewater treatment plant through the national and European courts.  I appreciate Irish Water has moved the site and is now entering a new process which we hope will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the end of this year but that individual is sitting there and I live in fear for the people of Arklow that the common good is not outweighed by the rights of an individual.  I have some reservations. </p> <p>  We mentioned sustainable funding a few times.  With the loss of domestic water revenue, there are two other sources available: commercial water in and out and connection fees for connection to wastewater treatment plants.  We know there are multiple tariffs for them because Irish Water inherited the local authority regime.  Is there any proposed harmonisation process whereby there will be a national tariff for commercial water in and out and one for connection fees to wastewater treatment plants?  </p> <p>  In respect of the EPA, we mentioned Gweedore not being under its control because they are individual septic tanks and we mentioned the national inspection plan.  Who monitors that plan?  Is it monitored by the local authority?  Does the EPA have any role in seeing how it is rolled out and kept up to date? </p> <p>  While, rightly, we focussed attention on the 127 non-compliant plants, are we monitoring the remaining 870-odd wastewater treatment plants?  Do we have warning systems to ensure another ten, 15 or 20 are not added to that list annually because we are not investing in mitigation?</p><p>To start on the infringement process, I suppose it is no surprise to anyone.  This directive came in many decades ago.  The legislation in 2007 on licensing these wastewater treatment plants was the direct result of an infringement against this directive.  As regards communications, it is important to state the EPA is an independent agency.  It provides its own independent data and reports.  Those reports, along with periodic requests from the Commission directly to the member state, quite often form the basis of the source of data it would use to determine whether or not the directive is being complied with.</p></speech>

Once an infringement case starts - it tends to start, as one would expect, through a letter - there is not so much an ongoing correspondence but rather, as an independent agency, we provide independent data to support any arguments that are being made by the member state to the Commission on that.  We also regularly attend package meetings with the Commission to provide that data, but we are there as an independent agency whose role is to collect those data and publish them.</p></speech>

The current national inspection plan for septic tanks was written by the EPA.  It is then given out to local authorities to conduct the inspections.  We do an annual review of that inspection plan each year.  Later on this year we will be starting the next version of the national inspection plan.  We will monitor its implementation and will take the results and use that learning in the development of the next national inspection plan for septic tanks.</p> <p>  As regards the 127 sites and remaining ones, we get all the monitoring data back from Irish Water.  Irish Water is monitoring at an operational level each of its plants.  There are requirements in the licence in terms of environmental monitoring that Irish Water has to provide back to us once a year.  We also conduct our own monitoring.  On a one in three-year basis we will be across every single licence site in the country, of which there are currently approximately 505.</p> <p>  As was rightly pointed out, because Gweedore does not have a network at the moment, it does not come under the EPA until the network is in place.  Once it does, it will become an agglomeration under the regulations, will require a licence and will become part of the normal process.</p></speech>

As the economic regulator, the CER oversees the approval of Irish Water's tariffs for non-domestic customers and also their connection charges.  At the moment we are operating under a business as usual process, as has been indicated, so we are currently living with the existing local authority charges.  However, we have commenced a project with Irish Water which involves a lot of stakeholder engagement.  Irish Water is working on proposals for an enduring non-domestic tariff regime in future.  The timing for that has been slightly delayed because it is linked somewhat to the joint committee's deliberations.  We would hope to receive proposals from Irish Water on its non-domestic plans perhaps by the end of this year.  We would seek to consult on those in 2018.</p> <p>  We currently have approximately 500 different tariff categories for non-domestics in the country, which is not ideal in terms of transparency, simplicity or equity.  That major project will involve much stakeholder engagement.</p> <p>  On the revenue side, Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to funding for capital over the years.  We see capex investment ranging from &euro;562 million in 2016 upwards to &euro;629 million in 2018.  It is, therefore, increasing somewhat.</p></speech>

For example, Ringsend will go on for at least another year or maybe two years.  The cash tends to come behind the project, so we are projecting the cash as well as the build-out cost.  We will have a number of schemes that will run beyond 2021, but we expect to be compliant in Ringsend by 2021.  The best thing for us to do is to set it out year-on-year and provide that to the committee.</p> <p>  I want to start at the end by agreeing with Ms Rooney on the commercial tariffs but also on the connection charges.  We will be making a proposal on connection charges earlier than that, in the coming months, because there is a programme on that.  We think it is extremely important because we have a huge variety of charges across the country, so this will bring about a standard set of connection charges.  It will go through the same process of submission and consultation that Ms Rooney outlined.  It will certainly regularise that.</p> <p>  I will now pick up on the questions.  There are plans in place for all the priority sites.  If one takes, for example, the 44 that had no treatment, they had to start with feasibility studies.  We appointed consultant engineers to put them together.  We put them out in bundles of five to ten so we could get a much quicker delivery of solutions.  We have a number of constraints and the supply chain is part of the issue as well.  We plan on putting out some of that work to what we call early contractor involvement.  In other words, we will put it out early and get the contractors to support the design, or offer design solutions, and then go for planning on the basis of those solutions in the hope of fast-tracking delivery.  We expect to be letting contracts with five to ten schemes in a single contract, as part of the future supply chain management approach.  That is very different from what we have been doing up to now where, by and large, we have been tendering individual projects.  We are in the process of engaging with the contracting industry around how that will happen, as well as looking at the contracts arrangement and models for all that.</p> <p>  As regards the question of money, I would not suggest for a minute that we would not take all the money we could get.  However, given the time it takes to get projects through, one needs to look at the profiling.  The real challenge for this country will be to sustain the level of funding and keep the graph going up, and keep the plans and programmes behind that.  There are limitations on the supply chain and even on the planning system as to how many projects one can take through at a time.  Nevertheless we are actively trying to spend as much money as we can on doing the right things.</p> <p>  If one turns on the tap and then turns it off again that will ruin value.  One can really destroy value and delivery by doing that.  Therefore, one has to plan capital delivery in order to make it efficient.  That is where the regulatory model as applied to utilities in other countries has demonstrated value.  By having that sort of programmed approach, one can do things such as clustering projects, having early contractual involvement, and supply chain relationship management approaches.  With the money and a five-year certainty, one can do those kinds of things.  If there is any doubt about that, one is unlikely to get value, efficiency and timeliness of delivery.</p><p>Surface water is an interesting and challenging issue.  I will take the example of Cork city but it can be applied to most urban areas.  In Cork city we have a modern treatment system which treats to a very high standard and a lot of money was put into collecting all the foul sewers.  What we have in the centre of Cork in the Lee Estuary is the discharge out of sewage whenever it rains and we take in saltwater on high tides, which wrecks or complicates the treatment process.  To address and figure out what the problem is and its scale, we have to spend a number of millions of euro on CCTV cameras, surveys and models to investigate where it is coming from because we are speaking not about pipe sewers but old stone culverts and brick culverts.  It is a very big problem.  It is likely to result in probably tens of millions and maybe hundreds of millions of investment in a city such as Cork . In Dublin it will be similar.  Throughout the country it will involve huge investment in the period beyond 2021, and for the next 20 years in fact.</p><p> This is a great example of something we cannot solve today with money because we do not know what the answer is.  We do not even know what the problem is.  What we are trying to do is build these models that will define the rainfall response and track back through CCTV and investigation.  We will end up relining a lot of the culverts using glass-reinforced plastic, GRP, liners and so on.  It would be really helpful if we could remove stormwater altogether because it adds costs and complications to the treatment process.  In central town areas it is extremely difficult to do and, frankly, it would be very disruptive if we had to try to separate out the pipes.</p><p> There is also a missed connection issue because we have foul sewers going into storm sewers.  The resolution of this type of issue will take years.  Such issues have an impact, which is why Thurles and Roscrea networks will take a little bit longer because we are preparing the surveys that will lead to the works.  It will just take that bit longer.  If we went in and tried to solve it now without the information we would waste money and we probably would not get the answer or the right result.</p><p> As for Arklow, we have a number of schemes and I will not go into specifics.  Certainly, if we look back over the past 20 years a number of schemes stopped dead in their tracks because of objections.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la and the strategic infrastructure Act have streamlined the process a bit but recourse to the courts and to Europe is something to which citizens are entitled.</p></speech>

This still leaves Irish Water significantly short, if its annual investment is &euro;124 million.  The EPA stated that in the early noughties, it was approximately &euro;300 million a year and then fell to &euro;200 million.  Now Mr. Grant is speaking about &euro;124 million a year over the next five or six years.  I would really like to see the figures over a longer period of time, if they could be provided to the committee, because I am concerned by this.</p> <p>  The EPA representatives have been very diplomatic, as was its spokesperson on "Morning Ireland" this morning, but I am looking for a straight answer if possible.  If the programme as outlined in Irish Water's capital investment programme is implemented, is the EPA satisfied we will be in compliance with the directive by the end of the programme?  Does it not get very frustrating whereby year after year prior to infringement proceedings the EPA warns the Government the system is not working and does not meet the legal obligations of the State, infringement proceedings then start and the EPA continues to warn it?  Here we are, facing potentially thousands if not millions of euro of fines and there still is a question mark over whether levels of investment are adequate.</p></speech>

Given, as Mr. Grant outlined, the supply chain issues in Ireland and the capacity available to do this type of work, it is an ambitious programme to 2021.  It will bring us largely into compliance, apart from the three or four sites left beyond 2021.  Be under no illusion: it is an ambitious programme.  It will need to be funded and resourced and the supply chain issues will need to be sorted out.  It assumes no significant planning risks coming into the process.  As for our continued warnings, our job is to bring these issues to light with regard to water, wastewater, climate change and other issues, and we will continue to do so until the issues are resolved.</p></speech>

The studies I referred to regarding the Dublin and Cork main drainage schemes use various models to predict how rainfall intensities might increase.  We have clear evidence that intensities are increasing and we have what are called pluvial summer storms that are causing flooding.  We are trying to factor in these.  We are also factoring in changes in tide levels because they impact on our overflows.  It is clear huge investment will be driven and we believe this will happen at the back end of the water services strategic plan.  Quite frankly, we will not have the capacity to do it earlier and we probably will not have much of the information because of the amount of work that needs to be done.  We also have to look at our sites, particularly many of our wastewater plants, because naturally enough, they tend to be proximate to rivers and the coast.  We think we will have to spend quite a bit of money on the defence of our infrastructure over the period but it is a significant cost for which we have put in a notional figure.  In time I have no doubt it will become a very big challenge.</p></speech>

We consider opportunities whenever there is a road reinstatement project or a road surfacing project by a local authority, for instance.  It is very expensive to take storm water out of the sewer system.  In general, it is not economic to do so.  Our response, in most cases, is to try to deal with it at the plant by installing a storm balancing tank.  It means that the tank temporarily overflows when it rains and the water is brought back into the system.  That was not typically provided until relatively recently in most plants.  It is required in order to deal with Irish conditions.</p></speech>

It also provides updates on the Department's performance in meeting its output targets for 2016.</p><p>It is useful, in the first instance, to outline the scope and scale of the Department's expenditure and its importance, not alone for those who directly receive the various payments but also for society generally.  An allocation of &euro;19.85 billion was provided for the Department this year.  This represents 37% of gross current Government expenditure and is &euro;229 million more than was provided in the Revised Estimate for 2016.  Each week some 1.35 million people - pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity or sick leave, carers and jobseekers - receive a payment from my Department.  In addition, over 623,000 families receive child benefit each month for almost 1.2 million children.  What is significant about these figures is not just their scale but also what they represent - a social compact where the State, on behalf of all citizens, provides support for those citizens who, for whatever reason, need support at certain points in their lives.  Importantly this compact which in 2017 will take about two thirds of all social insurance and income tax receipts can only be sustained if all citizens have confidence in the integrity of the system.</p><p>There can be a misconception that most welfare payments go to unemployed persons, but that is not the case.  The biggest single bloc of expenditure in 2017 will be on pensions - the State pension, the State contributory pension and widow's and widower's pension - which will amount to almost &euro;7.3 billion or 37% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on working age schemes comprises two programmes, namely, income supports and employment supports which, combined, account for about &euro;4.7 billion or 23% of total expenditure.  Income supports, including jobseekers allowance, one-parent family payment, maternity and paternity, account for almost &euro;3.7 billion or 18% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on employment supports, including community employment, back to education and enterprise and various employment programmes, amounts to just under &euro;1 billion or 5% of my Department's expenditure.  The next biggest subhead is expenditure on illness, disability and carers' payments which will amount to over &euro;3.8 billion or 19% of overall expenditure in 2017.  Expenditure on children and families will account for nearly 13% of total expenditure or &euro;2.6 billion, of which &euro;423 million will be spent on family income supplement paid to low-income working families.  Expenditure on supplementary payments such as rent supplement, agencies such as MABS and the CIB and miscellaneous services accounts for &euro;863 million or 4% of overall expenditure. </p><p>Nearly all of the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand-led.  This demand is driven by demographic trends, including ageing of the population, and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  As we all know, Ireland has experienced a recovery in employment that has been much more rapid that even the most optimistic analysts projected.  There are now more than 2 million people in employment, with 65,100 net new jobs added in the past year alone.  As a result of this growth in employment, CSO data show that the unemployment rate as of April 2017 was 6.2%, a reduction of 3.5 percentage points over two years and about nine percentage points lower than its peak level of just over 15% four short years ago.  Long-term unemployment now stands at 3.6%, which represents a reduction of 43,700 people in the past two years.  The level of youth unemployment has fallen to 12.9%, a fall of 8.5 percentage points over two years and down from a peak level of over 30%.  These trends in unemployment have fed into the live register.  At the end of April there were 42,000 fewer people on the live register than at the same time last year and over 79,800 fewer than this time two years ago.  The live register peaked at a figure of 470,000 in mid-2011 but stands at 263,400 as of last month, a reduction of over 44%.  The last time it was at this level was nearly nine years ago, in October 2008, when the population was lower than it is now.</p><p>The reduction in the live register is freeing the resources we need to meet demands emerging from demographic changes.  In addition, it provided the basis on which I could, in budget 2017, take steps to ensure everyone would benefit from the recovery, including retired people, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents, farmers and people who were unemployed.  In doing this and referring back to the concept of the social compact mentioned I sought to balance the increases in social welfare payments with measures designed to make sure the system was seen to work for and by people who were contributing to the system such as people in employment and paying PRSI, including self-employed persons.  On budget day I announced the first general increase in all weekly rates of payment since 2009 at a cost of &euro;284.5<font color="#FF0000"> </font>million in 2017.  Approximately 1.5 million people have benefited from this increase, which took effect in March.  As promised in the programme for Government and the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il, I also extended social insurance benefits for the self-employed.  Since March self-employed contributors can avail of the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids and contact lenses.</p><p>This will be extended in October to include other benefits for those employed and self-employed.  <br/><br/>I also introduced changes to improve the reward for work for lone parents who take up some employment.  The income disregards for the one-parent family payment and jobseekers&rsquo; transition payment increased by &euro;20 from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week.  This change improves the level of take-home earnings of lone parents.  Farmers in receipt of farm assist also saw the reintroduction of disregards from their farm and off-farm income from self-employment last March.  I was also pleased to be able to increase the number of places on the rural social scheme by 500 this year.  <br/><br/>A number of the 2017 budget measures have yet to take effect.  Most significantly, from December, self-employed contributors will be eligible to apply for the invalidity pension for the first time.  This will give them access to the safety net of a guaranteed income support if they have the misfortune of experiencing a debilitating illness or injury that prevents them from returning to work.  <br/><br/>Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017, which will provide further dental and optical benefits to both employees and to the self-employed for the first time.  That includes free eyeglasses or a subsidy towards them, certain periodontal treatments, certain contact lenses where medically necessary and scale and polish from the dentist.  This was removed some years ago but is now being restored to employees and extended to the self-employed for the first time, as well as their dependent spouses.  <br/><br/>From the commencement of the next academic year in September, a &euro;500 annual cost of education allowance will be made available to back-to-education allowance participants with children.  This includes lone parents as well as couples.  This will help parents to return to and remain in education.<br/><br/>From September, young jobseekers age under 25 years will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of &euro;193 per week when they engage in educational activity under the back-to-education allowance scheme.  This is an increase of &euro;33 or 21% on the previous level of payment and represents the largest single increase in the budget package.  That is expressly for people under 25 years who enter education, having been unemployed.<br/><br/>Budget 2017 also provided for the inclusion in the school meals scheme of an additional 80 schools newly designated as DEIS by my colleague, the Minister of Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  Furthermore, for the first time in many years, school meals will be extended to schools outside of DEIS, with the phased extension of the scheme to breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools from September 2017.  I do this noting and being aware that more than half of children who suffer disadvantage do not attend disadvantaged schools.  They very often attend the school in the district or parish next door.  That is why this is a programme that I would like to make universal in the years ahead. <br/><br/>Finally, a Christmas bonus, of 85%, was paid to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients, such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and long-term unemployed jobseekers at a cost of &euro;220 million.<br/><br/>In comparing the Department&rsquo;s expenditure in 2016 with the allocation for 2017, it is important to note that variances in expenditure on most social welfare schemes are typically explained by a combination of factors.  These include trends, including downward trends, in recipient numbers, changes in average weekly payment values and differences in the number of paydays in any given year.  In addition, comparisons between 2016 and 2017 expenditure are further impacted by the measures introduced in budget 2017, including the increases in the weekly rates of payment; and the payment of an 85% Christmas bonus is 2016 costing approximately &euro;220 million.  Provision for such bonuses is made, subject to the financial position of the State, in October of each year as part of the budgetary process and is not included in the Revised Estimates at this time.<br/><br/>The Department has also provided briefing regarding claims processing last year.  For most of my Department&rsquo;s schemes, claims are processed without delay and within or close to the Department&rsquo;s processing time standards.  However, for some schemes the processing time standards were not achieved in 2016.  This was particularly the case in schemes such as the carer&rsquo;s allowance and domiciliary care allowance, which is of great concern to me.  The Department now reports that there have been significant improvements in the processing times across these schemes since 2016.  For instance, in April 2017, 75% of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims were processed within target, compared with<font color="#FF0000"></font>7% in April 2016.  That is a dramatic improvement and I am grateful to our staff in Longford and Carrick-on-Shannon for that.  In addition to this, the number of claims on hand is 36% lower at the end of April 2017 compared with the same month last year.  We are very much getting through that backlog.  <br/><br/>Committee members will be aware that in recent months, delays have been experienced in processing maternity benefit claims received via the postal system.  In order to tackle these delays additional staff have been allocated to the processing team in Buncrana and performance is beginning to improve.  I had the pleasure of visiting the staff in Buncrana last Friday. <br/><br/>It is important to note, and this may not have come across very clearly in the media, that these delays only apply to postal claims.  If one claims online, claims can be processed much more quickly and in fact, almost two thirds of people who claim online will get a decision instantaneously.  If, in their constituency work, members come across people who have made a paper application and are still waiting for an answer, they can still put in an online application.  An applicant does need a public service card to do so but that is all.  I would encourage any expectant mothers or fathers to use the Department&rsquo;s online facility <i>. </i><br/><br/>A lot of public attention has focussed recently on my initiative to raise awareness of fraud.  This campaign aims to encourage people to comply with social welfare rules and to report any instances of fraudulent activity of which they have knowledge.  We all know the vast majority of people on social welfare are claiming the correct entitlement due to them.  However, a small minority are claiming payments to which they are not entitled either because they do not understand the rules or because they deliberately choose to ignore them.  Many are employers, paying people in cash who do not pay PRSI on behalf of their employees and therefore deny them social benefits.  Some have hundreds of thousands of euro in the bank, and we have many estate cases on hand on those lines.  Others have jobs, do not pay tax on the work they do, and claim social welfare.  Some do not even live in the country or may have dual identities.  <br/><br/>Given the scale of our expenditure even a low level of fraud amounts to very large sums of money; money that is desperately needed in other areas of Government activity, including within my own Department&rsquo;s schemes and services.  While fraud rates of 0.5% or 1% may seem minuscule to some, in the context of a multi-billion euro budget, the sums are considerable, certainly tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of euro.  It should be borne in mind that &euro;10 million is what it would cost to increase the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance by 25% this summer.  If I can, it is my intention to use any savings made from this campaign to do that.  In addition, if the public is to retain confidence in the integrity of the welfare system, it is important that we not only tackle any fraudulent activity but that we are seen to do so.  Taxpayers expect us to do that.  For this reason it is appropriate that we engage in a public awareness campaign from time to time and I make no apology for so doing.  To date this campaign has seen a 50% increase in reports made by members of the public to the Department.  I should point out that it accounts for maybe one sixth of my Department&rsquo;s publicity budget this year, five sixths of which has been spent telling people about benefits they are entitled to but may not claim, for instance the new benefits for the self-employed, the Abhaile service for people who are in mortgage arrears and the new paternity benefit scheme before that.  <br/><br/>None of us know if and when we might require the support of the schemes and services operated by the Department.  What we do know is we want supports to be available if and when we need them.  For this reason we need to build and sustain a consensus across society regarding the funding model and benefits that make up our social welfare system.<br/><br/>Social welfare legislation provides for the carrying out of an actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund every five years.  The Department has engaged KPMG to carry out the latest review and this will be completed by mid-August.  The review will examine the financial health of the fund in the short and long term.  The outcome of the review will help to inform the debate on the funding approach and the types of benefits which should be available as our society evolves, the nature of work changes and our population ages.  I intend to consult widely on these questions and the committee will be an important stakeholder in this discussion.<br/><br/>To conclude I have sought, in this opening statement, to provide a broad overview of the role of the Department and its expenditure programmes and to set out the changes made in budget 2017 that are reflected in the Estimates presented here today.  I look forward to hearing members' views and will welcome any questions.</p></speech>

Before he arrived I indicated to the committee that we would go through these under the various headings to ensure there is adequate scrutiny and analysis.</p><p>The first heading is pensions.  I call Deputy O'Dea.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1585" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  We will go through this heading by heading but I will ask the Minister one general question which affects all headings.  In the supplementary document issued subsequent to our receipt of the main documentation, there is an item titled "administration".  Administration costs are divided between pay and non-pay.  Pay has not increased significantly.  It seems to be non-pay that has increased.  Pay has gone down slightly, actually, but non-pay has increased from &euro;190 million to &euro;254.9 million, which is quite a considerable increase.  It is an increase of &euro;50 million and perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that.</p> <p>  The pension figures are interesting.  There is almost a 5% increase in the Estimate for contributory pensions.  As the Minister will be aware, there was an increase in the rate of pensions this year which kicked in in March.  Can the Minister tell us how much of that actual estimated increase is due to the extra numbers?  The Minister made the point, when we were discussing this prior to the budget, that he must find a certain amount of money before he provides for any increase in the pensions.  How much of this is due to the actual budgetary increase and how much to increased numbers of pensioners?  I notice that the increase in provision for non-contributory pensions is very low in comparison - only 0.7% - despite the fact pensioners under this scheme have also benefitted from the increase.  I can only speculate that the numbers may have dropped there.</p> <p>  The Minister will also be aware of ongoing controversy surrounding the methods used to calculate contributory pensions.  Two changes were made to the pensions system in 2012.  A different averaging system was introduced and basic qualification changed from 260 contributions to 520.  If we were to go back to 2012, could the Minister tell us how much it would cost from here on in, on an annual basis, to undo those change and return to the position in 2012?  I would like separate figures for each change.</p> <p>  Finally, I congratulate the Department on the more rapid processing times but there seems to be a bit of a drop in the processing times for non-contributory payments.  Obviously, a different situation applies in that regard - a means test must be carried out etc. - but perhaps the Department would take note of that.  It is down to about 75% now.  The target processing time for non-contributory pensions is ten weeks.  Ten weeks is two months.  If the chart here is correct, it shows that while processing times have improved - they improved quite considerably last year - they seem to have dropped back again.  They were up to 85% at some stage last year.  They are now back to 75%.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1587" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E00400"><p>I will starting with the Deputy's first question concerning administration.  There are two key reasons for the increase in the administration subhead.  First, we have engaged in a detailed staff education and training programme whereby the Department now has a contract, or a partnership, with the National College of Ireland to upskill and educate our staff.  This is for many reasons.  Obviously, we want staff to do more and do things better.  We also want to give them opportunities for promotion and that has a cost to it.  The JobPath contract falls into this subheading as well.  As the Deputy will be aware, the main cost of this is when people get jobs that pay more than 30 hours per week and they sustain it for more than 13 weeks.  That is when the payments to JobPath start to kick in.  I think 20,000-odd people now have gone through that programme and managed to sustain a full-time job for more than three months.  That is when the payments kick in.</p> <p>  Regarding the contributory pension, we can provide a breakdown as to where the increases are for the Deputy.  Last year, the number of people entitled to a State contributory pension increased by 4.6%, whereas the number entitled to a non-contributory pension fell by 0.5%, which is something the Deputy identified.  This reflects demographics.  There are more and more people now retiring who have a history of paying into the PRSI system and are therefore entitled to a contributory pension.  Those who are passing away are obviously much older and would often be people who did not pay into the PRSI system and only received a pension on a means-tested basis.</p> <p>  Regarding the rate increase, this cost 1.8% in respect of contributory pensions and 2.1% in respect of non-contributory pensions.  There are other factors at play, as I mentioned earlier.  The payday has an effect as well because there are a number of different paydays in any given year.  We can give the Deputy an exact breakdown and if he wants it in numbers, it is on page 7 of our brief.  The allocation for the State pension contributory was &euro;4.844 billion, which was an increase of &euro;182 million on the outturn.  Of this, &euro;210 million was due to an increase in pension recipient numbers.  The cost of the rate increase was &euro;81 million, but this was offset by things like the Christmas bonus, the number of paydays and a number of other factors.  I should point out that the figures we use in our brief include the Christmas bonus for 2016 but do not assume there will be a Christmas bonus in 2017 - although I do assume there will be a Christmas bonus in 2017; I am just not permitted to put it into the accounts, barring a major recession.</p> <p>  Regarding the figures on the cost of the changes made in 2015, the Deputy refers to the two reforms brought in by the former Minister, Deputy Burton, in 2012, namely, a change from five years' contributions to ten and the averaging system.  If we were to reverse that, it would cost &euro;60 million in 2018, and if we were to backdate it, it would cost &euro;200 million.  Because the changes work into the future, it would cost &euro;10 million more every year.  Therefore, it would cost &euro;60 million next year, &euro;70 million in 2019, &euro;80 million in 2020 and so on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1591" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E00800"><p>I do not.  Averaging would form the bulk of it, though.  I apologise - the figures I have given the Deputy concern a reversal of the change made to the averaging system.  I do not have the figures for the change made to the number of contributions required.  However, the Deputy knows where we are going on this.  I am not satisfied with the way we contribute to the State contributory pension.  I do not think it is the right way to do it.  What I - or certainly the Department - will have for the committee in the next few months, when we have done the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, is a set of ten options as to how we can have a new, fairer system to contribute to the State contributory pension and how much it would cost.  Obviously, any time one changes the rules as to how one calculates something, there are winners and losers.  Before we make that decision, we need to know who would lose and who would win or who would benefit and who would end up with less.  We also need to know, if we were to make sure nobody lost out, which I am sure would be the desire of all of us, what the cost would be.  It is pretty phenomenal, by the way.  It is important the committee sees those ten options.  Then it can decide in its pre-budget submissions whether it would prioritise them over other measures.</p> <p>  Regarding the target time for non-contributory pensions, 73% are done within ten weeks, which is the target.  The average is 11 weeks.  I am informed that the processing times at the end of April - that is, so far for this year - are well ahead of target for the contributory schemes.  We are doing much better on processing except for maternity, unfortunately.</p></speech>

I will begin with a similar question concerning administration.  I note the Minister's remarks about JobPath and his acknowledgement that it comes under the spending under this subhead.  There is a lack of clarity and information on JobPath and constant rhetoric and comments about commercial sensitivity surrounding it.  To find that money relating to JobPath is now appearing under this subhead with no clarity or information just adds to these issues.</p><p>I want to come back to JobPath because I have a series of questions.  Could the Minister elaborate on that?  We have heard that money for the two private companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, is buried in administration under non-pay costs.  Could the Minister elaborate on that?  I am somewhat concerned and confused about it.</p><p> In respect of pensions, I note the Minister's constant use of the words "winners" and "losers".  He is certainly very used to employing those words.  There were certainly no winners from the changes introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Burton, in 2012.  The Minister stands over those changes and he continues to roll them out.  The real losers were women.  Does the Minister agree with that?  There were certainly no winners- only losers.  Women lost out.  Over 36,000 people were on reduced pensions up to June 2016 as a direct result of the changes in question.  The figures bear that out.  Does the Minister think this is fair?  The figures underpin the argument to the effect that those affected were, in the main, women.  The breakdown shows that there was a reduction of 100% in respect of the State pension transition.  We know that this is another group of people who are losers.  Again, there are no winners under this Minister and I think he would agree that this is very much a case of losers.  This is where people who retire at 65 are forced to accept a jobseeker's payment instead of drawing down a full State pension.  Many of these people, and I am sure the Minister agrees with this, have worked their entire lives and paid their contributions hoping to get their State pension only for it to be moved at the last minute.  The State transition pension bridged that gap to ensure that people were not up to &euro;40 worse off.  Does the Minister think these people are winners or losers?  If he looks at the statistics, he will see that 65 year olds make up the largest category of people signing for a jobseeker's payment.  Over 5,200 65 year olds are signing for such payments as opposed to drawing down the full State pension, to which they should be entitled.  Are there any updates on those figures?  To use his terminology, does the Minister think they are winners or losers?</p><p> I said during the discussion on last year's Estimates that one of the worst cuts introduced was the abolition of the bereavement grant.  I asked the Minister about its abolition at the time and he went off on a tangent saying there were three types of payments that can be used to pay families that are going through financial difficulties at very vulnerable and difficult time following the loss of a family member.  The figures here show quite clearly that there was a 100% cut in the bereavement grant.  This does not stack up with what the Minister said last year about three payments.  Could he comment on that matter?</p></speech>

I think he was a bit bewildered.  He did not think the bereavement grant had been abolished and told me that there were three payments, which is true, but there was a specific bereavement grant that was abolished.  I raised the matter last year during the Estimates process.  The Minister questioned it but the figures before us bear out the contention that the bereavement grant is gone.  What is the Minister's perspective on that?  Again, we have losers.  There are certainly no winners in this instance.</p></speech>

One of these is an exceptional needs payment where a person can go to his or her community welfare officer and say that he or she cannot afford to pay funeral expenses or burial costs.  We can help with that.  Approximately &euro;5 million was paid out to help 1,000 people to date this year.  In the region of 3,000 people last year and 1,000 people so far this year received an exceptional needs payment to assist them with burial and funeral costs and that is still available.  Under the PRSI scheme, there is an occupational injury payment if someone dies in work as a consequence of that work.  That is still part of PRSI.  What was abolished in 2014 was the more general bereavement grant.  That would cost about &euro;20 million to reintroduce.  It is something that should be considered in the context of the budget.  We must prioritise.  We can never do everything we would like to do in one year but it is certainly something that could be considered for budget 2018, along with the telephone allowance.  These are two things I would like to restore in 2018.  I got a lot in the previous budget and, hopefully, I will have enough influence to get a lot in the next budget as well.</p> <p>  I will be as clear as possible about JobPath.  The allocation to JobPath in 2017 was &euro;65 million.  That roughly works out as an average cost per participant of &euro;1,000.  When we consider the number of people who, as a result of or with the assistance of JobPath, move from welfare to work and paying taxes, we can see that this is a very good investment at only &euro;1,000 per participant.  The cost is &euro;65 million in 2017 and the return is very considerable.  I do not like to compare JobPath with community employment because they are very different programmes with very different purposes.  However, members might like to know that JobPath will cost &euro;65 million in 2017 while community employment will cost &euro;600 million.  The cost per participant in JobPath is &euro;1,000 while the cost per participant in community employment is between &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000.  That gives members an idea of the difference in cost compared to outcomes.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that there were no beneficiaries or winners from the changes in 2012.  However, those changes were made for a reason.  They were made at a time when budgets were very tight and the then Minister, Deputy Burton, with my support and that of the Cabinet, decided that instead of cutting pensions, and we never cut the pension even throughout the worst recession in a generation-----</p></speech>

There were future expectations perhaps that is not the same thing.  We both know what we are saying and the Deputy understands what I am saying.  It was also done as part of a wider reform to better reflect the fact that when it comes to any contributory pension, including the Deputy's, there has to be or should be a link between the amount someone pays in and the amount he or she gets at the end.  That is the contributory principle and it is not a bad one.  It applies to the Deputy's pension and my pension so why should it not apply in social insurance as well - linking the amount someone pays in to the amount he or she gets back, with provision for caring and child rearing?  I would hope that any new system would properly reflect that as well.</p> <p>  In the context of the gender breakdown of those affected, the figures are 58% women and 42% men.  If we look at the population of people aged over 66 - as the Deputy is aware, women live longer - we can see that 54% are women and 46% are men.  As a result, there is a 4% variance in the effect on men versus women.  At the same time, the Deputy also knows that poverty rates are higher among older men than older women.</p><p>Men are slightly more likely to be in poverty in old age than women.  The figure is 4% one way and 0.3% the other way, but it is certainly not as characterised or as one would think from the narrative and the discussion in the media that it was only women who were affected or it was 80:20 or 70:30.  That is not the case, there is a difference of approximately 4% in the impact on men versus women.</p><p> The State pension age must rise.  I would love to go out in the next few days and tell people they are going to be able to retire at 60 years, 62 years or 65 years but that would be dishonest and not true.  When one goes back to the 1970s, the State pension age was 70 years and in those days the average man lived to the age of 68 years and the average woman lived to 72 years to 73 years.  People paid into the system through tax and social insurance for perhaps 40 to 50 years and received a pension for two or three years.</p><p> Things have changed.  It is wonderful that people are living much longer but obviously that creates a potential time bomb in our pension system.  We have time to diffuse the time bomb but we have to do something about it.  Part of that has to be increasing the State pension age.  Every other country is doing it.  It is just basic maths.  It adds up.  The State pension age will rise to 67 years in 2021, and 68 in 2028.</p><p> It is important to remind anybody listening and members of the committee that there is no compulsory retirement age in Ireland.  The year in which one gets the State pension is not the year in which one has to retire.  There have often been people who have to retire at 50 years or 60 years for some reason or another.  We have always had a case of people who have had to retire from a particular job earlier than the State pension age, but the State pension age is not a compulsory retirement age.  Many people work into the 70s because they choose to do so and you and I know many of those people.  What is interesting is a case taken to the Workplace Relations Commission, which issued a ruling in the past week or two on the case of a person in Knock Airport.  The Workplace Relations Commission confirmed that just because one has a contract until the age of 65 years, the employer essentially cannot make one retire at 65 years.  It must have some objective basis in reason as to why that is the case.  I think that is a very significant judgment and one that has major implications across the private sector that people cannot be forced to retire unless there is a good reason as to why he or she should do so.  The obligation is therefore on the employer.</p><p> The public sector is different.  I am sure as part of the talks and negotiations that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, will have with the trade unions that the possibility of allowing public servants to continue to work to the State pension age will be part of those talks.  I think that should be the case.</p></speech>

On the last point, in essence we have compulsory retirement.  While I am familiar with the court case the Minister referenced, prior to that there have been many other court cases that ruled the other way.  The difficulty is the EU legislation was introduced back in 2012 is open to interpretation.  That is the difficulty here.  While I note the recent court case, there have been many other court case where the decision went the other way.  That is wrong.  The serious error and anomaly, and I believe the Minister has admitted it himself, is that when these changes were brought in with the abolition of the State transition pension, is that we have 65 year olds who are forced to retire.  Many of those forced to retire, do so against their own will and are forced to sign on for a jobseeker's payment and those people would have preferred to stay working.  Many women would have preferred to stay working to build up their contributions to try to get a higher pension.</p> <p>  I think the Minister acknowledges that the changes that were introduced in 2012 were unfair.  He said there were no winners, that everybody was a loser.  The Minister has come before us with flags flying, whether it is part of his leadership campaign, he is now talking about reinstating this or that, using the so-called savings generated by the fraud campaign to increase the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  Perhaps as part of his campaign, the Minister might give a commitment to those pensioners who are forced on to a jobseeker's payment to reinstate the State transition pension payment.  Again, the Minister refers to other countries that have raised the retirement age.  I put it to the Minister that what we in Ireland are doing is going far beyond what other countries are doing.  A number of countries have increased the retirement age up to 66 years.  We are proposing to increase it to 68 years.  That is far higher than many other countries at an European level.</p></speech>

I will be glad at least in the next few weeks when that nonsense comes to an end.</p> <p>  The Deputy may have to accept at some point that I may actually say things I believe and do things I think are right.  The Deputy may not agree with what I say but I do believe it.  The Deputy may not support what I do but I think these measures are the right thing to do.  That has always been my guiding principle.</p> <p>  We have had this discussion before.  People may well be required by contract or even by law to retire from a particular job but nobody is required to retire.  It is possible to take up other employment and lots of people do.  We know lots of people who have retired from a job and then work part-time or who become consultants.  Garda or Army people who retired in their 50s have taken up other jobs as well.  The solution is not to reintroduce the State transition pension but to ensure that people can continue in their job beyond the age of 65 years and that is why the Workplace Relations Commission's ruling is very important.  Deputy Brady has a Bill that strengthens the law further in that area.</p></speech>

The reason for that is the reductions in the other areas.  We anticipate that humanitarian aid will fall from &euro;1.7 million to &euro;500,000 because we hope there will not be any major floods or similar things in 2017.  The allocation for direct provision is going down as well because the number of people in direct provision is decreasing.  We are estimating a fall in things such as heat and light from &euro;6.7 million to &euro;4.5 million.  When it comes to ENPs and UNPs, we are not anticipating a major change.  It will go from &euro;32.2 million to &euro;31.5 million.  It is demand-led so it may well come out higher.</p></speech>

Is that possible?  The reason I ask is that when we raised the abolition of the bereavement grant initially with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Burton, she said people would be taken care of from the exceptional needs fund.  It was my experience at constituency level that even when the bereavement grant, which was &euro;800, was there, many people who came to me needed extra assistance because of the rising costs relating to funerals.  The extra assistance they have been getting does not reflect the fact the bereavement grant has been abolished.  I would like the Department to send those figures to me.</p> <p>  On the total increase in the allocation for working age income supports, the main item is jobseeker's allowance.  Could the Minister give us an indication of how the figures for the reduction in jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit allocation break down?  How are they offset by the increase that came into play in March?</p> <p>  I have a point on the discussions the Minister has had on compulsory retirement.  A Bill has passed Second Stage and has been referred to committee.  If the Government accepts the Bill and ensures that it is passed, any individual who wants to stay on in his current job would not have to go see solicitors and lawyers.  An awful lot of people cannot afford that or to go to court.  I take the Minister's point that a person can take up another job at 65, but there are not that many openings for 65 year olds.  If we are serious about this, the legislation is there and it is pretty unambiguous.  The proposers, Deputy Brady and I, are prepared to accept any reasonable amendments from the Government side.  I do not know when the Bill in question was referred to committee but we are still waiting for movement on it.  The ball is in the Government's court.</p> <p>  I welcome the increase in treatment benefits and maternity benefit.  Much of the increased figure is as a result of that.  </p> <p>  Is supplementary rent allowance dealt with under this heading?</p></speech>

That is an offset by &euro;55 million which is the cost of the rate increases - the &euro;5 increase in jobseeker's.

That is the cost of changing the disregard on JST from &euro;90 to &euro;110.  There is approximately &euro;10.5 million in respect of other factors, including paydays and things of that nature.</p><p>On maternity benefit, I have been to Buncrana to witness it myself and to meet the staff there.  It is probably down to a number of factors.  It started to emerge as a problem in February.  Some of it is down to staff changes and the high turnover of staff.  Much of it is down to the new system.  Essentially, the forms have to be scanned in.  In the past, it was paper based.  Now, where it is a paper application, the forms have to be scanned in.  There are still a lot of old forms out there.  Some of the different centres throughout the country are still giving out the old forms.  It is our responsibility to solve it.  I am not blaming those centres; it is up to us to tell them to withdraw the forms and bring in the new ones.  In some cases the forms are printed out or photocopied and the scanners are not picking them up right, which means that staff have to go through them individually and re-enter the details.  That has caused a delay that was not there in the past.  We are catching up on the backlog and, as a result of that, we are starting to see improved times.  We have additional staff from Letterkenny brought into Buncrana to help out and staff are being offered overtime.  The office is opening on Saturdays on overtime to get through the backlog.  I am confident that we will resolve the matter.  If a person is entitled to any maternity benefit payment, that person will get paid in arrears so nobody will lose money, although there may be a delay in getting it.  The online system can produce an instant answer in two thirds of cases and all that is required is the public service card, PSC, which requires a visit to the local Intreo centre.  That is all it requires and signing up to <i>www.MyWelfare.ie</i>.  I have encouraged people to do this because the PSC is needed for child benefit as well.  It would be a good idea for anyone who is expecting a child and who does not have a PSC to get one because it is increasingly required for any public services.</p></speech>

Reading through the Revised Estimates, it is very unclear.  There are only two or three references to JobPath.  Any time I ask questions, I am told it is a commercially-sensitive matter and the Department cannot give out figures or statistics or any information on the contracts that are in place with Turas Nua or Seetec.  I will raise the issue of JobPath because, like thousands of people out there, I am deeply concerned.  The Minister will say that he has the results of a customer care survey, that the number of complaints is low and that his concerns have not been raised regarding the negative experiences people are having.  The reality is that people are being hounded and they are petrified.  They are afraid to make complaints.  They are afraid to raise any concerns because the threat that their payments will be suspended or cut or that they will be penalised is constantly hanging over their heads.  There are huge concerns, which I share.  I have asked the Minister repeatedly to carry out a review of the operation of JobPath.</p><p>He has stated it has not been in place long enough to carry out this review.  It was piloted in Bray and Longford and has been in place for two years in these areas.  It has been in place a year in the rest of the State, since it was rolled out.  It is timely and appropriate that a review is carried out.</p><p> The Department's target for 2017 is to refer 60,000 long-term unemployed people to JobPath, but the outturn for 2016 was 76,400.  Why is the target so low this year in comparison to last year?  The Minister often refers to contracting-out employment services in the UK and uses it as an example, but a 2004 report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee recommended greater transparency in the scheme there, with regard to visibility to the public about suppliers' performance, costs, revenues and profits.  All of this is hidden away from us.  We do not know what has been achieved.  We do not know targets or performances.  What are the Minister's views on this?  He constantly cites the UK example.  Does he share the concerns with regard to the alarm bells that went off in the UK in the Public Accounts Committee?</p><p> With regard to the fees payable to these private companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, have they been reduced in line with reductions in unemployment by between 4% and 16%, as was planned within the contract?  Will the Minister gives a bit more detail on this?  More than 94,000 people have gone through, or are going through, JobPath through the two companies.  There are huge concerns.  Is the Minister happy with their performance?  Are they hitting the rates of employment they are contracted to meet?  Why are the employment finding rates in the contract set at lower levels than those for local employment services, which have higher expectations?  Why is the bar so low?  It is 14.4% for the JobPath companies.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this is the figure set for Turas Nua and Seetec.  Why is it so low?  I would like clarity on some of these points.</p></speech>

These include payments to medical certifiers, such as doctors, of &euro;21.75 million, nurse attendance &euro;270,000, payments to branch managers of &euro;16 million, because many of the branch offices are outsourced, and a payment of &euro;37 million to JobPath.  The figure is there as much as any figure in any payment to any agency.  Similarly, community employment involves mostly private companies and the numbers are there for them also.</p> <p>  Quarterly reports will be issued on JobPath.  The first one is done and the second will be out later this month.  The report includes financial information, the extent to which targets are being met and the satisfaction survey from customers.  The target is set at 60% of the counterfactual.  Essentially, an assessment is made with a control group as to what percentage would progress to full-time employment and sustain it for three months and JobPath is then asked to do 60% better.  This is how the target is met.</p> <p>  Bear in mind it is not easy for many people who are long-term unemployed to get employment because they have been out of the labour market for so long.  We are not just saying any old employment, we are saying it only counts if it is for more than 30 hours a week and if it is a job that people are able to sustain for more than three months.  The idea that people are being pushed into part-time jobs or jobs that are not suited to them does not really match the contract, which states that a job has to be for 30 hours a week and a full-time job.  There are one or two exceptions, such as teaching, for obvious reasons.  It has to be a job the person is willing to stay in for more than three months.  This is essentially how the target is picked out.</p> <p>  The reason there will be fewer referrals in 2017 is because fewer people are long-term unemployed.  For the same reason there are fewer referrals to local employment schemes, community employment and T&uacute;s there will be fewer referrals to JobPath.  Fewer people will be referred to JobPath in 2017 than in 2016.  I would have thought Deputy Brady would welcome this.  He might want to come back in on it.</p> <p>  The Department is conducting an econometric review, which will be completed by October or November.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the contract provided for the Department to reduce the payments made to Seetec and Turas Nua if the economy recovered faster than we thought it would at the time of the recession.  We have implemented this and we have reduced the payments to the two companies, recognising that employment growth has been better than we thought it would have been at the time the contracts were signed.  I compliment my officials involved in negotiating the contract for ensuring provision was made for claw back in those circumstances, and we have implemented it.</p></speech>

There is no clarity.  For the Minister to compare community employment to Turas Nua and Seetec because it is established on a private company basis is disingenuous.  Turas Nua and Seetec are for profit.  They are profit driven and this is their motivation.  I hope the Minister will agree community employment provides essential and critical community services, and to compare it because it is set up on a company basis is disingenuous and a slap on the face.  Many community employment schemes are struggling because of the creation of JobPath.  People are being referred to JobPath and not to local employment schemes or community employment schemes.  They are not allowed on community employment schemes once they are signed up to JobPath.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether the review the Minister spoke about will be a root and branch review of the full operation of the scheme and both companies involved, because there are other concerns with regard to cherry picking.  This is another phenomenon that has been brought out and exposed in the UK.  I have spoken previously about concerns in this regard.  Will the Minister elaborate on this review?  Will the findings be published?  There are huge concerns.</p> <p>  With regard to redundancy and insolvency payments, which are in the same chapter, I note the Estimate is for a reduction of 20.5%.  I wish to raise concerns carried in many national newspapers recently.  The Department wrote off &euro;345 million in redundancy payments due to the State.  There is huge concern.  I acknowledge some of the companies are legitimate, for whatever reason, but some companies have come back under a different name with the same individuals.  There is concern that some companies have abused the system.  They have wound down and let people go to avoid giving out redundancy payments.  What process has been put in place to ensure these payments have been followed up and paid to the State?  A total of &euro;345 million certainly surpasses and puts in the shade the Minister's big campaign about welfare fraud, which I will touch on later on.</p></speech>

Community employment, CE, companies are not-for-profit, voluntary-based entities and I am not trying to suggest that CE companies are the same as Tesco or Aldi.  The point I am making about private companies is that they are not inherently a bad thing.  Private enterprise is not inherently bad and lots of Government and public services are provided by entities that are established as private companies.  In the way the Deputy speaks sometimes, he makes out that he thinks it is inherently wrong for the Government to deliver any service through private enterprise yet, across the board, we do this very successfully.  We do it in health care through GPs and primary care centres and in so many other fields.  That is the point I was making.  Turas Nua, for instance, has two shareholders, one is a not-for-profit, the other is for-profit, so it might be disingenuous to talk about the companies as being for-profit.</p> <p>  On redundancy and insolvency, we do pursue those companies for repayments.  I believe we got back over &euro;10 million in redundancy payments last year from companies, which is good but where we have to do write-offs is for obvious reasons.  Companies exist in law, they have legal personality and where they cease to exist they can no longer be pursued, any more than one could pursue someone for fraud after they had passed away.  One cannot pursue a company that no longer exists.  If one looks at the trading status currently of the companies which are listed as owing the Department money, 36% have been liquidated, 20% dissolved, 1% struck off, 6% in receivership but about 37% are still classified as normal.  While those companies continue to exist as a legal entity it does not mean that they are still trading but we will still pursue them if we can.  </p></speech>

Obviously, if someone fulfils the qualifications, one gets a number and multiplies the number by the rate and that is straightforward.  This section is one of the smaller items of expenditure, only about 5%, but that is almost &euro;1 billion, which is a lot of taxpayers' money.  In this particular section, there should be different metrics.  What is being done here is money is being spent to achieve a particular result - community employment schemes, rural social schemes and so on are designed to achieve something.  There seems to be no method of measurement, no metric by which one can measure their quality, how they are performing and what they are achieving.  If one looks at something like invalidity pensions or State pensions, an appropriate metric to put in is processing times, how quickly they are being processed and so on, but surely the metrics need to be different when we are spending money to achieve a particular result.  Surely there should be some mechanism to measure how effectively that money is being spent, identifying what result is being sought and how well this is being achieved.</p></speech>

The allocation for Gateway is down 65%.  We know the purpose of Gateway and I questioned the Minister on this previously.  The Minister said he was hoping to bring forward a replacement or an alternative scheme for local authorities.  My preferred choice would be to have staff working directly for councils within councils.  There has been no information on that replacement.  Is it the Minister's intention to bring something forward on that?</p> <p>  The other area is that of CE schemes, on which there are huge concerns.  The Minister has made an announcement about opening up the criteria to qualify for CE schemes but there is considerable concern that people who previously would have taken up CE schemes to provide essential community services are now being referred to JobPath and locked into it.  That is the difficulty for many people.  Many of the CE schemes and companies around the State are struggling to get people at present and the Minister's intentions are a little unclear. </p></speech>

From looking at the figures, I understand there was a reduction in the outcome versus the projected figure for the year, because of the uptake of CEs.

The outputs are things such as the movement of long-term unemployed people into employment, the reduction of the persistence rate, which is the rate at which short-term unemployed people become long-term unemployed, an increase in the exit rate for people on the live register for two years or more, long-term unemployed people referred to JobPath and the reduction in the overall ratio between youth unemployment and overall unemployment.</p><p>That shows the outturn for 2016 and also the performance indicators for 2017, which are relatively new.</p><p> Gateway is essentially being phased out.  It was introduced as a recession measure when local authorities could not afford staff.  We wanted to give people some work experience and have them do some useful work for the community as well.  We are engaged in more general conversation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and local authorities on having a division of T&uacute;s for local authorities.  My preference is that local authorities would take on more outdoor staff, which some are doing, in fairness.  There is also space for people to get work experience through T&uacute;s working for local authorities doing outdoor works and then go on from that to get a job with a local authority.  At any job interview immediately after being asked for one's name, one is asked to outline their experience.  It is not a bad idea to have some mechanism to give people experience working for a local authority to put them into a position to get the job when they subsequently apply for it.  In Fingal County Council a number of people who started on Gateway have gone on to work for the local authority, which is very positive.</p><p> A few weeks ago I announced a number of changes to open CE to a wider pool of people.  The consultation is ongoing at the moment with the supervisors and so on.  The plan is to have them in place for June, so they will take effect quite soon.  I would particularly like to see those exiting JobPath entering CE.  Many people spend a year on JobPath and get employment, but more of them do not.  I regard T&uacute;s people, who have tried the year with JobPath and have not got a job, as ideal candidates for CE.  There are 30,000 of them each year, which should be enough to fill any vacancies that exist on CE schemes.  I am trying to put in a better and more seamless engagement so that Intreo and my Department refer people on quickly to CE once people have been through JobPath and have not found a job.</p><p> I have committed to consider and make a decision over the summer on those aged over 55.  In rural areas, although not just in rural areas, it can be very difficult for people in their late 50s and 60s to find employment.  I would be open to relaxing the rules there to allow older workers - I do not like to describe 55 as older, but people in that age group from 55 to 66 - to perhaps stay on for longer.  I am very open to that.</p><p> The CE numbers are down.  I do not have the figures for before 2016.  As the Deputy knows, they were low, they went up and then they started falling in line with the recession.  The number of participants at the end of 2016 was 22,567.  Actually I do have the figures.  It was about 21,500 in 2012 and 21,400 in 2013.  It went up to 23,000 in 2014; 22,000 in 2015; and 22,500 in 2016.  These figures exclude supervisors.  Our estimate for this year is a fall to 22,311.  While it has gone down, it has not gone down dramatically when one hears those figures.  We are providing funding to keep the numbers the same.</p><p> The numbers in T&uacute;s, Gateway and JobBridge are certainly going down.  We are trying to maintain the numbers for CE.  The overall number on schemes went up to about 36,000, but that includes those on T&uacute;s, Gateway and all the rest of it.</p><p> We are still working on a replacement programme for JobBridge.  There has been consultation with unions and employers.  I have outlined the basic principles that I want to apply - hat there would be a training element to it; that employers would make a contribution; and that it not be paid any less than the minimum wage for the hours worked.  That is ongoing.  We still intend to have it operational by the second half of this year.  The question arises as to whether it is needed.  While I am meeting some employers who would like to see it reinstated, I do not have a huge number of people clamouring at my door to have a replacement for JobBridge.  We might do it in limited numbers and see how it goes.</p></speech>

I ask him to give us details on that.</p> <p>  Regarding the metrics, the target is to have a decision on disability allowance within 12 weeks.  Only 73% of claims are being decided within 12 weeks.  People can experience great hardship waiting for disability allowance.  They are people who do not have contributions and are too ill to work.  I know the Minister has set himself an ambitious target to make a decision on carer's allowance within one week.  Obviously, as he is only achieving 15% within that target, he may have to revise that.  The target for domiciliary care allowance is six weeks with only 2% success.  That is something that jumps out.</p> <p>  The allocation for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance was down by 6%.  Family income supplement increased slightly by 2%.  Has there been a further uptake of family income supplement?  I understand there was a PR campaign to advise people of their right to apply for family income supplement.  There was some slight increase in the amount because of a slight change in the income disregard.</p> <p>  In the interest of efficiency, I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

We are deciding 73% of disability allowance within 12 weeks, which has improved quite substantially.  I appreciate that anyone waiting that long is waiting a very long time.  Of course, we pay in arrears.  Much of the time people are on basic supplementary welfare allowance while they wait for the decision.  That is certainly something we need to improve and the same applies to DCA.  We have had some difficulty hiring medical staff.  I think we are at full complement now, which is the first time in a long time that we have had a full complement of medical assessors, which has helped significantly in improving waiting times.  We will improve them further.  However, at some times we run into issues.  As with any application system we can receive incomplete information requiring us to go back for more information and so on.</p> <p>  The budget for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance has been reduced.  That is largely a reflection of the reduction in the live register meaning that fewer people are entitled to it.  However, that is offset by an increase in the number of people entitled to FIS, which is a reflection of the increase in employment.</p> <p>  We estimate that an additional 2,000 families will become eligible to FIS in 2017.</p></speech>

Processing times for domiciliary care allowance payments are notable with only 2% of claims being awarded within six weeks.  The current waiting time is 15 weeks for that allowance.  What is the Minister doing to address that?</p> <p>  I note the Minister's comment earlier that he hopes to increase the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by 25% this year.  He said he hoped to use the money from other campaigns, but it is highly debatable that he will achieve anything close to that.  He mentioned a figure of &euro;10 million.  Is it the Minister's intention to move ahead irrespective of savings in his so-called fraud campaign?  I will be touching on that campaign in a moment.  What are his intentions around the back to school clothing and footwear allowance?</p> <p>  I have raised with the Minister previously the payment of the fuel allowance as one or two bulk payments.  I agree perhaps with what he said around the nature of the payments for jobseekers, but for old age pensioners, one or two bulk payments could be considered.</p> <p>  I must question the Minister's so-called fraud campaign.  It is very questionable and has come in for a great deal of scrutiny.  Certainly, the Minister's figure of &euro;506 million is very questionable.  The Department's method of calculation is bizarre.  We are talking about notional money.  On overpayments since 2016, we had a saving of &euro;61.9 million.  It was &euro;48.9 million in 2015 and &euro;52.5 million in 2015.  Last year, there was a saving to the Department of &euro;41 million from overpayments and fraudulent claims.  As such, giving the figure of &euro;506 million is being described as a hate campaign.  It is being described as the Minister going on a solo run and I tend to agree with what has been quoted from former employees of the Department.  The whole campaign is a fraud in itself aimed at criminalising a whole sector which includes many vulnerable people.  Does the Minister stand over those figures?</p></speech>

This is a family show so I will not use the expletives I would otherwise.  I find it nauseating that the Minister would use &euro;200,000 of public funds to humiliate people on social welfare.  I ask the Minister if he has ever been on social welfare.  He can answer that later.  As Deputy Brady asked, is this a solo run or a team effort?  If it is a team effort, everyone at the table over there should be ashamed.  They are trying to humiliate people who are trying to find work.  Bernadette Gorman touched on it on RTE when she said it was a type of class and ideological warfare committed by the Department of Social Protection.  In the context of the overall budget, this is a fraction.  More important is the other fraud that goes on in this country in terms of white collar and corporate crime and corporate welfare.  I do not see anyone being named and shamed there.  The idea that the Minister will publish the names of people who have in his eyes defrauded the State by miscalculation or misinterpretation is ideological warfare.  What about those who have bankrupted this country?  What about putting them on billboards and buses?  I take my cue from Bernadette Gorman who was brilliant on RTE the other day.  She gave a very good insight into the vindictiveness towards those who are trying to do their best.  There is no doubt that there is a small element who are defrauding social welfare, which one cannot condone.  However, in the greater context, the Minister ought to be ashamed of what he has tried to do here.</p></speech>

I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on the amount of that allocation which related to fraud and the figure of &euro;41 million was provided.  I have done a quick calculation and determined that &euro;41 million is one fifth of 1% of the total social welfare budget.  It could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as a major issue.  While it is part of the heads of the Social Welfare Bill which we will be discussing in more detail in a fortnight, I ask for the following clarification.  My reading of the heads is slightly different from that of Deputy Kenny.  I ask for an assurance that if we go ahead with publishing names, an idea I do not like albeit we do it for Revenue defaulters, no one who has not been convicted of social welfare fraud will have his or her name published.</p></speech>

The reason we are not meeting the target relates largely to a High Court judgment which required us to modify the process for deciding DCA and other medical scheme applications to demonstrate that the decisions comply with social welfare legislation.  The High Court found in April 2016 that the decision letter provided in a negative decision for DCA cases was deficient.  To ensure compliance with the judgment, the DCA section has introduced a much more detailed decision letter which requires significantly more work in each application.  That has resulted in approximately 50% of applications having to be dealt with by a smaller number of officers at a higher grade in a manner which takes significant additional time.</p> <p>  We are resolving this.  A new assessment process was, co-incidentally, introduced at the same time with a new version of the application forms.  Supplementary medical forms were also brought in.  This has seen the percentage of applications awarded at first assessment and initial decision increase from 43% to 75%, which is positive.  As such, 75% of people are being approved where it used to be much lower with many appeals.  Over 80% of applications are ultimately successful and that has led to a significant reduction in appeal numbers.  While the initial waiting times are much longer than we would wish, the fact that a higher percentage of people are being awarded on first applying has helped more customers to receive their entitlements more quickly, which is positive.</p> <p>  Any increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will have to be on foot of a Government decision.  We are seeing savings emerge across the Department of Social Protection Vote which is due largely to unemployment falling this year again and faster even than we had anticipated.  I have no doubt that there will be overruns in other Departments, however, and public sector pay negotiations will come up also.  I will fight the corner to be allowed to hang on to some of those savings, but that is going to be a Government decision.</p><p> In terms of the fuel allowance, Age Action has suggested a bulk payment for the fuel allowance while other groups hold a different view.  I have an open mind on the matter.  It would be very complicated for us to administer bulk payments for some and weekly payments for others.  We would have to go one way or the other.  There are differing views on the matter.  I have no objection in principle to moving towards a bulk payment if that is the consensus.</p><p> The sum of &euro;41 million represents overpayment fraud.  I have a copy of the advertisement for the campaign in front of me.  We clearly stated in it that the &euro;500 million refers to control and anti-fraud activity.  We put the word "control" before anti-fraud activity.  I am not sure members are familiar with Aristotle's 13 fallacies.  One of his fallacies is that one claims somebody said something and then lecture him or her on why he or she was wrong.  We have always maintained that the &euro;500 million refers to control and anti-fraud activity.  The advertisement is on the billboards.  One can clearly see that we put the word "control" ahead of anti-fraud in case anyone thought we were trying to say it was just fraud.  The figure of &euro;41 million refers to overpayment fraud, not just overpayments.  There is roughly &euro;110 million a year in overpayments of which &euro;41 million is customer fraud.  I do not think the sum is minuscule.  It is taxpayers' money.  I think it is a lot of taxpayers' money, quite frankly.  Having been a Minister in Departments with much smaller budgets than this one I know the kind of things we could have done for &euro;41 million, which would have made a big difference in people's lives.  The contempt some members of the left in this country have for taxpayers, the work they do and the money they pay into the system bothers me.</p></speech>

The sum of &euro;41 million is only a proportion of that and I would like us to recover a lot more of it.  If I was in the Department of Finance, I would adopt the same approach to tax fraud and other fraud.</p> <p>  I did not invent the calculation of &euro;506 million.  It is based on a statistical model and it was developed with the CSO.  The model is used in other countries and it is used for comparative purposes.  My Department stands over the use of such a model.  It is one of the more conservative models.  Much higher multiples are used in Sweden when conducting its estimates.  Sweden has a very advanced welfare state.</p> <p>  I will answer Deputy O'Dea's question and correct him and others.  Any list produced of people convicted of welfare fraud will not be people who have committed welfare fraud in my eyes.  They will be people who have been convicted of welfare fraud in a court of law in this State.  It is already public information.  News media outlets regularly report on these cases.  We will do much less than what Revenue does.  Revenue produces lists of settlements, as well as convictions.  We will only produce a list of convictions and not of people who have appealed their convictions.  The provision will only apply to new cases for constitutional reasons.  The provision will not apply to people who are already in the process.  The list will comprise people who have been convicted of fraud in a court of law.</p></speech>

The Minister talked about control and anti-fraud activity, saving &euro;500 million and the methodology used.  The latter is not transparent.  I know how the sum of &euro;506 million has been calculated.  The Minister has said that &euro;172 million comes from jobseekers' payment.  In 2016, his Department conducted 246,741 investigations or reviews.  The answers to the following questions are not transparent to the committee.   What percentage of those were found to have a liability to make up the sum of &euro;172 million?  What percentage of the total jobseekers were involved in the first place?  What was the targeting process?  We do not have time to go through these matters now.  The same questions about the methodology of calculating the &euro;506 million apply to all of the other schemes, whether it is the carer's allowance or otherwise.  How did the Department select the investigations or reviews?  What percentage of the total were they?  What percentage of the reviews had an income?  </p> <p>  With the permission of the Minister and his officials, I would like the financial scrutiny team from the Oireachtas, which has worked in preparing some of this, to work with the officials to bring some transparency to this and produce a document for the benefit of members.  The Minister builds in the figure into the Estimates on an annual basis.  We need some understanding of it but we do not have time today to adequately address this matter in full detail.  Are the Minister's officials prepared to work with the committee secretariat's financial scrutiny team on this matter?</p></speech>

I concur with everything  the Chairman said.  The figures do not stack up.  As the Chairman said, it is not transparent.  The Minister said the same formula is used by other countries but I disagree.  In 2014, two fraud and error surveys were commenced and the savings generated were much higher than in 2015 when three surveys were conducted.  Surveys take place on an annual basis.  The Department does not need big fancy campaigns that have a budget of &euro;200,000 to penalise and categorise people as fraudulent.  That was the essence of the campaign.</p> <p>  I mention the redundancy payments where &euro;345 million of taxpayers' money was written off.  The Department did not roll out a similar campaign in that case.</p></speech>

As much as five sixths of our publicity budget is used on telling people about things they are entitled to, and we will keep doing so.  Not that long ago there was a campaign on insurance fraud that asked people to report fraudsters.  It was broadcast on television, aired on radio and displayed on billboards.  The reason for the campaign was because we all pay for insurance fraud through our insurance policies.  Something similar applies to social welfare fraud because if it occurs, we all pay for it through social insurance and taxes.  I do not remember a single person at the time suggesting that we were demonising everyone who had insurance or made an insurance claim.  It is a nonsensical argument.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome the president of the Ulster Farmers Union, Mr. Barclay Bell, and the chief executive, Mr. Wesley Aston.  It has become clear quickly from our meetings so far, especially in agriculture, that our two economies are intertwined and linked in very fundamental ways, with daily transfers across the Border and back again of milk products, cattle, pork and so on.  For some products, the raw material comes from one side of the Border to the other for processing and for other products.  Before I invite our guests to speak, I want to welcome them again.  My late grandfather farmed cattle on the Cavan-Fermanagh border for many years, as Senator Joe O'Reilly knows.  I would not say he was cattle-rustling at the time, but many products went back and forth seamlessly many years ago.  Before we begin, I would like to read out a note on privilege.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses, or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>With all that out of the way, I welcome the witnesses and ask them to speak.</p></speech>

We appreciate the opportunity to come and present here this morning.</p> <p>  I will start by saying a little about the Ulster Farmers Union.  We have between 11,500 and 12,000 members.  There are 25,000 farm businesses in Northern Ireland, so we are a key player in the North.  I think all the members of the committee have a copy of our presentation.  We will start on the second slide, which addresses the matter of where we are now.  It mentions the political situation in both Northern Ireland and the mainland UK.  At present, when we do not have devolution, we do not have anybody sitting at Stormont and we do not have anybody in London right now, we feel somewhat exposed as an industry in that we do not actually have anybody to talk to.  Hopefully there will be somebody by the end of June.  It could be a longer process up at Stormont.  As far as the Ulster Farmers Union goes, our process has been a case where we have consulted.  We started off the week after the referendum and tried to identify ten key goals and what was going to be important to the farming industry going forward.  Since then, we have started to develop our thinking, and, just last week, we launched a discussion document on possible support arrangements for the industry going forward.  That is all happening and live at present.</p> <p>  I think the biggest issue here is probably the uncertainty.  There is no real clarity anywhere at the minute.  Article 50 has been triggered.  After the general election in the UK, we will maybe start to get a bit more clarity.  From the Ulster Farmers Union's point of view, we had ten key goals.  Those were identified in the first fortnight after the referendum, and we are focusing on four main themes.  They are trade, agriculture support, regulation, and labour.  We liaise closely with our counterparts in Scotland, England and Wales, as we do with the Irish Farmers Association here as well.  When we looked at the four themes, the one which we identified as being key in all of this was the issue of trade.  Trade and trade deals will affect everything else.  While there seemed to be some doubt around whether the UK was leaving the customs union or not, in some recent discussions we had just last week, at our premier show in the North, we got an indication from the Secretary of State that we would be leaving the customs union.  The term "a deep and special partnership" is used, which we want.  The defining of that is important.</p> <p>  Trade North to South is one of our key issues.  I am sure members of the committee are all aware of the statistics about milk.  Probably 30% of our milk pool travels up and down on a daily basis.  Probably upwards of 40% of our lambs are processed here in Southern meat plants.  Conversely - I am not sure of the exact figure - many pigs head north for slaughter and processing.</p><p>The logistics of crossing the Border on a daily basis must be worked out.  There is no doubt that flexible and imaginative solutions will be required.  Procedures that slow down the transportation of milk and lambs to the South and pigs to the North would have a major impact.  The extent of trade and trade deals will have a major impact on the level of support needed by farmers.  </p><p> The agriculture sector in Northern Ireland receives approximately &pound;300 million sterling per annum from the United Kingdom.  We have been given an assurance that this level of support will be guaranteed until 2020.  Our big fear concerns what will happen after 2020.</p><p> Some farmers voted to leave the European Union as they had become very frustrated with the current regulations under the Common Agricultural Policy.  We like to think there will be an opportunity to draw up an agricultural policy for the United Kingdom which would be fit for purpose and move the industry to a different level.  The key to this is the government not taking Ulster farmers over a cliff edge.  Agriculture and agricultural industries will need a transitional period.  A new support system must be focused on productivity, under which the farmer producing the goods will be rewarded, there will be environmental sustainability and some level of regionalisation.  We hope a devolved government will be back in place.  There have been some suggestions of a UK agriculture Bill.  We would like to see legislation to give certainty to the industry and, possibly, ring-fence a pot of money in an agriculture Bill.  Noises have come from Whitehall in that regard and we will watch with interest to see what happens.</p><p> There has been a considerable level of activity by the Ulster Farmers Union in the past couple of months and it will ramp up throughout the summer.</p><p> The conversion of EU law into domestic law will result from the great repeal Bill and we hope to see regulation evolve over a period of years.  There will be an evolution of regulation and we hope it will be science based and that we will see advocacy first and regulation second.  We have seen a few examples of this model working in the North.  We believe advocacy first and regulation second is sometimes a better way of working.</p><p> Labour is a significant issue.  Upwards of 65% of the workforce in the agrifood industry and meat processing plants are migrant labourers.  A major concern for the wider industry is access to labour.  The Ulster Farmers Union and the four UK unions believe this is an issue the British Government could sort out quickly.  It is not only in the agrifood industry that there is a requirement for labour, it crosses many industries in every MP's constituency.  There is a need for a statement on the supply of migrant labourers.  As I said, this is an issue that could be sorted out quickly by the British Government. </p><p> The Ulster Farmers Union believes farmers need the best possible access to European markets and that they need to secure additional trade agreements outside the European Union.  The fear when the United Kingdom enters into trade deals will centre on whether the food imports are produced to similar standards to those applying in the United Kingdom.  Farmers could not accept product produced to lower standards being imported into the United Kingdom.  A key point is that anything that would disrupt the existing trading relation between the North and the South could have very damaging effects.  We have high animal health and plant health standards in Northern Ireland and want to see them maintained.  There are no borders when it comes to animal and plant health. </p><p> I will compare the level of growth in exports from the food and drink sector in the years from 2005 to 2014.  A strategy report from three or four years ago identified the potential of the agrifood industry in the North.  Since 2005 the percentage increase in food and drink sector sales was 96% to Great Britain, 114% to the Republic of Ireland and 135% to other EU member states.  Milk and milk products, as well as beef and sheepmeat, are the significant contributors to this growth.</p><p> The rates of food self-sufficiency in the United Kingdom have been highlighted in the past seven or eight months.  The United Kingdom is only 61% self-sufficient in food production.  We have a table that shows that the United Kingdom has a self-sufficiency rate of 55% for pork and 75% for beef.  There is room to supply product to the UK market.  We have another table in which we compare imports and exports that shows the UK trade imbalance by commodity.  There is a major trade gap, with a significant level of imports of poultry products.  It extends right across the board to beef, lamb, dairy and pork products, but the difference is less marked in the case of eggs.</p><p> We have set out in tabular form alternatives to EU membership.</p><p>Members will see from the tables there is not much change at the top but if they then go right down to the two free trade agreements and to the figures for the World Trade Organization, right down at the bottom, they will see a lot of red boxes and many things that would change.  At the moment we are looking at all these alternatives.  There is much talk about the Norwegian model and reference was made to the Cypriot model.  Currently, we are trying to look at all the different scenarios going forward.  This presentation has been a quick overview.  Trade, labour, regulation and agriculture support are the four key areas that we as an industry are trying to get our heads around in order to move the whole debate on, and in the absence of any political stability in the North.</p></speech>

I wish to tease out a little more information to get to the kernel of the issue and for report purposes.  I am on the record as saying - I do so on a weekly basis with the different groups who appear before us - that we are all hoping for the best but we must think and plan for the worst case scenario.  With this in mind, from a farming perspective, during the campaign one of the selling points of the side canvassing for Brexit was the crippling EU standards and red tape that farmers have to meet.  I am a farmer and I know there are days when it is frustrating.  Northern Ireland farmers would not have to maintain those standards if the UK went on a solo run, to coin a phrase.  If the farmers in the North intend to trade with any other EU country, tariff-free or otherwise, their product will not be accepted unless it is to an equal standard at least.  What do the witnesses think of this? The farm sector may maintain the standards but it will be policed by a different body even if it is not policed by Brussels or Strasbourg.  While the process may be identical and if things get tweaked on paper to have, in theory, better standards going forward, it may not be recognised as such within the EU.  I would like to hear the thoughts of the Ulster Farmers Union on that issue.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the points raised in regard to the break-up of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It must be very frustrating for farmers with no assembly, no Parliament and no Government at the moment.  Where do they go with their concerns?  I would like to know where the Ulster Farmers Union was in respect of lobbying before the breakdown of the Assembly.  The Irish Farmers Association - the UFU sister group here in the South - will appear before the committee later today and I will ask it the same question.  I would like to know what level of contact both organisations have with each other, how closely they are working together and how intertwined are the approaches.</p> <p>  Aside from the trade aspect, for my sins I have a small interest in breeding pure-bred Aberdeen Angus.  At the Carrick-on Shannon show, which is the biggest one, more than 50% of the cattle on show and for sale are from Northern Ireland.  Have we gone that far down the line if there is a hard Border?  How will events such as this be affected?  Will the breeders and farmers from Northern Ireland be able to show their stock in Ireland?  How will the different standards affect this?  Trade aside, the Ulster Farmer's Union might look at the overall picture of an all-island activity.  Some would consider this to be a hobby or a sport.  While it is within the farming remit, farmers are not in it to make money, they are in it for the love of it.  This is just one example.  How badly will events such as this be affected with a hard Border?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1724" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1397" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#C00400"><p>I join my colleagues Senator Daly and the Chairman in welcoming our guests today.  I am delighted they are here.  I thank them for the accessible documentation they provided to the committee.  It is very clear and easy to deal with.  Before going into specifics, in a general sense, is the Ulster Farmers Union contemplating a special deal for the island of Ireland within the overall deal?  Are Northern Ireland's farmers contemplating the special trading arrangement that might emerge from the possibility of using a combination of the Good Friday Agreement and our relationship with the EU that could result in east-west trading between Ireland and England, which would facilitate trade if at all possible without customs and tariffs?  Are the farmers contemplating that sort of solution or is that too pie in the sky?</p> <p>  I live in County Cavan and I am very conscious of the specifics that have been raised such as the 30% of milk being processed in the South, the 40% of lamb and the numbers of pigs that go North.  A local co-op has a processing plant in my own town.  Lakeland Dairies is a substantial employer in the area and accesses quite an amount of its milk north of the Border.  It is processed in Bailieborough and in Lough Egish.  It was said that we need imaginative supports and I presume the witnesses are speaking of customs being electronic or involving minimal physical delays.  There would be costs associated with that.  Would this make it an unviable option for an organisation such as Lakeland Dairies to continue that arrangement and would it be unviable for the pigs to travel to the North in the event of a customs union?  This raises another question.  From their meetings or from anecdotal evidence, does Mr. Bell or Mr. Aston believe there is any chance that we will get a return to anything akin to free trade between the UK and the EU, although that prospect may have receded a bit lately?</p> <p>  Subsidies are a very serious issue, obviously.  I presume that the Ulster Farmers Union see the source of subsidies of food as being the domestic UK Government after the transition period post-Brexit?  Are the witnesses concerned about the political factors that will be at work there?  The political factors and the strong lobbyists must surely concern them.  There would not be a strong farmer lobby in an overall UK context but there would be a need for food and relatively cheaply produced food.  One would have to look at how the second consideration would work.</p> <p>  With regard to food and the veterinary area, are the farmers in Northern Ireland advocating for the veterinary standards, about which Senator Daly spoke earlier?  Will veterinary standards, traceability and food standards for hormone-free food all be maintained at current levels whatever the regulatory body is?  Are they of the view that food could not come in from other outside countries - Commonwealth or otherwise - that would be sub-standard?  Is the Ulster Farmers Union advocating strongly on that issue?  I would be interested to hear their views on it.</p> <p>  The labour aspect is very interesting.  From talking with people at all levels in the UK - public and private individuals - the big issue in determining the Brexit referendum vote appears to have been immigration.  It is clear from what the witnesses have said, and I agree with them as I know it to be the case in Ireland also, that there will be a need for labour to come in from outside.  I would like the union representative to elaborate more on this.  How does the Ulster Farmers Union see this objective being achieved in the context of the controls wanted by Brexiteers?  Keeping control of immigration was their number one issue.  The labour issue is a practical reality that may not have dawned on everybody.  It would have dawned on people at the witnesses' level but ordinary punters wanted to vote out aspects of immigration they perceived as troublesome.  They did not realise the downside to that.</p> <p>  I am very heartened to see the destination of Northern Ireland's food and drink sector sales and growth over the last years and the trading relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland strengthening.</p><p>It would be a shame that anything would thwart or change this.  I ask the witnesses to comment on this.  It is great that a delegation from the Ulster Farmers Union is present because we want to hear from it, and then put the same questions in a converse way to the IFA to see if we can arrive at an overview.</p></speech>

It is good to see them.  We can all appreciate the detail in the report and the presentation given to us this morning.  For me it is quite stark because it indicates just how much of a disaster Brexit has the potential to be for our economy, North and South.  I am struggling, with the greatest respect, to see any positives for the agriculture or agrifood sectors or for anyone else.  We do not want the British Government to take us over a cliff edge and, unfortunately we are dangling very dangerously close to the edge at present.  We have highlighted some points on the issue of trade, and I am sure that witnesses have seen the reports on the front page of the Irish News today that potentially one in 12 vehicles will be stopped.  This comes in light of the fact the Irish Government has conceded it is scoping out sites for customs checks along the Border at present.  There is the issue of labour and more than 65% of workers in the food and meat producing sector are migrant workers, which I believe is a significant figure when we consider the ethos of the Brexit lobbying and campaign.  Senator O'Reilly covered much of what I had intended to ask.  I hope we can expand on the issue of funding support, which it is indicated will be maintained to 2020.  What engagements have the witnesses had with the British Government on it meeting and matching its commitment on EU subsidies and other EU funding sources and streams?  What indications have they had from the British Government?  Prime Minister Theresa May launched her manifesto this morning.  I do not know whether it featured, but I could be corrected.</p></speech>

Many questions have already been put.  I am struck by the statement, which we know to be the case, that there is dissatisfaction among Northern Irish farmers with the CAP.  Malcontent with the CAP is no news down here either.  Overregulation was cited by Senator Daly and there is also a perceived unfair distribution of the funds.  There is always a running battle about how the pie should be divided up and who is more worthy.  In reality, is this a significant factor in the decision of those who wanted to leave?  How do the witnesses envisage conducting their farming differently if they are not subject to the CAP?  What difference will it make in how they do their business?  I am speaking about what people are trying to get away from by removing themselves from the European Union.  It follows from Senator Daly's question.  How will it tally with farmers doing business with the European Union and the standards to which they will need to adhere?</p> <p>  Is it not a fact that many of the ills of farming can be more attributed to international factors, such as the commodity prices of milk and beef and the price of inputs, such as fertiliser and fuel, which we know are volatile?  Is this reality?  We are where we are, in that the vote has happened, but I am interested because it is a recurring theme here.  We are looking at it with regard to areas of natural constraint and the distribution of funds.  Do the witnesses have concerns about the possible importation, or the liberalisation of the importation, of meat and other foodstuffs from South America?  What assurances have they received?  What feedback have they received from the British Government on this?  What are the witnesses asking?  Are they stating this will not be acceptable or will they state they will lower their regulatory standards?  How do they see this panning out?  Where will they be on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1728" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#D00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for travelling here today and for their presentation.  I wish to focus on certain comments that have been made and then ask questions.  With regard to agricultural supports, people from Westminster who came before the committee recently made it perfectly clear it was their desire that any outstanding funds due to the EU to 2020 would not be paid and as far as possible it would be a cut and run.  If it is a cut and run, the &pound;300 million, I assume, is tied up in the 2020 agreement.  Given the size of the agricultural lobby in the UK, if the UK does not live up to its commitment to the EU do the witnesses see the &pound;300 million disappearing well before 2020?  This would be detrimental to the farming sector in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  The figures produced by the witnesses on growth in Northern Irish products are impressive to say the very least.  However, I would like to know how much of this the witnesses attribute to the all-Ireland marketing of agrifood products.  There is no doubt we are on the premium side of agrifood, and I assume this is as much in Northern Ireland as it is in the Republic.  Like Senator Mulherin, I am concerned that in certain parts of England cost would drive the market rather than quality.  We can expect that in the south-east high quality will still be in high demand, but in some of the other parts of England cost will probably drive it.</p> <p>  In an ideal world if the witnesses were told tomorrow morning by Theresa May and the European Union they can write their own deal what would they want?  How would they see it work?  Do they see a benefit in us marketing Ireland the island for agrifood?  The Border is a bit of a joke when we speak about agriculture because farmers in Northern Ireland can have their cattle in the North in morning and in the South in the afternoon.  The Acting Chairman and I were in Brussels, where we were told to bring a solution and do not mind how ridiculous it might sound because they might just take it.  The witnesses have been given a free canvas to write their own solution and I ask them to tell me how they would do it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1729" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#D00500"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentation.  I want to broaden it to the strategic.  As I understand it, the 2020 guarantee is not very significant.  The CAP is coming up for review in 2020.  We are now in 2017 and Article 50 has been triggered, which will bring us up to 2019.  The 2020 horizon will be on us very soon.  The real question is what is Britain's policy on agriculture and food thereafter.  Is it the view of the Ulster Farmers Union that the UK will pursue a low-cost agricultural system from now on?  If the UK as an economy is pursuing low-cost food prices and unsubsidised agriculture then given the prevalence of world prices, it clearly has very strong implications as to what can be done on an all-Ireland basis, especially if Europe is going in one direction under a revised CAP and the UK is going towards a cheap food policy, with imports from South America and New Zealand.</p><p>Secondly, in that context, I can see from the Ulster Farmers Union charts that the United Kingdom is a net importer of food.  Therefore if it is isolated as a unit, there were tariffs and there was an expanding market at current prices, it feeds into the first question.  If Britain regards itself as free to pursue a cheap food policy, can Northern Ireland agriculture go along with this?  Can it benefit from it?  </p><p> The farmers' union members, like us all, are looking in a crystal ball, but what are their views?  Westminster seems to have been engaged in a decade long series of public expenditure cuts.  Do they see it taking over the process of subsidising agriculture beyond 2020 at current levels?  I would be interested to know where Mr. Bell sees Ulster farmers interests being protected and how that would be done in terms of the UK strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1731" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barclay Bell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#E00200"><p>I may bring the chief executive in at different times.  There is quite a range of questions.</p> <p>  Senator Daly touched on was regulation.  We only have to ask some of our producers in, for example, the vegetable sector, who is driving the regulation.  They will say that it was not the EU regulation that really bothered them, but the regulation from the retailers.  Some of our farmers got hung up about regulation, that there was going to be a bonfire of regulation, but we would see this more as an evolution of regulation.  Some of the regulation that has perhaps come out of Brussels has been very difficult for farmers to understand.  It has not been science based.  What we are saying is that any new regulation has to be science based and there might be a change in the delivery of the regulation, but we are adamant that regulation is here to stay.  Retailers will drive regulation.  We will have to satisfy that regulation and there is a full recognition out there that if we want to export product into the EU, we will have to meet those standards.  It might be more the case that there will be a simplification of the regulation and its delivery.  Commissioner Hogan has indicated that he wants to try to continue to simplify the regulation within the EU.</p> <p>  There was a question of how we were getting on with Stormont before it fell.  We were making good inroads there.  The worth of the agrifood industry to Northern Ireland is recognised across all political parties in the North when one considers this is an industry worth over &pound;4.5 billion to Northern Ireland.  In the wider agrifood industry, including processing, over 100,000 jobs are hooked on the industry.  We are convinced that our politicians in Northern Ireland fully understand what the agrifood industry is all about, but the bigger fear is whether that message gets through across the water in Whitehall.  That is why, along with everyone in the North at the moment, they want to see Stormont back up and running.  We need representation there, fighting our corner.  We are in a good place on recognition around the importance of the agrifood industry.</p> <p>  We have strong links with the Irish Farmers Association and we meet on a regular basis.  There is a recognition that the Border is a key issue in all of this when one considers that we may well have farmers who are farming North and South because their lands straddle the Border.  We are told there are 250 or 260 roads crossing the Border, never mind all the little farm tracks.  I do not think anyone wants to see us going back to a hard border, but there will have to be a lot of thinking on how we find imaginative solutions.  We have good relations and meet regularly; we attended the IFA's big event in Goffs recently.  We meet Joe Healy and the team in Brussels quite often too.  There is a good line of communication there.  </p> <p>  What was Senator Daly's exact question on trade?  Was it about the Aberdeen Angus?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1732" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#E00300"><p>Yes, on trade, like the farmers straddling the Border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1733" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barclay Bell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#E00400"><p>In that situation, animal health and plant health requires an all-island policy.  The Border does not recognise TB or whatever issue.  There has to be that sort of freedom that animals can cross.  When one thinks back to when there was a hard border, animals moved fairly freely when one thinks about the number of cattle that would have come up to the North for finishing or whatever.  There was a fairly free movement of cattle then but, as we outlined in our initial presentation, there has to be some thinking done around how we can have an all-island plant and animal health programme in the future.  If my colleague, Mr. Wesley Aston, wants to butt in at any stage, he should do so.</p> <p>  Senator O'Reilly mentioned the possibility of a special deal for Ireland and how that arrangement might look east-west or North-South, for that matter.  There has to be some imaginative thinking around that.  The east-west arrangement is equally as important as the North-South arrangement.  There does not look to be any clear thinking about that now and perhaps that cannot move on quickly until our own local politicians get involved.  All this relates to there being a political vacuum at the moment and we find it difficult to talk to the right people.  So far, in London, we have spoken to the Department of Exiting the EU and to Andrea Leadsom in the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.  We have not yet had access to Liam Fox.  The National Farmers Union in England and Wales has had access to Liam Fox and the Department of International Trade, but at this stage we have not had access to Liam Fox.  He is a man we would like to get to talk to and this goes back to the point regarding what they are thinking about international trade and trade deals.  Are they going to rush off to sign deals with other countries, maybe other Commonwealth countries?  It is key that we get some insight into the thinking around international trade.</p><p>The Senator mentioned milk.  Was it around the costs?</p></speech>

There are tariffs.  It is all sorts of things, such as the non-tarriff barriers.  That is going back to this issue of equivalent standards and ensuring we have the veterinary checks and everything put in place.  That is the bigger concern because that has to be done over and above the normal traditional customs posts.  That is why we are always keen to minimise any disruption between the North and the South in terms of trade.  That is why, while one could argue about a special deal, we have been told clearly in Brussels that it is not special status that we are going for.  It is encouraging, from our point of view, that any time we have been in Brussels there is a clear recognition of the issue on the island of Ireland.  However, in relation to Senator McDowell's point, it does not go as far as recognising that there is an east-west issue.  There is a North-South issue on which it is very focused.  It does not necessarily see east-west as being its problem and I can understand that.  That is a very important issue.</p> <p>  We do want to minimise any potential trading barriers, whether it is tariffs or non-tariffs.  Non-tariffs could actually be a bigger issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barclay Bell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#F00400"><p>The Senator also mentioned subsidies and asked if there is the political will in the UK Government to continue with subsidies.  It comes back to the point about food security and to the point that the UK is only 61% self-sufficient and all indications are the British consumer wants food produced to a high standard.  It is very much a red line issue, as far as the farming unions go, that we cannot accept that there would be food coming in to the UK produced to lower standards.  I suppose one has to think of whether a trade deal should be struck with the US.  There is the hormone-treated beef and the chlorinated chicken.  Those are the sorts of issues.  That is really a red line issue for us.  We all recognise, both in the UK and Ireland, that we are producing food to some of the highest standards probably in the world.  Why should that be jeopardised and why would one even consider exporting an industry to some other part of the world where, maybe, on welfare grounds or on environmental grounds, they cannot come up to the standards that we have to satisfy?  That maybe covers the Senator's point around veterinary, that is, about such matters as the hormones and chlorinated chicken.</p> <p>  We still believe the issue of immigration and labour is one that the UK Government could sort out fairly quickly.  This is low-hanging fruit that affects a huge range of industries right across agrifood, hospitality - you name it.  The labour requirement is huge.  One need only ask some of our agrifood processors if they were to try to employ local labour whether they could they get it.  The answer is simply "No."  The labour issue is a big one.</p> <p>  Senator Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile also mentioned the labour issue.  We made the point that it is one of the first issues that could be sorted.  I suppose it is right up there in the top three.  Michael Barnier has indicated that both the Border issue and the labour issue have to get sorted fairly quickly.  We feel this is one where we need a clear statement from the UK Government.</p> <p>  Obviously, I agree there are concerns around customs posts and how this would work out.  That will build costs into the system.  It will slow down the transport of product to the South.  I refer to anything that will build costs into the system, if there are to be some sort of customs checks.  In any of our discussions with officials from here, there seems to be electronic methods to get around some of this but, as I stated, on costs or those sheer logistics on a daily basis, we have got so used to just driving up and down the road that nobody wants to go back to where one would have to stop or whatever.</p> <p>  On funding support, as farming organisations right across the UK, we have a major job to convince the UK Government that this is an industry worth supporting.  We have to go right back to the fact of food security.  Food security is important to any government.  Why would one consider exporting an industry to somewhere else in the world?  Over the past ten years, we have seen the issue of horse meat and some of the food scares there have been.  That tightened everything up in the UK.  There was this big focus on short supply chains.  Those are some of the points we have to hammer home, as well as the fact that currently 30% of our payment is linked to environmental stewardship of our farms.  We fully accept we have a responsibility to deliver such environmental stewardship and that is something we can demonstrate.  Anyone would say that if one takes the farmers out of the countryside, one will soon see the countryside completely changed.  Therefore, farmers have to be kept in the countryside.  It is not only about producing food.  It is about the wider rural communities.  If one takes the farmer out of the countryside, rural communities will suffer big time in all of this.</p> <p>  Senator Mulherin mentioned the unfair distribution within CAP and how we might see a new model of delivery.  We have a discussion document, which, as I said, we are happy to share with the committee, that the 15 committees within Ulster Farmers Union considered.  What we are suggesting is that any new delivery model has to be geared towards those who are being productive, who are active and are looking after the countryside, but key to all of this is that they have to be productive.  We are suggesting that there would be some sort of baseline payment which would satisfy baseline environmental standards.  That baseline pot of money would also deliver around education and training.  It might deliver around marketing.  For the farmer who really wanted to move his business on, I suppose there was this thinking that the old system of subsidies did not incentivise anyone to be efficient, to be productive and to move one's business on.  We are saying that, on top of this baseline, one would then have these different pillars or modules, or call them what one may.  Should that be possibly a capital grants system to assist one in driving efficiencies on?  Should it be, for example, producer organisations?  There would be a pot of money for that.  There would also be a pot of money if one wanted to raise one's animal welfare or plant health to a higher standard, if one wanted to really go for that.</p><p>There could be another pillar for those wishing to reach higher environmental standards.  One could broaden the range of issues to include rural broadband and diversification.  Take tourism, it is not for everybody but if there was money available it would allow people to make choices.  There should be something for everyone.  The farmer has to decide whether he wants to make himself more proficient and his business more efficient, more productive and more sustainable.  We would try to put forward a policy to drive that sort of thinking in the industry.</p><p> The document was only released last week.  We intend to canvass our members and the wider industry in the next number of months to get their opinions on it.  I think part of the problem with the CAP is that it does not reward the person who wants to be productive and efficient.  This is a way that we would see agriculture moving forward.</p><p> The British Government may decide that it wishes to import low-cost product from the rest of the world, but it goes back to the point that we cannot accept imports from countries, where the product is produced to a lower standard.  I think that is a red-line issue for us and I think it is a red-line issue for the four UK unions.  Why would one consider such a proposal?  We are strong on that issue.</p><p> On the issue of unsubsidised agriculture, it is always a threat.  The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Ms Andrea Leadsom, and Ms Theresa May have played their cards reasonably close to their chest.  We do not know what will happen after 2020 at this stage.  We hope that under the changes we will still get continued support.  Change takes time.  If there are proposed changes in agriculture, there must be a transition period.  We cannot go over a cliff edge.  We all know that farming is a cyclical business.  There is a lead-in period so we cannot change overnight.  That is a fear for the farming industry.</p><p> Some of the indications from Brussels are that the pot of money for reform of the CAP will be under pressure.  When the UK leaves the European Union, there will be a big hole that must be filled in some way or other.  Some of the conversations would suggest that the money will start to move east to some of the less productive countries in the European Union in the next round of CAP negotiations.  There are those considerations.</p></speech>

Naturally, our contribution will focus on the agriculture and food sector.  Unsurprisingly, our overall view is that the best outcome from the perspective of the Irish agriculture and food sector would involve as little change as possible to the current nature of trading and relationships among Ireland, the European Union and the United Kingdom.  I refer members to our presentation handout.  I will talk them very briefly through a few key points.  A great deal of the information on the initial assessment of the impact of Brexit, or at least what has been referred to as a &quot;hard Brexit&quot;, is well known at this stage.  I will focus on a couple of aspects which are perhaps not as well appreciated.<br/><br/>The key issues include the trade impact which is the dominant economic impact, but I also wish to focus on some issues related to North-South agri-supply chains.  Teagasc is also of the view that there is a potential negative impact on the Common Agricultural Policy budget.  The final issue I intend to address is what will be required to enable Irish companies to diversify from the UK market to the greatest extent possible and what we consider that process will involve.  Teagasc and colleagues in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our sister agencies attached to that Department have organised a very significant response to the Brexit challenge by establishing a dedicated unit to monitor continuously developments in that regard.  We have also established a working group across the entire organisation comprising colleagues in various research areas, including processing research and our advisory service nationally.  We hope, with our colleagues in the Department, to be in a position to respond to issues as they emerge.<br/><br/>As the situation pre and post-Brexit is well known at this stage, I will not spend too much time on it.  Pre-Brexit, we enjoy as a member state of the European Union a situation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the United Kingdom in which regulatory frameworks are identical and no customs procedures apply to trade.  No tariffs are levied on trade.  Post-Brexit, a known unknown, there is the possibility that regulatory frameworks will diverge.  That is a concern which will add to the cost of trade.  If the United Kingdom moves outside the customs union, there will be clear additional costs in the processing and administration of customs requirements.  Of course, the major potential impact is the imposition of tariffs on trade with the United Kingdom, as well as third country competition for Irish products in the UK market.  These are well known issues.  A variety of analyses have been conducted by colleagues in Teagasc, led by Dr. Hanrahan, to quantify the impact of different Brexit scenarios.  In simple terms, the impact of a hard Brexit boils down to the potential tariffs that could be levied on Irish imports into the United Kingdom.</p><p> In simple terms, the impact of a hard Brexit boils down to the potential tariffs that could be levied on Irish imports into the UK.  We have tried to simplify, in the bar chart members have before them, the complex potential tariff arrangement that would be in place in the event of the World Trade Organisation, WTO, tariffs applying, for example, if there was no deal.  Clearly, this is at the outer extreme of possibilities.  Members can see from that chart that the beef sector would be substantially hit with an average tariff of the order of 70% in that scenario, the dairy sector would be hit by an average tariff of 50% and it goes down along the various foods that are imported into the UK.  This is a very complex matrix of tariffs.  A total of 2,500 tariff lines exist in regard to trade between Ireland and the UK.  This is an attempt to provide an overview but the impact of such tariffs is obvious.  One would not need complicated economic analysis to determine that faced with those kinds of tariffs, the competitiveness of Irish products in the UK would be affected to a catastrophic degree.  If Britain decided to revert to the traditional cheap food policy and allow imports from third countries, that would add further to the competitiveness threat.  Broadly, the impact on trade with the UK generally is pretty well known, at least as far as an extreme hard Brexit scenario is concerned.</p><p> We have become concerned recently about the implication of a hard Brexit for the agrifood trade North and South.  We have extracted some data for 2016 which illustrates the potential impact at a micro level.  There has not been sufficient appreciation of the disruption that could be caused to local supply chains, particularly those close to the Border.  Members can see that in the dark green line on the chart we have exports to Northern Ireland in 2016 and the lighter green line, with the negative numbers, indicates the imports from Northern Ireland.  There is a good deal of information given there but I want to single out three trade flows that are very significant.  The first one to draw to the members' attention is the substantial imports of dairy produce from Northern Ireland into the Republic.  A total of 80% of these products are raw milk for further processing in the south of Ireland.  If that supply chain is disrupted, it will have severe implications for these supply chain flows.  </p><p> I would also draw members' attention to the imports of animal foodstuffs, which is very important in a local context.  The port of Derry is the dominant source for importation for most of the northern region of the country.  Members can note there are substantial flows of product.  It is evident that any disruption to that supply chain would have very serious consequences for agricultural sector in the South.  </p><p> I would also draw members' attention to live animal exports to Northern Ireland.  Most of the other exports are in the form of processed goods and of course they will be affected.  The reason I draw their attention to live animal exports is that many sectors on the Border depend substantially, for the processing of their product, on factories in Northern Ireland.  One sector that comes to mind is the pig industry, which is concentrated in the Border regions.  We would be very concerned about it in the event of a so-called hard Brexit.  These local factors have not been brought into the public domain to date, at least not in a formal way.</p><p> We have attempted to bring together the impact of tariffs and the potential impact of, what we call, a hole in the CAP budget should the British withdraw from the CAP, as would be expected post-Brexit, and, most importantly, this hole would not be compensated by other member states.  We hypothesise that the hole could have of the order of 10% of a negative impact on the budget.  If we bring that CAP effect  together with a tariff effect, that will have a huge impact on farm incomes.  These are indicative estimates and we call them static effects in the sense that they do not take account of what one would expect in the longer run, namely, that producers would respond to these changes and adjust their activities but, nonetheless, it gives an order of the magnitude involved.  Members will see from looking across the bottom of the chart they we have the various systems of production in the Republic in the dairy sector, cattle fattening, sheep and tillage sectors and that what we call the policy shock, which is Brexit, will cause an impact on tariffs but it will also affect prices.  By bringing the two together in the blue line on the chart, members can see that our estimate is that the reduction in incomes -  this would be a permanent reduction which would not be compensated - would be of the order of 35% in the cattle sector and of the order of 20% in the remaining sectors.  In a nutshell, that represents what might be termed the extreme competitiveness shock we could face.</p><p> I draw members' attention to the last slide.  It is not possible to capture the complexity of this slide without having the animations on, but I will do my best.  We in Teagasc believe that we must focus on how we can minimise this shock.  Clearly, our view is that we need to focus, as never before, on developing the innovation capacity of our farmers and especially of our food companies.  Everyone talks about market diversification and there will have to be more diversification but there is not a full appreciation of what is involved in it.  It will require all the organs of the State - Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and so forth - to identify routes to market and so on but it will also involve and require a substantial investment in developing innovation capability within our food companies and within support services in the research and development area.  </p><p> We believe there are opportunities that we can exploit.  There is a number of technologies that I would like to summarise that we can exploit and that we need to do that in the next few years through a determined strategy to enable diversification to be realised.  For example, we need to work on extending the shelf life of products for faraway markets.  There is huge scope in the dairy sector for further fractionation and the addition of value to milk.  Country of origin labelling will be very important as will the deployment of leading analytical capabilities to support food companies in new markets and in developing existing markets.  In particular, we would draw attention to one area that needs a great deal of work, particularly as far as the Asian and Chinese markets are concerned, that of understanding the sensory requirements of consumers in these markets.</p><p>I have just come back from a very illuminating trip to China.  Teagasc is very concerned about the cheddar market in the UK, on foot of Brexit, because 65% of our cheddar exports go to that country.  British people like cheddar, and not every other country appreciates the exceptional quality of this product.  So far, Chinese consumers have not really embraced cheese at all.  From our point of view, that is a challenge to be overcome.  Extensive sensory analysis of Chinese consumers <i>in situ</i>will be required so we can identify what type of cheese products will be attractive to them.  It is a growing market.  Similarly, there is huge potential for growth in south-east Asia.  We have to do a great deal of work to penetrate such markets.<br/><br/>I would like to speak about the development of smart ingredients in recent years.  Senators will be aware that infant formula is a big component of our overseas market at the moment.  The unique features of the Irish production system ensure that there is quality and that the products are produced in a sustainable manner from the perspective of animal welfare.  We need to develop smart technologies that enable us to penetrate those markets.  The success of Ornua's investment in the Saudi market over recent years is an example of this.  The extraordinary nature of the product that is used in the production of labneh cheese is probably not fully appreciated.  An ingredient that is shipped in powder form from Ireland is reconstituted as a soft cheese in the Saudi factory.  That is based on Teagasc technology.  That is an example of what I mean when I talk about innovation.  There are many other opportunities for potential innovation that we need to exploit quickly.<br/><br/>If I was to leave the Chairman with one message, it would be that although we are facing a definite competitiveness shock, even in the most benign scenario, we must bear in mind that opportunities are available to us to minimise that shock, at the very least.  That boils down to a commitment to continually innovate in support of Irish companies.  I have mentioned the Chinese market on a couple of occasions because it is very important.  Teagasc is in the process of developing a laboratory in the University of Fujian in China to support Irish-based companies in the Chinese market.  More initiatives of this nature are needed if we are to ensure the market diversification opportunities that exist in China are fully exploited.</p></speech>

I congratulate both of them on the degree to which Teagasc has been engaging with this critical issue for Irish agriculture.  It is encouraging that Teagasc has a dedicated unit and a working group on Brexit.  It is clear from the nature of the paper that has been presented that Teagasc's research in this area is in progress.  That is to be welcomed.  It is reassuring for us, as representatives of taxpayers, that this important work is being done.</p><p>I am very happy that Professor Boyle has focused on the micro-aspects of agriculture in the communities of the Border region.  Others have failed to focus on such matters.  As the Chairman will be aware, I have attempted to raise a few of them at meetings of this committee in recent weeks.  It is very good that Professor Boyle has focused on them today.  I will give a practical example of what we are talking about across a range of areas.  Lakeland Dairies, which has a major processing plant in the small town I live in and is the key employer in that town, sources much of the milk it processes in that plant and in its Lough Egish plant from North of the Border.  Conversely, important pig processing activities take place North of the Border in many instances.  Such cross-Border agriculture movements are critical.  How hopeful is Professor Boyle that we will be able to maintain today's veterinary standards after Brexit?  If imports from non-EU countries, including the Mercosur states of Latin America, are accepted, the application in the UK of a cheap food policy, as it is called and as it is popularly known, will be to the detriment of the maintenance of proper standards.</p><p>I would be interested to hear Professor Boyle speak further about the level of potential tariffs.  I think he said in the substantive document he presented earlier that the UK could set tariffs with the Republic at a lower level.  If I understood him correctly, the UK might be able to set favourable tariff ratings or customs ratings.  Maybe he will elaborate on that.  Wearing his hat as a distinguished economist, does he see any great prospect that the current free trade arrangement between the UK and the EU will be maintained?  If not, to what degree will it be diluted?  I know that a graph in the paper that has been presented to us today sets out estimates of potential tariffs, but I would like to know what the actual level of impact on each farmer will be.  I am afraid that small farmers will not be viable in this context and we will move towards factory farming.  I am scared that if large factory units are needed to achieve the economies of scale necessary to deal with the tariff question, there will be awful implications for rural Ireland, including the breakdown of society as it is known in small towns and communities across this country.  I ask Professor Boyle to comment on the degree to which the <i>status quo</i>could be sustained in this eventuality.  As an economist, what does he think the Government can do to mitigate the impact of tariffs and customs?  How much could the Government potentially invest to this end?</p><p>I would like to comment on the figures that have been presented with regard to the cross-Border dimension.  It is amazing that Brexit will have effects across such a range of areas.  As we have noted, the live trade across the Border for processing is very large.  The solutions proposed by Professor Boyle at the end of his presentation are very interesting.  He said that other markets will be examined from a &quot;sensory&quot; perspective.  He might explain what he means by terms like food &quot;fractionation&quot;.  We do not want to discuss any company in a very specific fashion as it would be an inappropriate exercise in the absence of the principals of that company.  Having said that, does Professor Boyle think companies like Glanbia and Lakeland Dairies, which have a presence in my own area, will be fit to absorb the costs which will be involved in adjusting to market diversification?</p><p>It is great the witnesses introduced that cautionary note.  There is an assumption that market diversification will come easily.  It is a bit like the UK internally claiming it will establish trade with the old Commonwealth to replace trade with the EU.  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, pointed out at this committee several weeks ago that for every 5% of trade the UK would lose with the EU, it would have to achieve 25% new trade with the old Commonwealth countries to redress the balance.  Will we be fit to absorb the costs of market diversification and getting ourselves into new markets?  What exercises would the Government want to take in this regard?</p><p> I am delighted that the focus of today's conversation is impacting on what is real life of the people I represent.  The trading relationship between farming communities North and South of the Border is enormous.  It is great Teagasc is grappling with that question and how we might deal with it.  After hearing the witnesses, I am also concerned we could be arriving at a situation where small farming, as we understand it in County Cavan, could no longer be viable.  With the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, does Teagasc believe there will be a pull to the east?  What impact will the UK contribution not going into the CAP budget have?  Again, that will be a challenge to small farmers in my area.  We do not want to be too much of a Jeremiah on this and still hope for the best.  However, it is a concerning scenario.</p></speech>

Several other witnesses and external commentators have touted the idea of Northern Ireland getting special status.  In that hypothetical scenario of an all-Ireland agricultural model, we would think we have got a good deal.  When all is done and dusted, it would potentially solve many of the problems which my colleague, Senator Joe O&rsquo;Reilly, highlighted with regard to the flow of milk, live cattle and so forth between North and South.  However, delving into it, Republic of Ireland farmers would still be in the CAP scenario.  If it were an east-west border between Ireland and the UK, there would still be tariffs on products from the Republic going to the UK but none on Northern products as it would still be part of the UK, irrespective of its new status within the European model.  Potentially we may have to create our own agricultural border if Northern Ireland gets special status to avoid the hard Border because of the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  While I accept this is all hypothetical, it is potentially one possible outcome.  Will Teagasc tease this out a little more and give us an insight into what it thinks its organisation's role would be in that complicated all-island agricultural model after Brexit?</p> <p>  Using the cheddar example and new markets, it is not just the Chinese who do not have a palate for cheddar cheese.  Our continental European friends are not lovers of it either.  The UK is a specific market for this product.  Other products have been affected too, such as the mushroom sector which was affected immediately.  Due to the perishability factor, mushrooms cannot be exported to China.  While we have always explored creating new markets, no knee-jerk reaction in the world because of the current situation with Brexit will make a further afield market viable.  Where does Teagasc seeing us going in that situation?</p></speech>

The customs union, with the free movement of people and goods, has been beneficial to the island of Ireland.  There are massive implications, which Senator O'Reilly touched on, for Border milk producers, the dominant commodity transported between North and South.  There are processing facilities right along the Border, including in counties Cavan and Donegal.</p> <p>  In terms of our bargaining position, what is Teagasc&rsquo;s view on what we should be trying to achieve?  The UK cannot charge a tariff because it is part of the EU.  However, if the customs union is removed, the UK would come under World Trade Organisation rules, which could allow it to apply tariffs which would be on the upper limit of the European tariffs.  The consequences would be dramatic for Irish food exports and right across the economy.  What are the best political tactical moves to mitigate this?  Have there been any talks with Teagasc&rsquo;s counterparts in the UK on this?  What are the soundings coming from the British food and drinks industry on this issue?  I assume it would see it as less competition.  Would it see tariffs from a competitive viewpoint in that it could keep out Irish exports and undercut them in certain markets, cheddar cheese being one example?</p> <p>  Professor Jonathan Tonge from the University of Liverpool told the British parliamentary committee examining this issue that there is the potential for a border arrangement within the island of Ireland akin to that between France and Switzerland or Norway and Sweden.  If that were to happen, we would have a major issue with the North-South movement of people and goods.  In 2014, there were &pound;3.63 billion of exports from the North of Ireland into the European Union.  Is there any opportunity for the European Union to look positively at retaining the North of Ireland within the European Union?  Is that a bargaining position the Government should be looking at to safeguard the common arrangements we already have?</p><p>It would certainly assist in the free movement of goods.  If I were to drive home this evening post-Brexit, I would be asked for a passport or driving licence at the Border at Lifford.  I would be asked exiting Lifford as well.  Not only would this affect travel arrangements, but it would also have major implications for milk or food products going from Dublin to Donegal, for example.  Has any work been done on this at official level or at Teagasc's level with its counterparts in the UK?  Do the witnesses have any suggestions as to recommendations the committee could make in this regard in terms of the political bargaining or negotiations which will take place over the coming weeks and months?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gerry Boyle" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#M00300"><p>I thank all the members for their comments and questions.  I will preface my remarks by saying that some of the issues raised are of a political nature, and our organisation has no role in that regard.  As the committee will understand, we very much occupy the science space, so to speak, and we are a little reticent to comment on some of the matters members have raised.  Nonetheless, we will do our best.</p> <p>  Several issues were raised regarding the impact on teasing out the potential impact of an extreme scenario on small farmers and the question of market diversification, which is an issue for companies.  Unfortunately, there is no doubt but that if we were to face the kind of shock that is possible, small farmers would be more severely affected.  This is quite clear in two senses - they will take a bigger hit from any reduction in the prices they can get for their products and, more important, they will be adversely hit if the CAP budget is reduced because of their dependence on it.  Sheep and cattle farmers are, as the committee will be aware, substantially dependent on CAP payments, so there is no doubt but that small farmers will be adversely affected.</p> <p>  A specific question about food fractionation was raised.  This relates particularly to the dairy sector.  Even we in Teagasc are continually surprised by the extraordinary product that milk is.  To help the committee understand what we mean when we talk about fractionation, I will give an example.  Many years ago, the farmer used to take the skimmed milk home for the pigs.  I can certainly remember this.  It was quite common.  Not too long ago, whey was considered a waste product; it is now a critical part of the nutrition industry.  The more we learn about products, the more we realise there are further opportunities to distil down their by-products - whether for standard milk production or cheese production processes - and recognise their value, and this will continue.  When I talk about market diversification and market penetration, I emphasise that Irish companies are already hugely involved in these new markets.  This is well known to the committee.  What is interesting is that these markets present their own challenges in the scale of the operation required to successfully penetrate them.  Substantial investment is required to penetrate them.</p> <p>  Regarding what the Government can do, the Government is already doing a lot by supporting industry through a variety of means to access such markets.  There will have to be a substantial step-up in the investment and the timescale of that investment.  All the commentary suggests that Brexit will play out over several years.  In our view, at least as far as dealing with the challenges of market diversification is concerned, now is the time for a significant plan to be put in place to address this.  The point Senator Daly made, that the only uncertainty is the uncertainty, is well taken.  A private company cannot wait around for clarity; it must take decisions.  This is where the risk arises.  Senator Daly talked about cheddar cheese.  It is not easy for a company to change its production model.  To some extent, one can produce continental-type cheeses off a cheddar platform but, by and large, purpose-built investment will have to be put in place if that is the market diversification route that must be pursued.  Some Irish companies are doing this.  Dairygold, for example, now has an agreement with a Norwegian cheese producer to produce a completely different type of cheese that involves a different technology.  There has been substantial investment by the Irish dairy processing sector on foot of the anticipated impact of the removal of quotas, but the sector is now faced with a further requirement for investment.  I still think we have an opportunity to persuade the Chinese that cheddar is a delightful product, although our tastebuds would find some of the cheeses I have seen in the Chinese market utterly bizarre.</p> <p>  I will leave all the hard questions Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill has raised about the bargaining position and so on to my colleague.  We can make a big mistake in our sector by focusing on agrifood.  It is probably not as high up on the UK agenda as it is on ours, and many other factors will impinge on that.  As I said at the beginning, I think there would be universal agreement that we would like an outcome as close as possible to the current situation.  The North-South issue is critical and, from a political perspective, if we could retain that single market, so to speak, on the island at least in the agrifood sector, that would be hugely positive.  We have an extraordinary amount in common.  Nonetheless, it is interesting that if one takes dairy as an example, there are vastly different systems of farming practised in the dairy sector North and South.  We would like to think we have a more competitive and resilient model in the South but we need to collaborate on a much more extensive basis.  Only yesterday, I had a discussion with my counterpart in Scotland on this broad theme.  It is very early days yet, but I thought he made an interesting argument that one thing we have in common with the Scots, the Northern Irish to an extent and the French - but let us just take us, Northern Ireland and Scotland - is the development in agricultural terms of a sort of Celtic alliance in terms of our pasture systems and the sharing of our technology in a way we have not done before.  One positive thing about Brexit is that it has brought us all to the point of considering the potential opportunities for collaboration.</p> <p>  I ask Dr. Hanrahan to deal with the difficult issues that were raised regarding tariffs and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1757" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kevin Hanrahan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#M00400"><p>Senator O'Reilly asked about veterinary standards and the possibility they may diverge and the UK may adopt different standards.</p><p>Until they leave, they have to satisfy the <i>acquis</i>and there will be no difference.  My own assessment is that the UK will be slow to move away from European standards given how high they are as a function of crises that occurred in the UK in the 1990s and early 2000s.  There are grounds for guarded optimism that the UK will not pursue lower standards of regulation on the food, animal and veterinary standards side.  One thing the UK will have to do, however, is develop its own capacity to licence businesses that export to the UK market in terms of veterinary standards.  That is all currently taken care of by the EU.  Britain will have to up its game radically in terms of having the capacity to do that on its own.<br/><br/>In terms of the tariff levels that might prevail post-Brexit, I note that the UK is a member of the WTO just like Ireland.  While I am an economist and not a lawyer, my understanding is that when it leaves, the UK will inherit the EU's bindings at the WTO.  Those set the maximum tariff rates the UK can apply to trade with other WTO members outside of a notified free trade agreement, or FTA.  If, outside of an FTA, it wants to apply lower tariffs to a WTO member like Ireland, it must offer those lower tariffs to everybody.  The cost to Irish agriculture is really in the loss of preferential access to the UK market.  It is the access to the UK market that is protected by high tariffs, in effect.  Even if we have free access to the UK market post-Brexit and there are no tariffs, it will also mean under WTO rules that no tariffs will apply to imports from the rest of the world as long as they meet the UK's standards of food safety, animal welfare and so on.  That will be a much more challenging market than we are currently exporting very successfully to.  Those countries and industries internationally with lower costs than Irish and European farmers face will have access in that scenario to the UK market and we will be severely challenged in that space.  Recent research by Teagasc on the competitiveness of Irish agriculture underlines the point that while we are globally competitive in the dairy space due to our pasture-based production system, we are not as competitive at all in respect of cattle and sheep as countries like New Zealand, Australia, Brazil, Argentina and parts of North America.  Obviously, we benefit from being beside Britain and there are costs to getting product from Brazil, for example, even if it meets all of the standards we require and which the British are likely to require.  It is a long supply chain.  However, technology will move on.  Things we could not have imagined happening 20 years ago are now quite common in terms of fresh beef or lamb coming from the other side of the world onto what we consider our markets.  To assume technological changes that shorten supply chains and distances will stop happening would be unwise.<br/><br/>The question was asked about us having a special status and what benefits that might deliver for the island of Ireland.  There would be benefits if the trade flows North and South were unimpeded relative to where we are starting from right now.  That must be set in the context, however, of the overall Ireland-UK trade.  While the North of Ireland is important in a whole-economy context and for the agrifood space, it is - &quot;dwarfed&quot; might be the wrong word - much less important in terms of value at an economy level than the east-west flow.  At a regional level in the Border area, the North-South dimension is perhaps way more important.  For the industry as a whole, however, the east-west axis dominates the North-South in terms of the value of trade.  While an arrangement which allows for free trade on the island of Ireland would mitigate the cost of Brexit for the agrifood sector, the cost of tariff or non-tariff barriers to trade on an east-west dimension will not be avoided.  They will still be there and those are the ones which will really drive the large trade costs which could flow from a very hard Brexit.  While we may end up in that position, we hope we do not.<br/><br/>Most commentary suggests the European Union and the United Kingdom want to avoid a relationship based on WTO rules.  However, it seems likely from my perspective, albeit it may be beyond my competency in terms of the politics of it, that we will not be where we are currently.  We are currently in the deepest imaginable free trade agreement, the Single Market.  We will not be in the Single Market together and the UK may be outside the customs union.  There will be additional non-tarriff costs to trade as well as possible tariff costs.  Even if there are not WTO tariff levels, they may be somewhere between where we are now, which is none, or very low, but very low for every producer in the world.  That will make the competitiveness challenge Irish agriculture already faces much more intense.<br/><br/>It is hard to know what tack the UK will take in terms of its agricultural policy and whether it will go back to a 1950s model.  At that time, they were importing foodstuffs from their former colonies at, in effect, world prices, which was the disadvantage for Irish farmers.  It was one of the great benefits of joining the EEC in 1973.  If I had to bet, I suspect they will go some way towards it but not all the way because they will also want to protect their farmers' interests.  In so far as they lower barriers to trade with non-EU countries, that will disadvantage UK farmers and also Irish farmers.  Many of our standard commodities are as, if not more, competitive than those of the UK versus South American producers, but I expect that will be cold comfort.<br/><br/>On the budgetary issue, the dependence of Irish, UK and, in particular, Northern Irish farmers on the single farm payment and CAP.  If Brexit had not happened, we would still be facing a challenge in that the next iteration of the CAP will see the newer member states from central and eastern Europe looking for a greater share of the budgetary pie that goes to agriculture.  Other policy areas within the EU will also be looking for a bigger share of the overall EU budget and to see agriculture get a bit smaller.  As such, we would be facing a challenge to maintain the levels of support Irish farmers get from CAP, even if Brexit was not an issue.  Brexit doubly underlines that issue because of the size of the UK's net contribution to the EU budget.  It places the onus on Irish civil servants and officials to do their normal brilliant work in that process.  While we are often worried about what the outcome will be, Ireland has always done very well if history is any guide to that negotiation process at European level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1763" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shane O'Dwyer" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#O00300"><p>I thank the Senators for inviting us here to discuss our concerns about the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  I will begin by giving an overview of the thoroughbred industry for the benefit of anyone who is unfamiliar with the industry.The thoroughbred industry in Ireland is highly successful and globally competitive.  It directly employs approximately 17,000 individuals and thousands more indirectly.  It makes a direct contribution to the Irish economy of approximately &euro;1.3 billion.There are 6,777 registered breeders in the Thirty-two Counties.  The breeders account for 14,617 mares and their mares produced 8,563 foals in 2016.  There were 246 registered stallions in Ireland in 2016.  Ireland is an international leader in racing and breeding.  We continuously punch above our weight and breed the best horses in the world.  Irish stallions are the best and attract many foreign mares to be covered by those stallions.<br/><br/>At a time when other forms of rural employment are under threat from the consequences of Brexit, the maintenance and expansion of activity in the thoroughbred industry is important.  Brexit creates concerns for the thoroughbred industry, which I will deal with.<br/><br/>The Irish thoroughbred industry has great economic significance.  As much as 65% of Ireland's annual foal crop is exported, 80% of which are exported to the UK.  The UK is the single biggest market for Irish bloodstock and is a major source of overseas revenue for Ireland.  In excess of 10,000 horses were exported or imported between Ireland and the UK in 2016.<br/><br/>Ireland has two major sales companies - Goffs and Tattersalls.  They both have sister companies in the UK and there is a significant presence of Irish vendors at all UK sales every year.  <br/><br/>In terms of Goffs, approximately 33% of sales in Goffs are to UK buyers, which equates to between &euro;33 million and 35 million per annum.  Approximately 10% of sales in Goffs are by UK vendors and equates to &euro;10 million per annum.  When the impact of Irish business in Goffs UK is added then another &pound;27 million is threatened.  Therefore, I conclude that &euro;75 million of Goffs's business is threatened by Brexit. <br/><br/>If the UK introduces a form of tax for UK buyers buying outside of the UK then it will discourage UK buyers from travelling.  It would also threaten up to &euro;80 million each year in inward investment for both sales companies.  Ireland's exports of thoroughbreds to Britain are worth approximately &euro;225 million each year.  That business would be at risk due to reduced trade flows following the vote in favour of Brexit.  Exchange rate volatility will also make Irish exports more expensive. <br/><br/>I will discuss the movement and transport of thoroughbreds and people within Europe.  To a large extent, the horse racing and breeding industries of the UK and Ireland operate as one with all stakeholders ranging from horses to trainers, riders, agents, stable lads, owners and vets regularly travelling between both jurisdictions.  I will outline a typical example.  In the industry there is something called day walk-in covers.  In such cases a mare is transported to Ireland from the UK or <i>vice versa</i>to be bred within a 24-hour window, a practice that has become increasingly popular.  This is also very popular between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  There are 687 mares in Northern Ireland who are bred and almost 90% of them would be brought to the South of Ireland to be covered by stallions.  A hard border would restrict the free movement of horses and could have an adverse effect on trade.  British breeders would also be more inclined to cover their mares in the UK rather than risk delays at ports due to customs procedures, veterinary requirements, etc.  Another issue is the free movement of EU nationals and the employment of UK citizens in the EU and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>The thoroughbred industry is extremely well regulated.  Ireland and the UK operate as a single entity for stud book purposes.  Basically, British and Irish foals are registered in a single stud book controlled by Weatherbys, which has an office in Naas.  We maintain, as would our counterparts in the UK and further afield, that Weatherbys should continue to maintain the ongoing stud book for both countries.  The situation is further complicated by the fact that horse racing and thoroughbred breeding have always operated on an all-Ireland basis.  For example, foals born in Northern Ireland carry the IRE suffix, rather than GB.  As Elizabeth Headon will outline later, two of Ireland's 26 racecourses are based in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Crucial to all of this is the high health of the animal.  There is a tripartite agreement in place in that regard.  Together with France we have historically had a tripartite agreement between the respective Departments with responsibility for agriculture to facilitate the movement of thoroughbred horses between the three countries.  This agreement predates EU law.  The ability of EU member states to use such flexibility was incorporated in subsequent EU laws on equine movement.  This is now at risk.  The UK leaving the EU might be used to revoke the tripartite agreement on the premise that it only has validity in the context of an EU directive, that the UK is no longer a member of the EU and that France and Ireland cannot make bilateral agreements with non-EU countries.  It is vital that this agreement is retained.<br/><br/>The introduction of tariffs and regulations would increase the cost of business and reduce the free movement of labour and horses.  Without an EU 27 and UK trade agreement on tariff and non-tariff barriers, it is possible that up to the standard World Trade Organization, WTO, 11.5% tariff might apply on racing animals, particularly geldings.  As mentioned, the industries in Britain and Ireland are also in competition for investment, sale of media rights for racing, location of bloodstock and training operations.  Our concern is that once Britain leaves the EU it could offer a raft of taxation and other incentives which Ireland would be unable to match.  I can give an example.  The rise of good stallions standing in Britain since the removal of the stallion tax exemption in Ireland is a bellwether of what can happen.  We would have to mark their move in the event of a hard Brexit.  The industry and the Government would have to examine incentives that could be offered to keep the Irish bloodstock industry competitive.<br/><br/>I will now discuss various solutions.  We wish to maintain the long-standing trade relationships that worked together on harmonised approaches long before the creation of the EU.  As an industry, we are working with our EU and UK counterparts to ensure that the close relationship with Ireland and the special case for Ireland extend to thoroughbred breeding and racing, given our common stud book and close racing relationships.  We wish to avoid reciprocated barriers to trade and the dangers and costs of non-tariff barriers of health certification, temporary admission requirements and restrictions by requirements to use only border inspection ports being reciprocated between the EU 27 and the UK.  UK and EU 27 legislative equivalence already exists through the zootechnical and equine identification regulations.  Much work was done in the last number of years by the industries in all countries to ensure these regulations are in place.  The Irish Government should work with other member states to ensure that this equivalence is implemented after the UK leaves the EU.  On that note, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association has just assumed the chair of the European Federation of Thoroughbred Breeders Associations.  At a meeting involving 15 European countries last weekend it was agreed that Brexit is high on our agenda and that lobbying should take place between EU countries to ensure that legislation and so forth are in place and that Ireland retains its special position.<br/><br/>Innovation is another solution to promote and develop as reassurances how high health status with high levels of control are implemented for thoroughbreds by EU and UK competent authorities for animal health.  Animal health and welfare are crucial.  We wish to evolve existing controls of thoroughbred identification to deliver real time digital identification and movement controls for tripartite and real time reporting in the 21st century.  Animal movement through border checks could be facilitated through enhanced chip technology and dedicated lanes at key ports.  We must work co-operatively with all stakeholders, not just within the industry but also at Government and EU level, to get the message across that Ireland must maintain its <i>status quo</i>with the UK post-Brexit.  The licensing of medication could be harmonised.  For example, there are products available in the UK that are not available in Ireland.  Horses are sometimes moved to the UK to access treatment.  This must continue with minimum disruption.  At EU level the thoroughbred sector could be better classified as agriculture in the application of state aid rules.  It is a rural industry with all the characteristics and social impact of agriculture.<br/><br/>That gives the committee a flavour of the industry.  The single message we wish the committee to take from it is that we are an important global leader in this industry, with an economic input of approximately &euro;1.3 billion to the economy.  It must be maintained and passed on.  Any negotiation or papers on Brexit at Government level should include our industry.  I thank the Members for their attention.</p></speech>

I am here on behalf of the Alliance for Racing and Breeding.  The alliance brings together the associations for jockeys, trainers, stable staff, owners and breeders.  It represents approximately 10,000 people, most of whom rely on thoroughbred racing for their livelihood.  I am also a recent ministerial appointee to the board of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, and I understand that the committee will hear the views of that organisation at a later session.<br/><br/>Shane O'Dwyer has comprehensively dealt with many of the key issues, so I will try to avoid being repetitive.  I will focus more on horse racing than on the breeding sector.  Some 80% of people living in Ireland believe that horse racing is an important part of our heritage.  Irish people value the national prestige its success brings to the country.  In no other international sporting activity have Irish people succeeded as much or as consistently over decades as in horse racing.  This is not just due to one or two individuals but has been achieved through the work of many trainers, jockeys, stable staff and, of course, their famous horses.  Proximity and ease of access to racing in the UK is a key element in these achievements.<br/><br/>However, the sport is really the shop window and the springboard for a much larger agricultural and rural industry - breeding.  Ireland&rsquo;s racing successes have built the brand of Irish bloodstock and the UK offers many of the most prestigious races in the world, which are currently easily accessible to Irish trainers and owners.  We are fortunate to have many natural advantages for horse racing in Ireland: climate, limestone, great pastures, the best bloodlines and superb horsemen and women.  We do not talk as often about our disadvantages, such as our geographical position as an island surrounded by water and our comparatively small population.  Unfortunately, Brexit could bring those disadvantages into sharper focus.<br/><br/>Horse racing has always been organised on an all-island basis and two of Ireland's 26 racecourses are in Northern Ireland.  Nine out of ten horses racing at Downpatrick and Down Royal are trained in the Republic of Ireland and they receive capital development grants and prize money support from HRI.  This will be a focus for the committee's future meeting on all-island bodies.  It is almost impossible to imagine Irish racing without British racing and <i>vice versa</i>.  Of all the sectors the committee will meet, we maintain that ours is the most highly integrated of all.  As much as Ireland relies on Britain as a buyer of its horses, Britain at present relies on Ireland to supply the racehorses it needs, both in terms of number and quality.  They are, in effect, twin industries.  British racing is an important proving ground, especially for Ireland&rsquo;s future breeding stock, stallions and mares.</p><p>Ireland's foal crop is almost twice as big as that of the British, but British racing is much bigger than our sport here in Ireland, thereby providing opportunities to Irish jockeys, stable staff and trainers.<br/><br/>In 2016, just over 2,500 races were run in Ireland, compared to 10,000 in the UK.  Ireland had nearly 29,000 runners compared to the UK&rsquo;s almost 90,000.  Last year, Irish trained horses ran 1,471 times in Britain, winning &euro;17.5 million in prize money.  We had 309 British trained runners in Ireland who took home &euro;4 million.<br/><br/>At a prestigious level, Ireland's reputation is very high.  In Cheltenham this year, there were a record 19 Irish trained winners.  More than two in three races were won by an Irish trained horse.  At Royal Ascot last year, one in three races were won by Irish trained horses, and 63% of the winners were foaled in Ireland.  Looking at the race card of any meeting in the UK, it is clear from the names how many Irish jockeys are working there, but there are short-term and long-term threats arising from any changes in this <i>status quo</i>.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s easy access to British racing is very appealing to overseas investors and we would be very concerned that any impediments to this could be a disincentive to racehorse owners to keep their horses in training in Ireland.  Furthermore, the possibility of the UK introducing incentives for its industry over time is a real threat, especially if racing in Ireland is still excluded from the usual state aid exemptions for agriculture and thereby limited in the scope of its competitive response.<br/><br/>British racing is not a replaceable market for the Irish thoroughbred industry.  Unlike many other Brexit hit sectors, unfortunately, we cannot create or develop large racing industries in other EU countries such as Denmark, Germany or Portugal or adapt our product to suit new markets.  As members heard from Mr. O'Dwyer, there are approximately 200 thoroughbred horse movements a week between Ireland and the UK.  That accounts for half of all horse imports and exports to the UK.  France would have half that number and is the next closest in that regard.  The implications of a hard border, therefore, would be severe for both people and horses.<br/><br/>While it is the hope and expectation of industry parties in the UK and Ireland that the tripartite agreement that exists between Britain, France and Ireland will endure, the mundane logistical challenges of moving horses through border controls and checkpoints needs to be worked through.  Thoroughbreds are highly sensitive animals, selectively bred for their flight response for the past 300 years.  Horses in training are young equine athletes, at peak fitness.  Any new delays that can increase time in horse boxes stuck in queues at ports could prove extremely difficult for trainers and their staff to manage and still permit the horse to perform to its maximum potential on the track.<br/><br/>For some major racing events, it is not unknown for jockeys to race in both Ireland and Britain on the same day, for example, travelling from Haydock to Leopardstown by helicopter for Champion Stakes day.  That is not common, but it is a very exciting occurrence for the racing public and can be important to owners.  It is essential that Irish jockeys are able to freely work and ride in the UK, which is great grounds for them to gain experience, and that they can move easily between the jurisdictions.<br/><br/>There are also the threats of virtual borders.  With close and positive working relationships between the sport&rsquo;s governing and regulatory bodies, we hope that there will not be any future divergence in veterinary and racing regulations.  The importance of a level playing field as regards availability of medication and control of those therapeutic treatments will be essential, as we know from horses running in other jurisdictions that it can become problematic.<br/><br/>From an economic point of view, racehorses are luxury products and any downturn in the UK economy will be felt in Irish racing and breeding.  While sales figures for Irish bloodstock have held up in the past 11 months since the Brexit vote, the drop in the value of sterling has already seen stallion fees here reduced, and it is making boarding a mare in Ireland more expensive for British based breeders.  Media rights, which are negotiated fees paid by bookmakers to show Irish racing, will be paid in sterling from 2019, and this brings further uncertainty.<br/><br/>Turning to solutions, which I know is the members' focus, the committee will understand that anything other than the current integration and ease of movement for people and horses will have significant negative consequences for Ireland.  Some of these issues are outside of Ireland&rsquo;s control.  However, this industry has proven its resilience in the past so with support and goodwill from the authorities in Ireland, the UK and Brussels, solutions can be achieved.  These may include the development of clear customs and border protocols applicable to thoroughbred horses to facilitate ease of movement and traceability.  Technology may offer solutions here but there will be a cost in implementation.  An example of that is when there were tailbacks at Dover because of the issues in Calais.  The UK authorities issued red As for everybody transporting animals to allow them be taken out of the queue and let through.  Thoroughbred horses are at another risk level entirely from a standard livestock consignment, therefore, we believe that the thoroughbred industry needs its own clear protocols.<br/><br/>A professional sports person category could permit jockeys to move easily between the jurisdictions.  We need clarity that thoroughbred breeding and racing are considered agricultural activities.  Domestically, the resolution of a secure and sustainable funding model for the industry would provide some certainty as we move through challenging and unprecedented times.<br/><br/>I will conclude by saying that the other major racing nation in Europe is France.  Their industry is extremely well supported through funding from betting, and while there are risks to France, they are fewer.  It is up to Ireland, therefore, to keep the concerns of thoroughbred breeding and racing on the Brexit agenda during negotiations and we look forward to continuing to work with the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in that regard.</p></speech>

I have one question before I open the floor to members.  Does Ms Headon and Mr. O'Dwyer perceive that this message has percolated to Government?  Do they believe there is a consciousness of it as we approach negotiations?  It is our job as a committee to deal with this issue, and we will do that, but do they perceive an awareness of its gravity?  I am struck by the extent of this problem, which is enormous.  Do the witnesses believe there is sufficient awareness of it at the level that matters?  I will open the floor to the members and suggest to the witnesses that we will group the questions.  I call Senator Paul Daly who has no lack of expertise in this area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1768" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#Q00300"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I welcome Ms. Headon and Mr. O'Dwyer and thank them for the comprehensive and frightening reports they have given us.  I say that as someone who has a keen interest in and love for this industry.  From a racing and horse breeding perspective, getting out this message is one of the biggest concerns because it is seen as a sport among the general public.  When one mentions Brexit, economies, trade and borders, sporting activities are probably way down the list.  From the point of view of the Irish economy, the figures Mr. O'Dwyer has given are startling.  It is a major industry from an Irish export point of view.</p><p>We are a world leader in the industry and the consequences of Brexit from an Irish point of view probably are being well flagged by the witnesses and by our Government in negotiations.  However, in terms of the European organisation Mr. O'Dwyer mentioned, how high up the list of priorities is this issue for Prime Minister Theresa May?  This negotiation will involve Prime Minister May on one side of the table and 27 other member states on the other.  We will be one of the 27.  Where do the witnesses believe their concerns might figure in those negotiations?  How can the members of this committee, by virtue of our report, highlight their case to that extent and try to get it higher in the list of priorities in negotiations?</p><p>As Mr. O'Dwyer rightly pointed out about the IRE suffix, where might that be after a potential hard Brexit?  We have to look at every scenario.  As I said earlier, the only thing that is predictable is the unpredictability of the situation.  We hope for an easy Brexit, but we have to prepare for a hard one.</p><p>I will be in Downpatrick tomorrow evening.  A situation might arise in two years time whereby if I am going to Downpatrick, not only will the horses have to have a passport or go through security but I will have to show my passport also.  That is one possibility.  How do the witnesses see us prioritising the horse in that situation?  The horse will be pushed down the line, so to speak, if people have to show their passports.  A horse crossing over to be covered or to race in either of the two tracks or <i>vice versa</i>will not be high on the list of many people's priorities.  How do we get out that message?</p><p>Anybody involved with horses or in horse racing knows the story about the horse which befriended the goat for relaxation purposes or to overcome nervous traits, but getting that goat to travel with the horse to Cheltenham was unbelievably difficult.</p><p>Could we in a worse case scenario potentially see the same difficulty for the horse?  Without putting Mr. O'Dwyer on the spot for specifics, could he give us a ballpark figure for the economic impact on the industry of a very hard Brexit?</p><p> In an ideal world we would like to see the tripartite agreement remain, so that horse racing and horse transport across borders would not change post Brexit irrespective of what kind of Brexit we had.</p><p> During an earlier discussion on cheese exports with Teagasc, the option to export to France would be the next port of call.  The land bridge to France is through England.  If trainers such as Willie Mullins or Aidan O'Brien decide because of the barriers post Brexit that they will bypass English racing and head to France, their best mode of transport is through England.  Would there still be difficulties inadvertently, without even stopping over?  </p><p> I would like to hear more from the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association on what might be potential solutions to the worst case problems that will arise.  As I said at the outset, we are hoping for the best but we have to ask about worst case scenarios.  None of us wants the worst case scenario but we do not have very much control at this point in time as to which outcome will come.  I think that in Mrs Theresa May's list of priorities, this industry, which is very close to my heart will not be very high up on her list and I wonder how we can get it up that list.</p></speech>

I do not have a great understanding of the horse racing industry apart from going to the races.  Obviously I am aware of the beauty of these incredible animals.  I echo Senator Paul Daly's concern about the priority of horse racing in Mrs. May's list.  The reality of going through borders, particularly from North to South would be very worrying for thoroughbred horses.  That would be something that I too would be very concerned about.  I would also be concerned about the economic impact of change.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell put a question to the President of the Ulster Farmers Union this morning and I am going to ask the same question.  Senators Craughwell and Richmond were in Brussels and the nub of the question that was put to them, was to give an ideal, no matter how over the top it might be, of what they would like to see.  What would be the ideal dream scenario for the ITBA?</p></speech>

The Department has set up a stakeholders' consultative group and the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association has appeared before it to outline our concerns, as we have given today.  We would like it included in any report that the Department commission.<br/><br/>There is awareness in Europe of the industry's perspective, in particular among the 15 countries, including the United Kingdom that were around the table at the weekend.  It is high on the list of priorities.  When the Government produces papers on the impact of Brexit, we would like the economic value of the equine sector to be included, as Senator Daly has said.<br/><br/>It was mentioned whether this sector was high on the UK priority list.  We also share that concern.  We raised it with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at one of the stakeholders' meetings.  When we were speaking to our counterparts in the United Kingdom, we made the point that whereas agriculture is high on the list of Ireland's concerns, in the UK it is not, but in agriculture, that the bloodstock and equine element might be even lower down on that list.  We were assured.  Ms Headon made the point that while we might breed more horses, there are more racers in the United Kingdom.  This year, 50% of the horses that ran in Cheltenham were bred in Ireland, some 25% of them were bred in the United Kingdom and 25% were bred in France and Germany.  The racing model in the United Kingdom, particularly the National Hunt is built around race meetings on a Saturday.  They are not producing enough horses, so they are reliant on Irish bred horses to run in England.  They are acutely aware of that.  The chairman of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association, TBA, and the chairman of the British Horseracing Authority, BHA, are keen to get that message out.  In fairness to them, everything has been delayed a little bit.  The calling of the election has put things back a little bit.  The chairman of the British Horseracing Authority accepts that we in Horse Racing Ireland are joined at the hip.  <br/><br/>Members heard me mention that 50% of vendors at the major sales in the United Kingdom are Irish.  The TBA and the BHA will bring the message to Mrs. Theresa May for no change to the present arrangement.  That message will be high up on their list of priorities.<br/><br/>Downpatrick was mentioned.  We must be concerned about the number of mares that are moving.  The ideal scenario is no change. <br/><br/>I was listening to the discussion with the road hauliers on &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; yesterday.  Some 1,000 plus lorries per day will travel between the Republic and Northern Ireland, of which some 8% will be diverted into trade facilitation centres located some ten to 15 miles from the Border.  We want to avoid that.  We want to be able to get animals from North to South with the minimum of fuss.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Elizabeth Headon" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#R00500"><p>The questions were germane and very relevant.  I will start with the question on how detrimental a hard Brexit might be.  As Mr. Shane O'Dwyer stated in the short term Britain will have to maintain good relations with Ireland and keep using our horses, which is very positive.  There is a very benign, strong close relationship, but if it does become difficult to move horses.  Some thoroughbreds, particularly if they are moving for racing, develop a condition called travel sickness from the stress of being in a horsebox while travelling and out of their normal surrounding.  Not all horses are susceptible to it but some are and it can become quite serious and almost like a pneumonia type condition.  That is a big risk for a valuable racehorse.  We have many major UK owners who keep their horses in training in Ireland and can bring them to Cheltenham and to the big race meetings in the United Kingdom.  One would be very worried that over time they may gravitate back to keeping their horses in Newmarket, with significant consequences for rural employment in Ireland.  That would be very negative.  The other consequence that would be negative over time would be on the breeding stock.  Even though there is a small number of stallions, as Mr. O'Dwyer mentioned, they are the foundation of our industry and they must win a big race such as the Epsom Derby or major high profile races.  The United Kingdom rather than France is seen as the proving ground for stallions because people turn towards the winner of the major races.  Horses would have to make a longer journey to race in France and the United States.</p> <p>  I spoke recently to a person involved in transporting horses who told me that at present if he is moving a horse to the United Kingdom, he will have to think about it about two days beforehand.</p><p>If he is looking to move horses to America, which is also an English-speaking country, for the Breeders' Cup, which takes place in November, he will have to start getting through the paperwork in August.  As we all know, the more paperwork is involved, the more costs are involved.  In a worst case scenario, we could be looking at quarantine problems and the various associated difficulties.  When a horse is in training, a great deal can happen in the four or five days before the race.  The horse might not be as ready for the race as its trainer expected it to be.  It is not easy to plan, or to be certain which horse will be going where and when.  Problems like those I have mentioned can be extremely disruptive in such circumstances.</p><p> France has great racing.  The French authorities have introduced funding structures that prioritise or incentivise French-bred horses.  Irish horses are at a little bit of a disadvantage in that regard.  The real disadvantage, as Senator Daly suggested, is that nobody is going to put a horse on a boat from Rosslare to Cherbourg.  If a horse develops colic or gets some other kind of sickness while travelling by boat to or from France, it is not possible to take the horse off the boat to get to a vet.  The option of going to a vet would be much more quickly available if the horse were being transported through the UK.  These things do not happen very often.  Racehorses are valuable animals and there is a lot riding on their success.  People put years of effort into bringing them to the point at which they are ready to be raced.  Given the risk of being out at sea for very long with a horse, it is really not workable to travel directly to France.  Even if it is technically possible to avoid going through the UK, it is not really achievable in a practical sense.  We must be able to transit through the UK if we believe racing in France is an attractive proposition.</p><p> I was also asked about our priorities.  As Mr. O'Dwyer has said, it is positive that everyone who is looking at this issue is taking a very benign attitude to it.  While this may be quite a hidden issue at present, if we reached a position where there were fewer Irish runners at Cheltenham, it would become much more visible and public very quickly and everybody would ask what was going on.  They would want to know where the Irish horses were.</p><p> It was a little disappointing that our sector was not specifically mentioned in the Government plan for Brexit.  We know there is a lot of interest in and support for the equine sector.  It is up to the sector to propose workable solutions.  I do not believe we will meet resistance to that.  If Ireland does not keep saying that the huge issues which are arising do not need to be resolved in respect of thoroughbreds, things could become very difficult.  As Mr. O'Dwyer said, the dream scenario is for us all to go back to where we were 11 months ago so that this does not happen.  I am sure the committee is hearing that from everybody.  If that is not possible, we need to work closely with our UK and French counterparts to put systems in place that will ensure the disruption is minimised as much as possible, particularly from a welfare point of view for the animals involved.</p></speech>

It was remiss of us that the equine sector was given little or no mention in the report.  For that reason, it is very important for it to be included in this committee's report.</p> <p>  I would make a statement, rather than asking a question, in response to what Mr. O'Dwyer said about Ireland being joined at the hip with the UK.  As he said, the ideal situation would be for everyone to go back to square one as if none of this had ever happened.  Many people who have appeared before this committee have said it would be acceptable to them if Northern Ireland were to get special status because it would solve many of our problems.  It would solve the problems with Down Royal, Downpatrick and Northern Ireland mares.  I have a fear - it is important for this to be reflected in the negotiations - that if the EU 27 were to see the granting of special status to Northern Ireland without interfering with the island of Ireland as a means of giving Ireland a great deal and being seen as heroes, the imaginary border - the east-west border - would be much harder than a hardened Border between the North and South would be.  I think the witnesses know the point I am making.  Such a scenario could make the equine industry's relationship with the UK far more difficult than a perceived hard Brexit would make it.  If we are seen to get a good deal by securing the retention of an all-island situation, it is possible that a far stronger border will be drawn along an imaginary line in the Irish Sea.  We have heard the point that has been made today by the breeding and racing sectors from other groups, particularly within the agriculture industry.  This point has been made with regard to cheddar cheese and mushrooms, to mention just two products.  We are talking about an entire industry.  I do not think we can stress that point enough when we produce our final report.</p></speech>

I apologise for my intermittent appearances.  We picked up on these issues during our preparatory meetings.  When we examined the report published by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, on which Senator Daly sits - I am not criticising the report because it is excellent - we said that as a committee we wanted to focus on the whole equine industry.  We have had good feedback from our colleagues.  When I was in Scotland on Friday, I spoke to my colleagues in the Scottish Parliament.  We have discussed this issue with MPs and Lords.  We have suggested that all of Ireland and the UK could take a clear common stance on whatever deal is forthcoming in the equine area.  I thank Mr. Shane O'Dwyer and Ms Elizabeth Headon for coming to the Seanad Chamber to discuss this important issue.  As I have mentioned to everyone, the committee's report is a live document.  We will be meeting in public session until 15 June.  We will have two weeks to compile our report before it is submitted to the Commission and the Government.  We would appreciate the ongoing engagement of Mr. O'Dwyer and Ms Headon on this matter.  I thank them once again.</p></speech>

I had the pleasure of knowing Mr. James Healy's predecessor very well.  We met on many red-eye flights to Brussels when he was going to various things.  I think I saw Mr. Joe Healy waiting to get the flight home once or twice.  Their reputations and those of their respective organisations precede them.  I say that in the warmest way possible.  I thank Mr. James Healy and Mr. Joe Healy for engaging in this morning's last session before we break briefly for lunch.  Today we are considering one of the key issues facing Ireland in the context of Brexit.  We have had some really thorough discussions so far this morning and generally throughout our work.  We are looking forward to the input of the witnesses.</p><p>Some of those present will be familiar with the usual note on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Mr. James Healy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am the 36th national president of Macra na Feirme.  I am delighted to be joined by our chief executive, Mr. Denis Duggan; our agricultural affairs manager, Mr. Derry Dillon; and our agriculture policy officer, Mr. Paul Smith.</p><p>Macra na Feirme is the only organisation representing the unique interests of the young rural people of Ireland and in particular young farmers, so the opportunity to voice their concerns and their vision for life both during and after Brexit is greatly appreciated.  We are delighted to get this opportunity to attend the Seanad Committee and to reaffirm our commitment to the European project.  Young farmers, and indeed young people across Ireland, many of whom we represent, have benefitted tremendously by the freedoms of movement, financial supports and market access offered by membership of the European Union.  Young farmers and rural youth cannot be allowed to suffer the effects of a decision in the UK that is not of our making.<br/><br/>During our recently completed CAP consultation with approximately 1,000 young farmers, the impact of Brexit was to the fore in their concerns.  Some of the recommendations proposed in our CAP policy 'Young Farmer Roadmap for Generational Renewal' include maintaining the strongest possible trade links with our largest trading partner post Brexit, and ensuring that the CAP budget is maintained post Brexit.<br/><br/>According to the UK Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board, AHDB, the UK imports approximately 35% of the beef and veal it consumes every year, which amounts to 250,000 tonnes or 50% of the beef produced in this country, and Ireland supplies 70% of that beef meaning we supply almost nine times as much beef to the UK as any other country.  In comparison it exports on average 100,000 tonnes of beef but, according to the AHDB, this is mainly due to the lack of processing capacity and most of this meat will end up back in the UK market as a value added product; 37% of what it exports comes to Ireland.<br/><br/>From a sheep meat point of view, the UK has a balance of trade with approximately 100,000 tonnes of sheep meat going in both directions but it is the type of cut that is the differential.  According to the AHDB, a lack of processing capacity means that the UK exports a higher proportion of carcasses while importing value added cuts.  Ireland is the largest EU supplier of sheep meat to the UK following New Zealand and Australia, while the UK sends over 50% of the meat it exports to France and 9% to Ireland.<br/><br/>From a dairy point of view, UK exports were estimated at &pound;1.1 billion in 2015, with some &pound;800 million generated from trade with the EU and &pound;300 million going to third countries.  A total of 90% of UK dairy exports go to the EU, 67% of that going to Ireland.  Most of the liquid milk trade between the UK and Ireland occurs in both directions across the Irish Border, therefore putting dairy producers along the Border in a very uncertain situation.  According to the AHDB, a large proportion of exported UK liquid milk returns to the UK after processing.  For Ireland, the UK market was valued at around &euro;840 million and accounts for some 25% of total dairy exports.  In 2015 Ireland exported to the UK 65,000 tonnes of butter and dairy spreads and 139,000 tonnes of cheese, predominantly cheddar.<br/><br/>Taking all of this into consideration, the picture in front of every young farmer around the country but particularly in Border areas is stark.  Young farmers are starting their farming journey.  They have completed their education and are likely to have had to make significant investment in their business, probably availing of much needed credit meaning that they are working every day just to keep their businesses afloat.  This, compounded with currency fluctuation, means that young farmers are more exposed to volatility than others in the same industry.<br/><br/>Now the uncertainty that Brexit has brought about threatens the business of every young farmer in the country as most have not had the time to establish the appropriate levels of capital and financial reserves to protect their businesses from the current and most likely continuing uncertainty and volatility surrounding Brexit.  Hence, young farmers face a dark future where the likelihood of their business becoming crippled by low farm returns and a need to repay loans will become a reality if the UK's departure from the EU is a cliff edge scenario.<br/><br/>Macra na Feirme, however, has not come here today to tell the committee what the problems are, we know that it is well aware of them already.  We are here to be positive, to identify the priorities that will protect all farmers, young and old, and to offer solutions that we feel can help protect agriculture in Ireland from the sort of crash we saw in the last decade.<br/><br/>The first priority is the relationship post Brexit.  There will be a lot of discussion over the next two years about what sort of relationship there should be between the EU and the UK after the divorce has been settled.  Listening to the Prime Minister, Theresa May, it sounds as if the UK is going to step out of the customs union.  We would, however, propose that maintaining the UK inside the customs union post Brexit should be a red line issue for the Irish Government.  Keeping the UK inside the customs union ensures that EU regulations continue without tariffs, duties or regulatory change.  In the event that this red line is unattainable, the Irish Government must lobby for a period of transition, where the UK remains within the customs union during any protracted exit negotiations beyond 2019.  Temporary membership of the customs union would allow for the appropriate time to be dedicated to developing a full and comprehensive trade agreement.<br/><br/>While political tensions may make this a difficult result to achieve, we believe that this transitional period will allow the time it will take to develop a full free trade agreement which can take anything up to seven years as seen with the recent Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA arrangement.  A transitional phase would at least offer some stability in the intervening period.  It would also allow time to work out the implications an exit from the customs union would have for farmers near the Border, in particular with the flow of products and services in both directions, which is set to disappear overnight.  This would cause huge problems for young farmers especially relating to country of origin labelling.  A customs border brings costs and obvious barriers, and it is the young farmer who will suffer in this scenario as most of the processors, especially in the meat and dairy industry, have the financial ability to mitigate the risks facing their businesses but the young farmer cannot relocate his or her flock or herd.<br/><br/>It is highly unlikely, given the complexities of a comprehensive trade agreement, that one will be negotiated within the timeframe set out by Article 50 thus making a transitional agreement essential for both sides to avoid the cliff edge scenario facing all industries at the end of the two year period.  Imports are rarely mentioned in the context of Brexit.  As a nation we import as much from the UK as we export to it.  We are not advocating for more imports.  Many of those, however, are inputs required by farmers: agro-chemicals, veterinary products, and tractors, for example, all come from the UK.  This is the double impact that is rarely discussed regarding any UK withdrawal from the customs union.<br/><br/>The second priority is identifying new markets, within and outside the EU.  Speaking at the Agricultural Science Association Conference last year, economist Colm McCarthy when questioned about Irish trade dependence on the UK highlighted by Brexit countered with the point that the UK is a lucrative market.  He argued that of course Irish farmers and agri-companies should seek to supply as much food as possible to our nearest neighbour which eats the same food as us, pays a top price for it, and is the closest geographically to us.  It makes complete economic sense, instead of trying to service markets at the other side of the globe.<br/><br/>With that in mind, Macra na Feirme during its recent CAP consultation with 1,000 young farmers, highlighted the view that young Irish farmers want to maintain the strongest possible market links with the UK market.  According to the recently published KPMG <i>Farmers Journal </i>global agri-business report, four of the top ten global economies are in Asia and South America, driven by rising levels of new Asian middle class consumption, with over 3 billion new consumers, or 40% more, expected by 2030.  Bord Bia recently reported that in 2016 global exports to markets outside the eurozone accounted for 70% of exports, with an 8% decline in the UK and a 35% rise year on year of exports to China.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that strategic targeting of new or emerging markets is economically prudent.  However, we cannot afford to leave the UK market without a fight.  As a nation, we must defend the interests of young farmers in the UK market.  The UK is not self-sufficient in food and in the minds of the UK consumer phrases like &quot;British and Irish beef&quot; are common marketing parlance.  Every opportunity must be used to ensure that the maximum viable market is retained in the UK.<br/><br/>Opportunities may also exist as a result of Brexit.  However, we in Macra na Feirme caution against over optimistic views of the opportunity from a young farmer perspective.  In a possible tariff environment with the UK post Brexit, Irish farmers could seek to displace UK products into mainland Europe.  This, however, may not be as economically lucrative as the current UK market due to the make of the UK exports for example, replacing UK sheepmeat carcass for France with Irish carcasss is not as valuable as Irish lamb cuts exported to France.<br/><br/>Bord Bia is to be commended for its efforts, along with the industry, to proactively target new markets for Irish food products through new market exploration and indeed expansion into existing markets.  That effort, combined with Origin Green further promoting the sustainability of Irish food produce is a significant competitive advantage.  Over the coming years, Bord Bia must not be left short of either human or financial capital as it continues efforts to ensure Irish product maintains market share and builds new markets.</p><p>Increasing the diversity of destinations for Irish products is crucial for the future viability of Irish agriculture.  There is a genuine fear that the United Kingdom will pursue a cheap food policy post-Brexit.  Speaking in Dublin recently, Patrick Coveney, chief executive of Greencore, cautioned that many backbenchers within the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom favoured a cheap food policy.  Bord Bia must have adequate marketing resources to reaffirm for consumers in the United Kingdom the value, quality and sustainability of Irish food products.<br/><br/>The third priority is adopting an all-island approach.  Consideration must be given to the implications of Brexit for animal health and the environment on the whole island of Ireland.  Diseases and pollution do not respect lines on a map.  Within the Brexit negotiations a framework for North-South co-operation and converged regulation of animal health and the environment must be provided for.  While it is our understanding that after Brexit the North-South Ministerial Council will have no legal power, co-operation between the two Governments is mutually beneficial.  Macra na Feirme encourages the Government to ensure some legal mechanism is created in the negotiations to provide legal standing for such co-operation.  Being an island, Ireland as a whole has a biosecurity advantage and our island advantage makes disease control easier.  The implications of a future animal health crisis or disease outbreak in a post-Brexit economy include the potential to destroy the combined efforts of initiatives such as Origin Green.  An all-island approach to animal health was commissioned by the North-South Ministerial Council in 2001 and could act as a template for continued co-operation between the two Governments post-Brexit.  Should such a strategy be continued into the future during times of crisis, it will need to be able to act effectively and rapidly based on solid scientific advice.<br/><br/>The North-South Ministerial Council should also continue the work it has undertaken to deal with the environmental challenges the island faces.  It already works in the areas of research, environmental protection and water quality and waste management in a cross-Border context.  In the post-Brexit scenario waterway pollution on the other side of the Border, for example, could have a detrimental impact further downstream for Irish farmers.  Similar to the advantages of an all-island animal health strategy, a continued all-island environmental strategy is crucial.  As a non-political organisation, it would not be appropriate for Macra na Feirme to engage in discussion on a united Ireland, but we are clearly stating the mechanisms are in place today to support all-island responses to issues of animal health, the environment and disease.  These mechanisms must be retained in any legal framework negotiated as part of Brexit.<br/><br/>The fourth priority is upskilling.  In the <i>Irish Farmers Journal </i>today the research of Dr. Kevin Hanrahan of Teagasc sets out the impact of Brexit on family farm incomes.  It worryingly forecasts income reductions of up to 40% in certain farming sectors.  The European Union makes significant resources available to member states or regions impacted on by globalisation.  Macra na Feirme believes the Eurpoean globalisation fund which is normally deployed in situations where multinationals or large companies close down or relocate with the loss of jobs is relevant.  The chief economist at the Department of Finance has warned that up to 40,000 Irish jobs could be lost as a result of a hard Brexit.  Macra na Feirme is concerned that many of these job losses would be felt most harshly by young people in rural areas where there are traditionally fewer opportunities to avail of job mobility.  If Teagasc&rsquo;s research is borne out, a significant number of farmers will be forced to exit the industry and should also become eligible for EGF support.  Should significant job losses become apparent as a result of Brexit, the European globalisation fund should be deployed to provide training and upskilling programmes to enable those affected by Brexit to retrain.<br/><br/><b></b>The fifth priority is meeting increased education demands.  Every year a cohort of Irish students who have completed their leaving certificate examinations head to the United Kingdom to complete agriculture degrees in areas such as animal, food and crop science, with agribusiness, veterinary and forestry studies.  We estimate that there are approximately 300 to 400 Irish students studying these or similar courses in the United Kingdom.  In 2015, according to the Higher Education Authority, just over 3,300 students were enrolled in agriculture, horticulture and veterinary related degree courses in Ireland.  On the back of Brexit and if there is no agreement for the shared funding of education courses and the cost of studying abroad between the United Kingdom and the European Union, we estimate that 300 Irish agricultural students currently studying in the United Kingdom could be returning to Irish shores to pursue their studies.  If this becomes a reality, there would be a 10% increase in the demand for agriculture courses based on the 2015 figures.  The CAO system correlates the demand for a specific course with a number of points.  Hence, the return of these 300 students to the Irish third level education system would mean a consequential increase in the number of points required for courses, making it harder for Irish students to gain places on agriculture courses.<br/><br/>UK universities and Irish higher education institutes compete in the Middle East, Asia and elsewhere to attract undergraduate and postgraduate students.Possible travel restrictions and a reduction in the number of EU research opportunities in the United Kingdom could have a positive impact for Irish higher education institutes in their efforts to attract international students.  However, any rise in the number of international students must not lead to a displacing of opportunities for Irish students studying for the leaving certificate examinations in years to come.  Together, the impact of additional foreign students and the additional demand for places on agri-related courses could create an upward spiral in the numbers of CAO points required for agriculture courses.  Provisions need to be put in place to allow Irish universities, colleges and institutes of technology to cope with the potential increase in demand for places on agriculture courses.  If the agri-sector is to continue to grow and expand, it is highly important that there be a continual flow of educated, young and vibrant people into the sector.<br/><br/><b></b>The sixth priority is the CAP budget.  For agriculture to remain vibrant, we need young people to see farming as a viable career.  If they believe they will be washed away by the first crisis they encounter, they will not risk entering the industry.  That is why we call on the Government to ensure funding for young farmer is not cut on a <i>pro rata</i>basis with any decrease in the CAP budget following the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  We ask the European Union to show its support by maintaining the funding currently directed towards young farmers, ensuring their ability to develop and expand their businesses.  We leave the committee with a challenge.  Can we have a commitment that, as Members of the Oireachtas, committee members will sign off on an increase in the Government's contributions to the EU budget to sustain the CAP budget for young farmers?  <br/><br/>I thank the committee for its time.  We will be happy to take questions from members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1784" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#U00300"><p>I thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to outline the key issues of concern for Irish farming and the agrifood sector arising from Brexit.  I apologise in advance because I am more than likely to repeat a few of the points the other Mr. Healy in attendance has made.<br/><br/>In the ten months since the Brexit vote, there has been a huge amount of analysis undertaken of the potential implications for the Irish economy and the farming and food sectors of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union.  The results are clear and stark.  Ireland is the economy in the European Union that will be the impacted on most by Brexit and the farming and agrifood sector will be the one impacted on the most.  The sector generates economic activity in every parish, village and town across Ireland, supporting 300,000 jobs, directly and indirectly.  Last year alone, food and drink exports topped &euro;11 billion.  The sector is particularly vulnerable to Brexit for a number of reasons.<br/><br/><b></b>Ireland's agrifood sector has a high dependence on the UK market, with 40% of exports destined for the UK market annually.  They include 50% of our beef, one third of our dairy products, over half of our pigmeat exports and more than 90% of all mushroom exports.  Disruption caused to the UK market by the imposition of tariff barriers, border checks, certification requirements and other regulatory changes could render this trade uneconomic.  High EU tariff protection applies to products of major importance to Irish farmers such as beef, dairy and lamb.  Tariffs on imports from non-EU countries are in place to protect the market for European farmers.  A significant reduction in import tariffs by the United Kingdom for non-EU countries such as the Mercosur countries of South America would fundamentally undermine the competitive position of Irish and EU products on the UK market and reduce the value of the UK market.<br/><br/>The existence of the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland creates a serious challenge.  Every year thousands of animals and huge volumes of agricultural produce cross the Border to Northern Ireland for finishing or processing as part of a highly integrated supply chain.</p><p>These trading links, which have built up over many years, are critically important for farmers and processors on both sides of the Border.  Brexit presents a real risk of a hard Border with customs checks and other controls.  The departure from the EU of the UK, which is a net contributor to the EU budget, will create uncertainty about the size of the CAP budgets after 2020.  A reduction in the CAP budget would have a direct negative impact on Irish farm incomes across all sectors.</p><p> I would like to highlight some of the specific issues for our main sectors.  The threat from Brexit for the beef sector is frightening.  The UK is the market for 270,000 tonnes of Irish beef, or approximately half of our beef exports.  The IFA is continuing to strongly support efforts to secure new markets for Irish beef.  Any damage to our position in the UK market would see significant displacement of Irish beef onto EU markets, such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy.  This would undoubtedly destabilise the EU beef market, thereby undermining price returns to farmers in Ireland and across Europe.  In the dairy sector, one third of our exports go to the UK, which is our main market for cheddar.  There is no alternative.  A loss of access to the UK market would destabilise the overall dairy sector here.  Brexit presents a particular threat for milk processors that depend on an all-Ireland milk pool.  The same thing applies to the pigmeat and poultry sectors, in which large volumes of produce move across the Border for processing.  The key issue in the sheep sector is the future destination of large volumes of New Zealand lamb imports.</p><p> There are real threats to virtually every sector of agriculture, from beef, dairy and lamb to mushrooms and forestry.  These threats include reduced access to the UK market through tariff barriers, a loss in the value of the UK market through increased substandard and low-cost imports and the potential reduction in the CAP budget after Brexit.  The ESRI has estimated that WTO tariff rates would virtually wipe out our agrifood trade to the UK, with losses of &euro;2 billion to the meat and dairy sectors.  At farm level, Teagasc has looked at the impact a hard Brexit would have on farm incomes in a scenario where there is a 10% reduction in the CAP budget and lower UK food prices.  Farming would be devastated in such circumstances, with average incomes decreasing by 26%.  Cattle farm incomes would be worst hit, with a massive 37% reduction.  I remind the committee that in this sector, direct payments already account for over 100% of family farm incomes in most cases.</p><p> Since last year's vote, the IFA has undertaken a campaign of engaging with key stakeholders in the negotiations.  We have highlighted the real threats posed to farming livelihoods.  We have met the Taoiseach; the Ministers, Deputies Creed and Flanagan; the head of the EU negotiating team, Michel Barnier; and the British ambassador to Ireland, Robin Barnett.  The IFA Brexit event at Goffs, which was attended by more than 700 farmers and industry representatives, was addressed by the European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Phil Hogan; Mairead McGuinness MEP; the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed; and other speakers from the industry.  The IFA is actively working with European farming organisations to highlight the damage a hard Brexit could do to Europe&rsquo;s &euro;45 billion worth of food exports to the UK.  We are in close contact with our colleagues and neighbours in the Ulster Farmers Union, representatives of which are in the Gallery today, and the National Farmers Union.  They share many of our concerns about the impact of Brexit.</p><p> The IFA published a policy document in March as part of its overall response to Brexit.  Two key priorities for farming in the Brexit negotiations are identified in the document, Brexit: The Imperatives for Irish Farmers and the Agri-Food Sector.  Our first key priority is to maintain the closest possible trading relationship between the UK and EU while preserving the value of the UK market.  It is not sufficient for tariff-free access to the UK market to be achieved.  Equally, the value of EU agrifood exports cannot be undermined by an increase in low-cost food imports into the UK or by imports that do not meet the high standards of food safety, animal welfare, health and environmental controls that are required of EU producers.  The optimum outcome from a trading point of view is for the UK to remain within the EU&rsquo;s customs union.  This would solve many of the border issues that may otherwise arise, such as checks on origin of imports from third countries.  If the customs union outcome is not possible, there must be a comprehensive free trade agreement that includes the following elements for agriculture and food: tariff-free trade between the UK and the EU for agricultural products and food; the maintenance of equivalent standards in food safety, animal health and the environment; and the application of a common external tariff for imports to the EU and the UK.</p><p> Our second key priority is a strong CAP budget in the period after 2020.  This is critical for farm incomes, farm output and wider economic activity.  There cannot be a reduction in the CAP budget arising from the UK exit.  A reduction in spending power for Irish agriculture arising from a cut in direct payments to farmers would have a significant and negative knock-on impact on production decisions and on the demand for goods and services in the rural economy.  Farmers and the food industry have been badly hit by the devaluation of sterling over the past year.  The beef industry lost &euro;150 million in this way in the second half of 2016.  This had a knock-on effect on wider rural areas.  In the event of further significant decreases, farmers and the food sector will require direct support through CAP market supports and flexibility on state aid rules.  Increased resources for market access and promotion must be allocated to the relevant bodies, including the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia.  Discussions on the future EU-UK framework, including transitional arrangements, must commence early in the withdrawal discussions in order to minimise uncertainty during the negotiation process.</p><p> We are at the starting point of the withdrawal negotiations.  The EU is adopting a phased approach.  It has identified four initial priorities in the withdrawal negotiations: safeguarding the rights of EU and UK citizens, agreeing the UK financial settlement, avoiding the creation of a hard border and reaching agreement on dispute settlements.  It has outlined that discussions on the future relationship will form part of the second phase of the negotiations.  In the initial stage of the negotiations, it is critical that minimising the disruption to trade, for example by maintaining equivalent standards in the areas of food safety, animal health and welfare, is a priority issue in the discussions on the Border.  The UK must fully meet its obligations to the EU budget for the entirety of the existing CAP reform programme, which runs to the end of 2020.  To minimise the uncertainty for farm enterprises and the agrifood industry, there is a real need for progress to be made quickly.  Therefore, discussions on the second phase should commence as soon as possible.</p><p> Brexit is the greatest threat to Irish farming we have seen in our lifetimes.  The livelihoods of thousands of farm families and the future of the agriculture and food industry are at stake in these negotiations.  Over recent months, the IFA has clearly set out for political leaders in Ireland and across the EU the critical issues for Irish farming and the food sector in the negotiations.  It has identified the outcomes that must be delivered to secure the interests of this vital sector in the years ahead.  I assure the committee that as progress is made with the negotiations, we will keep up the pressure by continuing our engagement with stakeholders in the Oireachtas, Government Departments, the European Parliament and the European Commission.  I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

As someone who is often made fun of for being a south Dublin suburbanite, I stress that this whole session is fascinating for me.  It is not something I am alien to.</p><p>I am very proud that the area I represented had 63 members of the Irish Famers Association, IFA.  It was not exactly a massive number, but they all went down.  We also have a thriving branch of Macra na Feirme in south Dublin.  Obviously I come from a family with a strong link to the agricultural sector both in terms of supply and agribusiness.  Both of those presentations were really excellent.  We are really grateful.  We have had an excellent day's work so far.  I commend the works that both organisations do.  I watched the live stream of the meeting in Goffs.  It was top notch.  If we had more people doing that from various sectors we would be in a really good place - not that we are in a bad place, but we can always be in the best place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1788" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#W00200"><p>Not unlike the Chairman, until very recently I thought milk came from bottles, but I recently learned it had moved to cartons.  I am extremely impressed by the level of preparation that both Macra na Feirme and the IFA have put in.  I only arrived as the Macra na Feirme presentation was beginning because I am involved in another committee.  One of the things this committee set out to do was to look for solutions.  As I believe the speaker from Macra na Feirme said, the problem is well rehearsed in every corner of Irish life at this stage.  The amount of thought that has gone into the witnesses' work has been most impressive.</p> <p>  In trying to get to questions, there were a couple of things mentioned, particularly on the education side.  It is an area in which I have a huge interest.  In respect of the approximately 300 students mentioned which we send to the UK each year, in the event of a hard Brexit, the first problem we are going to face is the fees for those students, assuming we can get them into the UK in the first place.  That is the first problem we have.  The second problem that we are likely to run into is that, if standards change and they are taught to a curriculum which has different standards, recognition of their qualification when they return home will be an extremely serious challenge for members of Macra na Feirme particularly, because that organisation deals with the future farmers of the country.  </p> <p>  The first priority set out was the relationship post-Brexit, and I think it was well set out.  Firstly, I would like to say to Macra na Feirme what I said to the Ulster Farmers Union this morning - that we give them a clean canvas.  We take everything that is on the table off of it.  Macra can now draw or paint the canvas for us to show us what it wants.  The Chairman and I met Michel Barnier and other members of the European Parliament some time ago in Brussels.  They all said the same thing to us - they too know the problems and are very well-rehearsed on them.  They want solutions coming from Ireland.  They were not shy in saying that the solutions need not necessarily be the most intelligent or sound.  Something completely off the wall may actually work for all sides as we go forward.  I ask Macra to have a look at that.</p> <p>  Moving on to the IFA, one of the things that bothers me is whether it is an issue of taste that there are no serious markets for cheddar outside the UK.  Is that an issue of taste or of competition from other parts of the world?  Is there a saturated cheddar market out there?  I am not sure.  I know the English taste for cheddar and I have long been a fan of the same cheese myself.  I am very much aware of it.  Again, when we look at agrifood exports and what is happening between the UK and Ireland, I honestly cannot see a way that we can separate out North and South.  From an IFA perspective in particular, it will have members whose land straddles the Border, with some land in the North and some land in the South.  That seems to be a massive problem.  I am not sure where we are going with that.</p> <p>  The IFA's products are sold on the world market as Irish beef, Irish lamb, Irish pigmeat etc.  I assume our colleagues in the North of Ireland brand their produce in exactly the same way - as Irish.  If we have a divergence between standards, that will be a serious problem for the marketing of our product.  The IFA's aspiration to hold market share in a UK which will now be dealing on the world stage will be very hard to secure.  There will be cheap Argentinian beef and cheap lamb coming from wherever.  At the end of the day, there are parts of the UK where price, not quality, is the issue.  I assume that we sell at the tightest prices at which we can sell.  I assume massive profits are not being made from the UK market.  If we are going to compete on price and price alone, because quality may not be the issue in some parts of the UK, how are we going to fare?</p> <p>  When the witnesses talk about the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and I am interested in the views of both groups on this, it is my view that the European Union should be pumping in supports to allow us to diversify into other market areas and to provide for the building of a cheddar mountain or a beef mountain in order to support our industry until we have developed those markets.  If this is a hard break, which looks very likely, we will have to find something outside the UK.  The Ulster Farmers Union made the point this morning that even if we did diversify outside the UK into other world markets we would have to work really hard to earn the same sort of income that we are earning from the UK because we are selling premium cuts and getting the top end of that market.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on that.  </p> <p>  Again, I ask the president of the IFA, and it is probably an unfair question to ask as he has only been in the job for about a year and a half, but if he had a clean canvas, what would he want from both governments?  Clearly we cannot dictate to Theresa May what she will want from Brexit, but if he could what would Mr. Healy want?  I thank the Chairman.  I hope that has not been too around-the-houses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1383" speakername="Paul Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#W00300"><p>I welcome both delegations and thank them most sincerely for their presentations.  At this stage, almost a year down the line, we are all fairly well aware of the facts, figures and perceived consequences.  Unfortunately, solutions are not that easily achieved from the point of view that, as we are all aware, we will be one of 27 when this negotiation gets down to the nitty gritty.  Both organisations, and particularly the IFA, are world leaders when it comes to negotiating and lobbying.  They are in Brussels more often than many in this House.  I ask them what they gauge the feelings of the other 27 to be?  I was out some while ago with a group from the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  While it was not officially across the table, when we walked away from the table I certainly got the impression that, while we were talking about the CAP and CAP reform, they kept bringing up Brexit.  Perhaps it is the cynic in me but I walked away saying to myself that these lads think they are being very sympathetic with our Brexit situation and that if they look after us in Brexit they will be entitled to wash us down the Swanee when it comes to the CAP.  The Polish representative in particular made a point of the Russian embargo and of who looked after his country in that similar situation.  The witnesses are preaching to the converted here and in the other House and when dealing with anybody who has a voice in this thing.</p> <p>  How do they see it going and, through their negotiations and lobbying in Europe, how do they see the views of the other members of the 27 about our agriculture sector?  We are dealing with agriculture specifically, although there are so many other strands.  As has been said, agriculture is probably on the back of the page when it comes to Theresa May's list of priorities.  Therefore, how much negotiating time, when hard negotiations begin, will be allocated to agriculture?</p> <p>  Earlier we has the Ulster Farmers Union before us and I asked its members about how much contact it had with the IFA and Macra.  They are all working well together.  I think that is important from an all-island perspective.  I said that to the Ulster Farmers Union.  I know it is repetitive but the organisations are similar.  Many people we have had before us, and many outside commentators, are flying a kite about Northern Ireland getting a special status after Brexit, which would help to maintain our all-island situation and minimise or eliminate the possibility of a hard border on the island.</p><p>It is a great idea in theory but if one analyses it from the perspective of agriculture, it means that our border is east, west.  There will be an imaginary line in the Irish Sea between Ireland and the UK.  Our milk situation, our pigmeat and everything else on the island will be sorted but we will need an agricultural border on the island, in my opinion.  We will have farmers in the South who are still under the CAP while the Northern Ireland farmers, even if they are in an all-island agricultural model, will still be in the UK and will probably be outside of the CAP.  A Northern Ireland farmer who exports across to England will not be paying a tariff but farmers south of the Border potentially would be paying such a tariff.  We could have a segregation of the island.  What a lot of people are putting forward as one of the better scenarios could be, from an agricultural perspective, a time bomb.  Maybe I am wrong and I would like to hear the opinion of the witnesses on that.  </p><p> While not wanting to pre-empt the response to Senator Craughwell's question, there is nowhere else to go with cheddar.  Even if we built a cheddar mountain, it would still have to be eaten by the English because the Europeans would not want it nor would the Chinese.  In that context, where do we go?  Where do we go with mushrooms?  Before the Brexit vote we were scouring the world for new markets.  I used an analogy previously of being tortured with an ingrown toe nail, but if one hits one's thumb with a hammer, one will forget all about the toenail.  That does not mean that it is cured or that the pain has gone away.  It merely means that the thumb becomes the priority.  Brexit has become our priority but we had a lot of problems before the vote.  We were already scouring the world, looking for markets.  What new markets do we think are going to mushroom - pardon the pun - in the aftermath of Brexit that were not there previously?  Bord Bia and so many other agencies have been out there, trying to get new markets.  There are not going to be any new markets.  The market is still there.  The English are still going to have to eat.  In that context, can the witnesses see any bright light in this?  Is there any positive potential in any one of the possible outcomes?  We are in a bubble here in the sense that we are talking about the unknown.  The only certainty here is uncertainty.  We must, for the purposes of our report, get as much feedback from as many different perspectives as possible.  We must examine the various scenarios, from worst case to best.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on these points.</p></speech>

I am not involved in farming myself but my father was born on a farm and my cousin still runs a farm.  I would have spent a lot of time on the farm and understand the complexities of farming.  I also understand how hard it is for farmers, particularly those with small holdings.  I can only imagine the anxiety and stress that they are under at the moment.  I was talking to my cousin at the weekend.  He lives in the North.  He talked a lot about his concerns and is actually thinking of retiring.</p> <p>  The presentation was fantastic.  It was very clear and will be very useful in the context of the preparation of our report.  Reference was made in the presentation to the fact that the pollution of waterways north of the Border could have a detrimental impact further downstream for Irish farmers.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that point.  While bearing in mind that Macra na Feirme is a non-political organisation, do the representatives believe that a united Ireland would be beneficial for the farming sector?  I ask them to be really honest and to answer from the position of concern for the people that they represent.</p></speech>

If we had a clean canvas, ideally the UK would not leave at all but obviously that is not going to happen.  The IFA has said that ideally the UK would at least stay within the customs union, a position with which we concur.  That would maintain an equivalence of standards to a very large degree and would ensure that there are no tariffs.  From a trading point of view, it would make the picture an awful lot simpler.  It would also limit the ability of the UK to go off and conclude trade deals with third countries, including those in South America, and would make such deals much less profitable.  That would leave us in a much better position in terms of being able to retain our market share in the UK.</p> <p>  In terms of the first part of the Senator's question, staying in the customs union will not solve the educational part of the picture.  There would have to be some sort of an arrangement between the EU 27 and the UK on education, as well as on other issues such as pensions and so forth.  Some sort of agreement will have to be reached whereby students could still travel from country to country.  We have UK students in Ireland and there are many Irish students in the UK, which is to the benefit of both countries.  </p> <p>  Senator Daly asked about the point of view of the other EU member states.  As it happens, myself and Mr. Derrie Dillon were at a meeting in Brussels yesterday of the Conseil Europ&eacute;en de Jeunes Agriculteurs, CEJA, the European young farmers organisation and Brexit did not even get a mention.  It was only during conversations after the meeting that we were able to ask for their opinions.  While Brexit is in the back of their minds, it is not something that is a priority for European farmers, except for those in the Netherlands who would also have a large amount of trade with the UK.  They recognise that it will be important in time but at the moment it is not a priority for them.  They are far more concerned about migration, terrorism and such issues.  Unfortunately, Brexit is not on the list of priorities.  </p> <p>  Reference was made to special status for Northern Ireland.  We are concerned about Northern Ireland from the perspective of animal health because diseases and other environmental threats do not recognise lines on a map.  If we are to continue to sell ourselves as a green island, to maintain our origin green status and to support the sustainability that we are marketing, we must have an all-island approach.  That brings me to the question posed by Senator Black.  A united Ireland might address some of the issues raised by Senator Daly, including the disparities between farmers north and south of the Border in terms of supports and access to markets but an all-island approach is more of a priority.  The overall marketability of our product and the selling of Ireland as a green island comes back to issues of animal health, environmental standards and so forth.  In terms of Senator Black's question on the environment, if there is an outbreak of disease or a slurry spill one side of the Border, the contaminated water will flow to other side of the Border.  It is unfair for farmers on either side of the Border to have to suffer the consequences of something that may have arisen on the other side.  At the moment Ireland is attempting to hold on to its derogation under the nitrates directive.  Water quality and water quality management is a huge part of that.</p><p>If one was to separate North and South from that perspective, it makes it very difficult for farmers, particularly around the Border, to maintain water quality.  They could suffer again for something not of their own making.  That is why we believe it has a huge part to play.</p><p> Senator Daly mentioned that those in the UK still have to eat and that is why we do not want to give up our share of the market in the UK at all costs and them being part of the customs union is a red line issue that we have identified.  The Senator said they still have to eat and we want to maintain competitiveness in the UK.  If the UK is outside the customs union, the tariffs that will apply may make our produce less competitive and affect our market share.  I agree with the Senator's remarks about new markets that might suddenly appear.  I spent three weeks in China last year and, particularly with beef in mind, I know it is not something they would even think about eating.  That is a major area of produce that will be affected by Brexit.  The new markets will not solve our problems so it is about maintaining the best possible relationship with the UK from a trade perspective.  That is how we will protect the incomes of farmers and, in turn, the quality of life for all people in rural communities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1794" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#Y00200"><p>I acknowledge the honesty of a number of Senators in highlighting the fact that they might not milk cows or herd sheep every morning.  There is really no part of Ireland too far removed from rural Ireland.  As Senator Black rightly said, she has an uncle and cousins on the farm, and there are very few people anywhere in Ireland that would not have direct family members involved.</p> <p>  The first point raised concerned cheddar cheese.  Every Member would have received our document at some stage.  Of our cheddar, 78,000 tonnes or 82% goes to the UK.  There is not really an alternative.  In the past two days we have been in the Netherlands and Germany, and we had a meeting with representatives of Ornua at its Kerrygold plant yesterday in Germany.  The taste of Europeans does not tend towards cheddar, so as I highlighted in my speech earlier, there is not really an alternative there now for the cheddar market in the UK.  As the person who put the question states, it is probably a question of taste and culture.</p> <p>  There was a question as to whether it is aspirational to believe we can hold trade with the UK.  We must believe we can do so.  I should make it very clear there are no winners here and no matter what way we look at this, it is a damage limitation exercise right across all sectors and particularly in the agricultural area.  A number of things have been said by UK and European politicians but perhaps the best thing to do now is allow British Prime Minister May and UK Government officials get on with their election.  We have always said that statements are made during an election that may not be carried through thereafter.  I say to European politicians not to get involved.</p></speech>

If we had a clean canvas, we would go back to 22 June last year.  In the absence of that, we seek for the UK to remain in the customs union and retain the closest possible trading links between the UK and European Union.  That in itself is not enough and we must maintain the value of the market in the EU, which from an Irish perspective, is worth over &euro;4 billion for agrifood alone.  We cannot see a position where the market is undermined by cheaper imports of food from countries where the standards of production are not even close to what we have in this country.  I was in Brazil at the end of last year and I have seen production first-hand.  We recently saw the lack of trust and sharing of information between the Brazilian authorities and the EU.  There is a major breakdown of trust in that regard.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that agriculture is high on the Brexit agenda in this country.  We met Mr. Barnier on four different occasions and it was noticeable that he mentioned agrifood four if not five times in his address to the D&aacute;il.  I would like to see it a bit further up the agenda and within British Prime Minister May's sphere of interest.  It may have been pointed out already this morning but from the UK farmers' perspective, nine of the top ten countries from which the UK imports food are in the EU, with seven of the top ten countries to which it exports food being in the EU.  The EU is very important to the UK and especially its farmers.  There is also between &euro;3 billion and &euro;3.5 billion going to UK farmers from the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  The CAP has been very good to all EU consumers.  If people are not from a farming background and hear of the Common Agricultural Policy, we might just think of supports for farmers.  In 1962, when the CAP was introduced, the average family spent 30% of family income on food; last year, the average family would have spent 12% of average income on food.  I would like to think the food produced in Europe is the top-rated in the world.  That is what the European consumer is getting as a result of CAP; it is not restricted to the Irish consumer but its effects are felt right across Europe.  I mentioned the 300,000 people employed directly or indirectly in agribusiness in this country and there are 44 million Europeans involved in the agrisector.  It is a lot of people and, as I mentioned, we are dealing with people's livelihoods.</p> <p>  There has been comment on the level of interest from other EU countries.  We have met a good few EU politicians and ambassadors since last June.  The message we were getting in July and August was that they were listening to us and, more or less, that they sympathised with us but "they" had to be taught a lesson.  I have to be honest and say that was the clear impression I got from them.  It was that we cannot have a position where a country is better off outside the EU than inside it.  I would like to think that in the mean time perhaps attitudes have softened somewhat.  From speaking to politicians from across Europe and other agricultural organisations, I know that when we spoke about just the effect in Ireland, it was grand because it did not affect them; we started talking about the &euro;45 billion of EU food going into the UK, and the negative impact on prices if this is displaced from the UK to the EU market, which is already fully serviced.  What would happen with 270,000 tonnes of beef we put into the UK.  Geography dictates much trade and that is why the UK is so important for the likes of cheddar, mushrooms, poultry, pig, lamb, beef and dairy products.  We would look to the next place beyond the UK, which is the EU market, and we will try to dump - or whatever term one might use - the 270,000 tonnes of beef into the European market.  The EU market is already fully serviced for beef.</p><p>It is like anything in that once one goes over what is required to supply a market, one will depress the market.  We have found that European politicians and other farming organisations will engage when they realise that they would be badly affected if the &euro;45 billion worth were to come back onto their markets.  That has been our experience.</p><p> I mentioned Germany already.  We speak about looking at other markets, which is why I mentioned the need for adequate funding for these areas in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Bord Bia in terms of accessing other markets, even though those markets might not be as good, and they will not be as good.  From an Irish point of view, the best market in the world for agrifood products is the UK but we are exporting food to 160 or 170 countries around the world.</p><p> Irish food has an incredible reputation.  Kerrygold, for example, is the number one butter in Germany.  I think it is number two in America.  It is incredible that a small country such as Ireland has such a hold in those countries.  However, speaking to the top man in Ornua's Kerrygold plant in Germany yesterday, it has taken Kerrygold 40 years of solid progression and building success on success to get where it is today and it is not where it wants to be yet.  There are still huge openings to increase its market share.  However, we will only increase market share in those countries if there is adequate funding.  Yesterday and on previous days, we saw the amount of work Bord Bia has done to highlight the safety and reputation of Irish food.  We need to ensure that continues to happen.</p><p> On special status, we have always stated that we accept fully that we must negotiate as part of the EU 27.  That is clear.  However, let us remember that this vote is unprecedented.  A lot has been happening over the past months and that will go on in the future.  It has been and will be unprecedented from a European point of view.  Let us not be afraid to ask or to be bold.  All anyone can say is "No".  Politicians across Europe understand the significance of the UK market from an Irish point of view.  I already mentioned common external tariffs on foreign food coming into the UK or the EU.  We need to try to ensure in the negotiations that there is a common external tariff.</p><p> Those were the points that I had jotted down.  If there were any areas that I have left out, please-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1803" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#EE00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to appear before the committee today.  My name is Paul Kelly, director of Food Drink Ireland and I am accompanied by Philip Carroll, chairman of Meat Industry Ireland.  Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous sector is facing an unprecedented challenge following the UK vote to leave the EU.  The agrifood sector has already been hit hard by the depreciation of sterling, resulting in a reduction in the value of trade to the UK by &euro;570 million in 2016.  This equates to 5,700 job losses.  The continued depreciation of sterling is a major concern, now that the UK Government has triggered Article 50 of the EU treaties and formally set out its approach to Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>  A further weakening of sterling will give rise to greater trade losses, enterprise and job losses for companies most exposed to UK markets and downward pressure on farm incomes.  The future value of UK goods exports, valued at &euro;4.1 billion in 2016, will be determined by exchange rate losses in the short term and ultimately, post Brexit, by the nature of the trading relationship that will exist between the UK and EU.  In a worst case, hard Brexit, scenario, the ESRI has estimated that there will be a disastrous outcome for trade with the UK for many food sectors, including 80% reductions in primary and processed meat exports, a 68% reduction in dairy and reductions of more than 70% for many other food preparations.</p> <p>  It is critical that Government take action now and introduce measures to assist the sector, which is of strategic importance to the Irish economy, in overcoming these challenges at national level while also making a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.</p><p>We believe that various measures are necessary to support the Irish agrifood sector in the face of the fracture already being experienced in our trading relationship with the UK since June 2016.  Such measures would include the relaxation of state aid restrictions at both farming and industry level that impact on the ability of Ireland to address critical stabilisation support measures and strategic transformative initiatives, direct support for farmers through CAP market support and the re-introduction of the employment subsidy scheme and the enterprise stabilisation measures which were last applied during the financial crisis in 2009 to 2011.  Also required is additional support for market diversification and product innovation measures, administered by the relevant State agencies as well as trade support measures, including export trade financing and export credit guarantees, to support the continued development of international export markets.  The Irish agrifood sector also requires access to sustainable financing via the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, supported by the European Investment Bank, EIB. <br/><br/>In the context of the forthcoming negotiations, we welcome the Irish Government's position that to succeed as an open and a welcoming society, we must remain at the heart of Europe.  We acknowledge the Government&rsquo;s acceptance that the agrifood sector is facing particular risks and challenges and that the sector is among Ireland&rsquo;s priorities in the Brexit negotiations.  We believe that delivering an outcome that continues the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the EU and the UK requires that Ireland seeks the inclusion of a range of measures in the EU mandate for negotiations.  In order to minimise economic uncertainty and the potential for major economic damage for exposed sectors, discussions on the future EU, UK relationship must be commenced early in the negotiating process.  The retention of free access to and the maintenance of the value of the UK market are of critical importance to the Irish agrifood sector.  Given the UK&rsquo;s stated determination to leave the Single Market and the customs union, this will require a comprehensive free trade agreement between the EU and UK.  In that context, all sides must commit to negotiate an ambitious and balanced agreement that prioritises continued tariff free and barrier free trade, long-term growth, investment and stability.  The agreement should take account of the special case of the island of Ireland, ensuring that the highly integrated supply chains can continue to operate with free movement of goods and services.  In acceding to a free trade agreement with the UK, the EU must ensure that the value of the UK market is not undermined through lower cost imports which do not meet the standards required of the EU agrifood sector.  We must see the continued application of the common external tariff for agriculture and food imports to the UK and the maintenance of equivalent standards on food safety, animal health, welfare and the environment.<br/><br/>Transitional arrangements must be of sufficient length for businesses to plan and prepare for any new free trade arrangements that may be required to bridge the gap between the completion of the UK two year exit process and the point at which the future EU-UK agreement enters into force.  There can be no reversion to high WTO, most favoured nation, MFN, tariffs on EU and UK imports of food, drink and agricultural products in the period between the UK leaving the EU and a new agreement being finalised, as this could permanently damage trade and livelihoods in the most affected sectors here in Ireland.  Overall, customs procedures must be dealt with as part of the first phase of the article 50 negotiations <br/><br/>Food Drink Ireland and Meat Industry Ireland are committed to working with the Government and the EU Commission to achieve an outcome from the Brexit negotiations that represents the closest possible trading arrangements to those that exist at present.  We appreciate the complex nature of these negotiations.  We also accept that tough negotiations lie ahead in achieving our overall objective of continued free and unfettered access to the UK market post-Brexit.  We urge the Government and the European Commission to be relentless in defending our interests and to stand firm in resisting conclusions that would lead to a hard Brexit, an outcome that serves nobody&rsquo;s interests, least of all Ireland&rsquo;s.<br/><br/><b>Mr. Philip Carroll:</b>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to contribute to the discussion on this important topic.  I wish to underscore some of the points made by Mr. Kelly in his introductory statement.  Members will recall that in October and November 2015, seven or eight months before the Brexit referendum, sterling was trading at around 72 pence to the euro.  It is now trading at around 85 to 86 pence to the euro.  In the period immediately after the referendum in June, it hit a peak of about 92 pence.  We have seen a very significant devaluation of sterling in the period in question.  In the immediate aftermath of the result, the currency was particularly volatile.  Our real concern in the short term, as the negotiations proceed, is that there will be further volatility in sterling.  Of course, that has an immediate impact on the returns available to Irish food processors from their exports into the UK market.  As Mr. Kelly has said, we have already seen the impact of that.  Brexit has already happened.  It has happened in a very significant way in that there has been a loss of almost &euro;600 million in returns from the UK market in the relevant period.  <br/><br/>I note that in recent days Enterprise Ireland, in its review of 2016, has indicated that the growth in value of the UK market has declined from 12% in 2015 to 2% in 2016.  That is indicating that over a full year this year, the likelihood of significant growth in the value loss that was recorded for 2016 will be something of the order of &euro;1 billion.  If such a loss were sustained for any period of time in the agrifood sector, it would equate to 10,000 job losses.  That is the very significant impact that Brexit is having already, even before it has actually taken place.  <br/><br/>Data shows that there has not been a significant decline in volume of exports into the UK but the value decline has been huge.  Were we to reach the point where we have a hard Brexit, then we are in a completely different ball game.  We are not just talking about the relative value of sterling but also about the impact of very significant additional costs through the tariffs and quotas that would be applied in a hard Brexit scenario.  As Mr. Kelly has said, because Brexit has happened, there are two immediate challenges.  One is the current challenge to respond to the market signals that we are getting but the second stage challenge centres on how we engage in the negotiations and the result we get from them.State aid is critical in that regard.  The issue here is about getting some sort of enabling approval from Brussels that will allow a set of measures to be activated by the Irish Government to support the industry through the difficult period of the two year negotiating cycle.  We are not asking anyone to sign a blank cheque.  Rather, we are asking that the Irish Government be allowed to intervene at critical junctures if sterling hits a scale that could be substantially damaging to the interests of the Irish meat processing, dairy processing, drinks and prepared consumer foods sectors over a lengthy of period.  Of course, the immediate impact of all of that is on farmers' incomes.  We are looking for supports that will enable the Government to intervene and to invest in the efficiency of the agrifood industry in response to Brexit.  We also want it to be able to introduce short term measures that will support jobs, prevent potential job losses and stave off those risks for a period until we have greater clarity on what the aftermath of Brexit will be for Ireland.  <br/><br/>In a wider sense, we are looking for free and unfettered access.  That seems a bit of pipedream at this stage, given the position taken by the UK which looks more likely to lead to a hard rather than a soft Brexit.  The British Government has indicated that it believes that the divorce proceedings can be settled relatively quickly.</p><p>Yet we hear a huge narrative about the cost of that, the figures coming out of Brussels and how they would  be rejected in the UK.  It does not seem likely that can be settled as quickly as was envisaged a few months ago.  They have also talked about leaving the single market and the customs union, yet having some rights of retention of access to the EU market in respect of financial services and none of that seems to be compatible with the freedom obligations within the European community.  They will be difficult negotiations as well.  The third one which it seemed to be suggested could also be resolved before the end of March 2019 was the respective rights of EU citizens living in the UK and <i>vice versa</i>.  The community has responded by saying all of these negotiations will be dealt with in their totality at the end, and there will be no short-term decisions taken on any of these issues.  That leaves a lot of room within which there will be serious volatility in sterling.  That means we need to have these enabling provisions put in place to support our industry during that critical period.<br/><br/>On the wider issue, Mr. Kelly is right that we need as close to unfettered access as we can get.  We all know that Brexit will do damage.  There is no question about that, whether it is soft or hard.  It is the scale of that damage that concerns us most.  In that context, we would like to think that there would be negotiations on the future relationship with the UK at an early stage.  We think the Irish Government has done an excellent job in bringing that to the forefront.  That needs to be reinforced as we proceed and those negotiations need to take place later this year or at the very latest in the early part of next year otherwise we will be heading towards a difficult cliff edge in March 2019.  To avoid that we need a transition period because it is unrealistic to expect that a trade agreement can be negotiated in less than a year.  The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, took approximately seven years to negotiate and that is one of the most recent trade agreements negotiated by the EU.  There has been considerable talk about negotiating an EU Japan agreement and the expectation was that would have been finalised before the end of December 2016 but now in May 2017, the expectation is that it might be completed by the end of this year.  That has been going on for six or seven years as well.  There is no real expectation that a trade agreement can be negotiated within the period we are now considering and, therefore, we need a transition agreement which will be pretty much what we currently enjoy in the relationship Ireland has with the UK. <br/><br/>The part of the meat sector most exposed is the beef sector.  We export 52% of output to the EU market, in a hard Brexit if tariffs are imposed a tariff on a tonne of beef would be of the order of &euro;3,600.  That shows the scale of the problem we will face.  Will the British consumer be willing to pay that extra amount?  That is unlikely.  We will then try to sell our product to the European market and potentially depress prices in an oversupplied market.  It is a very difficult situation and I wanted to highlight that area.</p></speech>

It is particularly serious for someone coming from my region.  I am a native of, and live in, County Cavan.  Food processing is a huge source of employment in Counties Cavan and Monaghan.  Any job losses would have serious implications and the jobs would be difficult to replace.  There is a double problem there.  We would all aspire to maintaining the <i>status quo</i>but recent rhetoric would suggest that is not likely to be the outcome.  The tariffs that Mr. Carroll mentioned would make small farms unviable and make Irish beef exports less competitive.  Only factory producers could respond to that.  The processing sector would then be threatened.</p><p>Are the witnesses optimistic that Ireland could have a North-South special trading arrangement and ideally one with the UK which would be important in the food sector?  Are they advocating that and, if so, with what effect?  Are they getting any traction on that?  There is great optimism around free movement of people, but we are not sure there are similar grounds for optimism for the free movement of goods.  </p><p>The sterling fluctuation is a very immediate and serious issue.  It has already hit the mushroom sector in a big way.  The witnesses say that the Government, or basically the taxpayer, will have to be fit to step in to defend the jobs there.  As a local representative I would advocate that strongly.  I hope it would be a viable option.  It is better than trying to source new jobs in the area.  Could they elaborate on the form that might take? </p><p>Senator Paul Daly mentions regularly the fact that so much food is perishable making new markets beyond the UK difficult but where it is possible how optimistic are the witnesses about other markets and are we going after them?  Professor Boyle, the director of Teagasc, told us this morning that we would need much more investment in research and development and innovation to get movement in the market place.  A big problem for many of the food processors in my area is that they source their product north of the Border and the live movement of pigs is particularly difficult.  This is fraught with difficulty and it is a depressing landscape.  I welcome the witnesses because it is important to have their input for our final report.  I would be interested in hearing them elaborate on those matters and what hope, if any, they can offer regions such as ours.</p></speech>

Obviously, Brexit is a challenge, not least because of the value of sterling.  We have to think outside the box.  For example, will we be able to find markets and increase exports to the Middle East, the east and west? </p></speech>

We have been here since 10 a.m.  I was nearly said "depressing submissions" because the submissions do not get any better as we move from one to another.  That is the harsh reality.  There are so many unknowns and it seems to be all doom and gloom.  It is starting to become depressing at this committee because there are very few positives.  While we are all delving and trying to come up with solutions and answers, the solutions, answers and outcomes are somewhat beyond our control.</p> <p>  I would like the delegates to elaborate a little more on their position.  If they were in a similar position based in the United Kingdom, where would they stand on the issue?  While the agrifood sector is a very high priority for us on the island of Ireland, when those who will negotiate the divorce and, in turn, the trade deal sit down, on the British side agriculture and the agrifood sector will not be very high up the ladder.  How do the delegaes as representatives of their sectors propose to get the British side to make it a high priority?  Banging on the door for the sector may get us sympathy all around the world and kind comments and remarks, including from Mr. Michel Barnier, but while we are getting loads of sympathy, when it comes to hard and fast negotiating, will Mrs. Theresa May have 25 other priorities before agriculture and agriculture-related industries even get a mention or a look-in?</p> <p>  Senator Joe O'Reilly mentioned the all-island kite being flown.  If Northern Ireland were to be given special status, at least there would not be a hard border, rather there would be an east-west border somewhere in the Irish sea.  How much of an advantage would that be?  Would we be opening a new can of worms through having an all-island economy?  We would be able to trade freely between Dublin and Belfast, but Belfast would still be part of the United Kingdom and we would still be a member of the European Union.  The agriculture sector would still be part of the CAP, while that in the North would not.  With an imaginary border in the Irish Sea, would there be a situation where a product exported from Dublin to London would be subject to tariff, whereas a product from Belfast to here would not?  While the issue has been flagged by a lot of people, I have said on more than one occasion, including today, that it might be seen by our colleagues in the EU 27 as a goodwill gesture that would go a big part of the way towards solving our problems, but it might not be.  We have to look at the worst and best case scenarios.  We are hoping for the best, but we have to consider and prepare for the worst.  If we were to end up with an all-island economy, would it be of advantage to either of the respective areas the delegates represent? </p> <p>  We have had representatives of different sectors of agriculture before us today, but there is only so much we can discuss and we have gone through most of it already.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1811" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Kelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#HH00400"><p>The first question raised by all three Senators was about the Border and the regional dimension.  I will start by stating, as is generally known, that agrifood is the largest indigenous sector.  In all regions, particularly outside the greater Dublin area and Cork city, in its broadest sense, it has by far the largest industrial output and level of employment.  Therefore, it is hugely important to the regional economies, all of which are in the bottom half of the 1,330 NUTS 3 regions in Europe.  Ireland has a very high GDP <i>per capita</i>ratio.  However, it is the cities that rise it.  From a regional perspective, we are disadvantaged in the European Union.  The big concern is that the economic sector which is most affected is the most important in each of the regions.  That is of critical importance  The growth plans the industry has included in the national agrifood strategy, Foodwise 2025, will be a key part of regional development.<br/><br/>With regard to the Border, it is acknowledged that there is very intense agrifood activity in the Border region, including County Cavan.  There is the particular issue of the Border and the implications Brexit will have, initially for the currency but also further down the line.  There are very deep integrated supply chains.  It has been mentioned that a lot of raw material comes from the North and <i>vice versa</i>.  That characterises the nature if Ireland-UK food imports and exports.  It is not just all about finished goods.  There are a lot of intermediates and ingredients travelling in both directions.<br/><br/>I share the lack of optimism of the Senators and think of the speakers who spoke this morning.  It is very welcome to see the issue of the Border and North-South trade being mentioned in the first phase in the three priorities Mr. Barnier has to deal with from an EU 27 perspective.  However, it is very difficult to see how we can find a free-flowing solution for goods if the United Kingdom moves outside the Single Market and the customs union.  The United Kingdom will be a third country and an international market.  There will be various pieces of legislation that will need to be complied with and official controls applied.  It is very difficult to see how there will not be certain requirements that will have to be dealt met.  To what extent can we minimise the friction?  That is what I believe we need to be looking at, including electronic rather than physical solutions.<br/><br/>Yesterday some of the representatives of the French farming sector called for a hard border between the North and the South because they were concerned about the flow of goods and materials in the European Union from an area what would effectively be outside it.  That is the challenge we are going to face on the issue.<br/><br/>With regard to an east-west border, unlike the Border between the North and the South, any special case that we will be able to develop around it will be very limited.  The issue of an east-west border will be very much decided by the EU 27 and the United Kingdom and the trade relationship between them, despite the fact that we are their most important partner.  It is worth bearing in mind that about 40% of our food and drink exports - about &euro;4 billion in value terms - go to the United Kingdom.  A number of countries that adjoin the United Kingdom, including France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany, are all exporting food and drinks to a similar value to the United Kingdom, but in percentage terms, it is significantly less.  Therefore, the impact on them will be be significantly less.  We will probably need to deal with that issue with the United Kingdom together as the EU 27.<br/><br/>The important point to bear in mind is that North-South trade is very much about deeply integrated supply chains.  We, therefore, need to address the managing of supply chain issues.  There are products which move North and South and businesses with operations on both sides of the Border.  An east-west border is more about markets.  Ultimately, we are selling to 65 million people in Britain.  We also need to focus on that issue.  If that market is shut off to us, unfortunately, the supply chain issues will not be as important.  I believe there is a certain degree of leverage with the European Commission and the negotiating team in task force 50, an aspect on which we need to continue to work.</p><p>Mr. Carroll alluded to currency risk being a significant and serious issue.  State aid rules need to be changed to allow supports to be put in place.  That was done in 2009 at European level when we had the financial crisis and that allowed the agencies here such as Enterprise Ireland to put measures in place under state aid rules.  We welcome that in the negotiating position of the Government, which was published a few short weeks ago, a specific reference to the need for measures in the event of a serious disturbance in the Irish economy.  That is alluding to that type of issue.  Further work on that will need to be done by the Government to ensure changes to these rules.</p><p> All three Senators referred to market diversification and new markets.  Between 2010 and 2016, food and drink exports to the UK increased by &euro;1 billion but, at the same time, as a percentage of our overall exports to the UK, they decreased.  The reason was that we were increasing exports to the rest of the EU and other international markets at a faster rate.  Diversification into other markets is continuing.  Bord Bia's annual report on exports, which comes out in January every year, stated this year that we are exporting to 180 countries, an increase of five on last year.  A small number of countries account for the bulk of value and volume of our exports.  In 2016, there was a reduction of more than &euro;500 million in exports to the UK.  Half of what had been built up in painstaking fashion over six years building on the work of the previous decades disappeared overnight.  That is the type of risk we face.</p><p> Market diversification is, therefore, hugely important and that is why we have called for a &euro;25 million fund for market retention in the UK market and to build on overseas markets.  That additional money needs to be put into Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, and the companies themselves.  Companies need to invest significantly if they move into a new market.  For example, if they want to build a business in Sweden, Germany or Italy, that is an expensive proposition.  Many businesses, particularly SMEs, will need a great deal of support to put experienced salespeople on the ground and for trade financing and so on.  Mr. Carroll may add to that shortly.</p><p> Senator Daly made a point regarding the UK perspective.  We have a great deal of contact with our fellow food organisations in the UK, not only about Brexit but about a variety of food policy issues.  We have had that constantly because we are effectively a single market in terms of Irish companies operating in the UK and UK companies operating here, with a similar legal system and the same food legislation, which is currently European in origin.  Based on our interaction since July last year on Brexit, there is a clear indication that they share similar concerns to us for a number of reasons.  Ireland is the largest export market for British food produce.  They want the same free, unfettered access we have into the UK market into our market.  They are a deficit producer; they produce less than two thirds of their own food requirements.  They require raw materials, intermediates and finished food products.  Importers share almost identical concerns to an Irish or French exporter who exports into the UK.  They are concerned about currency, tariffs and regulatory divergence.  Despite the fact that, as in Ireland, food manufacturing is the largest employer among manufacturing sectors, it does not have the same resonance or importance as the agrifood sector in its totality has in Ireland.  It is not up the political pecking order in the same way as other business sectors.</p><p> That can be demonstrated in anecdotal terms by the fact that the director general of the Food and Drink Federation in the UK managed to meet our Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine before he managed to meet the UK Minister with responsibility for agriculture, Ms Andrea Leadsom.  That shows how the sector is perceived in the UK in political terms and that is a concern for us as well.  We have been working, as have the Government and the Irish embassy in London, to push agrifood up the agenda in the same way as the UK food and farming industries.  It needs to be up the agenda because it is only then that the policy concerns and policy remedies will be understood and accepted by the British Government.</p><p> The same applies at European level.  We have worked closely with European bodies, including FoodDrinkEurope.  They very much support our policy recommendations.  We are building a coalition of interested countries, particularly those that are close to the UK on the other side of the English Channel and the North Sea.  One of the big issues is the food and drink sector which, despite being the largest employer at European level, comprises 99% SMEs and, therefore, it does not jump off the page like the UK financial services industry and the German car industry.  There is a huge body of work to be done to make sure everybody is aware of the economic importance, the existing employment and the regional impact that agrifood has not only in Ireland, but in all members states, including the UK.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1813" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Carroll" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051800002#JJ00200"><p>Mr. Kelly replied to most of the issues addressed by the Senators.  Senator O'Reilly talked about optimism and I agree we have little grounds for optimism, most particularly in respect of the agrifood sector.  However, I hope over the next 12 to 18 months that there might be a little more realism in the negotiations, especially about the impact they will have on economies around Europe and, in particular, the UK economy.  There is a complete contradiction in the UK position.  They want certain things but they are not wiling to accept obligations associated with their ask.  For example, they may not have the same level of concern that we have about the agrifood industry but they have a concern about holding their ground in respect of financial services, IT consultancy services, and the automotive and automobile industries.  They want to hold their position strongly in these areas but they will have to temper their requirements and demands on exiting to maintain the level of business they do with other European countries.  There might be grounds for optimism in that respect.  It may not be built on the agrifood sector but, nonetheless, nothing can be agreed regarding individual sectors with the EU unless everything is agreed.  If there are any grounds for optimism, that might be it.</p> <p>  There is a misunderstanding about where the responsibility for market diversification lies in many respects.  As Mr. Kelly said, we are exporting to 180 countries with 37% of our exports going to the UK.  That means 63% of our exports are diversified across 179 other countries.  That is massive diversification.  Approximately half of those exports go to the European Community other than the UK and rest goes to other international markets.  Diversification is not only about what the industry itself does; it is also about the Government having a responsibility and engaging with third countries with a view to gaining market access.</p><p>For example, there is ongoing dialogue that we hope will prove fruitful in the case of China.  I refer to beef exports to the Chinese market.  Last year we concluded an agreement on access for beef exports to the US market.  The negotiations are in the initial phases and entail the Governments talking to each other and agreeing to the ground rules for market access.  It will then be up to the industry to exploit it by negotiating with customers with a view to their importing product.  We have been talking to China for 13 years.  It is a very slow process and negotiations do not happen overnight.  It takes two parties to conclude them.</p><p> Diversification also involves looking elsewhere in Europe.  Bord Bia is looking at areas where it can seek to build a significant market share within the French, German and Dutch economies.  Because of the implications of a hard Brexit, one must seek a share of markets that are already well supplied.  That can have a impact in depressing prices when one seeks to enter those markets.</p><p> My final comment is on the United Kingdom proceeding to negotiate free trade agreements with other countries in a hard Brexit scenario.  Mercusor agreement countries are engaged in negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union.  The risk is that the United Kingdom will import products from Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil which could result in Irish products being locked out of the UK market.  Ireland will have the tariffs about which I have talked imposed on its products in these markets, whereas a free trade agreement is unlikely to involve such tariffs.  There will be a double-whammy unless and until we negotiate a free trade agreement with the United Kingdom.</p></speech>
