Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.  The next item is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  No. 3A.1 is correspondence, dated 4 February 2013, from Mr. Shaun Quinn, chief executive, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, re Suffolk Street information office, to be noted and published.  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 7 February 2013, from Mr. Dermot Nolan, chairperson, Commission for Energy Regulation, re providing information requested at the meeting of 17 January 2013, to be noted and published.

The commissioner was asked to provide updated key performance indicators for 2012 but he only had 2011.  He has provided them but they are not very good.  It is 77% for completed investigations or 46% in travel trade licensing.  Can we ask him to explain why his key performance indicators do not hit 100% in each case?</p></speech>

We will revisit the matter in the context of our meeting with the auditors from local government.  We will get information for the Members on the background for the new proposal regarding the audit service.</p><p>  No. 3A.8 is correspondence, received 12 February 2013, from the Waterford Institute of Technology, which was marked strictly confidential, forwarding a Deloitte report in respect of non-pay expenditure incurred in the office of the former president of Waterford Institute of Technology, to be noted.  As previously agreed by the committee, we will await the report of the special inspector before returning to the issue.  I remind Members that the correspondence was given to the committee on the basis that it will remain confidential.  Is there any idea when we will have the report from Mr. Quigley or from the Department of Education?</p></speech>

No. 3A.10 is correspondence, dated 14 February 2013, from Mr. Tom O'Mahony, Secretary General at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, providing information requested at the meeting of 7 February 2013, to be noted and published.  The Accounting Officer has responded promptly to the requests of the committee and I commend him on the information he has provided, as it is needed to examine school transport and free travel, which we will take up at forthcoming meetings.  We mentioned that we would meet with the Secretary General again about some of the expenditure that goes to CIE, but in respect of that amount only and not necessarily the overall accounts, because that is a matter for that company.  However, we will get the opportunity to examine the allocation to CIE, and that is what we were discussing.  That needs to be clarified for the Secretary General.  No. 3A.11 is correspondence dated 15 February 2013 from Mr. Frank Ryan, chief executive of Enterprise Ireland, providing information requested at the meeting of 31 January 2013, to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3B. is individual correspondence.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 6 February 2013, from Mr. Tom O'Mahony, Secretary General of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, forwarding a note from CIE regarding the north Kerry railway.  This is to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to Mr. Liam O&rsquo;Mahony, cathaoirleach, Great Southern Trail.  No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 6 February 2013, from Mr. Ray Mitchell, parliamentary and regulatory affairs division, Health Service Executive, providing information previously requested regarding disability services.  This is to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to Mrs. Mary Farrell, the original complainant.  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 6 February 2013, from Mr. Tony Walsh, private secretary to the chairman, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, providing information previously requested regarding the examination of multinational corporations.  This is to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan.  No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 7 February 2013, from Mr. John Moran, Secretary General, Department of Finance, providing information previously requested regarding the examination of multinational corporations.  This is again to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p><p>  No. 3B.5 is correspondence, dated 12 February 2013, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, providing information previously requested regarding the allocation of apprenticeship training in institutes of technology and colleges of further education.  This is to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to Mr. Pat Brady, the original complainant.  No. 3B.6 is correspondence, dated 7 February 2013, from Mr. Daniel O'Mahony re the home tuition scheme, to be noted.  Mr. O'Mahony is raising policy matters relating to the education of children with autism, which falls outside the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts.  On the issue of the &euro;70 million spent on a pilot project, we will ask the Accounting Officer for a note on the pilot project.  We had referred previous correspondence to the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and while there was a delay in doing so this matter has now been addressed.</p><p>  No. 3B.7 is correspondence, dated 7 February 2013, from Mr. John Fallon re the proposed lease of property on Abbey Street, Ballina.  This is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the matter.  No. 3B.8 is correspondence, dated 15 February 2013, from Mr. Denis Griffin, Department of Justice and Equality, providing a note previously requested by the committee on the Property Services Regulatory Authority.  This is to be noted and a copy is to be forwarded to the original complainant.  No. 3B.9 is correspondence, dated 23 January 2013, from Ms Marie Therese O&rsquo;Sullivan re The Warrens wet and dry homeless hostel, Wicklow town.  This is to be noted and forwarded to the HSE for a note on the matter.  No. 3B.10 is correspondence, dated 24 January 2013, from Mr. Michael O&rsquo;Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, re the appearance of the Commission for Aviation Regulation at the committee meeting of 17 January 2013.  This is to be noted and I will ask the clerk to check back on the transcript and to follow up as appropriate with the aviation regulator.</p><p>  No. 3B.11 is correspondence, dated 25 January 2013, from Mr. Gerry Mullins, chief executive, Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland, re the school transport scheme.  This is to be noted.  We have not finished examining the issue of the school transport scheme as we will have to follow up on issues with the Department of Education and Skills next week.  The complainant is to be informed of this and also given a copy of Mr. O'Mahony's letter which was already considered today by the committee.  No. 3B.12 is correspondence, dated 29 January 2013, from Mr. Michael Brosnan, North Circular Road, Dublin 7, to be noted.  Members will recall that I raised this specific case at our last public meeting because information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act had not been made available to Mr. Farrell in his legal pursuit of his rights against the Department.  The case dates back to 1977.  It may well be that this case should now be referred to an independent review, but we will ask the Department for a further note on the issues raised in this correspondence.  No. 3B.13 is correspondence, dated 4 February 2013, from Deputy Niall Collins re the expansion of bicycle hire scheme.  This is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for a note on the matter raised.</p><p>  No. 3C is documents relating to today&rsquo;s committee meeting.  Deputy McDonald wished to raise an issue.</p></speech>

In the course of that discussion it emerged that, on balance, the analysis of the awarding of that contract showed that it would have been more effective for it not to have gone the PPP route.  I asked for some background clarification as to why that decision was taken.  We were given a commitment that we would be given some background detail on that project but we still have not received it.</p></speech>

It is part 6 of the correspondence from the Secretary General.</p></speech>

That might be the best way to deal with it.</p></speech>

One is a briefing paper and the other is the opening statement.  Both are to be noted and published.</p><p>  Reports and financial statements are listed from 4.1 to 4.12.  The only question I would raise relates to 4.3, 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8, because they date back to 2009 and 2010.  Why are they not up to date?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013022100003#B00700"><p>The Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, accounts for 2010 were delayed.  We had questions about expenditure in respect of the development of a web-based information technology, IT, system which, I understand, was to record awards within the framework managed by FETAC.  We sought explanations and there were delays in getting satisfactory explanations relating to that matter.  Ultimately, we were satisfied that the contract management had been satisfactory, but the result was that we could not sign off on the account until we received those explanations.  We will be examining the project further to see if it delivered what was expected.  FETAC has since been integrated into the Quality and Qualifications Ireland organisation.</p><p>  With regard to the National College of Art and Design, these two audits were difficult to bring to a conclusion because of delays in the production of the financial statements.  There were also gaps in the preparedness of the client for the audit, and there were long delays in obtaining answers to audit queries.  We have completed the 2009 and 2010 audits.  Obviously financial statements for 2011 are not yet ready, which represents a delay of nearly two years.  We propose to issue an audit query in respect of this and we might report on governance matters and accounts production.</p><p>  As regards University College Cork, UCC, there was a delay.  My predecessor reported previously on issues around the transfer of pension liabilities from the pension funds of the universities to the national pension fund.  The delay by UCC in completing its accounts and by the governing body in signing off on them was related to the way in which the liabilities for pensions should be presented; they sought legal opinion on the matter.  The accounts for 2010 were only signed off by the governing authority in September 2012, and were signed off by me in December 2012.  The 2011 accounts were signed off in December 2012 by both the governing authority and me.</p></speech>

In fact, I might have wronged the Accounting Officers because, when we checked, some of the issues had been addressed.  There are some outstanding matters but, in the main, we have received the replies to date.</p> <p>The work programme is now on the screen.  Does Deputy Simon Harris want to raise a matter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013022100004#C00200"><p>I recently submitted a raft of parliamentary questions and correspondence with State agencies about the amount of money various State agencies and local authorities have on deposit.  I estimate there could be up to &euro;3 billion on deposit in hundreds of accounts throughout the country.  These are public accounts and I will not read all of the figures into the record but, for example, the National Transport Authority has almost &euro;19 million on deposit, the Railway Procurement Agency has &euro;45.8 million, Bord Iascaigh Mhara has &euro;3 million and Bord Bia has &euro;5.2 million on deposit.  A very significant amount of money is gifted to the State agencies by these Houses when we pass budgets, yet there does not seem to be a consistent policy on treasury management across State agencies.  In local authorities, which do not directly fall under our remit, the situation is more worrying.  The latest figures available for deposits date to the last day of 2010.  Local authorities do not have more up-to-date information provided to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  This is not to be critical of State agencies for having deposits.  There may be good reason that they should and some may use them for wages and the like.  However, there is a great inconsistency in the level of deposits held by agencies carrying out similar tasks.  The does not seem to be a treasury management structure and there does not seem to be national guidelines on interest rates, the action people should take and the ratio of deposits that is appropriate.  The Committee of Public Accounts should correspond with Accounting Officers and ask each of them to provide us with information on the level of deposits in each State agency that falls within their remit.  When we look at the information, we should then consider interacting with the NTMA.  This could amount to &euro;3 billion in hundreds of accounts with no plan, no strategy and with different interest rates.  It is being carried out on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis with each agency making individual decisions.  It is a substantial sum of money and it will surprise people when they look into the detail of it.

One of the points we raised was the figure of &euro;750 million in balances.  Different organisations have different requirements for working capital in order to run their business.  I suggest getting a view from the Department of Finance, which is a more efficient way of framing questions for other Accounting Officers.  The Department has an interest in ensuring balances are kept within the Exchequer.  This would be a quicker way of getting an overview rather than trying to build it up from individual Accounting Officers.</p></speech>

I have figures in excess of &euro;2 billion, with a number of agencies with large budgets still missing.  At a practical level, local authorities have overdraft facilities and I know the overdraft facility in my county is very large.  People are paying a lot of money to avail of the facility and, at the same time, they may have extremely large deposits.</p><p>  We also have town councils, which will be abolished for better or for worse under Government reform plans next June, with &euro;17 million on deposit.  They have consistently had millions on deposit over the past number of years.  If the money is not spent by the town councils, where will it go?  This is a broader question but we have very little data.  The first thing I would like to do is get the data.  I have spoken to a number of State agencies and there are many good reasons why they have money on deposit.  I raise this not to be critical of them for holding deposits but to be critical of the lack of national co-ordination.  A proactive State agency could seek very good interest rates while another is leaving the money in the bank for years.  That is happening also.</p></speech>

Having fallen in each year since 2007, the net revenue of the State increased by 7.3% to just over &euro;34 billion in 2011.  The &euro;2.3 billion rise was principally accounted for by the introduction of new taxes in the form of a universal social charge and a levy on pension schemes, partially offset by decreases in corporation tax and VAT.  </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioner's assist the Department of Finance in preparing forecasts of annual Exchequer tax receipts.  Net receipts in 2011 were below the forecast by almost &euro;900 million.  Overall, Revenue forecasting has been relatively accurate in recent years with actually receipts being in the range of 2.3% above to 3.9% below the forecasts.  A Department of Finance-led tax forecasting methodology review group concluded in 2008 that the level of forecasting error in Ireland had been high by international standards.  The group noted that of the four biggest tax heads, corporation tax receipts recorded the highest forecasting error between 1999 and 2006.  </p><p>  The difficulty in accurately forecasting corporation tax receipts has increased as a result of the emergence of very significant losses which businesses can use to offset against reported profits.  Revenue estimates that &euro;119 billion of unused losses and capital allowances were available at the end of 2010 to carry forward for offset in future years.  The concentration of accumulated losses in a relatively small number of companies suggests that information of use for forecasting purpose could be obtained by Revenue through analysis carried out on a case-by-case basis.  </p><p>  Given the level of change in national output and the structural change in the economy in recent years, the chapter recommended that the Department of Finance should review the effectiveness of its tax forecasting methods and the reasons for divergence from tax forecasts.  I understand a review is under way.</p><p>  Chapter 9 reviews the performance of Revenue in regard to the collection of debt arising from assessed tax liabilities.  The estimated value of tax outstanding increased significantly between 2008 and 2010 but dropped marginally over the past two years.  The total tax outstanding at the end of March 2012 was just under &euro;2 billion.  One third of the outstanding debt at March 2012 was under appeal and, consequently, not available for collection.  Approximately one quarter was at some stage of enforcement but the remaining 40% or so of the debt was not subject to enforcement proceedings.  </p><p>  Revenue set a target to reduce the level of outstanding collectable debt by 14% between March 2011 and March 2012.  While progress was made, the actual reduction achieved, at just over 5%, fell short of the target.</p><p>  The age of debt is also an important measure because the likelihood of collection decreases over time.  Without specifying a target, Revenue set itself an objective of reducing the overall age of the debt outstanding during 2011 but this was not achieved.  Approximately 70% of tax debt at March 2012 related to tax periods prior to 2010.  </p><p>  Given the complexities of the factors underlying debt levels, it was recommended that Revenue should develop more specific performance measures in regard to its debt management function, including, for example, separate outstanding debt targets for fiduciary and direct taxes and separate age profile targets for collectable debt and debt under appeal.  It was also recommended that Revenue should develop its debt management system to enable the generation of timely management information reports analysing the characteristics and status of outstanding debt and to support the generation of relevant debt collection performance measures.  </p><p>  Chapter 10 reviewed Revenue's approach to monitoring and managing taxpayer compliance.  In order to effectively manage compliance, Revenue needs an understanding of the underlying tax gap.  This is the level of non-compliance by all individuals and businesses liable to pay tax, including unregistered activity.  Revenue collection authorities in other countries have developed methodologies to estimate the tax gap.  For example, figures compiled for the UK suggest that the tax gap there is in the order of 8%.</p><p>  Revenue does not currently produce an estimate of the tax gap in Ireland because of concerns around accuracy of estimates and concerns regarding its usefulness at an operational level.  Some work has been done in regard to the links between relevant economic variables and tax collected but this does not provide Revenue with reliable indications of the level of non-compliance.</p><p>  The audit gap is a more limited indicator of revenue collection performance.  It measures Revenue losses as a result of non-compliance by registered individuals and businesses.  Revenue does not estimate the scale of the audit gap but it carries out a programme of random audits which has the potential to generate broad estimates of the amount of tax not collected from registered individuals and businesses.  Approximately one third of all taxpayers examined under the random audit programme each year are found to have underpaid their tax.  </p><p>  The chapter recommended that Revenue should amend the methodology for its random audit programme to capture additional information on those audit cases, including the amount of the original assessed liability and the value of the tax under declared.  Revenue has indicated that since July 2012, this additional information is being captured.  </p><p>  Revenue is relatively successful in targeting higher risk and higher value cases for audit.  Excluding large cases and special investigations, the average yield from risk-based audits in 2011 was substantially higher than the average yield for random audit cases.  The non-compliance rate for risk-based cases was 73%, which indicates very effective selection of cases for audit.  </p><p>  While targeted audits and assessments result in high value detection of unpaid taxes, Revenue's overall success rate in detecting non-compliant taxpayers is not known.  Deployment of additional resources to carry out more audit and assurance work could be cost effective but better information about the effectiveness of detection of non-compliance is needed to conclude on this.  </p><p>  Revenue employs a wide range of measures designed to have a deterrent effect on individuals and businesses that might consider evading their tax obligations.  This includes publication of the names and amounts of settlements following audits, levying interest and penalties and legal action to recover unpaid taxes.  However, the effectiveness of these measures cannot be assessed in isolation from the perceived likelihood of detection of non-compliance.  Ultimately, taxpayers who may consider not paying their due taxes are likely to be deterred only if the likely adverse consequences outweigh the more immediate benefits of non-payment.</p></speech>

The issues covered include the receipts for 2011 and trends in collection since 2007, outstanding tax debt and write-off, taxpayer compliance and measures to deal with non-compliance.</p><p>  In regard to tax receipts, these increased by &euro;1 billion in 2011 and by a further &euro;2.6 billion in 2012, reversing the downward trend of the 2008 to 2010 period.  Not surprisingly, outstanding tax debt increased rapidly from 2000 onwards given the economic climate but the negative trend in this area has been reversed in the past two years and the debt has declined by &euro;127 million since 2010.  </p><p>  Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with tax obligations by filing the required tax return and paying the right amount of tax in a timely manner.  Our overall strategy is to influence compliance behaviour by making it as easy as possible for people to comply.  This is international best practice among tax administrations, that is, that making it easy for comply with tax obligations encourages compliance.  It also helps to reduce the cost of compliance for the taxpayer.  </p><p>  In terms of risks, avoidance and aggressive tax planning represent a constant challenge and there are very specific risks also in regard to excise.  Also situations where individual or businesses have the capacity to operate with cash need particular attention from us because we recognise that in times of recession, people look for ways to replace lost income or profits.  Last year, we focused much of our audit activity on a wide variety of such cash businesses, ranging from the entertainment sector to white collar professionals, and we will continue this focus in 2013.</p><p>  As part of a targeted approach to tackling oil laundering, we rolled out a new legal framework for that sector followed up with a new IT-based oil movement system, from which the first returns are due very shortly.</p> <p>Tax non-compliance is serious and where there is sufficient evidence to support a criminal court case, the matter may be pursued by our dedicated investigation and prosecution division.</p><p> Last year we collected &euro;36.7 billion for the Exchequer, &euro;21 million more than projected.  This year we have a more significant challenge, with a somewhat higher target of &euro;38 billion and a new local property tax to introduce in an environment that remains challenging for Revenue, for business and for taxpayers.</p></speech>

That presumption of honesty extends to all taxes.  The property tax is a self-assessment tax, so what we have said again and again, and the Minister has repeated this on our behalf, is that in cases in which a person approaches this honesty, we will accept the valuation.  We always do.  When we come to do compliance, which will certainly not be this year, we will be looking at outliers.  There is no doubt that we will look at outliers, as we would not be doing our job otherwise.</p></speech>

Let me give an extreme example - if a return states property X is in band 3 or 4 and it should be valued at &euro;1 million.  Clearly that is a big outlier.  Our compliance campaign will start at the outliers, at the extreme end.</p></speech>

We also suggest they can use the Property Services Registration Authority, if houses were sold in their area, the values are available at the level of an address.</p></speech>

The compliance element of the work will begin with the significant gaps in the valuations.  If there is an outrageous gap between the norm that is emerging for an area and returns, these are the cases in which we will start our work on compliance.</p></speech>

Staff were becoming free in Ennis as a result of public sector reform initiatives with payroll and a number of other shared service initiatives.  We would have had to redeploy these people and it made much more sense to move the work to this area.  The paperwork will be done in Ennis, the planning will be done in Dublin.  Obviously there is a big overlay on the IT side and the Office of the Collector General in Limerick will be central to that, as they will be collecting the money.</p><p>  There is a live online system.  I looked at the prototype last week.  The screens are available and the system is nearly ready.  The logistics are on track.  Staff who will be redeployed from other Departments will come this week or next week.  I have lost track of the dates.  We will be hiring some temporary clerical staff in Ennis and in Limerick to supplement the staff there.</p><p>  We sought an allocation of 100 staff as this is a new tax.  We had no idea of what staff it will take, but now it will certainly not stop at 100.  We must deal with 1.6 million tax returns and we have never handled that large volume in a single month.  This is colossal and it will eat into our own resources.  We will be supplementing it.</p><p>  The allocation in the expenditure report for 2013 for property tax is &euro;25.9 million.</p></speech>

Let me rephrase that.  We have done our best.  I have enough cash resources for the IT development.  We got a capital sum for that.  We have enough cash to run the publicity campaign and so on.  If 1.6 million people all telephone on the same day, we will not have enough staff to deal with them.  That would be an enormous challenge.</p><p>  The challenge is as follows: to make the information campaign as good as it can be; to stagger the issue of the letters, apart from the logistics of the postal system which will stagger it; and to encourage as many people as possible to file online.  It is a very simple procedure to file online.  It will be similar to the way one pays motor tax online.  We will give people a PIN to file online.  If all the pieces fall into place, we will have sufficient resources.  If they do not, we will eat into our other resources, and that is what we will do.</p></speech>

First, I understand the letters will issue from 11 March and continue over a four week period.  What should people who are seeking an exemption or deferrals do?  Will she outline the return dates, the payment dates and the methods by which people can pay?</p> <p>I want Ms Feehily to deal with the issue of ability to pay and financial hardship.  This new measure is being introduced in the amended Bill.  It is obviously an issue.  As public representatives, we are conscious that ability to pay is a key factor.  Can Ms Feehily quickly run through the logistics that come into play in terms of returns, payment dates and payment methods, when the people to whom letters are issued seek exemptions or deferrals?</p></speech>

As this is a self-assessment tax, those who do not receive letters will have the same obligation as those who do.  At the beginning, the message will be "the letters are going out - here is the helpline".  In April, the message will be "all of the letters have gone out - if you have not got one, here is the helpline, get yourself a form or go online".  It will move along like that.  The filing date for paper returns will be 7 May.  The filing date for online returns will be 28 May.</p></speech>

The number of people who will fulfil all of these criteria will be quite small.

They are aware of the financial position of the country.  This is a new tax and if people are experiencing financial hardship, they should be given a fair hearing.

Our experience of previous publicity campaigns is that the nearer they are to the event, the more real and useful they are.

I am sure she is aware that there are very many tax-compliant citizens who regard this not as a just or fair measure but as a sort of Big Brother tax and an unfair imposition on them.  I note Ms Feehily was amused by the story in the media about GPS data and the notion of Revenue officials hovering overhead taking satellite photographs of homes.  Most people did not find the story amusing and it is a measure of just how odious this tax is considered that many people believe it to be the truth.</p><p>  Ms Feehily set out the process she envisages will be used for acquiring information and for estimating and collecting the tax.  I want to explore with her the issue of non-compliance.  A great number of the 1.6 million persons or households the Revenue will write to are in what any reasonable person would be consider to be financial hardship.  Sadly - and this does not fall to the Revenue Commissioners - the definition of financial hardship will not include someone who is on jobseeker's allowance or a State pension because, bizarrely, such categories of person are not considered to be in financial hardship.  All of these categories of persons are captured as qualifying to pay the tax.  What will happen to a person who does not file any return?</p></speech>

I simply wanted to make that clear in order that people on jobseeker's allowance understand they do not have to pay and can defer.  If somebody does not send back the return, two things will happen.  We will obviously engage in publicity at that point, warning people of the consequences and reminding them to send back the return.  What we will then do, which is what I was discussing with Deputy O'Donnell, is to write to them stating they have not sent back the return, and we will move to enforce the Revenue estimate.  This estimate will have been received in the letter in March and April and we will move to enforce it using the full range of enforcement options available to us.</p></speech>

We must remember this is offered in the first instance as a service.  This is a voluntary option that people can opt for in the form.  They can opt to pay their local property tax by deduction at source, so we have set up a deduction at source arrangement with the Department of Social Protection which primarily - this is my strong expectation - will be used almost exclusively on a voluntary basis.  If people want to spread the payments and do not have salary then their regular payment is their pension and if they want to pay through a deduction at source in their pension, it is entirely voluntary in the first instance.  We have had detailed engagement with the Department and arrangements are in place.  I have to say I do not believe we have had engagement with banks because, quite frankly, this is a normal part of our toolkit.  Attachment orders involving financial institutions would be used a number of times a year in any event, so banks would be familiar with that.</p></speech>

I say directly the reason that, to my way of thinking, is the more important part of the puzzle is that the vast majority of people who rely on social welfare payments are not in a position to pay this tax.  One does not have to be an economist or a mathematical genius to do the sums to understand that if is on a payment of &euro;200 or less, and that is one's source of income, one cannot afford to pay a property tax at any level.  One cannot afford to pay it now and unless one's circumstances change dramatically, which sadly for many will not be the case, one will not be able to pay it next year or the year after or the year after that.  Ms Feehily told us she had made a request for 100 additional staff.  I imagine that large numbers of those staff will be dealing with compliance issues.  I emphasise that this is not among a cohort of people who wish to be non-tax compliant.  It is a group of people who simply cannot afford to pay the tax.  It is extremely heavy-handed.  To be honest, I have some sympathy for the Revenue because I would not relish the task of deducting this tax at source, from bank accounts or, worse still, from the social welfare payments of people who cannot afford it.</p></speech>

Our tax system is a self-assessment system and if it is not backed up with enforcement, across all the taxes, we have a non-compliance problem, which will get worse.</p><p>  The strong message we will be sending out to people is that the most sensible thing to do is fill in the return.  The legislation provides for a range of deferrals.  That is a policy matter; obviously, it is not for me.  I remind people, and I will be reminding people in the categories the Deputy mentioned, that if they have not sent back their return on time we will be writing to social welfare recipients reminding them that they had deferral options.  I understand the Deputy does not want me to say this but I need to say it because critical to our fairness approach is to remind people whom we know are on low income because we have the welfare file that they have a deferral option and to claim it they must send in the form.  I do not want to get to the point of mandatory action.  The strategy is for them to send in the form, claim their deferral if they are on low income, and they will qualify.  That will ensure we do not have to get to the place the Deputy is discussing.</p></speech>

There is a deferral but no exemption for people who clearly and fairly fall into "persons experiencing financial hardship", and Ms Feehily also used the term "fairness" in terms of the application of this tax.  The big problem that all of us face, and that Revenue faces, is that Revenue is administering a taxation measure which is not fair.  It is not fair to simply offer deferral to somebody on a very low income or on a welfare payment.  This is a policy decision by the Government and it is ironic that Ms Feehily would come in here, and whatever about being questioned vigorously by Opposition Deputies, to be questioned by Government Deputies also who have supported this measure.  I am not laying the unfairness piece at the feet of Revenue but as public servants the witnesses face a real dilemma.</p> <p>There is every likelihood the Department will use mandatory instruments to take money from people it knows cannot afford to pay the tax.  This proposal is mind-boggling and it is a great pity we have come to this pass.</p><p> Is a deferral something people must seek on an annual basis?  For example, if a person is on jobseeker's allowance in May 2013 and still in that position in May 2014, must he or she return to Revenue to seek a deferral?  Is a deferral granted for a 12 month period only?</p></speech>

The tax is stable for three and a half years, until November 2016, the new valuation date for 2017.  A deferral is available until a person's circumstances change in most cases.  Therefore, people should come back if their circumstances have changed.  However, if the person remains on jobseeker's allowance, the deferral will continue.  Some deferrals have a specific time period such as the one being proposed for homes affected by pyrite, which is three years.  If a person is and remains on jobseeker's allowance, he or she is not expected to come back every year to say this.  We will have that information.</p></speech>

However, if a large proportion are not on social welfare and we need the information, we may build an administrative model to write to them.  The Deputy must leave that question with us until we see what happens.  We are looking into the unknown.  We will receive a lot of returns and have significant work to do to get the shape of the population of who is paying, subject to deferral and exempt.  We must then work out treatment models for all of these categories for next year and the year after.</p></speech>

I am concerned about properties that have been flooded in the past or which face the risk of flooding in the future.  There are hundreds of such homes within my constituency and I am aware that this is also an issue nationwide.  These houseowners cannot get insurance and are in a situation where the market valuation of their property is very low.  In situations where a property has been flooded in the past and runs the risk of being flooded again, what valuation should somebody put on that property?</p></speech>

Usually, despite comments to the contrary, most people have an idea of the market value of their house.  If a house or residential property has certain characteristics to do with location, that will influence the market value, either positively or negatively.  Therefore, it seems that in the case of people whose properties are vulnerable to flooding, that will have an impact on the market value.  They would be perfectly entitled to assess their property themselves, based on their best judgment, at quite a low value.</p></speech>

The minimum tax amount is &euro;45 this year and &euro;90 for a full year in the bottom band.  Therefore, that is what would apply to a property that had a very low market value because of extraneous issues.  People are entitled to assess the tax themselves at a very low value and pay that low amount.  I do not want to say to people that if their house has been flooded, its value is very low or that if it has not been flooded, it has a high value.  They must make their own judgment.  That is the essence of self-assessment.  I am simply saying it is reasonable, in making that self-assessment, to take account of location factors and whether there is a market for the house.  It is perfectly reasonable to reach quite a low value in that self-assessment.  What is important is that if we come to challenge the assessment in due course that that self-assessment be reasonable.  As I said to Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, our challenges will start where there is a wide margin between the norms for the area and the value in a particular case.  If we come to challenge an assessment figure, the only question we will ask is whether the assessment was honestly and reasonably made because the presumption of honesty will apply.</p></speech>

I could name a dozen such roads off the top of my head.  What I want to ensure is that there is consistency.  If we say the tax is based on market valuation, that is what it should mean.  In the case of those who face the injustice of being flooded through no fault of their own, I want to ensure the market valuation they face is one that reflects that risk of flooding, not a value that would be applied to their property in the absence of a risk of flooding.  Would Ms Feehily agree that if a homeowner cannot have his or her house insured, that is a decisive factor in influencing its valuation and should play a decisive role in influencing how he or she values the home for the tax?</p></speech>

I will give an example to illustrate my point.  I met a lady recently whose property has not been flooded since 1954 but a property on a road around the corner from her has been flooded twice in the last decade.  She cannot get any kind of insurance for her home now.  Even though she has never been flooded and is unlikely to face flooding in the future, when she goes to sell her house in the future, the market valuation for it will be the same as that for houses that have been flooded.  In a situation like that, is it reasonable to include that fact in the valuation put forward by this lady and her neighbours to the Revenue Commissioners?</p></speech>

Just to develop this point further, a large proportion of the revenue raised through this tax will be redirected to the local authorities.  That is the objective of a tax like this.  I hope this will result in the realisation of how gigantic an issue this is across the State, where homeowners cannot get insurance.  This will be crystallised by virtue of the revenue lost to the State because of this fact.  I hope this process will feed into solving this problem once and for all.  There are people all over the country listening to this exchange who thought they would be paying tax on the basis of a market value that their properties simply do not have but we are establishing here that flooding risk is a germane factor in how they price their homes.

That is a very helpful clarification.</p><p>  In terms of people supplying information to qualify under the financial hardship conditions, I know Ms Feehily is slightly restricted in terms of what she can say at the moment.  However, she made a point regarding the need for people to supply lots of information in order to meet the criteria.  Is it not the case that an awful lot of the information people would need is already residing with other agencies of the State?  Perhaps an example would be useful here.  Let us say a person applies on the basis of a rapid decrease in income due to a situation beyond his or her control.  What can happen then is that such a person becomes entitled to a social welfare payment or, if it happened in the preceding tax period, the Revenue Commissioners would have captured that data in a tax return or it would be evident, in the case of a PAYE worker, through a fall in income.  Is there not a way for Revenue to gather this information instead of asking people to assemble it, particularly if the information is already held by the State?  Can we not take that additional hardship off people by using the information that is already available to us?</p></speech>

The deferrals are on a self-assessment basis so if people have lost their jobs last year or filled in a tax return last year, certainly they will claim a deferral on the basis of the thresholds we already mentioned and we will have that data and will risk-assess, using that data, in due course.  The new provision refers to "significant" and "unexpected".  The "unexpected" part means that the data is most unlikely to be anywhere, given the prior-year arrangement with tax returns, income tax and so on.  Last year's information could hardly be regarded as "unexpected" this year.  We have to work out what this provision means.</p><p>  The dilemma I face with this is that I have an Act which specifies the terms under which people should pay and should get a deferral or an exemption.  Now I am overlaying onto that something which is a little different but it cannot be different to what is already in the law.  It cannot add to the legislation.  As a Revenue Commissioner, I am not allowed to turn an exemption limit into something that is not contained in the law.  I cannot turn something into a multiple of the exemption limit.  It is a very narrow provision and uses language like "significant" and "unexpected" hardship.  The first thing a person will have to clarify is why the hardship was "unexpected".  We will have to come up with definitions for those words and that is the guidance I am working on at the moment.  With those definitions will come requests for information to support the contention that the hardship was "significant" or "unexpected".  In other words, if a person knew it last year, then it cannot be "unexpected".</p></speech>

I am struck by the huge contrast between Ms Feehily's appearance today and that of officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in the past concerning the household charge.</p> <p>I assume a significant number of lessons have been learned as a result of how the campaign to collect the household charge was rolled out versus the implementation of the property tax.  There was a situation at this committee whereby one of the most senior officials responsible for the roll-out of the household charge conceded that she had not received a letter informing her that she had to pay the household charge or the associated booklet in the post.  Whatever people think about the property tax, I have been struck by the competence of Ms Feehily and her team in the Revenue Commissioners in terms of the preparation that has gone on behind the scenes, and I am grateful for that.</p><p> I wish to address some issues relating to the property tax and then I will move on to some other Revenue issues.  The publicity campaign has been referred to a good deal.  I presume it will take the form of television and radio advertisements.  What type of publicity campaign does Revenue envisage?</p></speech>

It will certainly involve radio and local radio, which we have found to be very useful in the past for our type of messages.  We will have the usual press launches and some print media involvement and so on.  We have trained several people from local Revenue offices and they will be made available to local radio stations throughout the country.  Much of our publicity effort will be of this quieter type and involve engaging with groups of people.  Certainly, there will be print media and radio advertising.</p></speech>

If I am living in a house and I put in an extension next year, for example, a downstairs bedroom and bathroom, in my house, is there some way the Revenue model can work that out?  If I am in that scenario will I have to pay for a valuation?</p></speech>

We took the view that most normal extensions will be within the band.  Valuers maintain that the impact on the market value of a house is not greatly enhanced by sticking on an extra bathroom.  A &euro;50,000 band gives a great deal of room in that sense.</p><p>  There is another message that is important for people to hear.  The valuation date is 1 May.  Any enhancements or additions after that date are not relevant or captured.  It is important that people do not think this should stop them from enhancing their houses in June and July of next year and the year after.  The valuation date of 1 May lasts for three and a half years.</p></speech>

Then, if Ms Feehily or one of her colleagues comes looking for it, I give it up at that stage.  Is that correct?</p><p>  Ms Feehily has dealt with the issue of aerial photographs.  We have been hearing a good deal as well in the media in recent weeks about the snitch clause.  If I buy a house from another party and that party has under-declared then I have a responsibility to liaise with the Revenue.  Will Ms Feehily address this issue?  There have been contrary reports in the media about it and I am somewhat confused myself.</p></speech>

It is in the Bill and, therefore, I am somewhat constrained.  It is still before the Houses.  A certain amount of administration relating to the property tax must take place at a conveyance.  Charges will have to be discharged and so on.  In the context of the conveyance, we maintain that the seller should tell the purchaser the value he or she put on the property for property tax purposes.  The purchaser will assume the responsibility from 1 November following the purchase.  Presumably the purchaser will wish to assure herself that there is no bill stuck on the property because of a deferral.  The issue is part of that discussion.</p><p>  One thing the public debate on this clause taught me is that we need to prepare some dedicated guidance on what will happen or on the implications for a conveyance in the context of this new tax.  We have not done that yet but we will get to it.  That is what it is all about.  It is simply because the charge continues.  A new person is liable and that person must be told.  To echo our earlier conversation, at that point we have a responsibility for compliance as well, whatever about the rights or wrongs of it.  If someone has made a significant under-declaration, we maintain the purchaser should tell us because if the purchaser is paying a vast price for a house, it is material for her to know how the seller valued it.  The purchaser will have to take up the responsibility for meeting the obligations of the tax from the following 1 November.  That is the context for it.</p></speech>

We have to work out with the local authorities how we will manage that relationship.  It would make sense for them as well.  The Bill proposes changes in that category of housing.  Such houses will be taxable at a flat rate, the lowest rate.  The ideal for us would be to get a list and a single amount of money.</p></speech>

The changes in the Bill are relevant in that regard because they will not be affected by the payment and filing dates this year.  The Bill proposes a different arrangement in respect of local authorities.</p><p>  Permit me to be cheeky for a moment.  I wish to avail of a slight opportunity.  Another relevant category is that of social housing associations.  We have had a good deal of engagement with the representative body for the social housing associations.  We are asking them to get in touch with us and to list their properties for us such that we do not write to them, but they have not all done so.  We are telephoning them but it would be most helpful if those in social housing associations would tell us who they are and the names and addresses of the properties in order that we do not write to them.  We have approximately two thirds of them and we have dealt with them but approximately one third have not responded.  We are running a telephone campaign at the moment.  Some are rather small organisations and we will keep on the telephone campaign until we begin to issue letters.  Inevitably, we have made the offer but if it is not taken up, some people in those situations may get letters.</p></speech>

Obviously, it has presented a significant onus or task, as outlined by Ms Feehily today, and it seems to me that the Revenue is meeting it well.  I hope that I will be able to say as much when Ms Feehily is next here after the tax has been implemented.  What is not being done?  How is Revenue managing this within its resources?  Ms Feehily referred to this issue earlier.  Surely something must be suffering.  Revenue must not be giving every area the same level of attention as it did before it had to put a focus on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.377" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013022100013#M02500"><p>I think that is true.  A couple of things are suffering.  We always have a pipeline of very significant information technology developments every year and obviously that is suffering.</p> <p>Quite a number of the new things we would like to do have been moved back into next year and the year after.  This is very big for us but it is not unusual for a new provision to be introduced which requires us to readjust our scheduling.</p><p> The most immediate impact has been on our IT schedule of improvements and enhancements.  It has had an impact in that we have had to close down a tax district in County Clare, with the work being moved to Limerick.  The impact has been solely on the counter service, not on the availability of staff to do audit and compliance work and to provide a telephone service.  It has diverted some of my best and brightest from devising new policies.  For example, normally at this time of the year, we would be updating our audit policy or our policies and strategies relating to PAYE.  The team is instead heavily involved in the business analysis and will also be involved in publicity regarding the local property tax.</p><p> I have tried to ensure at this point that its impact is confined to new things that we would have liked to do and should be doing in order to keep ourselves up to speed.  However, when the returns are sent out, the volume of business could impact on our telephone service for other taxpayers.  I hope this will not be the case.  We will try our best to ensure it does not.  It could also impact on our debt management area.  The letters will be sent out in the name of the Collector General and that office will receive the payments which will need to be processed.  It could impact on collection timeliness at our end, not out there.  We are doing our best to ensure it does not.  I will not be able to answer that question until I see the extent.  The online system is very simple.  If that system helps with diminishing the confusion and volumes, the impact will be minimised.</p></speech>

I refer to a story in the media which has been circulating around these corridors, that Revenue made it clear to Government officials that it could only take on one additional project this year.  It was said that Revenue told Government it could not deal with any other project this year if it were to deal with the property tax.  It is said the other project mentioned was to deal with child benefit.  Did that discussion take place?</p></speech>

I can say that I would have conveyed to officials in places like the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance that in the context of taking on this particular project, if they had any other projects they wanted us to do at the same time, I would want lots of notice and lots of resources.  Revenue tends not to say we cannot do things.  Once we have clarity about what has to be done and with enough time and some resources, we can do a lot of things.  I can see how people might interpret it another way.</p></speech>

The numbers of Revenue staff have been reduced in line with all other public service organisations.  The Revenue Commissioners said that cuts of &euro;15 million to their budget could lead to losses for the taxpayer of &euro;434 million in 2013.  That seems an astonishing assertion.</p></speech>

We were looking for resources - as we always do - because that is our natural state.  We would have engaged with our colleagues from the centre Departments.  We would have warned them of the impact of cuts to our resources.  That has been turned around at some point in the reporting.  We always underline that the impact of a deep cut in Revenue resources will be felt on the other side.</p></speech>

Regardless of who said what or the order of it, could a cut of &euro;15 million actually result in nearly half a billion less in tax being taken in?</p></speech>

We are not the best at figuring out the marginal return.  However, this work has been done in other countries.  If dedicated resources are put into just audit and compliance - not for all of Revenue's work - the international benchmarks are for a return of between one to ten and one to 12.  The UK uses one to 11.  I wish to emphasise that not every person coming into Revenue can make such a return.  It is work for qualified, trained and dedicated auditors.</p><p>  We have carried out some experiments on the debt recovery side.  We have implemented the recommendations in respect of our management information on debt such as the age analysis.  This has resulted in very interesting new information about debt management.  An overtime project cost &euro;200,000 but this resulted in a collection of &euro;4.5 million.  We used some of the new data from the recommendations in the report.</p><p>  When our staff numbers began to be reduced, we made a strategic decision corporately that we would bias the reductions and not apply them evenly.  We have maintained staffing in debt recovery, in collection, in IT and in what we call excise enforcement, the uniformed staff.  Early in the period the Collector General proposed to us that if we gave him 30 staff he could collect a lot of money.  We begged, borrowed and stole 30 staff from other parts of Revenue.  The process took a year.  By using some of the new management information and for an investment of 30 staff, we have collected &euro;79 million.  The Collector General would not have had enough staff to reach these tiers of debt.  Those examples are indicative backup figures to support that assertion.  I admit that we are not the best at the marginal return for every extra auditor but I know that other commissioners have the same difficulty.  We need to improve our management information.</p></speech>

I suppose that is the challenge for the Revenue because we are always telling Departments to talk to each other and when that happens, we give out about the way it is done.  With hindsight, the issue caused a lot of concern.  I ask Ms Feehily to evaluate how that was dealt with.</p></speech>

I am happy to repeat that apology.</p><p>  Many people have asked me if I would take the same action again.  This is pertinent to the question of tax-gap analysis.  It is a classic tax-gap analysis study.  We had macro-data which showed that the Department of Social Protection was paying out X million.  We knew from our files that we were getting tax on minus X million, something less than X million.  We asked for the data and we received it in November.  We did not have time to be as sophisticated with the information as we should have been but the money involved was so material in the context of the national budget arithmetic that we felt we needed to move quite quickly to secure those funds for 2012.  We could have frightened every pensioner but instead we frightened a sub-set of pensioners, albeit a big sub-set.  If we had gone public, every pensioner would have been frightened.  That was our assessment but lessons have been learned, obviously.</p> <p> For the information of the committee, we stated at the time that we estimated that in 2012 there would be &euro;45 million extra and that the amount in a full year would be &euro;50 million.  We will not know for sure whether that has been achieved until the P35 data is submitted and we can compare two exact cohorts.  However, I am absolutely confident it has been achieved.  My confidence is based on the level of uplifts in PAYE payments from pension providers.  We will be obliged to carry out an analysis in order to remove uplifts caused by USC, additional early retirements and so on.  We have to do some work and we will not know for a time.  However, I have no doubts about this.</p><p> We are now in the compliance phase.  We indicated publicly last April that we would be beginning our compliance campaign with pensioners who have &euro;50,000 or more in income in addition to their social protection pensions.  We thought at the time that there were approximately 2,500 of these individuals but it emerged that there were 2,975.  We have now closed 2,600 of those cases.  Some 57% of them were yielding cases.  In other words, we obtained money from them and the average yield per case was &euro;4,177.  I indicated that when we had looked at this cohort, we decided what to do thereafter.  With that kind of yield, the decision was obvious and we moved on to the next cohort.  Again, we achieved a yield of over 50% of cases and the average yield per case was &euro;4,300.  We are now examining the next tranche, which relates to people who have incomes of between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000 in addition to their social protection pensions.  In all of the cases to which I refer, those involved had not reported their additional income.  Our current operation is in the early stages but we have closed over 1,000 cases.  We are finding that only a third of these cases are yielding, whereas in the higher cohorts over one half were doing so.  The average yield per case from the current tranche is &euro;2,300.</p><p> Chargeable persons, namely, the self-assessed, had the opportunity to make declarations up until it was necessary for them to make their tax returns in October or November.  We alerted the tax agents and pre-populated the return with the social welfare information.  In other words, the returns would have indicated that we know people have particular income.  Despite the reminder, 6,600 individuals did not declare their social protection pensions for prior years.  We have analysed these and some of them are fine.  However, 14,700 individuals with earnings of over &euro;30,000 - to be consistent with the PAYE group - did not report their social protection pensions in prior years.  The compliance project in this regard will be starting next.</p><p> We are still working through this matter.  The total yield, on top of the &euro;45 million we included in the arithmetic, has been &euro;11 million to date.  That was recouped in just 12 months.  That is sort of our biggest project.  We have a high-level group which works closely with the Department of Social Protection.  One of the things we have done is to carry out a REAP run for the Department in respect of social protection cases where there are indicators of economic activity on our files.  REAP is our risk evaluation analysis and profiling system.  I cannot discuss this matter in technical terms because I do not understand cloud computing but the Revenue and the Department have a cloud and we have placed the data to which I refer in this.  Our respective officials are working collectively and collaboratively on cases by using the data collected by the Revenue and the Department.  This data has been risk analysed and the officials are working together on it in the cloud.</p></speech>

There are two final issues to which I wish to refer.  A very interesting story appeared in the national media last October which indicated that Revenue believed that Government Departments and public bodies had been involved, on a number of occasions, in offensive tax avoidance or in abuse of the tax system.  As far as I am aware, this related to the classification of employees.  Will Ms Feehily expand on that and outline the current position?  We know how Revenue deals with Joe Public but how does it deal with Government agencies?  If it is discovered that abuse is taking place within a Government Department or agency, can interest and penalties be imposed?</p></speech>

The initiative which attracted attention last year is one I have taken on a number of occasions.  I have written to the Secretaries General a number of times - as a service, not as a threat - and the third time happened to be in the middle of last year.  There are many new Secretaries General and agency heads.  A couple of years ago legislation was introduced which requires all public bodies to report all payments to us - automatically and electronically - for risk analysis purposes.  The context to my communication was to remind people of the range of taxes that impact on public bodies.  I would have written to them and stated that they needed to be aware of all of those taxes and that the payment of VAT and RCT can arise.  There were some who were of the view that said payment did not arise.  Many public bodies do not use tax advisers.  In that context, this was a customer service initiative on my part which ended up being seen in the opposite way.  I was drawing their attention to the range of taxes which apply and the circumstances in which they are payable by public bodies and asking them to pass the information I was imparting down through their systems to their agencies.</p><p>  There is a code of practice for the governance of State bodies.  I am kind of hot on governance.  I have given this speech at a number of venues and not just to State bodies.  I am of the view that tax is a governance issue which should be dealt with by boards.  The latter should pay attention to it and State boards are no different.  I would probably have written that in the letter as well.  As already stated, there is a code of practice for State bodies which requires them to be tax compliant but also to stand off of aggressive tax planning.  I would simply have drawn their attention to the existing code of practice.  If I wanted to inform a public body that I believed it was engaging in aggressive tax planning, I would write a different kind of letter and send it directly to that body.  In addition, I would not discuss the matter with the committee because it would be subject to taxpayer confidentiality.  It was a general informational piece.</p></speech>

She made some comments, which are both helpful and alarming, in respect of the fact that State agencies do not use tax advisers.  Before she arrived, we engaged in a discussion on the substantial sums of money with which some of these agencies deal, the various places in which they deposit them, etc.  Given that SMEs use tax advisers, it is astonishing that large State agencies do not.  I would appreciate Ms Feehily's general take on this matter.</p></speech>

It is not as widespread in the public sector as it is in the private sector.  I am referring to in-house, ordinary tax expertise and that is just an observation I would make.  Public bodies are extremely anxious to be responsible and compliant.  I do not have any reason to believe otherwise.  Sometimes, however, the lack of expertise in-house may perhaps cause them not to understand the full extent of their obligations.  What we wanted to do was invite them to talk to us if they had any concerns, namely, to ask rather than to assume, and they have taken the opportunity to do so.  The committee will be familiar with the fact that public bodies will often make disclosures in respect of their tax affairs in their own accounts.  I am precluded from discussing the tax affairs of individual public or private bodies or private citizens because those affairs are confidential and the entitlements of these entities are no different.</p></speech>

I do not want to take up too much time so I will ask just a couple of questions, to which Ms Feehily may respond together, if she wishes.  In 2011, the Revenue Commissioners petitioned to have companies wound up on 62 occasions.  What was the figure for 2012?</p><p>  The job and statutory function of the Revenue Commissioners is to collect tax.  While they can come to agreements with people, they must ultimately bring in the money, and we will criticise them if they do not bring in enough money.  I take the point in that regard.  However, is consideration or weight given to the impact of an attachment order on the loss of jobs?  There was the high-profile case involving one of the haulage companies.  The Revenue Commissioners put an attachment order on a business and there was a loss of 400 jobs.  In the current climate, how do the Revenue Commissioners approach dealing with businesses?  What is considered by the Revenue Commissioners at the stage of applying for attachment orders?  How many petitions to have businesses wound up were applied for in 2012, as opposed to 2011, in which there were 62?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.399" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013022100016#P00200"><p>Off the top of my head, I am not sure if we have the petitions figure.  My colleagues will look for it while I am speaking to the Deputy.  If I do not have the figure to hand, I will write to the Deputy.</p><p>  In 2011, there were 4,463 attachment orders.  In 2012, there were 4,039, representing a reduction of nearly 10%.  Under a previous Finance Act, we were given a new power to attach salary, and we have used that in only five instances.  It is a power we use very sparingly.  We never use it without having exhausted multiple reminders, all sorts of other avenues, instalment arrangements and time-to-pay arrangements.  In the end, we are very conscious of the impact it can have.</p><p>  The Deputy made a point on our job.  In addition to that, I need to make two other points.  If we do not act against the non-complier or non-payer, we are creating a very uneven pitch for the payer, the business next door.  The second point is that, in many instances, the taxes that are not being paid have been deducted from employees' wages.  The impact is not just on tax as there is also an impact on the Social Insurance Fund because PRSI is not being collected.  It is not just the deducted PRSI but the employer's PRSI.</p><p>  I will not talk about cases.  The Deputy has referred to a particular case and jobs.  If there are many jobs, one can take it that there is considerable revenue from PAYE tax.  Where there are many PAYE employees, there is a lot of PRSI at risk.  This is a consideration.  Certainly, we are very conscious of the level playing field. </p><p>  In addition to the active instalment arrangements, at the end of 2012 we had 16,052 cases under time-to-pay arrangements.  I am pretty certain that there was approximately &euro;102 million in tax represented in those cases.  This is evidence that it is not just talk when we say we engage with business.  The cases would be moving through; it would be a different 16,000 cases if I gave the committee a figure this time next year.</p><p>  Last year, when I was talking about this subject, the figure that stuck in my mind was &euro;85 million in tax under time-to-pay arrangements.  It might be the figure for 2011 that is in my head but, certainly, I know that the figure in tax under time-to-pay arrangements is now over &euro;100 million.</p><p>  We consider the cases made by businesses that come in to us.  Businesses have to be viable.  If they are not, it is an unfortunate feature of the current environment.  If a business is not viable and cannot meet its current obligations in a reasonable fashion, and if its current level of economic activity is not sufficient to meet its current tax liabilities, this poses a question.  Time-to-pay arrangements can arise for historic debts and even current debts if there is a decent business plan such that the business can show how it is working its way out of its problems.  There has to be a viability test in relation to current taxes.  If the level of current business or economic activity or sales is not sufficient to support one's current liabilities, there is a question that we must take into account.</p><p>  We do not seem to have found the number of petitions.  I will get that for the Deputy.</p><p>  Quite often, there are petitions and receiverships caused by Revenue's actions, but we do not petition ourselves.  Our action may cause a creditor's voluntary liquidation.  That will often happen.  We will get the Deputy some data and send it to the committee.</p></speech>

Is it Revenue's job just to collect the tax for which the business is liable?  Is any consideration given to potential lost revenue?</p></speech>

We are mindful always of the number of jobs.  However, I have to keep saying that the level playing pitch argument is important.  If a business with a lot of jobs is operating in such a way that it cannot afford to pay over the PAYE and PRSI that it has deducted &ndash; if I may put it as bluntly as that &ndash; what about the guy next door who is offering the same service?  There may be undercutting of the market taking place at the expense of the Exchequer.  On the one hand, there is the question of future tax streams but there is also the question of the current tax liabilities and the impact this is having on the business next door, which also has a tax stream, income stream and profit to look after.  It is a tricky space.  We do not have a mathematical weighting.</p><p>  I am always struck by the extent to which business representative organisations have been quite content with the level of engagement with Revenue.  They are not complaining.  Therefore, we must have got the pitch between the compliant and the non-compliant about right.</p></speech>

Considering that the Local Government Management Agency was starting from standing still, it has given us a fairly respectable database.  I compliment it on that.</p><p>  My advice was that it was a huge job and that I would need bodies, resources and an early decision.  Normally when we engage with the Department of Finance and the Minister on any new development that might be budget sensitive, we have to be very careful that the discussion takes place in the appropriate manner.  In this case, we needed to be out and about gathering databases and talking to people.  Therefore, I needed a Government decision early.</p><p>  As I said, our business is to implement policy.  My point to several Ministers down the years has been that if the Government gives us clarity early, we will proceed.  Since administrators have networks, we would certainly have advised the Minister to the extent that we have knowledge of how property taxes operate in other countries.  One of my officials was a member of the Thornhill group so we were represented there.  In the end, the drafting of the legislation, under the Government's decision, obviously, is done by my officials.</p></speech>

Once the decision was made that we were doing it, it sort of just went away.  We are the tax administration and it is very common for the tax administration in other countries to collect local charges for redistribution.  A number of years ago, my opposite number in Denmark told me they abolished a whole range of collection agencies in local authorities and gave all the stuff to the central tax and customs authority as an efficiency measure or a kind of shared service.  No, I did not ask "Why me, Lord?" or anything like that.</p></speech>

Self-assessed tax is quite different from the old-fashioned idea whereby we write out to people telling the amount and then they pay.  Self-assessed tax requires a strong element of service to support voluntary compliance and a strong element of deterrent.  These are the characteristics and we have 30-something years experience of self-assessed taxes.  VAT is a self-assessed tax and consequently, I would say that our experience in tax administration generally and in particular in respect of a self-assessed environment probably was one of the factors.</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, I do not know the characteristics of this population.  We are beginning to develop an understanding of the characteristics of the properties.  I do not know whether we will have the same kind of voluntary compliance levels.  Generally speaking, if one takes the random audit programme as a sort of metric, we have 70% compliance across the self-assessed taxpayer base.  This is just in terms of the value or in other words, the amount of income they return.  However, in terms of the submitting of tax returns, for the largest cases we get 98% tax compliance in terms of submitting a form and really, all that is required in most cases is to submit a form in the first instance.  This reduces to 80% compliance at the smaller tiers of these self-assessed cases.  These are the kind of numbers that exist for other taxes.  Between 80% and 95% of those in the self-assessed taxpayer base send in their tax return more or less on time.</p></speech>

Revenue has various enforcement procedures, which Ms Feehily has gone through, and that is absolutely fine.  There is not going to be much resistance because there is no capacity for resistance in this case.  Revenue will just take the money out of people's social welfare cheques, employees' cheques or PAYE.  Is that not correct?

It will be a major lie because we risk-assess our prosecution cases.  It is not even on my radar at this point, frankly, to figure out what kind of cases might, sometime, after a couple of years, find their way into our prosecution programme.  It is not even on our radar.  The only example I can possibly think of is someone who declares a house that is worth more than &euro;1 million and tells a barefaced lie by calling it a couple of hundred thousand euro.  As I stated earlier, the compliance treatment we will apply to the different cohorts will be something we will work out when we see the shape of the non-engagement and the extent of the non-compliance.  I do not think we can plan for the extreme 0.00001%.  At this stage of the project would never plan anyway.  This simply is not on our radar at this point.  I am not saying that we will not do it but it is not on our radar at this point.</p></speech>

I do not think I have had the opportunity to ask the Chairman this before now and while it is somewhat historic, a fair number of prosecutions are under way at present.  How does Revenue make decisions of this sort?  For instance, historically, as far as I am aware there were no prosecutions in the Ansbacher cases.  Why not?</p></speech>

The cases the Deputy mentioned, I am working from memory, were extremely old and our experience has been that very old cases are unlikely either to be acceptable to the Director of Public Prosecutions or to secure a conviction.  There is plenty of case law to support that view although I do not have it to hand.  Consequently, very old cases and very elderly people, which was the position in many cases in respect of the Ansbacher group, were considered unlikely to be suitable for prosecution due to the justice delayed and the lengthy time involved, as well as the lack of sufficient evidence.  That is my recollection but I must admit I did not review Ansbacher for today's discussion.  I have not reviewed Ansbacher for several years.</p></speech>

However, those are the riding instructions to the admissions committee, namely, sufficient evidence and likelihood of conviction.  We have a very small resource available for prosecution.  It is hugely labour-intensive.  The return on investment in terms of cash is modest and, consequently, we must be highly selective and very careful.  The cases that go into prosecution will be ones we believe are likely to succeed in securing convictions.</p></speech>

I do not agree with it but understand it.  In the summary of prosecutions in respect of compliance, it states that 1,083 convictions were secured for 2011, amounting to small amounts of fines for non-filing of income tax, corporation tax and relevant contracts and tax returns.  When one contrasts that with Ansbacher, it very much looks as though Revenue picks soft targets.  Not filing tax returns is hardly on the same scale as tax evasion on that massive scale.</p></speech>

The treatment in the Ansbacher cases was fully in accordance with the law.

The inquiry made certain recommendations.  It gave certain direction to Revenue on how we should behave.  We had very long and exhaustive compliance campaigns which resulted in a huge amount of money.  There were issues to do with the definition of the offence, and that is as much as I can recall.  I think the DIRT inquiry report was issued in 1998 or 1999.</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy how much money we collected as a result, if that is any assistance, but in getting into questions of evidence for something that is that old, I would be afraid I might mislead the committee.</p></speech>

It seems the big fish get away and the small guys, who do not fill in their tax returns or who have undoubtedly committed an offence, are prosecuted.</p></speech>

For the first time, we set up a dedicated investigation and prosecution section.  Since then, we have had a dedicated prosecution programme.  It has included the creation of the submissions committee, that I mentioned to the Deputy, which has criteria for the admissions of cases.  At any given time, and certainly right now, there is a couple of hundred in a pipeline being investigated in that programme, some for tax and some for duty evasion.  Last year, we had 37 custodial sentences imposed between tax and duty evasion.  We had an additional 28 suspended sentences imposed.  On any given day last year, I would guess that there were 12 or 15 people in jail for tax or duty evasion, and on 30 September, we had 22 people serving custodial sentences for tax and duty evasion.</p><p>  Bringing it forward, I certainly take Deputy Ross's point.  Revenue reorganised itself very fundamentally to focus on criminal investigation and prosecution.  We have staffed that division with some of our most technically qualified staff.  Year on year, we have increased the number of prosecutions, but more importantly, our conviction rate is very high.  I have just read out to the committee the results in terms of sentencing.</p></speech>

Our order states that the commissioners are appointed by the president of the executive council, who is the Taoiseach.  In practice, however, we are appointed by the Government, like all Secretaries General.  We are three officials at Secretary General level.  We have the same terms and conditions as Secretaries General and we are appointed by the Taoiseach under statute but in practice by Government and the normal TLAC process for Secretaries General applies.  Appointments in recent years have been publicly advertised and subject to TLAC.</p><p>  By convention, one of the commissioners is appointed by the Minister for Finance to be the Accounting Officer for the purposes of the Comptroller and Auditor General Acts and the head of office for the purposes of the Public Service Management Acts.  That individual is the chairman.  Although the chairman does not have a legal status in the statute establishing Revenue but the files of the discussion of the first board in 1922 show that the Minister for Finance appointed one of the three commissioners as chairman.  According to the narrative that used to be written years ago in the IPA diary, one of the three commissioners acted as chairman but the role is more than that because the chairman is appointed as Accounting Officer and head of office by the Minister.</p></speech>

In 2010, we advertised for principal officers for our large cases division.  We made four appointments and they all came from the private sector.  We advertised for principal officers in information technology and two out of three or four appointments came from the private sector.  We advertised for assistant principals for audit and investigation in 2010 and made 23 or 24 appointments, of whom 22 came from the private sector.  We are very open to taking in qualified individuals from the private sector at the levels at which we make the decisions.  We have also engaged a number of administrative officers - I do not have the numbers to hand but a significant proportion of them came from the private sector or directly from college.  In recent years we have certainly opened up middle and senior management grades and have had a number of interesting applicants and good candidates.  We are happy to be able to make appointments from the private sector.</p></speech>

One of my compliance tools is to alert people to their obligations and then help them to comply.  We got a significant reaction from a number of Departments which asked us to send Revenue officials to meet their officials and provide information sessions.  We have done that for several Departments on foot of requests.  I regard that as the correct way to proceed.  We write to the Departments to tell them, in case they do not know, that they have a range of complicated obligations and they can read a variety of publications, and we also offer them our assistance.  Quite a few of them took up our offer and we arranged information sessions for a number of Departments.  That was the most positive outcome from my point of view.</p><p>  We also have a positive engagement with some of the larger public authorities, for which we have put in place a central liaison to allow them to engage with us on a regular basis if they have a complex range of agencies under their control.  I do not think I am breaching confidentiality by pointing out that we have centralised liaison arrangements with the HSE.</p></speech>

We are satisfied that the majority of cases would be categorised as innocent or technical errors if voluntary disclosures were to be made.  Innocent error and technical error are categories in our code of practice for disclosures.  Everybody knows how to do payroll and our involvement was limited to ensuring they understood the employment classification issues.  A code of practice on that topic is publicly available.  Sometimes they might wonder whether something is an employment.  Cross-border VAT issues arise in other cases which are very complex for public bodies.  In the event that they were procuring across borders we advised them to speak with us if they had any doubts.  In the case of non-regular or not recurring engagements - I do not mean irregular in an accounting sense - they would have needed advice.</p></speech>

When that figure is released from the appeals process, it goes back into the amount for the relevant year.  This is the new and better analysis that we need to be doing.  We have started the process of analysing the debt by age, but when one looks at the old debt, we need to overlay it on when it was put on record.  In many instances, the oldest debt was subject to an appeal stop until a more recent time.  When the appeals process is exhausted and the figure is released, the debt is allocated to the year in which the charge was raised.  Therefore, the old debt can be misleading from that point of view.</p></speech>

That is what I mean about it not being a static figure.  In a given year we will dispose of, using the various collection, enforcement, write-off instruments and so on, approximately 98% of the charges raised.  Therefore, the amount is moving all the time.  A significant proportion of the debt will be subject to active collection, which means it is being moved using some of the enforcement tools we discussed.  Another proportion of it - the figure of &euro;106 million I mentioned - will be subject to time to pay arrangements but will still be classified as debt until it is discharged.  There is an active process of managing the debt and the Chairman is absolutely right.  The newer it is and the quicker we get at it, the better.  This is where the age analysis will come into its own.  We have undertaken the developments needed to enable us to do this and increased the number of debt management teams.  We had 20; we then went to 25 and these teams will be given targets based on the age analysis to focus on the newer debt.  That will not make the picture any prettier, but it means we have a better chance of recovery.</p></speech>

It tends to be current and not aged.  We have an automatic write-off programme every year for small amounts.  They can be quite old, but they are tiny amounts.  The average figure in the last automatic write-off run was &euro;13.  I am ignoring it for this purpose.  The write-off tends to be relatively current, but the issue is what we will do with all of this.  The oldest part has generally been put on record when an appeal is concluded and then it starts to be subject to case work.  We ask for the money.  In the current climate when an old debt is put on record after exhausting the appeals processes, quite often the underlying money in the economic transaction is gone.  Certainly, in that instance, the write-off will increase for these cases.  We tend in our simple minds to think of them as current because it is only available to us once it is released from the appeals process.</p></speech>

Revenue collected &euro;36 billion last year and is expected to collect &euro;38 billion this year.  The Government parties by way of policy decided that they wanted more taxes and then asked Revenue to collect them.  They are, therefore, asking it to collect &euro;250 million this year in the local property tax and double that amount next year.  If I was in private business, I might not be able to increase demand that easily.  Therefore, I would have to refer to my aged debt and my ability to collect and insist on collecting the money I was owed.  There will always be someone who will not pay and there will always be a write-off.  Running an aged debt figure of approximately 40%, taking all of what Ms Feehily said into consideration, including the fact that it reverts to the year it was owed and so on, is a considerable amount.  If Revenue had the &euro;669 million tied up in the appeals system sorted earlier and the investment in the various teams she described in place, the policy makers might not look at a new tax because Revenue was efficient in collecting taxes and sorting out the problems within the current tax system.  Is that fair?</p></speech>

If Revenue had collected the outstanding taxes, they might not have gone near the tax.  I do not want Ms Feehily to comment on that, but I would like her to address the question of efficiently collecting and establishing the taxes due, including the appeals, in order that there is a little write-off at the other end.  That requires the type of investment she outlined where Revenue invests a small amount to generate a significant collection figure.</p></speech>

I could not disagree with this and it would not be fair to ourselves if I did.  However, we receive mixed messages.  If we went after aged debt ruthlessly, there is no doubt that we would be in a situation involving business closures and job losses.  Therefore, as I discussed with Deputy Simon Harris, we try to strike a balance in getting the money.  As I said, 98% of the charges raised is disposed of the following year.  The appeals process is entirely different, as it is completely outside our control.  We are a protagonist in the appeals system.  We do not run it.  People think that because they are known as the appeal commissioners that somehow we have control.</p> <p>We have no control over the timelines and the money is simply not accessible to us.  For example, a very long-running case that went to the Supreme Court in relation to our general anti-avoidance rule took 15 years to go right through the various appeal stages up, down, over and back, so that money was just not there for 15 years.  The average length of time for appeals that do not go to the multiple courts is about 2.5 years.  We cannot improve the efficiency of the appeals system.  That one third is out of our reach.  Certainly in relation to the others, I cannot disagree that different application of resources might lead to a different outcome in terms of the disposal of the debt, but it might not lead to collection if we are too ruthless.  It might lead to a ballooning write-off, a ballooning closure of businesses and then the consequences.  Earlier Deputy Harris asked me if we took into account future income streams.  It will certainly impact on future income streams so I do not think it is that simple, but, at the same time, the Chairman's basic premise that if I had bodies I could collect money-----</p></speech>

I am just suggesting early intervention with some of those that will obviously subsequently appear on its aged-debt list.  While I know encouragement and management at an early stage takes up resources, it might be a better way than having them end up in the hard core of debt based on Ms Feehily's analysis.</p></speech>

This new aged-analysis tool that we have introduced, which we have referred to in the report, will give us the data to do even more of that.  We have had a focus on early intervention.  We are now going to do more of it and all of the debt-management units will be given targets to focus on the debt, with the newest first, to try to stop problems getting worse.  I absolutely agree with that.</p></speech>

What happens up to the point when Revenue decides to send a case to the sheriff for collection?  I have seen cases where matters are resolved with the sheriff.  If they could resolve them with the sheriff, taking into consideration all the penalties that attracts, why do they not resolve them directly with the Revenue before they are allowed to go to that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.564" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Josephine Feehily" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013022100021#U00500"><p>If only I knew the answer to that.  First of all, nothing goes to the sheriff without being positively decided on by a senior officer.  Nothing goes to the sheriff just by a button in the computer - there is no automatic referral.  It is regarded as a serious enforcement tool and we do not allow it just to happen.  The case is assessed.  There will be a debt.  There will be a debt that has gone on for a while.  There will have been either minimal or no engagement.  There will have been reminders and then the case is assessed for the most appropriate enforcement tool, which can range from referral to our external solicitors to the sheriff or the use of attachment order that I discussed earlier.</p><p>  We do find that the referral to the sheriff causes a reaction that we seem to be unable to cause in some cases.  They settle with the sheriff having just refused or failed to engage with us in some cases.  My colleague, Mr. Gerry Harrahil, is just reminding me that at the point where we are issuing the reminders and the demands after the case decision has been made, we point out the cost consequences of not engaging.  So, in other words, we point out that "If this goes to the sheriff, you'll have to pay the sheriff fees".  I have experience of this myself where somebody has actually sent a payment into my own office the day after they got sheriff notice.  Then we have this big mess about who pays the sheriff and if they cross in the post, we will pay the sheriff.</p><p>  The answer is that I do not know, but if there are specific cases I would be happy to hear about what we might have done to get them to engage with us because we will have offered them instalment arrangements.  Inevitably in the kind of case the Chairman is describing, they enter into an instalment arrangement with post-dated cheques with the sheriff and then they have to pay his costs.  We would have given them the same deal without the costs.</p></speech>

I concentrated on a very specific area earlier on in my contribution but I looked at the chapters in preparation for the session.  In respect of the point made by Deputy O'Donnell, the point is made in the chapter on Revenue outturns that in 2011, while 36,000 taxpayers paid corporation tax, 129 were accountable for two thirds of that tax.  A taxpayer in this case is, of course, a company or unit as opposed to an individual.  It goes on to say that a large proportion of the losses, which I assume are what we have just been discussing, is accounted for by a relatively small number of taxpayers.</p></speech>

There will clearly be consequences as we emerge from this difficulty and the issue of mortgage arrears is dealt with in terms of the estimated future corporation tax yield from the same banks.

It happens at two levels.  We are also monitoring the developments very closely because, right now, it is a bit unclear to us precisely what way banks are going to respond, particularly in the personal insolvency area, which has potential relevance to us in all sorts of ways.  We are monitoring it centrally and at the level of cases.  What we will do will depend on what happens.</p></speech>

My comments will, therefore, focus mainly on how these negotiations have evolved, where they currently stand and how we hope to progress from here.  I will be happy to attempt to answer any questions that members may have and to listen to any comments or advice from members on the negotiations.</p><p>  Before turning to the CAP negotiations, I would like to mention briefly a number of other key issues covered by the six-monthly report.  Section 2.7 and parts of section 3 set out the current state of play on some key international trade negotiations.  The conducting of these negotiations is, in the first instance, the responsibility of the Commission, but naturally Ireland, like other member states, takes a close interest in the progress and outcome of these talks.  The Irish agrifood industry, as a large export-oriented sector, can benefit significantly from improved access to overseas markets, and we also have defensive interests, particularly in regard to the high-value European beef market, to which we are a major supplier.  The Minister and the Department, therefore, take a keen interest in the development of both national and EU policy in this area, and we are in a process of near constant engagement with the Commission to pursue our national interests.</p><p>  I would like to take the opportunity to update the report in one respect.  The EU-US high-level working group referred to in sections 2.7 and 3.4 of the report has now reported, and the European Union and United States have agreed to initiate the internal procedures necessary to launch negotiations on what will be known as the transatlantic trade and investment partnership.</p><p>  In addition to the CAP reform, the Irish Presidency is responsible for a crucial phase of the negotiations on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The objective of the Irish Presidency is to build on the partial agreement negotiated under Cyprus and to complete, in the first instance, an overall Council position on the three composite elements of the reform package in the coming weeks, followed by a political agreement with the European Parliament and the Commission by the end of June.</p><p>  As time is limited, I will not dwell on other aspects, other than to draw the committee's attention to the comments in the report on such issues as the food quality package, plant and animal health, forestry and other matters, all of which are active points for the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  In very broad terms, the challenge for the current round of CAP reform is to deliver, in good time, a Common Agricultural Policy that is fit for purpose, that is coherent with the Europe 2020 strategy for recovery and growth and that supports the twin goals of competitiveness and sustainability.  These broad objectives are very much in keeping with the overall theme of the Irish Presidency of the European Union, which is focused on the need for stability, jobs and growth.</p><p>  The Minister made it clear to the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission at the outset of our Presidency that his primary aim is to finalise the Council position and negotiating mandate by the end of March.  This will be followed by inter-institutional trilogues, or three-way negotiations, aimed at overall political agreement by the end of June.</p><p>  Three conditions need to be fulfilled to meet this very ambitious schedule.  First, there is a requirement for a timely agreement on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, which has now been achieved at European Council level.  Second, we need willingness in the Council of Ministers to move quickly to agreed compromises on all outstanding issues in the Council position, which will then allow us to enter negotiations with the Parliament and Commission.  Third, all three institutions &ndash; the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission &ndash; have to be prepared to engage actively in the search for acceptable compromise in the final round of negotiations in the trilogue process.  I would like to deal with each one of these in turn.</p><p>  A significant step forward was achieved two weeks ago when the European Council reached agreement on the EU budget for the next seven years, the MFF.  Subject to the consent of the European Parliament, this provides the necessary clarity on agriculture funding that will allow completion of the negotiations on CAP reform.  The agreement was generally positive from a CAP perspective.  The CAP will still account for almost 39% of the overall budget.  It incurred a cut of 3% compared with the figure in the Commission's original proposals, whereas the total EU budget was cut by 7%.  This represented a good negotiating outcome in the face of significant pressure from a number of sources for a much higher cut to CAP expenditure.</p><p>  A second crucial issue is the distribution of CAP funds between member states.  The formula agreed by the Heads of State and Government for the distribution of direct payment, or Pillar 1, funds between member states had originally been proposed by Ireland and resulted in a relatively favourable outcome for this country.  The result is that the level of direct payments made to Irish farmers has been largely protected, with our direct payments ceiling remaining at over &euro;1.2 billion per year, with a relatively small reduction in order to accommodate new member states and due to the overall cut in the budget.</p><p>  As part of the MFF, overall EU funding for rural development, or Pillar 2 of the CAP, was reduced by comparison with that of the previous financial period.  With a new distribution of funds between member states, this will mean an Irish allocation of approximately &euro;313 million per year in current terms.  This includes a special allocation of &euro;100 million, over the full period, negotiated by the Taoiseach in the final stages of the talks.  Ireland will also benefit from CAP expenditure on market support measures, but the precise figures will depend on commodity market developments.  Taken together, the EU funding to Ireland from direct payments, rural development and market supports will amount to over &euro;11 billion in the seven-year period 2014 to 2020.</p><p>  The summit also reached conclusions on a number of other issues that are central to the CAP negotiations, including: the use of 30% of national direct payment ceilings to pay farmers for greening practices; the implementation of new ecological focus areas, which will be done in a way that does not take land out of production and avoids unjustified income losses to farmers; the co-funding rates for rural development, where the general rate will be 53%; the capping of direct payments, which will be introduced on a voluntary basis by member states; the option to transfer up to 15% of funding between direct payments and rural development; and provision for an agriculture crisis reserve, which will be funded as required from direct payments.</p><p>  The MFF now requires the consent of the European Parliament, and this will be an important task for the Irish Presidency.  A further good foundation for the CAP reform has been laid in recent months on the second condition to which I referred, that of achieving rapid progress on outstanding issues in the Council of Ministers.</p> <p>The Cyprus Presidency built on the work of our Danish colleagues, resolving or progressing a range of issues to the point where, in its progress report in December, it was able to identify the 30 or so outstanding technical and political issues which still need to be agreed by member states.  That progress report now provides the basis for the Irish Presidency's efforts to reach agreement.  Naturally, and this deserves some emphasis, the outstanding issues are those that have been found most difficult to resolve so far.</p><p> Our ambitious target is to finalise all outstanding issues in February and March.  Under this timetable, a comprehensive Council position would be concluded at the March Council, with the negotiating mandate finalised by the end of March.  This would broadly parallel the process in the European Parliament where a plenary vote on the CAP reform package is scheduled to take place in mid-March.  The commitment of Agriculture Ministers to meeting this timeline was evident in the course of a very positive Council debate at the end of January, chaired by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  This has been largely reproduced at official level, where a number of outstanding issues have already been agreed by the special committee on agriculture in recent weeks.  However, the scale of the challenge remains an enormous one and we are dependent on the ongoing readiness of member states to engage constructively with the compromise proposals we are tabling.</p><p> This brings me to the third condition that must be fulfilled if we are to conclude the reform process by the end of June, namely, the active engagement of the three institutions.  Again, there are very encouraging signs on this one.  The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and Department officials have been in ongoing contact with the Commission at political and technical levels for some time now and we expect this constructive engagement to further intensify over the coming weeks and months as proposals are developed and agreement sought.</p><p> There have also been very positive developments within the European Parliament in recent months.  Following the reports produced last summer by the MEP rapporteurs on the four main legislative proposals on the CAP, almost 8,000 amendments were submitted by individual MEPs.  These were then reduced to a more manageable number of compromise texts in December and the Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted on them at the end of January.  This has cleared the way for informal contacts to take place between the Presidency and Parliament ahead of the latter's plenary vote planned for mid-March which should then provide the necessary mandate for the formal trilogue process between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission to begin in April.</p><p> In overall terms, therefore, we are making good progress and we hope that each of these elements will continue to function effectively.  However, we are entering a crucial phase between now and the end of March on which much depends.  Although our focus as Presidency is to broker agreement among the member states at Council, we have also been endeavouring to resolve satisfactorily the key issues from an Irish perspective.  One of these is the important question of how direct payments should be distributed within member states, otherwise known as internal convergence.  As members of this committee will know, a large number of member states have difficulties with the Commission's flat-rate proposal.  In the case of Ireland and some others, this is primarily because of the significant payment transfers that would result.  In other cases, it is because differentiation of payments between sectors or areas is not facilitated.  In others again - primarily the new member states - it is because their existing payment structures cannot be accommodated as simply as perhaps was thought earlier.  We have, therefore, proposed a set of solutions which endeavour to address all of these difficulties by essentially giving the necessary flexibility for member states to respond to their own conditions while, at the same time, respecting the overall thrust of the Commission proposal.</p><p> Similarly, member states have a range of views in relation to how the Commission's greening proposal should be implemented.  We, in Ireland, have our own particular issues that need to be resolved.  These include our desire to make the greening payment a percentage of a farmer's overall payment rather than a flat rate and the need to adjust the three criteria to suit Irish farming conditions.  We have already tabled a proposal that aims to deal with the percentage payment issue and we hope to present a compromise proposal on the greening criteria shortly which will address the main concerns expressed by member states, including Ireland.  The same approach will apply in the case of the outstanding issues under the other two main pieces of CAP legislation on market measures and rural development.</p><p> We are at a crucial time in the CAP reform negotiations.  Good progress has been made at Council level in recent months and the process has been given added impetus by the agreement on the EU budget and the significant steps taken by the European Parliament.  However, we need to build on this momentum, because there is still a lot of work to be done and in this regard, the next few weeks will be especially important.  The negotiation process will continue to be complex and difficult but we are firmly focused on achieving an agreement that will be to the long-term benefit of Irish and European agriculture.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.645" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013022100004#C00300"><p>I welcome the delegation from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll give us an update on where the Council and Commissioner are in regard to the proposal by Commissioner Cioloş that we move to a flat rate payment?  Will he outline what their position is as opposed to the Minister's one and whether they have moved from the position they had that the payments would move to a flat rate payment by 2019?  That would include the greening payment and the core element.</p><p>  Mr. O'Driscoll spoke about the amount of money that was received.  Will he confirm that when one takes inflation into account, one is talking about a 10% decrease in real value terms over the seven-year period in the value of the Pillar 1 payments and an 18% - an almost 20% decrease - in the Pillar 2 payments and that, in fact, it is a very bad deal?  Every other time the CAP money increased but this time it is a very significant decrease in real purchasing power and that decrease will have a major effect on farmers.</p><p>  Mr. O'Driscoll said the capping of direct payments will be introduced on a voluntary basis by member states.  Is he saying each member state can voluntarily create its own cap or is this the European Union cap which is not a cap at all - it is an irrelevant cap in the Irish context?  If it is the European Union cap, has the Minister tabled alternative proposals to cap the maximum payment a farmer can get?  In line with his seeking flexibility in regard to how the Pillar 1 payments are distributed, has he sought flexibility for member states to impose a national cap on Pillar 1 payments?  If, for example, the Commissioner's proposal was to win out against the Minister's one - it looks as if it is 22:5 - one would get some very unusual distortions because one would get farmers with a lot of land getting enormous payments as well as what is happening at the moment where farmers with very good lots of land get enormous payments.  One would also get farmers with marginal amounts of lots of land getting very big payments.  I do not believe either group should get huge payments at the expense of the 98% of farmers who get very modest payments.  In fact, 90% of farmers get under &euro;25,000.  </p><p>  Mr. O'Driscoll did not mentioned whether coupling is on the table at 5% or 10%?  I understand that in Ireland's case, it was only on the table at 5%.  Has there been progress in regard to coupling and a firming up?  Will it be uniform across the European Union, in other words, the same for every country?  There was a provision in the original proposal for areas of natural constraints.  Mr. O'Driscoll did not mention whether that is still on the agenda under Pillar 1.</p><p>  We keep hearing the statement that Ireland is concerned that the proposal to move to flat rate national or regional rates would cause very significant transfers of resources between farmers and that much of this movement is proposed to be front-loaded.  What objection does the Department have to a more equitable distribution of the money?  Why does it resist moving away from something that is totally based on a historic fact - that is, 2001 and 2002 which by 2020 will be 20 years out of date?</p> <p>Why do they keep saying that would, by definition, be a bad thing if the right prescription was found?  I do not agree with the proposal from the commissioner or the Department's approach.  I think the front loading approach would be best because it would also deal with the issues of high intensive small acreage farmers who are a huge number of the farmers in the country.  In regard to the low intensity farmers, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the National Parks and Wildlife Service appeared before the committee and they mentioned the need for significant compensation for farmers engaged in high nature value farming.  The only way of compensating them is across the board because they cannot be compensated under REPS because good agricultural and environmental conditions, GAEC, mean they will have all the work done under Pillar 1 and there will be nothing left to do under Pillar 2 and in any case Pillar 2 is decimated having been reduced by 18%.  Will the witnesses explain how farmers will be compensated for GAEC  in the areas about which the Department is concerned - abandonment of land and the ecological disaster that would follow?  It was made clear to us that without farming these areas will not survive.  How does one square that with a policy of campaigning strongly against them getting a decent payment in view of the ecological service they provide to the State and the European Union?  There appears to be a contradiction in that case.</p><p> I note what the witness said about the greening payment.  It is consistent with everything that is being said.  It appears the witnesses want it paid on an individual farm level whereas the Commission wants it done right across the board.  There appears to be a desire to freeze Irish history in 2000, 2001 and 2002 and regardless of whether one is farming now or at whatever level that one keeps one's 2000 payments and that the historic issue goes on and on.  No doubt if the same Government is in office in seven years time it will pursue the same policy of trying to preserve things in a historic context.  We will get to the year 2100 and we will still be paying people in respect of what they did in 2000 even though nobody will be left from that period.  The Department's policy is to preserve not what farmers are doing, or why they are doing it, or the constraints on them but history irrespective of what they are doing at present.  I ask him to explain the logic behind this as it does not appear to encourage people to farm actively; in fact it is the opposite.  It means that if one is lucky enough to get the payment that one can sit back and do virtually damn all and continue drawing the money.</p><p> In regard to Pillar 2 payments there is an 18% reduction.  Will the witness please clarify two issues?  When I take the total package of Pillar 2 or the total rural development programme and the national finances added to Pillar 2, how will the next Pillar 2, based on the MFF and taking the national contribution into account, compare to the last rural development programme?  In other words, does the figure include the national money?  Do we know what the national finances part of the Pillar 2 pool will be?  Will he confirm that forestry payments will not be paid out of European Union funds as that would have a huge effect on Pillar 2 payments?  Will he confirm that the Department will not try to save money by transferring 100% forestry payments out of Exchequer funding into a mixture of European Union and Exchequer funding?  If that were to happen it would have a disastrous effect on Pillar 2 payments.  </p></speech>

The renegotiation or review of CAP is long overdue.  I do not think it has been distributed equitably enough to keep the maximum number of people engaged in agriculture or on the land.  Given that the conversation and negotiation are ongoing there is an opportunity to deal with the small and medium-sized family farm which is gradually being eroded from the landscape.   Mr. O'Driscoll said he hoped to send a compromise proposal on greening criteria shortly.  Can he enlighten the committee on the compromise proposals from an Irish perspective?</p><p>  In regard to the cap on payments, Sinn F&eacute;in and other parties are advocating a cap on payments.  We suggested &euro;100,000 with a gradual reduction to &euro;50,000 over 50 years.  What are the views of the witness on that issue over four years?  What is his assessment regarding other European Union countries in respect of a cap on maximum payments?</p><p>  In regard to an article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal  </i>re minimum payments, what is the definition of minimum payments?  Has any consideration been given to the payment of a percentage rather than a flat rate on a holding up to X number of hectares, either coupled or decoupled historically from thereon?  In regard to flexibility for member states the witness mentioned that we would respond on our own conditions.  How realistic is this?  Ideally we would like sovereignty over how we distribute our funding?  How rigid is the commissioner's position regarding flexibility being allowed to member states?</p></speech>

As I have just been informed that we must make the room available for another meeting at 10.45 a.m., that means we have 37 minutes remaining.</p></speech>

Before touching on the CAP, I wish to question the EU-US high-level working group and the agreement to initiate internal procedures to launch the negotiations for a transatlantic trade and investment partnership.  What impact could this have for exporting Irish beef to the US?  Is there a timeline on those trade negotiations?  What is the Irish dimension?  I presume beef is the issue which would be of most interest to this committee.</p><p>  In regard to the CAP, the MFF and the overall budget, that the total budget was cut by 7% while CAP was reduced by 3% is as good as one could have hoped for in the circumstances.  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said it was the first time there was a reduction in CAP but it also the first time there was a reduction in the overall budget.  Given that the CAP reduction was not in the region of 7% but was less than half that is progress and we have to make do with the situation.</p><p>  The witness said the implementation of new ecological focus areas will be done in a way that does not take land out of production and avoids unjustified income losses to farmers.  Perhaps he would expand on that issue.  As with all negotiations, much is probably done at the end, in the heat of battle, late at night.  He mentioned moving on to the trilogues process.  How will the Parliament be represented in that process?  Mindful of the fact that at one stage there were 8,000 amendments which were trimmed down to about 3,000, that was more manageable.  Perhaps the witness would let us know how he sees that as it could end up being unwieldy.</p><p>  In regard to the desire to make the greening payment a percentage of a farmer's overall payment rather than a flat rate and the need to adjust the criteria, the witness said a proposal has been tabled.</p> <p>Can the representatives of the Department expand on what the proposal is?  The option to transfer up to 15% of funding between direct payments and rural development was mentioned and might be expanded on slightly also.</p></speech>

We must acknowledge that progress has been made.  The budget is agreed and there has been a cut of 7% overall and 3% for CAP.  We did not fare too badly in difficult times and must move on with what we have and distribute it fairly.  It is very important that active farmers get the payment and that we do not have a situation where farmers can sit back and draw down significant payments.  We have seen this a little in the past when farmers built up significant payments.  It was the advice they were receiving.  They would then sit back and not farm to the extent of farmers with lesser payments.</p><p>  Is the capping of overall payments being considered?  It was touched on earlier.  Will there be front-loading?  That is important.  I am also interested to know about Pillar 2, which includes environmentally disadvantaged areas, suckler schemes and sheep schemes, all of which are very important.  It is important to fund schemes to encourage people to return to farming those areas that have natural restraints, including commonages, which were discussed by the committee last week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.652" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/980" speakername="Tom Barry" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013022100006#E00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  Can they develop some points on questions I asked previously on greening?  Has anything been done in respect of the situation in which tillage farmers find themselves at a disadvantage with the screening proposal and the ploughing of permanent pasture?  I remind the witnesses of the important example I gave previously in which, if a farm comes up next to a tillage farm and is put into permanent pasture for five years, it is taken out of the system.  We will lose tillage land at a terrible rate if we do not provide some mechanism for permanent pasture to be taken out and rotated.  We must be really careful or we will not have a tillage industry.</p><p>  In the context of greening and tillage, is it possible to introduce protein crops?  There is a huge deficit of protein in Europe.  When I spoke to the Secretary General for agriculture in the EU, he said that was one of his concerns.  I was surprised that he raised the matter.  We are well capable of growing protein here.  Perhaps we do not have the expertise we had, but it might work if it were introduced under the blanket of greening.</p><p>  I do not like the transfer of 15% from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2.  How will that work out?  I do not have any urge to drop 15% of my payments into Pillar 2.  In the CAP legal framework proposals that came out a few months ago, there was mention of a diversification grant for alternative enterprises.  Have they been developed any further and are they embedded into Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, or are they separate?  Emergency funding was also mentioned.  Is that going to be taken out of Pillar 1, or will there be a separate fund for emergency reliefs?</p><p>  I recognise that we all come from different sectors, but I do not consider that levying out payments and providing them all over the country is going to make better farmers of people who get payments.  Quite frankly, I bought my entitlements.  Many people were delighted to sell their cattle.  They got the 22-month and slaughter premiums paid up front and it worked for them.  Those of us who had to take the risks are still farming actively.  While I can understand the urge to level out the payments, doing so will affect productive agriculture.  We must be aware of the production potential of land.  There is no point in sending money up to the top of a mountain where no production is going to take place.</p></speech>

Like previous speakers, I welcome the MMF agreement in the last number of weeks.  It is a positive step and we can move on now to negotiating the real issues that affect us.  The reference year is an issue that has affected us but we have heard very little about it recently.  What is the situation with that?  It is having a detrimental effect on the price of conacre.  There must be some stability and certainty brought to that soon.</p><p>  The age profile of farmers here and across Europe is very high.  There have been suggestions about incentives for young farmers.  Has there been any talk of incentives to move older farmers out of the system and to get younger farmers back in?  It must be a two-way process.  There is no point in having younger farmers come in if older farmers are still in the system.  There has to be an incentive in both directions.</p><p>  It was suggested in the earlier part of the negotiations that we would be doing away with bureaucracy.  Will greening introduce an extra element of bureaucracy?  It seems to involve a great deal more paperwork.  We need a more simplified system.  The inspections regime irritates most farmers.  We have recently seen a great deal of talk about the horse burger issue and the reported lack of an inspections regime in that context.  At farm-gate level the inspections regime is very rigid.  Will it be as rigid in the future if there is going to be a simplified system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1123" speakername="Brian &Oacute; Domhnaill" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013022100006#E00500"><p>Today's briefing is important in light of what has transpired with regard to the budget.  One could argue that it is perhaps the best deal we could have got, but it represents a cut to many farmers across the country.   We must take the 3% cut, inflation and the increasing costs faced by farmers into account.  The average single farm payment in Ireland is approximately &euro;10,000.  The cut will be approximately &euro;333 per farmer.  In addition, the new crisis fund that is being established involves a further 3.5%.  If that is the case, the average farmer is set to lose more than &euro;700 in his average single farm payment.  That is a substantial cut, bordering on 10%.  While it is suggested that a farmer will get the money back if there is no crisis, I cannot see it being returned if it is taken away.  It is a difficult problem in light of increasing costs and the weather situation.  It is something that needs to be addressed.  I do not think the average Irish farmer can bear the brunt of that, whether he has a small or large enterprise.</p><p>  The Irish allocation for rural development is &euro;313 million.  There is a 15% shift whereby one can transfer from the rural development fund into the single farm payment and <i>vice versa</i>.  A great deal has been said about the smaller farmer being protected and looked after under Pillar 2.  When one can transfer up to 15% of funds from Pillar 2 into Pillar 1, what will be left under Pillar 2?  I am not clear about the &euro;100 million that was negotiated for people under 25 years of age across Europe.  The presentation referred to it as a special allocation over the full period.  Is this the &euro;100 million for unemployment?  Maybe I am wrong; this might be clarified.  What will the &euro;100 million be used for?</p> <p>I agree with what has been said about the reference year.  It will have a knock-on effect on conacre pricing, but it will also present a great difficulty for younger farmers who will start farming after the reference year.  What will be done, for example, to protect the interests of someone who is starting this year or may have started in the past 12 months because he or she has a right to obtain payments under the single farm payment scheme also?  He or she should not have to look for entitlements from the national reserve.  That would be totally wrong because he or she is as entitled as anyone else.</p><p> The Commission's proposal <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Ireland's proposal and those of other member states gives member states flexibility to make up their minds about how they want to spend the budget.  There is a notion that we must protect production, which is fine.  We all subscribe to this and support the Food Harvest 2020 plan.  There are approximately 123,000 single farm payment recipients, of whom 2,000 receive over &euro;50,000.  That means there are 121,000 getting less than &euro;50,000.  Protecting production is fine, but there will be no production unless small farmers on marginal land producing lambs can produce enough for export and the live trade within the State.  There are two sides to the argument.  The use of reference years to divide the single farm payment in the next seven years is wrong.  I know farmers in my area who have obtained single farm payments in excess of &euro;100,000.  They will draw down the same amount this year and do not have any stock.  They get it because they were entitled to it in the reference year.  There is a neighbouring farmer, a young man who is trying to buy his way into agriculture, but he receives no single farm payment because of the way it is carved up.  An element of fairness must be introduced.  What steps is the Department taking to examine this issue and has there been a critical analysis carried out of the importance of small farmers feeding into the overall productive cycle of agriculture in the economy?  Has any work been done on this issue?  Some farmers have bought their way into payments, which is a fair argument, but the smaller guy cannot buy his way into them because he is not in receipt of the larger payments.</p><p> There are many small farmers on the western seaboard, the vast majority of whom are in receipt of single farm payments of less than &euro;50,000.  They would love to expand, but they do not have the resources to buy or lease land because the neighbour up the road or 50 miles away has a massive single farm payment and is able to outbid him or her in buying or leasing land.  That is not fair.  Certain farmers use the single farm payment, perhaps through no fault of their own, to compete for land available on the market and prevent smaller enterprises from expanding and developing.  That is happening in certain cases and I can easily give examples of where it has happened.  Any auctioneer who deals in farm land would say the same.  There is a need for balance to protect production and investment but also to allow small farmers to grow and expand their enterprises and ensure those who are ecologically restricted on commonage or poor land are compensated because of the biodiversity side of the work in which they are engaged.  There is a balance to be struck.  I do not see anything in the Department's script to suggest it is looking for that balance.  I am reading that the Department is happy with the <i>status quo</i>.  I would appreciate the delegation's thoughts on that issue.</p></speech>

This is central to some of the core issues that cause concern about productivity, production and access to entitlements.  It is a key issue because of the historical practice whereby if one has these entitlements but is not engaged in production, one can hold on to them.  Many of the concerns that cause what appears to be a difference of opinion can be addressed if that issue can be dealt with properly.</p></speech>

I will try to deal with all of the points raised as quickly as I can, but first I will make some general points.  </p><p>  It is very important to understand the kind of proposals Ireland has been pushing for as a state and is now making as President are about giving member states flexibility to do certain things.  The member state must then decide what it wants to do.  That is a key point.  It is a question of ensuring national sovereignty in decision-making.  Each country is different and the agricultural circumstances as between Cyprus and Finland, or Ireland and Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria are very different.  We believe in providing as much flexibility as is reasonable within a common policy and that affects our approach to the distribution of funds and greening.</p><p>  I will deal with the points as they were made.  On the outcome of the MFF negotiations, the reduction, as against the Commission's proposal, was approximately 3% in real terms under the CAP.  That was a good outcome.  In negotiations we have to deal with the proposals in front of us.  The Commission has a big influence on all negotiations by virtue of the fact that it has the sole power of initiative in the European Union.  If it places a proposal in front of us, that is the proposal on which we negotiate.  We have to move forward or back from it.  We wanted to maintain the full CAP allocation as proposed by the Commission, but it ended up being cut by 3%.  This is in the context of a cap on the overall EU budget which was cut for the first time ever.  Therefore, we have to be realistic.  There may sometimes be confusion between comparisons with the percentage reduction in what was proposed by the Commission as compared to the percentage reduction in the last round, which gives two figures.  There is no doubt that in comparing it with the last round it would be a bigger cut, but that would be true of the entire EU budget.</p><p>  The issue of capping was raised several times.  We do not yet know the outcome.  As part of the MFF decision, the European Council decided that capping would be voluntary.  It is a very short sentence in the conclusions and does not expand on what precisely it means.  That is something Agriculture Ministers will have to consider in the reforms, but we have not yet reached that point in the negotiations.  In early March we will commence discussion of the consequences or fall-out from the various decisions made by the European Council.  We needed that little gap for people to reflect on what was decided in the European Council and exactly what it meant.</p><p>  Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v asked whether we would table a proposal to provide for flexibility in capping.</p> <p>During our Presidency, we must consult all 27 member states, see what is the centre ground and ascertain what the Commission has to say about European Council conclusions.  From an Irish perspective, we believe there should be flexibility for member states in where to place the cap.</p><p> The issue of coupling was discussed in the Council during the Cyprus Presidency.  The European Parliament has also been discussing it, proposing some increases in the provision for coupling.  The Council discussion under Cyprus was closed with the existing Commission proposal in place.  That will go into the trialogue negotiating process and we will have to see what comes out of that.</p><p> There is the issue of areas of natural constraint, formerly known as less favoured or disadvantaged areas.  Unfortunately, there are multiple names.  The issue was mentioned on a number of occasions.  What is important is how one decides what qualifies as a disadvantaged area, to use the Irish term.  The Commission has put forward new proposals on the determination of disadvantaged areas, including a series of objective biophysical criteria such as stoniness, slope in the soil or wetness.  They are used to determine exactly what qualifies as an area of natural constraint and there is continued provision for it under Pillar 2-----</p></speech>

The key is the determination of what constitutes such an area, and that is where the negotiating is concentrated.</p><p>  I will make a point regarding our proposals and those of others on internal convergence.  Any suggestion that the Irish proposal involved retaining the historic model is simply untrue; it involves a very decisive and significant large move away from historic rates of payment.  It is nevertheless not as big or radical as the move proposed by the Commission, which is proposing a flat rate for everybody, regardless of land type, what is being done on the land or environmental benefits.  It would be a crude flat rate for everybody.  It is true that we do not believe this makes sense and that we have tabled an alternative proposal that involves limiting, to some extent, the level and pace of convergence of payments.  It will involve a very significant convergence in payments, with very large increases for those on low payments and significant cuts for those on very high payments, with more moderate raises and cuts for those in the intermediate groups.  It is important to understand that.  Our proposal, as tabled, provides that this is the minimum to be done.  In other words, it creates the space for a member state to use the same methodology but to do more should it wish to do so.  We have also tabled a proposal providing for the possibility of a minimum and a maximum payment per hectare as part of that measure.  As has been correctly mentioned, the Minister has spoken on the possibility of a minimum being introduced publicly.</p><p>  With regard to Pillar 2, there were a number of questions from Deputies and Senators on the 15% transfer rate.  I do not want to cause undue alarm.  This is an optional aspect that has come from the European Council, with the possibility of transferring 15% in either direction.  There are some countries that find it very difficult to spend rural development funds, with some completely failing to do so, leaving significant savings.  Some of those countries - mainly new member states - want to transfer the money to Pillar 1.  In addition, there are older member states that believe Pillar 2 is much more effective than Pillar 1 and want to transfer funds from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2.  Both of these have been accommodated within the proposal, which is completely voluntary and for national decision.</p><p>  Deputies Ferris, Heydon and others raised the question of greening.  I am not really in a position to outline our compromise proposals at this stage but they will be tabled in early March.  In the initial stages of the greening debate, there was a good deal of talk about what was called a menu approach, giving much flexibility to member states in structuring greening.  In the latter stages of the debate, that has been less evident, although there is more talk of introducing some greater flexibility within the Commission's proposal.  The three criteria would be retained but applied in a way that is more flexible at a member state level, particularly with regard to equivalence.  If there is an agri-environment scheme under the Pillar 2 allocation that delivers the same kind of benefits as greening, the farmer may qualify automatically.  That is one way to do it.</p><p>  Another option is a national certification scheme.  This scheme, which would not come under Pillar 1 nor Pillar 2, would deliver at least the same benefits as greening, with the farmer conceivably qualifying under that.  This mirrors an aspect of the Commission proposal that has not got much attention, although it creates an interesting precedent.  The Commission indicated that organic farmers are automatically green, and member states are expanding that somewhat.</p><p>  I will not go into the three criteria for greening in detail, as members know them.  There is a good deal of work ongoing in making those a bit more flexible.  For example, Deputy Barry mentioned the issue of moving land from tillage to permanent pasture, which is an important point from an Irish perspective.  The key issue is that the Commission proposed that a permanent pasture requirement should apply at an individual farm level.  Ireland and other countries have taken the view that it should apply at a national level, allowing much discretion at individual farm level.  I cannot say exactly what will be in our proposals on greening before we table them but members would not be significantly surprised with what may be tabled in the area.</p><p>  I spoke about flexibility.  The issue of beef exports to the US was mentioned.  The key factor blocking Irish beef exports to the US is the BSE provision.  The US blocks Irish beef from entering the country because of concerns about BSE, although the United States and Ireland have exactly the same status with regard to BSE.  The blockage has no merit in our view, and we have been very active in pressing the United States to lift the barrier.  Some progress has been made and there is an expectation that what is called the BSE rule might be published this year.  We are continuing to exert much pressure to get that done.  Members asked about the timeline for the US trade deal, which will take longer.  These trade deals sometimes take two years, for example, to negotiate.  Nevertheless, we will be pressing the BSE rule issue in advance of that, as it is a key matter.</p> <p> There was mention of the sentence about ecological focus areas in the European Council conclusions.  There is a good deal of discussion about what exactly that means.  Deputy Barry mentioned the growing of protein crops.  How does one get a farmer to set up an ecological focus area but not reduce production?  One idea is to get the farmer to grow crops that fix nitrogen in the soil, if that can be regarded as ecological focus.  It has been the Irish position for some time that this should be regarded as ecological focus.  There is a question of what can be contained in the greening proposal.  The Commission has major concerns that this could be seen as coupling, but we will have to work through that issue.</p><p> We hope the plenary session of the European Parliament will give the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, COMAGRI, a mandate to negotiate in mid-March.  That would mean in the trialogue process the Parliament will be represented by the chairman of the agriculture committee, Mr. Paolo De Castro, and individual MEP rapporteurs on the different regulations, Mr. Capoulas Santos, Mr. La Via and Mr. Dantin.</p><p> A question was asked about capping and front-loading.  If Senator Comiskey means by front-loading what we now call the redistribution of payment or payment on first hectares, which has been sought by a number of member states, it is part of our proposal.  I have already dealt with capping, which will be there in some shape or form, although it is not yet clear what exact shape it will be.  He also asked if Pillar 2 will have scope for payment on disadvantaged areas, with issues such as animal or suckler cow welfare.  The answer is "Yes," and it is again up to a member state to make a national decision on this.  Pillar 2 gives much national discretion.</p><p> The crisis reserve or emergency funding was also raised.  There may be some misunderstanding with regard to the figures, as the crisis reserve will amount to approximately &euro;400 million per year over the entire EU, and the Irish share of that will be approximately &euro;12 million.  The members are correct in that it is a rolling allocation and it will be extracted from direct payments and repaid at the end of the year if it is not used.  It is not on the scale that was feared.</p><p> The reference year issue was mentioned a number of times by Deputy Deering and others.  It has been an issue in Ireland but, as I said before, this has not been raised in any other member state.  We continue to tell people not to make decisions on the basis of proposals, and I will not go into the proposals again.  There is a reference to having had a payment in 2011, and in the Council proposal it has been expanded to having had a payment in either 2010 or 2011.  In any case, the issue remains as it was with the change in the Council position.  All of this will go to a trialogue negotiation between the Parliament, the Council and the Commission.  We again warn people not to assume that what is there is a final outcome.  That is the best that can be said.</p><p> The young farmer incentive is in the proposals and it is voluntary for member states.  The Minister has made it very clear that he intends the incentive to operate in this country.  The question was asked as to whether greening brings about extra bureaucracy, and if I am completely honest, the answer must be "Yes".  We made a counter-proposal in the very early stages that it would be better to roll greening into cross-compliance and apply this to the whole payment.  That would have made things more simple.  Ireland and Austria were the only parties to propose that at the time and I can say without a word of a lie that I have been approached by people from a number of countries who have said we were right.  The idea did not fly at the time.  We are still trying to minimise the amount of extra bureaucracy, and that is very much in our minds in making the proposal.  I would be giving an untruth if I said there was no extra bureaucracy.  If the extra &euro;100 million had not been allocated, our total allocation for rural development over the seven years in real terms would have been &euro;100 million less.  Taking the amount spread over seven years and adjusted for inflation, one gets the additional sum.  It was a significant addition in the final lap.</p><p> There were a number of references to internal convergence, with Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill touching on the issue.  There may be an impression abroad that our proposal favours larger rather than smaller farmers.  Considering our proposal and all of the payment categories, including those with low, middle and high payments, farm size is roughly the same in all.  It does not favour larger farmers.  There are both small and large farmers who would be significantly affected by a major cut in rates.  Where a distinction between farmers arises is in stocking rates, as those from whom payments will fall have significantly higher stocking rates; on average, they are double the stocking rates of those on lower payment rates.  That is coming from 2010 data.</p><p> It is true that the payments are based on historic data but as we all know, things change more slowly in farming.  Our data shows very clearly that those on higher payments have significantly higher stocking rates, roughly double the rates of those on low payments.  That holds for small and big farmers.  The Chairman made a related point and we are trying to ensure there is not an unreasonable cut in the payments for the most active and productive farmers.  We are not trying to hit farmers, and that is a misrepresentation of what we are at.</p><p> The Chairman referred to other possibilities within the regulation regarding active farmers.  The active farmer proposal is limited and within the definition in article 4 of the direct payments regulation is the possibility for a member state, on certain types of land, to impose minimum activity and stocking levels.  There was mention of a farmer with no stock who is on very high payments, and that would be an interesting case.  I have covered most points but I apologise if I have missed any.</p></speech>

When the rural development regulation is agreed in the CAP reform, we must draw up a rural development programme.  We are already engaged in a very extensive consultation process and we are undertaking an <i>ex ante</i> appraisal.  We have already commenced work on the new rural development programme.</p><p>  Ultimately, the Government must make policy decisions on what it will want to include in the rural development programme, including whether it will include forestry or fund it as it currently is nationally.  It must also decide how much funding it will put into the rural development programme.</p> <p>As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v correctly notes, in the last rural development programme we put in not only the money required for the co-funding but also additional funding.  That was subsequently cut back but nevertheless, additional funding was put in.

I thank Mr. O'Driscoll, Ms Cannon and Ms McPhillips for coming before the committee.  The witnesses probably have a copy of the document we submitted in December.  I will keep saying that if the objective of a new CAP is, as a Commissioner said at the outset, to produce as much food as possible within the EU sustainably and to protect rural communities, Ireland would have no problem with it.  The key first principle of flexibility is for the member state and we will take ownership as much as possible.</p><p>  We have accepted a move towards convergence and pace and extent is probably the issue to be decided.  The same logic applies to greening.  These are two issues pertinent to active farmers, and they hold the key to many other issues, such as reference years and flexibility.  If the national reserve works properly, it can be used to facilitate young farmers.</p><p>  To that end, as Chairman of the committee I will host on 11 March as part of the Presidency a meeting in Dublin Castle of all the chairmen of these committees across EU member states.  We will deal with the CAP, the Common Fisheries Policy and the young farmer issue.  Our statistics mirror those in the wider EU with regard to the number of farmers under 35, with the rate at 7% or 8%.  It is not just an Irish issue.  We probably have more farmers over 70 than in other member states but we have the same number under 35.  If we are going to produce food in the outlined manner, we need young trained professionals at the helm in managing the land, although not necessarily owning it.  That is a hang-up that we in Ireland have had in particular.  There was mention of reference years and because of our conacre system, there is a specific challenge that goes beyond CAP negotiations.  It goes to the core of the manner in which we allow people to rent land.  That has been alluded to by Senator Barry and others.  The challenge will go beyond this discussion but we should be mindful of it.</p><p>  We have gone over our time but I thank the witnesses.  We look forward to ongoing briefings and the next couple of months will be crucial from an Irish perspective.  We wish the witnesses, the Minister and all the officials and MEPs the very best in the ongoing negotiations.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I am pleased to welcome Mr. Seamus Coffey of the UCC school of economics, and Mr. Nat O'Connor and Mr. Tom McDonnell from the think tank TASC.  This is the first of a series of meetings as part of a debate on the future of Ireland and the European Union.  The session will focus on the implications for Ireland of an evolving European Union in terms of the proposed completion of economic and monetary union and the necessary steps to bolster democratic accountability and legitimacy.  Mr. Coffey addressed the committee last year during the debate on the fiscal compact.  Members will remember those days in March and April.  Representatives of TASC have also been before the committee in the past.  TASC describes itself as an independent think tank dedicated to addressing Ireland's high level of economic inequality.  We all look forward to hearing the perspectives of both organisations on the future of Ireland and the European Union.</p><p>  Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way that he or she can be easily identified.

I welcome the launch of a national debate on the future of the EU and Ireland's place in it.  TASC is an independent progressive think tank whose core focus is economic equality and democratic accountability.  Both of those concerns come together in the question of how we and our European partners are to govern the European economy through treaties, institutions and growing harmonisation of economic and social policy.  The structure of the economic and monetary union is at the heart of that question.</p><p>  I will ask our economist, Mr. Tom McDonnell, to make a short presentation on some of the immediate issues to do with economic and monetary union, which is at the heart of the current debate about where Europe is going and Ireland's place in Europe.</p></speech>

The question is the composition of this integration.  The answer to that question depends on the changing structure of the economic and monetary union.  We know the EMU as constructed was fragile, incomplete, and highly flawed.  There was no centralised authority responsible for the supervision, regulation and, if necessary, resolution, of financial institutions; there was no fiscal transfer mechanism to deal with asymmetric shocks; no automatic stabilisers at eurozone level to replace those lost at domestic level, and no mechanism for offsetting competitive imbalances or for preventing them in the first place; there was no lender of last resort for member states and therefore no circuit breaker to protect against negative feedback loops of spiralling borrowing costs.  Member states were at the whim of massive and destabilising credit inflows and outflows.  The long-term viability of the European Union's EMU depends on correct diagnosis and resolution of its design flaws, and the ending of the three interlocking crises - the sovereign debt crisis, the banking crisis, and the real economy crisis of low growth, high unemployment and high private over-indebtedness.</p><p>  To understand what the EMU will look like in ten years' time we must understand what may be the different solutions to these problems.  We have already seen a number of official policy responses and changes, or proposed changes, to the EMU in recent months.  These include European Central Bank interventions in the secondary bond markets through the securities market programme, SMP, and the new outright monetary transactions, OMT, initiative, or perhaps interventions in the future.  In other words, the ECB has been indirectly buying government bonds through the SMP and has agreed to do whatever it takes through the OMT.  Special purpose vehicles have been created in the form of the EFSF and ESM to preserve the stability of the euro by providing emergency funding lines to sovereigns.  That was the stated purpose of those special purpose vehicles.  Numerous initiatives, including bank recapitalisations and cheap liquidity through long-term refinancing operations, have sought to stabilise the European banking system.  The parameters of a single supervisory mechanism have been agreed, and from the start of 2014 the ECB will, supposedly, be legally responsible for supervising 6,000 banks.</p><p>  Responses to the sovereign debt crisis have thus far been somewhat insufficient.  For example, the structure of the ESM is inherently fragile.  Nevertheless, the ESM is an important crisis stopgap.  It is often forgotten that the historical rationale for a central bank was not to stabilise prices by controlling inflation, but to stabilise the entire economic system by providing backstop or last-resort liquidity to banks and sovereigns.  The OMT initiative was therefore a crucial step and reflects the critical need for the eurozone to have a lender of last resort for sovereigns, for that is precisely what the OMT represents.  The announcement and formulation of the OMT in August and September 2012 was when the euro was existentially saved.  The detail of how each measure is implemented will be very important.  There are potential criticisms in respect of the OMT.  Arguably, this set of measures remains critically incomplete.  Little has been done to ease the growth and employment crisis, and pro-cyclical policies of internal devaluation have taken hold in the periphery.  These policies were undertaken to deal with fiscal and competitiveness imbalances but have not been matched by countervailing measures in the eurozone core.  The overall effect has been deflationary, causing economies to contract rather than grow.  This does not necessarily mean there are alternatives in the periphery but it certainly means there are alternatives within the core.  This has exacerbated and elongated the jobs and growth crisis in Europe.</p><p>  In the medium term, a permanent mechanism is needed so that the so-called multiple equilibria problem of sovereign borrowing costs spiralling out of control is eliminated for any state showing a willingness to pursue a sustainable fiscal path.  Different versions of eurobonds have become fashionable as an idea, but moral hazard concerns mean they are not the solution.  A better solution would be to assign a banking licence to a special purpose vehicle such as the ESM, and then to use this vehicle as a <i>de facto</i> conditional lender of last resort for sovereigns.  I am happy to elaborate on this point.  This would be a key institutional development. </p><p>  The question is how we can break the link between sovereigns and banks.  The next few years will see the gradual construction of a banking union for the eurozone and this will have major implications for the EU as a whole.  A centralised banking union is a necessary component of any viable monetary union in the long term.  In practice, this means independent centralised supervision, regulation and, critically, resolution of financial institutions at the eurozone level.  This will have major implications for member states.  In addition, protecting taxpayers and depositors in the future, while also dealing with issues of capital flight, particularly from the eurozone periphery, will require some form of centralised deposit insurance scheme modelled along the lines of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States.  This would end the differentiation between banks in the periphery and the core and help to create a genuine banking union.  There is the prospect of further integration in the form of a eurozone banking union and possibly the creation of a eurozone lender of last resort. </p><p>  A more fundamental question is whether eurozone member states can align monetary and fiscal policies to the goals of employment and growth.  The answer to that question is &quot;Yes&quot;, but only at the level of the eurozone itself.  The broad framework required involves intergovernmental co-ordination of policies to prevent competitiveness and domestic fiscal imbalances from growing too large.  An example of this is the new European semester.  In order to help offset regional recessions and asymmetric shocks, such a framework will require a centralised fiscal fund.  This is because member states have lost much of their power to use their own budgets as a counter-cyclical automatic stabiliser, while also losing control over other macroeconomic policy levers such as exchange rate policy and monetary policy.  These lost policy tools need to be replaced in some form.</p><p>  Safeguarding democratic legitimacy and accountability within a full fiscal union would require a fundamental overhaul of the treaties and far greater power for the European Parliament and its committees.  However, what I have described is very far from a complete fiscal union.  While greater integration and co-ordination between EU member states is inevitable under EMU, full fiscal union is unnecessary.  It is important to note that in parallel to the formal development of the EMU, other more <i>ad hoc</i> forms of integration will occur.  A good example is the financial transaction tax - also called the Tobin tax or Robin Hood tax - which has been signed by 11 eurozone member states, but not by Ireland.  The European Commission tabled its proposals on 14 February of this year, confirming a levy of 0.1% for shares and bonds and 0.01% for derivatives.  The FTT is an example of the enhanced co-operation procedure permitted under the existing EU treaties.  These types of procedure may become more common in the future as it becomes increasingly difficult to reach agreement between the soon-to-be 28 EU member states.  However, they also represent the risk of a fragmentation of economic policy across the EU, with multilateral agreements replacing common EU-wide policies.</p><p>  The attitude and position of the United Kingdom within the EU is of great economic significance for Ireland.  It seems unlikely that the UK will actually leave the EU, but this is a political question perhaps better answered by my colleague.  I am limiting my response to the likely consequences of particular outcomes rather than speculating on the future of the UK's relationship with the rest of Europe.</p><p>  In summary, this is a critical decade for the European project.  Catastrophic errors were made in the design of the EMU, and economic history and theory were both somewhat ignored.  I have sketched a brief outline of the types of policy needed to create a durable EMU.  There are, of course, other issues to consider.  We are happy to take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013022100003#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to attend today's meeting.  The agenda will be driven by questions and contributions from members.  EU economic and monetary policy is given a lot of attention, but it can be relatively easily understood.  For those interested in studying the treaties, economic policy is dealt with in just five pages, while monetary policy is dealt with in just three pages.</p> <p>However, they seem to have a major influence across different areas.  From an economist's perspective, there is perhaps something more than just economic and monetary policy.  I refer, for example to the workings of the Internal Market, the importance of competition policy, agriculture and fisheries policy, implications in terms of taxation, employment policy and consumer protection.  These all feed in to economic behaviour.  At the macro level, economic and monetary policy would be where it is at.</p><p> In the context of what the EU sets out as what it tries to achieve by means of its economic policy, the top priority is stable prices and this is followed by sound public finances and monetary conditions and then a sustainable balance of payments.  Given the current economic environment in which we find ourselves, all of these bar stable prices have been achieved.  Perhaps price stability has been achieved at the cost of other priorities.  To a certain extent, EU economic policy is somewhat limited.  Ireland is in the middle of an EU-IMF rescue programme but what can actually be forced upon it is relatively limited.  We have certain targets to meet from a fiscal perspective.  However, as is now widely accepted, how we achieve these is largely our responsibility.  The policy itself is not being imposed.  It is more a case of focusing on achieving the targets.  Overall, EU economic policy largely involves monitoring, surveying, compiling reports and holding meetings rather than actually imposing specific policies on member states.</p><p> The EU currently comprises quite a broad spectrum of 27 countries and this is soon to increase to 28.  The policies must hold in countries with completely different systems and approaches.  For example, certain countries might have higher levels of social protection or public provision while states such as Ireland like to claim that theirs are lower-tax and lower-spend economies or that they are moving in this direction.  EU policies must fit and must not involve the imposition of large numbers of restrictions on member states.  They can, therefore, be quite broad.</p><p> For the first decade of the euro, much of the focus from a European perspective was on fiscal policy.  As we know, the currency tended to be quite weak.  There were rules in place by which countries were supposed to abide but these were largely ignored.  This was generally caused by the larger member states tending to ignore the rules at the beginning of the previous decade.  The smaller countries then took the view that if these larger states were not going to be pursued for ignoring the rules, they would not be too concerned about them either.  At the same time, the Stability and Growth Pact, which emerged from an Irish Presidency in the 1990s, largely fell apart.  Much of the past three to four years has involved, in a sense, fixing the Stability and Growth Pact.  There have been various additions to EU treaties and new rules have been introduced.  I refer here to the introduction of the six-pack in 2011 and the recent agreement on the two-pack.  We can discuss some of the issues which emerged there.  It is only really in the past 12 to 18 months that we seemed to get a sense of speed in the context of trying to fix the monetary side of things.  The fiscal side has attracted a great deal of attention but it is clear that EMU rules have always been broken.</p><p> I disagree with Mr. McDonnell to some extent in that I believe many of the failures related to design flaws that were intentional.  The EU faces an issue of encouraging closer integration while also trying to protect sovereignty.  There is no doubt that the weaknesses of the euro were identified at the time.  Various authors and commentators stated that certain things should have been included in the structures relating to the currency but these were left out.  Much of the power was left with individual member states.  The regulation and supervision of banks, for example, remained at national level.  Moving to a fully integrated monetary union in one jump might have been too much and it has taken ten to 12 years for the problems to emerge.  Now, however, there appears to be a willingness to address these and to put in place the type of integration a fully functioning monetary union actually requires.  This will take time.  Estimates to the effect that a European-wide system of bank regulation could be established within 12 to 18 months are way too optimistic.  At least the problem has been identified but it will take a while to get there.  Ireland will be considering the implications of the fiscal rules and the impact these will have when we emerge from the current programme, under which our targets are explicitly set.  When we move out of the programme, we are going to have to decide how we will abide by these rules during the next five to ten years.  We must examine whether these rules can fix EMU and whether they will lead to the development of a euro currency that will not be beset by its current difficulties.</p><p> If there are any issues which members wish to raise, I hope we will be able to shed some light on them.</p></speech>

The proposal in this regard is that where the debts of countries exceed 60% of GDP, they will be pooled and dealt with at a later date.  What are their views on the proposed fiscal transfers countries between countries in order to correct structural weaknesses within economies and to counterbalance any cyclical economic downturns?  How will these transfers work?</p><p>  Mr. McDonnell stated that one of the reactions to the crisis included the securities market programme and Mr. Coffey wrote about this matter recently in the context of the number of bonds purchased by the ECB under that programme.  I understand that almost &euro;20 billion worth of Irish bonds were bought at distressed prices by the ECB in the second half of 2011.  Some of these bonds were purchased for &euro;70 and they are now trading at over &euro;100.  The ECB has, therefore, made a significant profit on the bonds it purchased.  The ECB agreed to return the profits it made on the purchase of Greek bonds to the Government of Greece.  Those profits amounted to several billions of euro.  Should Ireland be seeking a return of the profits made on the bonds purchased and sold on by the ECB?  The figures indicate that the ECB made between &euro;3 billion to &euro;5 billion from purchasing Irish bonds that were in a distressed state in 2011 and then selling them on at a profit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.682" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013022100004#C00300"><p>I thank our guests for their presentations.  One of the concerns regarding economic and monetary union is that it created specific difficulties for smaller member states.  In the context of monetary policy, interest rates were set with the economic performance of large member states in mind.  During the early years of the euro when the German economy was sluggish, ECB interest rates were kept low in an attempt to stimulate investment.  While this made sense in the case of Germany, it created perverse incentives in the context of smaller economies such as that of Ireland which were performing strongly at the time.  The cheap money on offer incentivised reckless borrowing.  Now that the debate has moved on to the possibility of a closer fiscal union, there is a concern that similar problems will arise.  Fiscal harmonisation or greater centralisation of macroeconomic policy at European level could have the consequences of decisions once more being made in the interests of larger member states with big economies.  This, in turn, could have the potential to create more negative consequences for smaller member states and reduce the number of policy tools governments might choose to use in times of crisis.  There is no doubt that such states require greater levels of flexibility in times of crisis.</p><p>  Do our guests foresee the emergence of potential problems - similar to those which arose in the context of monetary union - for smaller member states such as Ireland as a result of greater fiscal and economic union?  If so, are they of the view that such problems could be avoided?  Will our guests also comment on the negotiations relating to the development of a banking union and the impact which slow progress in this regard may have in the context of any deal relating to the State accessing ESM funds to directly recapitalise the pillar banks?  How do they assess the state of play on this front?  From an economist's point of view, what would constitute a good deal at the end of the legacy bank debt deal negotiations?  Mr. McDonnell stated that "In order to help offset regional recessions and asymmetric shocks, such a framework will require a centralised fiscal fund".  Will he elaborate on how such a fiscal fund would work in the context of offsetting such recessions and shocks?</p></speech>

I missed the beginning of Mr. McDonnell's presentation but I have read it in its entirety.  Senator Reilly referred to further fiscal and economic integration.  I am clear on what further economic integration would look like from a banking point of view and in the context of the ability of governments to finance their operations through eurobonds, etc.  I am, however, less sure of what future fiscal integration will look like, particularly as we move beyond where the stand at present.</p> <p>I can see how it could develop in the area of tax harmonisation.  That has been on the table and a policy pressure point for quite a while.  Beyond that and bearing in mind the two-pack and six-pack and the fact that we will be emerging from a programme, what will the position be?  When a state emerges from a programme, further oversight mechanisms are in place.  What is the nature of the remaining aspects of fiscal integration which we can raise as good or bad?  Is there really much more to be done in this regard, excluding harmonisation, which I understand?</p><p> I have two questions for Mr. Coffey.  He stated one of the European Central Bank&rsquo;s initial criteria.</p></speech>

Is a core cause of the eurozone crisis that countries forgot about the balance of payments?  Rather crudely, the balance of payments position is the test of whether a country will be solvent in the long run.  There are countries running deficits left, right and centre, with no consequences.  If a country had had its own currency, things would have happened to it that would have meant governments and central banks would have had to do something.  However, since we did not have a national currency, people saw the balance of payments position as a phenomenon in which economists alone were interested and they believed it would not really have a great impact on them.  This is because all the other warning signs were taken away.</p><p>  How does Mr. Coffey envisage banking union evolving?  With the inevitable pressures that have emerged as negotiations have begun, does he still envisage the ESM playing a role in the direct recapitalisation of future banks, leaving aside the issue about which Senator Kathryn Reilly talked?  Will it be a credible component of banking union as opposed to what we would like to happen?</p></speech>

At the outset, I must state I am quite intimidated by the quality of the questions that have been asked.  Unfortunately, I must ask a couple of questions that probably are like those asked in babies' class in school as against the academic questions posed to the witnesses earlier, which were very intellectually strong and powerful economic questions.  Mr. McDonnell mentioned the example of the financial transaction tax and how 11 countries have signed up to it.  My simple question is, what is his opinion of Ireland opting out?  Is this a positive or negative position according to his intellectual analysis?</p></speech>

A couple of questions come to mind.  The comment, "Responses to the sovereign debt crisis have, thus far, been somewhat insufficient" is an understatement but of course, there are a number of reasons for that.  They have been both insufficient and late and the lateness of the hour has been the biggest single factor.  I will ask the witnesses a question I have asked a number of times.  During the boom, we repeatedly heard that we could not control the economy in Ireland because interest rates were controlled from Europe and, as a result, they could not be varied and nothing at all could be done about that.  All of this now seemingly falls flat because there are varying interest rates throughout the eurozone.  This raises the question as to the reason we locked ourselves in on the basis that we had no control over our own interest rates and could not control inflation or whatever.</p><p>  My next question is also an answer but I will pose the question.  I have held the view for a long time that there will never be satisfactory economic, monetary, social and political cohesion in Europe until such time as there is a single currency right throughout the European Union.  My case for so stating is the United States and asking how successful it would be if 20 different currencies circulated there.  I believe it would not be in any way successful and could not succeed.</p><p>  The final point I wish to raise relates to the financial transaction tax, Tobin tax or whatever one might call it.  My view is that were all countries worldwide where financial services and trading takes place to adopt such a policy, that would be fine.  However, if that is not done, the countries that do not adopt such tax obviously will have a distinct advantage over those which do.  In the same way, countries that stay outside the eurozone but are within the European Union can have an advantage over their colleagues by adjusting their own currencies in respect of the euro.  This has been done repeatedly and is being done in some countries even as we speak.  Possibly this is even being done by some countries within the eurozone.</p></speech>

My first question concerns something that is still only a possible hypothesis.  However, it could happen and there are many strands to suggest it will happen, although I acknowledge Mr. McDonnell stated he thought it might not.  Can the witnesses provide a further discourse on the implications for Ireland and the European Union, were the United Kingdom to leave?  How do they think we would be fixed if that happened?</p><p>  Mr. McDonnell's presentation included a section on aligning monetary and fiscal policies to the goals of employment creation and on having a special fund.  He should talk a little more about that and on what steps he thinks the European Union can take of a practical nature for job stimulus.  Those of us who believe in some of the present policies would argue that by creating the right broad financial conditions, the private sector will then create the jobs.  Mr. McDonnell should comment on what particular stimuli or measures can be taken, apart from the youth guarantee which is very important, by creating a separate fund, etc., to create jobs.  Mr. McDonnell also indicated in his presentation that he does not think eurobonds will work.  Perhaps he will explain this a little more to me or to Deputy Byrne.</p></speech>

One issue with Europe is the question of cohesion on the one hand and fragmentation on the other hand and both the economic and wider political policies speak to that.  At present, we have something of a mixture.  We have the core eurozone of 17 members out of 27.  The economic and monetary union, EMU, policies under discussion are about how the European economy will work but in particular about the eurozone.  At the same time, there are countries like United Kingdom which have a permanent opt-out from the euro, as do Denmark and Sweden.  Even within the 17 eurozone members, there is the question of whether all 17 are going in the same direction with regard to EMU policies or whether there is beginning to be something of a division.  In Ireland in particular, we find ourselves to be a country that is both small and peripheral.  There of course are small countries which are closer to the centre and which have advantages in terms of infrastructure and closeness to other economies.  Ireland is both peripheral and small, even though it is within the euro and close to the centre in that sense.</p><p>  A number of issues exist in this regard and in addition, there also are countries such as Norway, which is in the European Economic Area but is not in the European Union itself, and Switzerland, which has close economic ties but is in neither in the European Union nor the European Economic Area.  In the short term, we have the problem of whether we can get 27 and soon to be 28 countries to agree EMU policies that make sense for all of us and which must have the flexibility to take into account questions such as the core versus periphery and so on, while at the same time controlling fragmentation.</p> <p>I will give two examples.  First, there is a longer game in play in terms of the treaty.  Any country that now signs up to the European treaties must join the euro; it is not optional and a country cannot have an opt-out.  In the longer term, there is certainly a vision of the European Union where, as Deputy Durkan stated, we all have membership of the same currency.  That leaves a question as to whether the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden will eventually opt-in or find themselves in a second tier of the European Union.  Of course, Ireland, being geographically on the other side of the United Kingdom, will find itself in a difficult position.  We would be in a very bad position if the United Kingdom leaves the European Union or pulls away because we trade so much with the United Kingdom, and yet we have growing trade over the recent decades with the European Union.  It would be a bad position for Ireland if the United Kingdom pulled away.</p><p> On the question of what a coherent EMU might look like, there is the question, that Deputy Donohoe raised, of how far might tax harmonisation go.  One of the questions there is size.  Currently, speaking relatively, the European Union budget takes a small percentage of member states' budgets and pools it.  One of the tax harmonisation questions would be, not only what taxes we might harmonise but just how much tax.  For example, if we were to move towards including social insurance as part of tax harmonisation and trying to have harmonisation of social insurance, that would be a major step towards a much larger European Union budget.  It would also be a detailed harmonisation of social protection and social welfare systems which might make sense because it could work well with the integration of the European labour market.  It would strengthen the social Europe dimension because there might be the development of a European-wide stronger social safety net.  That is an example of how it would be a major step, in terms of the amount of money involved in the European Union and, therefore, a transfer of power from the national level to the European Union level.  That then brings in the question of the European Union institutions - the role of the European Parliament, its mandate, its effectiveness in terms of its committee at holding the various European institutions to account, the division between the Commission and the European Central Bank, etc.  All of that becomes an even more serious issue depending on how fast and how much we harmonise in the coming decades.  That is what is at stake in terms of the issue of core.</p><p> Fragmentation is the other side of the coin.  What I have described are some of the forces that might be involved in a more coherent larger European Union over the coming decades, and EMU is at the centre of that.  With something like the financial transaction tax to which only 11 eurozone countries have signed up, the following is what we have seen in those who have not signed up.  Finland is currently holding itself aloof, but the five other countries that have not joined the financial transaction tax all display similar features - these countries have larger financial sectors; while not being tax havens, have features of a tax haven; and are identified in various lists as countries to do with financial privacy, etc.  Arguably, the financial sectors in those countries are against the financial transaction tax, and are persuasive or have arguments why they are staying out.  Malta, Cyprus, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland are the five countries not in the financial transaction tax even though they are in the euro.</p><p> The risk of fragmentation on the political level is one which begins to get a complete incoherence of European policy.  The central train is economic and monetary union where the eurozone countries are growing closer together and something such as the fragmentation we see in the financial transaction tax, could slow that down.  That is really what is at stake.  It is a matter of whether we can get the 28 countries to agree mechanisms whereby they can agree or there will be ever more situations where member states make multilateral agreements together with the enhanced co-operation procedure.  The latter would slow down integration which, of course, would weaken the European economy in the global sense.  If the European Union takes another 10, 20 or 30 years to sort out where we will combine policies and when we will have different policies, it will weaken the European Union in terms of global trade.</p></speech>

The figures in this regard are unconfirmed, although a set of figures was presented to the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan, at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform recently and he did not deny them.  I think we can take it that they are in the ball park.</p><p>  The ECB had what it calls the securities market programme where it bought Government bonds.  It started in 2010.  The programme ended in March of last year.  The programme is now over but its legacy is substantial government bondholdings by the various national central banks in the eurozone which carried out the policy on behalf of the ECB.  Most of the activity took place after the July 2011 European Council meeting that finally admitted that a Greek default was necessary but, perhaps, did not go far enough.  Because private sector involvement was finally admitted in the case of Greece, to try to cushion some of the consequences for the other countries that were under pressure the ECB stepped in and really stepped up its bond buying over the coming months.  Irish bonds formed part of that.  It looks like they had somewhere in the region of &euro;18 billion to &euro;22 billion of Irish Government bonds bought in a fairly short period.  Most of them focused on what we might call "the short end."  These were bonds coming to maturity over a fairly short period - two, three or four years.  Since then, there have been two sovereign bond maturities in Ireland.  There was a November 2011 bond that matured and also a March 2012 one.  Many of the bonds that were bought might have matured and been redeemed, but the figures would still have been quite large.</p><p>  At a eurogroup meeting in February last it was agreed that the national central banks would recycle some of the profits they were making on these bonds back to Greece.  As attempts were made to bring down their debt-to-GDP ratio, one approach taken was that there was this money flowing out of Greece and maybe they could get it to flow back in.  In the main, as we now will be aware, when central banks make profits they return them back to their sovereign.  In our case, we expect the Central Bank to make substantial profits on Government bonds, but these merely happen to be our own Government's bonds and we hope the Central Bank can hold on to them for as long as possible because the interest we pay on them to the Central Bank is then recycled back to the Exchequer.  If there is a profit on any interest that is paid on the Irish bonds now held by the national central banks across Europe, it can be returned to the exchequer in those countries and we hope, perhaps, they will return it to us.</p><p>  The issue is made up of two elements.  The Chair spoke about the profit that the central banks will make.  The profit is made up of the annual interest - coupon - they get every year and the capital appreciation.  There is not too much we can do about the capital appreciation.  The central banks will require a certain return for taking on the risk of buying Irish Government bonds, and this was particularly the case in the autumn of 2011 when sovereign bond markets were quite heated.</p><p>  We can focus particularly on the annual interest, which might not grab as large a headline as focusing on the capital but which sums can be quite large.  Here, the central banks are making a cheap and easy profit.  The central banks get access to funds at a very cheap rate.  They can get the funds at the ECB rate and they have bought these Irish Government bonds.  They might have made a profit by buying them at 70 bps or 75 bps, but they are making that profit off somebody else.  They are making that profit off the person who sold the bonds.  That really is of little concern to us.  We borrowed &euro;100 whenever the bonds were issued, say, in 2006 or 2007, and we will pay back &euro;100.  The central banks themselves are not making a profit off us on that basis.  What they are making a profit on will be the interest that we will now pay on an annual basis on those bonds.  Perhaps we should target and try to get back the interest, which is the substance of the Greek deal where the interest that is paid on bonds is then recycled back to the Greek central bank which can return it to the Greek exchequer.</p><p>  The sums have potential to be reasonably large.  Given some of the redemptions, there could be - I merely pick a figure - &euro;12 billion of these bonds still being held by the national central banks across Europe.  At a rough 5% annual coupon, one is talking about &euro;600 million of interest per year.  We have a massive interest bill, approaching &euro;8 billion.  Some &euro;600 million of that could be going to the national central banks of Europe.  The money they are borrowing from the ECB for this facility could be costing them &euro;100 million and, potentially, there is a &euro;500 million per annum profit or income for the national central banks across Europe on their holdings of Irish Government bonds.  The central banks will benefit because they got to buy them cheap but as of yet, there has been no benefit for Ireland.  We were not in bond markets in July and August 2011 when these bonds were being bought.  This was, apparently, done for our benefit.  It was to try to stabilise European bond markets but as of yet, we have got no real benefit because it is only subsequently that we got back into markets.  This potential &euro;500 million is there and could be recycled back to the Central Bank of Ireland which would give it back to the Exchequer.  It would be a welcome boost to the public finances.</p> <p> Deputy Paschal Donohoe asked about the balance of payments and, to a large extent, answered his own question.  When it comes to an individual country with its own currency, there will be a focus on the balance of payments because it is interested in the supply of its currency on international markets and how it influences the exchange rate.  However, for countries in the eurozone, the balance of payments is less important as a mechanism for influencing the exchange rate because trade in the euro is not particularly influenced by what we do.  We may be interested in the direction of the euro exchange rate, but we have little control over it.  When we had the punt, a large balance of payments deficit, that is, punts flowing into the international market, it gave raise to concerns about whether people would try to sell or hold our currency.  We have realised in recent years that while the balance of payments provides an indication of the health of an economy, it might not be the policy objective it previously was.  If more money is flowing out than coming in, problems will arise eventually.</p><p> A number of countries are facing difficulties because of balance of payment deficits.  It is a question of running a collective rather than an individual currency.  The United States runs a huge balance of payments deficit but does not regard this as a significant problem because it controls its own currency and is interested in seeing its value fall.  It is not concerned about hundreds of billions of dollars flowing into international markets if the value of the dollar is dragged down as a result because that will help the drive to increase exports.  For several years there has been a closer focus on balance of payments and most of the struggling countries are improving in this regard.  Our balance of payments has moved from a slight deficit to a surplus and while countries such as Spain and Greece remain in deficit, they are moving towards surpluses.  This is something that does not receive much attention, but it is a sign of health and stability in an economy.</p><p> On the future of the ESM and the possibility of bailing out banks, I hope we will never have to bail out banks again.  Some of the rules being put in place will ensure the call on the taxpayer will be reduced in the future.  We know that the capital ratios for banks are going to be increased because they will need more money to absorb losses before somebody else is called on.  The mechanism being put in place for bank resolution on an EU-wide basis will require bondholder bail-ins and, perhaps, large depositor bail-ins, depending on the nature of the losses for the banks concerned.  The lack of a bank resolution mechanism on an EU-wide basis was a failure in the design of the euro.  Most of the countries involved tended to ignore the issue, rather than put in place their own mechanisms for bank resolutions.  This was something that could have been done in the run-up to the crisis and was done overnight in Ireland recently.  The aim is to avoid taxpayer bailouts of banks.  As the bondholders and depositors will only be bailed in to failed banks, it is unlikely that they will be bailed in if viable or functioning banks run into trouble .  They will still get their money back, but as long as the bank remains alive, the possibility remains for the State to get its money back.  We must avoid the bailouts for Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, in respect of which the State invested money which it had no chance of recouping.  In those instances a mechanism will be put in place to ensure there will be no call in the future.  The ESM will not be called in for failing banks which will be allowed to fail.  It may be called in for viable banks, but countries may also decide to act without the ESM to maintain control within their own jurisdiction if they decide there is value in doing so.  The aim at all times is to reduce taxpayer involvement, although it is difficult to decide if that is achievable because they are still only at the design phase.  It is badly wanted and I hope it will have an impact in the future.</p><p> Senator Kathryn Reilly asked about monetary policy.  I slightly disagree that interest rates were set with larger countries in mind.  Interest rates were set with inflation in mind.  If inflation was low, interest rates were going to be low.  The ECB takes note of policy conditions, but it is not going to respond with interest rate changes if they impact on its inflation rate target.  Its prime objective is to control inflation.  When inflation was low in the eurozone, interest rates tended to be low.  They were unsuitable for Ireland at a time when the economic growth rate was high and inflation was higher.  The question arises of what countries can do once their interest rates are set at a supranational level.  We are seeing difficulties in terms of the ECB trying to reduce interest rates beyond already very low levels.  Apart from Ireland, this does not have much of an impact on the ground.  The reason ECB interest rates have such a large impact on Ireland is tracker mortgages.  The ECB's low rate has not fostered cheaper lending in other countries or on bond markets.  While the ECB rate and German bond yields are low, there has been little impact on Italy, Spain, etc.</p><p> Closer fiscal union would benefit small countries.  Fiscal union should allow countries to deal with macro shocks without putting public finances under pressure.  We find ourselves in the midst of a large macroecnomic shock which, in theory, should be dealt with by easing back on the fiscal side, that is, spending more or cutting taxes.  However, because we are also faced with a solvency problem in keeping the country afloat, we responded in exactly the opposite way, by cutting expenditure and increasing taxes.  If there was fiscal union, perhaps unemployment benefit and other social welfare payments would have been ring-fenced at European level.  The public finances might be in a mess, but social welfare levels would be maintained from a central fund and once we were back on track to growth, we would become a net contributor to the fund, rather than a beneficiary.  We could thereby sort out the rest of the public finances while protecting social welfare expenditure.  That approach would bring net benefits for small countries.</p></speech>

I will try to touch on at least one issue mentioned by every member.  </p><p>  The issue of what was described as excessive influence over interest rate policy is a reflection of the size of economies and the weighting they are given over inflation policy.  The larger the economy the closer the chosen interest rate to the correct rate for the country concerned.  As smaller countries have a reduced weighting, they are likely to be more volatile and pro-cyclical in respect of the interest rates decided by the ECB.  However, it is not a case of bias or undue influence <i>per se</i>.</p><p>  Members asked a number of related questions about why eurobonds would not work, what fiscal integration would look like, whether it would make sense to have a single currency for the entire European Union and what direction banking integration was likely to take.  One of the problems when the euro currency was introduced was that policies which may have been sensible individually ended up as a mess when taken collectively.  I do not agree that the crisis was only discovered ten or 12 years later.  There were massive credit inflows to certain countries from the very beginning, but they were not acknowledged as being part of a bubble.  The crisis began when high levels of indebtedness began to form.  They should have been identified earlier.  The policy failures were imbedded from the outset.</p><p>  Eurobonds will not work because the eurobond models that have been discussed to date give rise to moral hazard issues.  Making EMU work and ensuring coherence in fiscal policy require us to deal with the moral hazard problem because we are members of a club and discipline is important alongside solidarity.</p> <p>The question then is how does one do what one is supposed to do in terms of one's central bank and create a lender of last resort that can do what is supposed to, which is to stabilise the system, and reconcile that with the inability to provide unlimited funding to whichever country wants it, that is, it has be a conditional lender of last resort.  The eurobond model, unfortunately, does not deal with the moral hazard issue.  It only deals with one issue and even then it is problematic because anything in excess of 60% is suddenly a second type of debt.  The first 60% might be safe and fine but bond traders will look at the remaining portion of the deb and they will isolate it as being different and will arguably regard it as even more toxic.  Eurobonds, therefore, are not an answer.</p><p> A circuit breaker, which prevents sovereign bond yields going over a particular value, is required but, at the same time, mechanisms are needed to prevent countries abusing that and, for example, running a 15% deficit every year because they know they can borrow at an interest rate of 2% or 3%.  Those goals have to be reconciled and that, ultimately, will become the problem that must be squared.  There are a number of ways in which that could be done.  The ECB is not allowed to be a lender of last resort for sovereigns because of the monetary financing prohibition and for other reasons and, therefore, another institution would have to do that, whether that is a special purpose vehicle created by eurozone members such as the ESM.  I have written a paper on this which I would be happy to circulate.  There are many moving parts but, ultimately, that question is very much core to resolving the long-term issues and making EMU sustainable and coherent but eurobonds are not the way to do it.  There are no solutions there and that possibly answers the redemption question as well.</p><p> We were asked what fiscal integration looks like and both Mr. Coffey and Mr. O'Connor have articulated the concept of a stabiliser.  There are two stabilisers within the system.  The first is the lender of last resort, which prevents sovereign borrowing costs from accelerating to unsustainable levels.  If there is a circuit breaker, that is prevented from happening.  The other automatic stabiliser traditionally has been government budgets but, as we are aware, there is limited capacity there.  We are in a new type of construct.  Ireland is not like the US.  There are not inter-regional transfers between Ireland and Austria in the same way there are between New York and Mississippi.  In the US, for example, if there is what is known as a localised shock such as a hurricane, the federal government can step in and provide emergency funding but if a local industry collapses in Ireland or there is an earthquake in Greece or a massive banking crisis, which leads to instability, there is no mechanism in place to deal with that and if unchecked, that can lead to higher levels of long-term unemployment in the long run as hysteresis and other effects kick in.  What a state wants to do is to prevent those long-term effects from occurring and some form of a limited central fund is needed, which runs a surplus in normal times and which can be  automatically activated for specific purposes such as for social welfare under specific conditions.  My own preference would be for education, retraining and upskilling, which would be particularly appropriate in the Irish context, given the vast majority of jobs were lost in the construction industry and many of them will never return.  Those people will have to acquire different skills.  It should be about human and physical capital, which is part of the process of restructuring economies and structural reform.</p><p> The question then is how does one create the fund without it being a full fiscal union.  In all likelihood, the eurozone countries will have to come together in a similar fashion to the FTT proposal, which is currently being put in place, and hypothecate some form of taxation from within each country, which would probably be a consumption tax.  This could also be an FTT, for example, but which in all likelihood would probably be 1% off VAT.  This fund would simply build up and be used purely to respond to the asymmetric shocks that have been identified for 50 or 60 years.  This also addresses the question of united states and whether we should all come together and have a single currency.  However, there would be hypothecated fund of, say 1% off VAT, which goes to a central place and which is activated upon certain events occurring such as a banking crisis or another crisis that leads to a major recession in countries.  That would then be used to ameliorate the recession and allow those countries to more easily manage their fiscal consolidation-austerity process without causing as much damage to society.  Countries tend, when reducing public spending, to go for the capital budget because it is politically the easiest thing to do by far, even though in the long term it is probably the most damaging thing to do in the context of the growth potential of the economy.  If the fund was in place and ring-fenced for those type of activities, that problem could be circumvented as well to a certain extent.</p><p> With regarding to the direction of banking union, it will happen but I am not convinced it is what we need.  The main thing required in the context of such a union is proper resolution mechanisms.  If resolution is to be at European level, that means supervision and regulation also has to be at that level.  This may be more severe than is perhaps anticipated.  It could mean regular stress tests for banks to a much greater extent than before.  It will probably be a requirement under a proper banking union with proper resolution legislation in place that it will have to be fully independent.  This is why it is not popular among nation-states.  If a fully independent body can turn around overnight and shut a bank, that will create issues at local level.  Perhaps the answer is to simply look at it as a European banking system.</p><p> As to whether we should move to a single currency at European level, that comes down to whether one believes Europe is an optimal currency area.  The US is not necessarily an optimal currency area.  What does this mean?  The issue is whether the benefits of the single currency outweigh the costs of losing exchange rate policy and the ability to devalue a currency to restore competitiveness and boost economies at particular times.  Israel, for example, strongly devalued its currency and got through the crisis fairly well.  I do not say that is the panacea.  However, fundamental surgery is still required to create a genuinely durable EMU.  There are a number of different ways in which all these things can be done.</p><p> With regard to jobs and what can be done for weak countries, the answer is a centralised targeted fund, which could be used in that fashion.  Unfortunately, there are no silver bullets when it comes to jobs.  It is a long-term grind.  The question is how long-term growth is generated.  The answers to those questions are different and those type of structural reforms at root and branch level remain important.</p><p> The problem with the FTT is the costs and benefits for individual states are different and, as Mr. O'Connor said, what we are witnessing is countries opting out of the things they believe will be negative for them and, in the context of 28 states, it will be increasingly difficult to fully integrate at that level.  There will be smaller clubs in different areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013022100010#K00100"><p>From an economic perspective an FTT is sound.  The purpose of the financial sector and finance in general is to allocate money from savers to borrowers and to allow us, to a certain extent, to engage in risk management.  The problem is the financial sector has become much larger than that, part of which has been down to the ease of transactions that can now simply happen at a touch of a keyboard.  Transactions that would previously have been quite complex can now be done in fractions of seconds.  The financial sector in general is adding value as it circulates funds around and deals with risk, but the part of the financial sector that engages in this very high-volume transacting might not necessarily be.  These small taxes can to a certain extent control that and also get a contribution from the financial sector to the broader economy.  Much of what happens in the financial sector stays within the financial sector - they are dealing with each other rather than dealing with individuals and businesses which is where the real benefit of the sector comes from.</p><p>  The concept of the FTT has been around for 40 or 50 years without being implemented.  The difficulties that Mr. McDonnell highlighted of countries picking and choosing what they want reflects the difficulties in implementing it.  From an Irish perspective, it is not so much the imposition the FTT would put on normal people - we do not engage in huge amounts of transactions with bonds, shares and derivatives - but that within Ireland a lot of it happens through the financial services sector that provides 20,000 or 25,000 jobs.  We talk about the IFSC, but basically it is a financial services industry within Ireland.  There are IFSC-type companies in Cork - they might not be in Dublin 1 but throughout the country companies are engaged in activities relating to that sector.</p><p>  As has been highlighted it becomes very much a national issue as opposed to a broader issue.  The benefits of such a tax have readily been proved and stand up, but then economic nationalism steps in and countries decide to step out.  So Ireland has decided to step out on the basis that we do not want to be seen to be flexible in any fashion.  We have established, what we might call, a business-friendly environment and even with issues such as corporation tax and financial transactions tax, we have drawn a line in the sand and said we would not change.  It is not that these changes are negative but that we do not want to show any flexibility and want to provide certainty for foreign companies investing in Ireland, which looks locally rather than to the broader issues.  It is possible to justify the decision to stay out of the FTT.  I believe the economics of it stacks up and it would be a useful addition, but getting all the countries to come into it would be quite difficult.</p></speech>

In the short term as I have described, there is considerable fragmentation about who is in the eurozone and who is in the European Union.  There are particular risks for Ireland because we are not only small but also peripheral.  There is a question of whether our economic strategies as a country are compatible with the long-term direction of the European Union.  In the short term we can have it both ways.  We are in the eurozone and involved in the conversation about European monetary union and the various institutions there such as the ESM.  We are also outside the FTT because it suits us regarding multinational FDI, particularly in our financial services industry.  At the moment we can have it both ways, but as there are more countries in the eurozone sharing more of the same rules there is a question of whether we will find ourselves having to make a choice as to whether we are in or out regarding, for example, harmonisation of corporation tax.  Rather than having a point ten or 15 years down the road where there is a break point and suddenly we are under massive pressure to change, we should really be looking at the longer-term strategic risk for Ireland of not having an economic policy here that is compatible with the direction of the core EU economy.</p><p>  In that context, as both other speakers said, institutions matter as do the rules of the European Central Bank.  The ECB explicitly does not look at employment and growth, as the Federal Reserve in America does.  At the moment it only looks at interest rates in order to control inflation and price stability.  It interprets that very narrowly as meaning 2% inflation but in fact a higher rate of inflation would suit Ireland now because of our high level of both private and public debt.  The institutional detail matters of the ECB, ESM and other institutions should have the flexibility to benefit peripheral economies like Ireland as well as benefiting the core.  That is where I would might a concern that Ireland is outside the FTT.</p><p>  There is no doubt that our strategic interest is for the UK to remain in the EU and ultimately if every other country in the EU is going to be in the eurozone then we need the UK to be in the eurozone.  Ireland has often been positioned as a broker between the UK and other European countries, particularly at a Brussels level.  We should certainly be considering our strategic interest in how the UK can be persuaded to stay in the European Union as a central player and ultimately to move into the eurozone.  It is unambiguous that is where our strategic interest lies.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Eugene McGlone, president of the congress, Ms Patricia McKeown, past president and member of the executive council of the congress, and Mr. Jack O'Connor, general president of SIPTU and member of the executive council of ICTU.</p><p>  Before I invite the witnesses to make their presentation, I advise them that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease to make remarks on a particular matter but continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter to only a qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only comments and evidence related directly to the subject matter of this meeting are to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Mr. Eugene McGlone to proceed with his opening statement.  We will have contributions from the three witnesses and then open the meeting to members for questions.</p></speech>

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions welcomes the opportunity to present its evidence to the committee.  We believe we have a major role to play to underpin the peace process in Northern Ireland and, indeed, on the whole island of Ireland.  I am the current president of ICTU and am accompanied by Ms Patricia McKeown, past president and member of the executive council and a member and former chair of the Northern Ireland committee of ICTU, and Mr. Jack O'Connor, the immediate past president of ICTU.  His day job is at SIPTU and he is a member of ICTU's executive council and its general purposes committee.  Ms McKeown and I have chaired ICTU's Northern Ireland committee and continue to serve on it.  We are joined and supported today by colleagues from ICTU's secretariat, Ms Clare Moore and Mr. Peter Rigney, and by the current chair of the Northern Ireland committee, Ms Pamela Dooley, who was originally going to make a presentation but offered her speaking time to Mr. O'Connor to ensure the committee gets a flavour of the all-island nature of ICTU and sees that our concerns are not merely Northern ones.  I will share the time with Ms McKeown and Mr. O'Connor.</p><p>  Congress is the single trade union centre on the island of Ireland.  Given that there are two distinct jurisdictions on the island, it is unique among European trade unions in that regard.  Having a single, cohesive trade union centre and voice for workers in Ireland, particularly over the last 50 years, adds weight to any argument we make on social and economic matters.</p> <p>We are also the largest civic society organisation in Ireland with the apex body representing some 800,000 workers.  Our mission statement requires us to strive to achieve economic development, social cohesion and justice by upholding the values of solidarity, fairness, equality and human rights.  The Northern committee of congress is a representative body of over 230,000 workers in Northern Ireland.  In membership terms it is also the largest single civic society organisation in Northern Ireland and the most diverse, covering as we do the full spectrum of political opinion.</p><p> The trade union movement first committed itself to a bill of rights for Northern Ireland more than 50 years ago initially through a body known as the National Council for Civil Liberties.  Throughout the decades of the conflict we continually strove to challenge discrimination in the workplace and in society and to campaign for peace.  This is evidenced, for example, by our work on the declaration of intent which congress entered into with all employers to challenge discrimination in the workplace.  It is further evidenced by the large numbers of people who over the past 40 years in particular came onto the streets to demonstrate for peace in response to trade union calls.  Some members of this committee joined our demonstrations and I thank them for that.  I include in that the march back to work which followed the Loyalist UWC strike in the early 1970s.</p><p> Regrettably since the peace agreement we have again had to make that call for people to demonstrate for peace on several occasions over the past few years.  I pay particular tribute to the work of one of our former presidents, Inez McCormack, who died recently.  Her efforts particularly on equality and human rights are reflected in many of the clauses in the Good Friday Agreement.  Inez and her union, Unison, and my union put up large banners on our buildings calling on workers to vote for the Good Friday Agreement.  This was achieved due mainly to the work of Inez and others in securing commitments which were vital to enabling the trade union movement advocate full and unequivocal support for the Good Friday Agreement in the 1998 referendum.  It is of central concern to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that the clear commitment to produce a bill of rights for Northern Ireland and the consequent charter of rights for the whole of the island is now 15 years overdue.  I must emphasise that these rights include the whole social chapter encompassing workers' rights, particularly the right to collective bargaining and to have trade unions recognised for bargaining purposes to protect workers at their place of work.  I thank the committee for listening to me and I now hand over to my colleague, Patricia McKeown. </p></speech>

Congress and a range of affiliate unions are members of the very important Human Rights Consortium which has presented extensively to this committee and our colleagues in the consortium are giving evidence here again today.  Through our work in the consortium Congress participated in the year long bill of rights forum where we acted as convenor to the working group on social and economic rights on which all political parties participated.  We have engaged in training and awareness raising with our membership on the centrality of equality and human rights to the peace process.  We participated extensively, primarily as members of the Human Rights Consortium in lobbies of the British, Irish and US governments on the need for full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and in particular a bill of rights for Northern Ireland and we gave extensive evidence to the recent UK commission.</p><p>  We are pleased to say that the one strong recommendation on which that commission agreed was that we should have a bill of rights for Northern Ireland. We are aware that the committee has already received extensive evidence from our colleagues in the Human Rights Consortium on its activities in surveying, and polling the people.  They demonstrate an 80% buy-in for a bill of rights from the population.  On the issue of social and economic rights this rises to over 90%.  These rights are of greatest concern to ordinary people, identified by them, the rights to health, housing, education, jobs and an adequate standard of living.  These, together with trade union rights, are supported in the same measure by our members in the trade union movement.</p><p>  Despite the obligation imposed by the Good Friday Agreement and statements in successive programmes for Government we have no framework for equality or human rights-based budgeting.  Current decisions on resource allocation are not based on objective need and the historic patterns of discrimination have not changed in the most deprived areas or sections of our society.  </p><p>  It will shock the committee to learn that life expectancy for the most disadvantaged in Northern Ireland has reduced since the Good Friday Agreement 15 years ago.  Premature death amongst the long-term unemployed has increased and suicide rates for the long-term unemployed are at record levels.  It was very shocking to learn from the press yesterday that the first case of rickets in a child in West Belfast was confirmed, a disease of poverty and inequality which we thought we had eradicated.  The committee will be aware of the large body of evidence which indicates that a society with the levels of inequality such as those experienced in Northern Ireland is an unfair and unsafe society.  This places everything we have worked for in the peace process in jeopardy.  A total of 15 years of political stalling is having the worst possible impact on society.  The right to life itself is being jeopardised.</p><p>  The UK commission has recommended a separate bill of rights for Northern Ireland thus the key excuse given to us by the UK Government for two and a half years is no longer valid.  The second excuse given to us by the UK Government is that there is no political consensus in Northern Ireland.  There have been issues on the Good Friday Agreement on which there was no political consensus.  The pressure was exerted by the signatories to the agreement and a process was engaged in and consensus was reached.  The only steps taken by the current British Government has been to write a letter to our political parties in Northern Ireland in 2011.  Congress is no longer prepared to accept this level of inaction from Government, given the growing division in our society and the increasing tensions on matters of safety and security.  I will hand over to my colleague, Jack O'Connor, to conclude.</p></speech>

The evidence of history tells us that when a new generation is denied fundamental social and economic rights it will seek status elsewhere.  Our people in the Six Counties are picking up what they believe to be evidence of growing ranks in the paramilitaries and we believe that is no coincidence.</p><p>  We know and acknowledge that this committee has diligently examined the situation over the past two years and we have arrived at a critical point when what it does and says can make a difference for the better.  On behalf of all of those in the Congress of Trade Unions I request that the committee brings forward as a matter of urgency its recommendations on the need for full implementation of the bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  We further request that it impress the urgency of the situation on the Irish Government as a co-signatory of the peace agreement and that it call on the Government to engage in urgent dialogue in this regard with its co-signatory, the British Government.</p> <p>We in the trade union movement on the island have consistently argued for the past 15 years that continuing dialogue between politicians and the people can result in agreement on a bill of rights.  This should be a far less contentious issue than the issue of policing and justice which has been dealt with.  What is not acceptable is for division and a lack of political consensus in Northern Ireland to be used as an excuse for a failure to implement this fundamental part of the Good Friday Agreement.  It was the will of the people that we have a bill of rights.  It was their will in 1998 and it is still their will in 2013.  The difference, as committee members have heard, is that fundamental rights such as the right to life for a growing section of working-class people in our society are at risk.  As a consequence, so is the peace process which people strove so hard to achieve. </p><p> On behalf of congress, I thank the committee for the time afforded to us.  We will try to deal with questions or issues committee members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.724" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maskey, MP" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100005#G00300"><p>I thank the delegation for coming before the committee and its presentation.  We really appreciate the time and effort made.  </p><p>  Ms McKeown mentioned west Belfast and I must concur.  What we see happening is scandalous in this day and age.  The constituency I represent has the highest unemployment rate throughout the North.  A bill of rights, if implemented and agreed to, would help in dealing with all of the issues we face in areas of high deprivation, including social needs.  We are very much in support of a bill of rights being agreed to.  I agree with Mr. O'Connor that if it is not agreed to, the two co-signatories of the Agreement must come forward and ensure a bill of rights is implemented in the North.  It is very important to sustain the peace process and enhance the areas which have suffered the most with regard to generational issues such as west Belfast where for generations there has been severe underinvestment owing to direct British rule, with Ministers flying in once a month and paying lip-service to the views expressed.  They have nothing but contempt for this and other areas in the North, including rural areas which also suffer from massive deprivation.  The implementation of a bill of rights is core to moving forward and we must all work harder to ensure it will happen.</p><p>  I hope the committee can push the two Governments in the right direction and the political parties which are opposed to a bill of rights.  We need to begin to challenge the parties opposed to it and ask why they are opposed to it.  We will hear some strange answers because I cannot understand for the life of me how anybody could disagree with a bill of rights because it would not cost anybody anything.  It is the same as equality - equality costs us nothing.  I hope the committee will push in the right direction and as hard as it possibly can.  Do our guests think we should exert particular pressure on people in this regard?  What is the ICTU doing to try to push it forward?  I would like to have a conversation on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.725" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Richie, MP" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100005#G00400"><p>The delegation is welcome.  I have had various discussions on constituency issues in recent years with the ICTU and they have always been based on the issue of rights, whether in health or education.  Has the ICTU met the new Secretary of State on this matter, notwithstanding the fact that her predecessor had set his face against a particular bill of rights for the North?  If so, what has been her response?  One of the issues is that we must turn around the British Government on this issue.  The committee must send a clear message to it through the Secretary of State and the Northern Ireland Executive, although responsibility for this matter resides with the Secretary of State.  What has been the result of the ICTU's representations?  I know the results of my parliamentary questions to her and her predecessor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.726" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100005#G00500"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentation.  Mr. O'Connor has made a very good point, that if people do not believe they are getting justice in their communities, they might move towards paramilitaries.  For me, the issues of the right to a fair trial and a bill of rights were brought into sharp focus last week when I went with an all-party D&aacute;il delegation to meet a group of people.  In Northern Ireland one can be put in prison without being told why and without any hope of a trial.  I was shocked to learn this because I had thought it was a thing of the past.  I ask the delegates to excuse my naivete.  My understanding is that one may be allowed to see a solicitor - not of one's own choosing - for approximately an hour or so and that when one's trial comes up, one gets to see the solicitor again.  I had to be told this several times because it was very difficult to get it into my head, coming from a civilised state, that such a thing could take place.  Whatever someone is accused of, at the end of the day we need consistency in human rights, as otherwise it is inevitable that we will see problems.  How aware is the ICTU of this issue?  I was not aware of it.  If the ICTU is aware of it, what do the delegates think of it and what can be done about it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.727" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eugene McGlone" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100005#G00600"><p>We certainly welcome the engagement referred to by Mr. Maskey and will certainly pursue the issue.  Our colleagues from the political parties in the North who are in the room have engaged consistently with us on matters such as this.  In a sense, we are speaking to the converted from Northern Ireland and, unfortunately, it is the unconverted who are not present.  We could engage in proselytising with them.  We will certainly pick up on the issue and drive it forward.</p><p>  I am from west Belfast and the news yesterday on the levels of deprivation, poverty and social injustice was not good.  It was not something with which I was comfortable or happy to hear.  I am not proud of it.  It is an indicator of neglect, but it is not unique to west Belfast, as it is seen in many constituencies in Northern Ireland.  While west Belfast has been highlighted on this occasion, all of the political parties and groupings in any constituency should be concerned enough to lift their heads and say there is something wrong.</p><p>  The people in our society do need to have their rights enshrined in legislation and the opportunity to test these rights.  Among them are the right to a decent standard of living, the right to an education and the right to a good health service.  As Ms McKeown pointed out, the right not to suffer from rickets is absolute.  We should not envisage any child in Ireland today suffering from rickets and we should not think in terms of having to deal with diseases or disorders which affected people 70 or 80 years ago and which we thought had been wiped out.</p> <p> Ms McKeown will deal with the question on the Secretary of State in more detail.  The short answer to Ms Ritchie's question is "No"; we have not met the Secretary of State.  We have been seeking meetings.  At this stage, our focus must be on persuading the parties in Stormont to approach this issue together.  If we and our friends around the table cannot persuade their colleagues in other political parties to join in, we will face a difficulty.  The Secretary of State will not take this route just because we ask for it, but she will probably be more persuaded if the Ulster Unionist Party and the DUP are also involved.  Ms McKeown will pick up on this point as well as the issue raised by Deputy Flanagan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.729" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia McKeown" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100006#H00200"><p>I will comment on all three questions, if I may.  As to what more we can do, we will not stop.  A core policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, is our insistence on the completion of the Good Friday Agreement in terms of the commitments on equality, a bill of rights for Northern Ireland and the necessary process for dealing with the past.  The absence of political will in these areas is destabilising our society.</p><p>  We have been consistently told by the British Government that it is not under pressure from political parties on the island as regards a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  We do not know whether this is the case.  If it is, it is incumbent on our political parties to exert pressure.  If they have done so already, the British Government needs to be called to account for claiming otherwise.  This point has been reiterated at our meetings with the Northern Ireland Office.  It has also been raised in the British-Irish parliamentary process, through which people have been briefed by the Northern Ireland Office and the British Government.  This situation must be addressed.</p><p>  We held several meetings with the Secretary of State's predecessor, who was open in his distaste for a bill of rights.  However, the UK commission has taken it out of the road.  We have requested a meeting with the current Secretary of State, but we do not know whether she has a different opinion.  In light of the UK commission's report, we hope that a different perspective will be taken.</p><p>  Of course we know that we live in a society in which our criminal justice system, which has been under review for a long time, does not meet all international human rights standards.  Better people than me will give evidence to the committee today - for example, human rights lawyers - which will put this matter in a clearer context.  We give evidence on a regular, cyclical basis to UN organisations such as the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  We pay particular attention to the absence of some fundamental labour and trade union rights.  We know what some of the civil and criminal justice issues are.</p><p>  All of the above formed an extensive part of the year-long engagement between civil society and the political parties, assisted by expert lawyers from across Europe, in the bill of rights forum.  Important work was done and a large measure of consensus was achieved, but we got caught between a rock and a hard place in the final part of the process.  People became entrenched in party political voting on all of the recommendations.  Behind those recommendations was extensive work.  Everyone had a sharp learning curve and people from whatever walk of life made expert inputs.  We need to return to having a large measure of consensus.</p><p>  Everything stopped after the human rights commission passed its recommendations to the then Secretary of State some time ago.  There has been no continuous dialogue.  There was only continuous dialogue in the first place because, on foot of lobbying by groups such as the consortium and ourselves, the British Government pushed for the process.  We need another push.  For the past 15 years, we have argued that, had there been a continuous process of dialogue between political parties and the people, we would be in much better shape as regards a bill of rights, as there would be a greater and in-depth understanding in our society.</p><p>  As congress knows, ordinary people have expressed their opinions through the work of the consortium.  They want social and economic rights, and we believe these should be based on objective needs.  The patterns of discrimination in our society must be challenged, but this is not occurring to any great extent.  On the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, the picture and the map look much the same as they did prior to the agreement.</p></speech>

It is important that we emphasise his query.  From a rational perspective, opposition defies logic.</p><p>  As to the question of what else we can do, we in ICTU believe there is an obligation on both Governments to press ahead with this issue.  If they wait for everyone, it will be too late.  Each of us has a responsibility in our respective roles to do everything we can to reassure those who have concerns about the prospect of a bill of rights, to address whatever fears they may have and to encourage them to ventilate those fears.  ICTU has a role to play in this regard and we have been endeavouring to do so over the years.</p><p>  There is also the question of why people would be opposed to equality.  There are certain obvious reasons, in that they have a vested interest in a lack of equality.  Ironically, it is increasingly clear that even those people are misguided.  No less an authority than the IMF acknowledges that exponentially growing inequality played no small part in the global economic collapse that threatened global society as we know it.  The IMF believes that the decline in collective bargaining in developed Western societies was one of the causes of exponentially growing inequality.  Unlike in the South, our workers in the Six Counties have a legal entitlement to collective bargaining, which one would imagine certain people would fear even more than a bill of rights.  This is relevant in the context of the charter of rights aspect of the discussion.  Perhaps the committee might bear this issue in mind.</p><p>  The issue to which Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan referred is arising within my union in the Six Counties.  We are not a large organisation in the North, but we do organise there.  The question of how to respond properly is the subject of some deliberation in the union.  Human rights are for everyone irrespective of what he or she believes.</p> <p>That is the key to ensuring people have enough confidence in the democracy to abide by the rules and regulations and expectations of human behaviour that participation in a democracy involves.  However, if people have reason to point out, with justification, that democratic behaviour and practices do not apply to them, it opens up an issue, especially in deteriorating economic circumstances and the demoralisation that goes with it.  I do not know if that is a full answer to the points raised by Deputy Luke 'Ming' Flanagan but the point we are making is that human rights, as enshrined in a bill of rights, is provided for in the Agreement.  The people voted for it across the entire island and the Governments signed up for it.  It is key to ensuring the progress that has been made is maintained and that we can go on to a better future for everyone.</p></speech>

It was especially epitomised by the doggedness of Ms Inez McCormack going into the Agreement and since.  We need to understand that it is not just the current British Government that has been lacklustre in its attitude to this.  It was the same with previous British Governments.  It is one thing for people to hide behind the fact that under the Agreement the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was to bring forward a proposal, but British Governments disappeared completely behind that and said it was nothing to do with them.  Even if the commission produced anything, it was to be subject to political consensus.  This created impossible standards.  Any of us who raised the issue in the context of impasse talks and negotiations that took place during the Agreement were told that no one else was pushed about it or we were told it was not for that time and that we needed to sort out a wording difficulty without getting onto that topic.  The attitude of the British Government now, and of some in opposition, is that the Agreement has survived so long without it that there is a question over whether it is needed now.  They are using its absence as proof that it is not needed.  That presents a challenge to those of us who want a robust, relevant and articulate bill of rights.</p><p>  The answer lies in a number of points.  Mr. Jack O'Connor made reference to a number of issues that are being expressed on the back of the current protests.  Those of us who advocate a bill of rights should use the opportunity to say that if people are saying rights are being stifled and neglected and are going downstream, and if they say the political process is unable to protect or assert those rights, perhaps we need something extra, such as another reference point or protection point beyond just the political dynamic.  For those of us within the political process, when it comes to trying to watch out for particular interests where individual and community rights are at stake, the reliance is on the negative or veto-type aspects of the Agreement.  This can help to stop bad policy, but sometimes it stops policy developing at all.  On a range of issues that are silting up in the North, nothing is happening because there are vetos in pocket.  If a Minister dares to table legislation that he or she personally wants to move on, the danger is that something else kicks in and it does not move.  A bill of rights that is articulate in respect of social and economic matters could create better protection so that people could have the debate safe in the knowledge that, if serious issues were to arise, they could be taken under the bill of rights.</p><p>  Some 15 years on from the Agreement, some people will say that certain policy issues have been neglected, and in many ways those policy issues would have a better chance of moving if the political process was complimented by a strong bill of rights.  We would not have to dead-end issues in the Northern Ireland Assembly or the Northern Ireland<b></b>Executive in the way we do.</p><p>  This other point this committee could address, given its embrace and the fact that its invitation extends beyond the parties that attended, is the charter of fundamental rights.  The Good Friday Agreement did not just envisage a bill of rights for Northern Ireland but also espoused the goal of a charter of fundamental rights for the island.  This was to be a bit different because the charter of fundamental rights was to be capable of being signed by all the political parties on the island.  We were quite deliberate on the wording in the Agreement.  That was about people making undertakings not just to citizens now but also to each other and to different traditions into the future.  Perhaps a better starting point for us is to say that we are having difficulty moving along the debate on the bill of rights, as well as the British Government, and that we could light up the debate on the charter.  Engagement on the charter of fundamental rights, through engaging the parties and non-party interests, could provide a helpful sidelight in the context of the Constitutional Convention.  Some of the issues we need to talk about, in terms of how we see matters right now and into the future, might get a different take and might get some more traction if we try the debate from that end rather than saying the bill of rights comes first and the charter later.</p></speech>

Their presentations were very clear.  Do the witnesses think they should be formally engaged with the dissenting political groupings?  I understand the only dissenters to a bill of rights in the North are the DUP and the UUP.  Should ICTU have some formal engagement with them to try to break down resistance, given its street cred and mass membership?  What is the ICTU evaluation of the resistance?  How resistant are they to it?  Is there any sense emerging among elements of Unionism that their interests are also at stake?  One would have thought some people in Unionism do not see a bill of rights as being in conflict with their interests in the position they are in now.  I accept that this Government must become the pusher and must invoke its position and apply the necessary pressure.  The committee should encourage that.</p><p>  Mr. Jack O'Connor mentioned that the recent spate of troubles would not have happened if there had been a bill of rights.  That is interesting.  Can he be more specific on this point?  Would a bill of rights have prevented the position taken on displaying the flags?  How would it have prevented the issue from arising, or is it that, over a period of time, it would have created the kind of societal well-being that eliminates trouble?</p><p>  From this remove, there is no reason it should not progress.  Obviously, there is resistance at Unionist level and there will be a need for an initiative by our Government.  Perhaps the witnesses can respond to these points.</p></speech>

We all agree poverty is not something which happens only in the North of Ireland but that it happens all over Ireland.  We know 100,000 children go to bed hungry at night and that deprivation and discrimination happen on the island of Ireland.  Most people would not understand why some would be opposed to human rights.  That is a big conundrum most people would be in.  </p><p> The parties agreed to the right to free political thought; the right to freedom of expression and religion; the right to pursue democratic national and political aspirations; the right to choose one's place of residence; the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity; the right to freedom from sectarian harassment; and the right of women to full and equal political participation.  Who in their right mind would be opposed to that?</p><p> Rather than looking forward to that inclusive Ireland we all thought would come out of the Good Friday Agreement, are some people are looking back to the good old days?  Is that what it is about?  The difficulties the British Government has were mentioned and that the Conservatives have a view on a human rights.  Do we really need all that type of malarkey?  The two Governments have also signed up to this.  It is almost as if they have adopted a passive role in regard to it.  They are not persuaders for change.  They say they must get agreement from the parties and that there is no point in them doing anything in this regard.  If we were to wait for agreement from the parties, would anything happen in regard to many of the big issues we face?  When do these people believe will be a good time?  Do we want to wait another 15 years, put it on the backburner, say it is not really important and say the Assembly is still meeting and that there are problems in the South as well?  </p><p> We had a discussion earlier about legislation relating to ex-prisoners.  That is a big issue in regard to the Good Friday Agreement and getting those people on board.  We all agree many of the people sent to jail in the North would not have been there but for the conflict.  There was agreement at the time that we would try to move things on and that people would not be discriminated against because of their background and yet 15 years later, we are introducing legislation which will discriminate against people because of their background.  How important is that?  That would not happen if this was in place.</p><p> Much of this is about people looking back rather than forward.  That is one of the biggest difficulties we have in trying to push this forward.  It is also about some people being opposed to it and others taking a passive role.  Responsibility now lies with the two Governments.  They must pull it together.  Do the witnesses agree with that?</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  It is good to see them.  They hit the nail on the head when they said they were preaching to the converted.  There is widespread support for the bill of rights here.  I refer to the point Ms McKeown made about challenging the British Government and applying pressure.  It would be worth challenging it further because it sounds like pressure from ourselves and the SDLP does not count unless pressure is applied by the DUP and the UUP.  That is the only pressure it will listen to.  We have raised this consistently with the British Government and people in the British Labour Party.</p><p>  The very people who are hypocritically on our television screens talking about the erosion of rights - we have heard the flag protest was not necessarily about the flag but about the erosion of rights - are consistently denying us a bill of rights and are trying to scupper it.  I would very robustly challenge the British Government to say from where the pressure is coming, if there is pressure, and also from where it is not coming.</p><p>  I did not hear about the child in Belfast with rickets but in the dim and distant past, after the Second World War, vitamins A and D were put into margarine to try to avoid rickets.  To think we have a disease like rickets in our population is incredible.  We have been making those points about health inequalities, early intervention, supporting families, Home Start and Sure Start and trying to give parents the support they need to make the right decisions for their children.</p><p>  Poverty was spoken about here.  The austerity measures in the South seem to be affecting the working class communities, which are the most vulnerable in our society, and not the people who have wealth and who can share it.  When one sees the impact welfare reform will have on the most vulnerable in our communities, it seems like the policies of both Governments on the island are more detrimental to people in working class communities who have most to gain from a bill of rights.</p><p>  In regard to the list of human rights, I attended an event last week with the parents of children with severe disabilities who are in a special school.  They are in a very safe environment for 15 years but when they turn 19 year of age, they are turned out of it.  There is no right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activities, regardless of class, creed, disability, gender or ethnicity.  Those people are left bereft after their child leaves formal education at 19 years of age with no chance of social and economic activity on any kind of rights basis.  It comes up in every walk of life in which we are involved.  Tomorrow I will speak at an event in County Fermanagh, where Invest NI is getting a hammering about how effective it has been in that county.  The Minister in charge is from that county but we see the economic rights of people, urban and rural, are being dissipated and at times one feels there is very little one can do about it.</p><p>  I do not have a specific question but would say the witnesses should challenge the British and Ireland Governments to see from where the pressure is coming.  The point was made that there was not consensus around everything in the Good Friday Agreement.  This is something all people in the North need, whether they think so or not.  We will continue to support the witnesses in their work.  We should not leave the British Government or the Irish Government off the hook.  Mr. Maskey seconded the suggestion that this committee write to the Taoiseach on this issue, and I concur with that.</p></speech>

We are under a bit of pressure because our members got carried away with their questions, so it is a bit rich of me to ask the witnesses to be brief.  Could I ask them to be conscious of the time but not to cut short their answers?</p></speech>

One or two comments were made which demand some further explanation and responses.  Mr. Durkan spoke about the idea afoot that the Good Friday Agreement seems to have survived and there is no need to do anything else.  The person saying that must be blind and deaf and live up a mountain in a hermitage.  Looking at any of the news programmes  emanating from Northern Ireland, it is quite clear the peace process is starting to come asunder, whether it is over daily protests on the streets over the flag issue, which was raised in the past four contributions.  That is indicative of serious concerns and issues.</p> <p>It is a significant idea related to whether a flag should be put up on the City Hall in Belfast or not but it becomes irrelevant because clearly there is concern among some of those articulating these issues that they feel alienated from their society.</p><p> We are of the view that a bill of rights is for everyone, it is not selective.  Those people would have the same rights as we would and that every other citizen should have.  The bill of rights should underpin their rights on a number of issues, such as feeling safe in their own environment.  They must not feel they are under pressure in terms of cultural identity.  Currently with the growth of activity from dissident republicans around Northern Ireland, it is clear the Good Friday Agreement has bedded down in the way we hoped it would and the way that worked to bed it down.  We are of the view that it is a symptom of the continuing polarisation in society that is being accelerated simply by virtue of the fact that there is not a guaranteed rights package that everyone can buy into.  Everyone bought into the Good Friday Agreement and the devil was in the detail.  Fifteen years later, we are not even discussing the detail in any real sense.  That is something that must be looked at.</p><p> In a sense it is laughable.  We sent a delegation to Colombia to talk about the lessons that can be learned from the peace process that might assist in the peace process that will hopefully evolve in Colombia and there were Unionists on that delegation.  It is strange that the trade union movement can bring together people from diverse political backgrounds in Northern Ireland and take them to Colombia to talk about the development of peace but we cannot get them to sit down and agree a bill of rights for our own people in a wee place like Northern Ireland, along with a fundamental charter of rights for the island of Ireland.  It is strange we cannot develop such a process among ourselves.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly asked about ICTU formally engaging with the Unionist parties.  We engage as much as we can, we have formal engagement with the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and with the DUP and the Ulster Unionist Party, as well as with the SDLP, Alliance Party and Sinn F&eacute;in.  We meet with them as often as we can and we press them on the issue.  We are aware of some of their concerns but not all of them and we cannot understand why someone would oppose a bill of rights.  Why would someone say it is unnecessary?  There are those who suggest we should look at a British model for a bill of rights and that we should latch on to that.  That is not what is contained in the Good Friday Agreement.  We want the Northern Ireland bill of rights as guaranteed in the Good Friday Agreement.  We think it is necessary, and that we have the maturity to develop it and build upon it.</p></speech>

The society I come from was constructed on the basis of discrimination and prejudice and out there is a world where there are those who deny women's rights, still practise religious and political discrimination and engage in all the other forms of discrimination that the Good Friday Agreement was designed to encapsulate as needing to change.  They are still there.  They are not always in government but they are in positions of power in our society and that is why strong enforcement of our equality laws and a justiciable bill of rights is so important.</p><p>  Engaging on a regular basis with the political parties that oppose the suite of proposals over the years on a bill of rights is something we do as a matter of course.  Of course we engage with them.  We represent the people who elect them, our members, on a regular basis on the importance of human rights.  When we gave evidence as ICTU to the British commission when it visited about a year ago, we were in the company of some tough loyalist working class communities who were giving evidence on why we should have a strong, justiciable bill of rights.  They got it.  They got it because they were engaging in a process of understanding what happens to people in an unfair, discriminatory society and they were identifying that as happening to their community as well as to "the others over there".  We still live in a society where some people want to hold political power by saying people will lose something if they do not vote for a particular party and that "they" will get it all.  It is as crude as that.  We are a divided, riven society where sectarianism is alive and well and 15 years after the Good Friday Agreement, it is incumbent on all of us to something about that.</p><p>  I can understand Mark Durkan shares our frustration that 15 years have passed and what do we do?  That charter of rights, however, is supposed to be based on the existence of a strong justiciable bill or rights for Northern Ireland.  I would not be opposed to a twin track process but we will not move away from the need for a strong, inclusive bill or rights because the absence of movement on that has delayed the charter of rights for those 15 years.  We have years' experience of intensively working on a cross-party basis, with civil society and us on one side and the politicians on the other.  It is not as simple as saying there are two, possibly three, political parties that would just vote against a bill of rights.  Every political party in the North has a policy in favour of a bill of rights in some form, and has had for years.  It is this bill of rights for Northern Ireland, that is part of the Good Friday Agreement, that is in dispute.  I have seen resistance to it for many reasons.  There is no dismissing the fact that some people are resisting it because it is a constitutional issue in their view.  We are part of the United Kingdom, so why would we want a bill of rights for Northern Ireland?  That was articulated many times.  There are others who see it as an attack on the power of elected politicians.  If there was a bill of rights, particularly social and economic rights, part of the power of elected representatives to make decisions on resource allocation is being taken away.  As we got into the process of how bills of rights work, and the evidence came out that it would support the power of a politician to be part of the resource allocation process.  Rather than distracting, it strengthens their role.</p><p>  There was not, however, enough time.  In these 15 years, we spent a year in a room, civil society and the political parties.  Maybe much more time in the room would have changed people's attitudes and there would have been more learning.  That must happen.  We are saying it must happen again.  Major work remains.</p><p>  For those who would argue that 15 years have passed and we have managed without a bill of rights, I point to the fact that our people are dying faster than they were when that agreement was signed.  It is working class people who are dying, it is the disadvantaged, it is the people who still suffer from traditional patterns of discrimination who are dying.  They are not dying in a conflict, they are dying in a peace process, which is even more shocking.</p></speech>

There are indications that we might be coming to the point where they would be proved wrong, especially in the context of economic decline, austerity and the alienation it fosters in a society as people retreat into traditional avenues in that environment.</p> <p>I was struck by what Mr. Durkan said about simultaneously focusing on the charter of fundamental rights.  In so far as I understood what he was saying, I agree with it.  My only regret is that I did not think of it first.  There could be issues for the trade union movement in this regard.</p><p> I must inform Deputy Joe O'Reilly that I did not go far as saying that a bill of rights would have prevented what has happened.  As a trade unionist, I am reluctant to speak in such absolute terms on any issue.  On a more serious note, I said that a bill of rights could have prevented it.  I made that assertion because those who voted against the recommendations of the bill of rights forum were voting against certain guarantees in relation to cultural identity.  That was highlighted as an issue by the people who were protesting.  I would not suggest that any one thing would have such an effect.  It took us a long time to get to where we are.  This is one of the ingredients we strongly believe is critical if more progress is to be made and if the progress that has been made is to be consolidated.</p><p> Deputy Crowe and Michelle Gildernew made the point that deprivation and poverty are not restricted to west Belfast or certain areas on the north east of the island.  They are aware that I totally agree with that view.  Regardless of one's political views, one will agree that it is absolutely appalling, as we celebrate the centenary of the great Dublin Lock-out, that we have returned to the era of children on this island going to bed hungry.  I totally agree that austerity places the greatest burden on working-class people and those who depend on public services.  I think that is obvious.  Such people have carried two thirds or 78% - depending on how one measures it - of the fiscal consolidation imposed in this jurisdiction over the past five years or more.</p><p> I totally agree with the point made by Michelle Gildernew that working-class people have the most to gain from a bill of rights and from equality.  They are not the only people who would gain, however.  There are many examples of people who see themselves as being better off, and might think they have a greater vested interest in things staying as they are, finding themselves as individuals on the wrong side of the absence of a bill of rights.  More to the point, a bill of rights and what it implies is critical to the task of building a prosperous economy.  It is critical if we are to attract investment, reassure potential investors of the security of the environment in which they would be operating and make progress with the possibilities offered by the Good Friday Agreement for the benefit of everyone on this island.</p><p> I reiterate that it is absolutely critical for every one of us, including the members of this committee, to strongly encourage both Governments to set the pace in this regard.  That means more than saying that something is to be imposed.  It means fighting to win over those who are opposed to this proposal.  Perhaps the trade union movement could do a bit more in that respect as well.</p></speech>

We understand their loud sense of frustration.  Perhaps I would differ in so far as I would not share the sense that things have not progressed in the past 15 years.  Although obvious challenges are being faced at the moment, a great deal of movement has been made in Northern Ireland in the last 15 years.</p><p>  The bill of rights issue is dominating our radar.  The commission that was established by the UK Government could not reach consensus on a pan-British basis for Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland.  There was a sense from the commission that a bill of rights for Northern Ireland needs to operate as a distinct entity.</p><p>  While I take Mr. O'Connor's point about the extent to which one can be committed to something, I emphasise that the Irish Government is committed to this.  Obviously, there is a need to evaluate that commitment continually.  I will use my office to ensure the Taoiseach knows we have had this meeting when he meets David Cameron on 11 March.  Formal correspondence on this matter will be issued on foot of today's meeting.</p><p>  I have listened to various contributions.  Paul Maskey made the point that there are other voices out there.  This committee tries to act as an honest broker.  When there are divergent views, as in this case, it might be helpful to hear them.  Deputy Crowe mentioned that he is baffled about why this issue is not being resolved.  We need to hear divergent views.  Our committee will try to assist by pursuing this issue as an honest broker.  We are committed to it.  It is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement.  We appreciate the contributions that have been made today.</p></speech>

Maybe we should take a twin-pronged approach to this issue.  We have agreed to go to the top and raise it with the two Governments.  Maybe we should have a bottom-up approach as well.

Maybe we should take it to people in the loyalist community and ask them what they have to fear from it.  That is just a suggestion.</p></speech>

We last gave evidence to it in May 2012 and I propose to provide an update on that evidence.  </p><p>  On the previous occasion we identified two main obstacles to progress on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  The first was the work of the United Kingdom commission on a bill of rights, while the second was the lack of political consensus in the North.  A substantial amount of our work since last May has focused on the work of the UK commission on a bill of rights.  The commission was established on 18 March 2011 as a coalition compromise to address the opposing visions of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats Party for the future shape of human rights protections in the United Kingdom.  Put simply, the former wishes to scrap the Human Rights Act, while the latter wishes to protect it.  This was highly worrying, but the work of the commission also had wider implications.  </p><p>  Throughout the lifetime of the commission the UK Government repeatedly used it as an excuse to defend the lack of progress on the Northern Ireland bill of rights, stating a section or an add-on to any UK bill of rights proposed by the commission would be the Government's preferred vehicle for developing rights specific to Northern Ireland.  We strongly disagreed with the idea of tagging on a Northern Ireland bill of rights to a UK bill of rights in the event that one was introduced.  For this reason, we ran a short campaign to allow members of the public in Northern Ireland to respond to the second consultation process of the UK commission last September.  The subsequent responses outline two main concerns.  A distinct debate is under way in Northern Ireland on a bill of rights and nothing done at a UK level should be allowed to cut across this initiative or reduce current protections.  The Northern Ireland debate takes as its starting point the existence of the Human Rights Act since it gives practical effect to the European Convention on Human Rights.  This Act should, if anything, be augmented and must not be weakened.</p><p>  The responses to our campaign accounted for slightly more than 60% of all submissions received by the UK commission on a bill of rights.  We followed up this work with meetings with the chair of the commission and UK politicians to ensure our message was as clear as possible.  The consortium was relieved to note that the report of the commission on a bill of rights released on 18 December 2012 as it validated our assessment.  While the commission failed to reach consensus on many topics in its report, including whether to proceed with a bill of rights in the United Kingdom, its report had this to say about a Northern Ireland Bill of Rights: <blockquote>In particular we recognise the distinctive Northern Ireland Bill of Rights process and its importance to the peace process in Northern Ireland.  We do not wish to interfere in that process in any way nor for any of the conclusions that we reach to be interpreted or used in such a way as to interfere in, or delay, the Northern Ireland Bill of Rights process.</blockquote>The barrier created by the UK commission on Human Rights process has been unambiguously removed.  Furthermore, recent parliamentary questions clarified that the Human Rights Act would not be tampered with under the Government.  This proves what we have been arguing for almost two years, namely, that the process was a complete distraction which served only to delay and confuse our process in Northern Ireland.  The challenge we now face is to identify how to move forward.</p><p>  The remaining barrier, in the opinion of the UK Government, is a lack of political consensus on a bill of rights among parties in the North.  It could not be argued that the UK Government has been overly-zealous in attempting to overcome this hurdle.  On the contrary, it appears to be using it as a reason to sidestep the issue.  The only intervention in the debate by the UK Government was in 2011 when it wrote to all five main political parties and tagged on a line about seeking suggestions on ways to make progress on a bill of rights.  This is not an adequate display of leadership.  The UK Government is failing to fulfil its responsibilities under the Good Friday Agreement.  Fifteen years after the agreement was signed, the time to hold the British Government to account is long overdue.  </p><p>  The Human Rights Consortium is encouraged by recent statements by the Irish Government, as co-signatory of the agreement, and look forward to hearing from the joint committee on its work plan for a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  Ms Reilly from the Committee on the Administration of Justice will now speak about the impact of the absence of a bill of rights.</p></speech>

Much of our contribution reflects the earlier contribution of our colleagues in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  As a large membership organisation, we speak from experience.  I work for the Committee on the Administration of Justice and I am also on the board of the Human Rights Consortium.  I propose to take stock of the current position and the reason it is more urgent than ever to move on a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.</p><p>  The Good Friday Agreement was signed 15 years ago in Belfast and while much has changed in relation to the political institutions and devolution of policing and justice, a great deal remains the same.  Many issues were highly contested in the roll-out of the peace process, whereas a process of implementing a bill of rights is a much simpler task.  As I noted, certain matters remain as they were prior to the signing of the Agreement.  A comprehensive framework to deal with the abuse of rights at a government level is absent and there is a lack of accountability mechanisms or a framework for the protection of basic rights.  These elements are absent.  </p><p>  In the past six months there have been a number of outbreaks of serious public disorder.  In July and September last year there was disorder about parades and more recently there has been disorder which appears, on the face of it, to be about flags.  Those of us working on the ground know that many other socioeconomic and human rights issues have compounded these events.  For those seeking a way to resolve the current issue, it is worth recalling that a legal framework based on the equality of treatment duty on public authorities was intended to be included in a bill of rights for Northern Ireland.  In the words of the Good Friday Agreement, bill of rights would provide additional rights to "reflect the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland" and "reflect the principles of mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both communities".  In short, the bill of rights was meant to provide a fairness framework within which issues involving a conflict of rights could be addressed.  I refer, for example, to flags and cultural identity, as well as many of the other issues that are causing serious unrest and, as I stated, being compounded by the situation with regard to socioeconomic issues.  These issues could have been addressed in a bill of rights and the introduction of a bill of rights should be regarded as an important safeguard for everybody in Northern Ireland. </p><p>  The Human Rights Consortium has always found its strength in the issues that unite rather than divide communities.  As Ms Patricia McKeown of the ICTU noted, housing, poverty, unemployment, education and other socioeconomic issues have brought communities together in their discussions on a ill of rights.  People want minimum standards and protections on these issues; it is as simple as that.  A bill of rights would do what many bills of rights and constitutional settlements have done across the world, namely, increase ownership and a shared sense of community cohesion in a divided society.  The consortium believes it would be seriously remiss of us to allow the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement to pass without fulfilling the provisions of the Agreement which have not been implemented, notably the introduction of a bill of rights.  The Agreement provided for a bill of rights to address the issues I highlighted within a human rights framework.  The danger in continuing to leave these matters unaddressed is that, as we have seen, problems begin to fester, communities do not believe they have gained from the peace process and marginalised communities become more polarised.  Mr. Mark Durkan, MP, has noted that we have been without a bill of rights for 15 years and that, therefore, it is okay.  It is not okay because, as we have seen in the flag protests, there is unravelling taking place owing to the failure to fulfil the commitment to introduce a bill of rights.</p></speech>

I should have stuck to my script.</p><p>  The Human Rights Consortium is encouraged by and welcomes the recent statements made by the T&aacute;naiste and the Taoiseach in which they spoke about their commitment to support the bill of rights process.</p> <p>As the committee is aware, the Agreement was written in such a way that there could be no veto by the Northern Ireland parties on a bill of rights.  We call on the committee to press the Irish Government in its role as a co-signatory to the Agreement to take all necessary steps to ensure the UK Government fulfils this outstanding obligation on a bill of rights without further delay. I hand over to my colleague Ms Sara Boyce, who will briefly outline some specific requests we have for the committee.</p></speech>

I am a policy co-ordinator with Include Youth, a rights-based NGO working with young people at risk and vulnerable young people.  We are also members of the Human Rights Consortium.  With other children and young people's organisations, we have been actively involved in the campaign for a bill of rights since its inception, on the basis that children and young people, who form a quarter of the population in the North, are among the most vulnerable in society and currently lack a comprehensive legal framework for protection of their rights.  From 2001, when the Human Rights Commission had its first consultation in the distant past, Include Youth has responded to consultation on behalf of the young people with whom we work, right up to the second consultation from the UK Commission on a bill of rights last year.  We have been consistently advocating for a strong bill of rights that would include protections for children and young people.  In 2001 I was involved in consulting with P7 schoolchildren - 11-year-olds - from all education sectors across the North, including maintained schools, state schools, Irish language schools and special educational needs schools.  Those schoolchildren are now in adulthood, having turned 18 years of age.  It is deeply disappointing that the promise made to them in the Good Friday Agreement was not realised throughout their childhood, so that they went through their childhood without the rights protections they had been promised.  We will soon be into a second generation, which is worrying for all the reasons we have heard already.</p><p>  The Human Rights Consortium has had a number of engagements with the committee.  We want to avail of the opportunity to put some concrete proposals to the committee.  In view of the committee's remit with regard to the implementation of the Agreement, we are interested to hear the committee's plans as we approach its 15th anniversary.  The consortium believes that an important exercise the committee could usefully undertake would be to conduct a review or audit of the implementation of the Agreement, which would obviously include an assessment of where the bill of rights process is at, as well as the development of concrete proposals regarding a roadmap to move us forward towards ultimate delivery of the bill of rights.  We also hope there will be a full debate on the Agreement's implementation in April and that the committee will use its influence to ensure that debate happens.  </p><p>  We extend an invitation to the committee to come to the North again and spend some time with the consortium's member groups in both loyalist and Nationalist communities - but also other communities that are sometimes overlooked - because a bill of rights would apply to all communities that most need and would benefit from the protections it could offer.  On behalf of the delegation I thank the committee for the time it has given us.  We will be happy to take questions and comments.</p></speech>

Many good suggestions have been made.  I do not see any reason to disagree with any of the three ideas proposed.  A review or audit of the Agreement is something we would like to see happening.  That would be helpful, and if we can assist in any way on any of those issues, including the debate in April, we will do so.  I see no reason to disagree with any of the comments made.  Because of the work Ms Sara Boyce has done with children and young people - she will have heard my comments to ICTU on the post-19 group - it is especially poignant that she engaged with young people who are now over 19 and are probably being dumped on their families with very little stimulation of any kind.  I am aware the delegation is representing the Human Rights Consortium, but I am concerned about the human rights of these young people and would welcome its views.</p></speech>

The report of the commission stated that it did not want any delay and did not want its work to be used as a barrier.  In regard to the lack of consensus, some will argue that the parties should be pulled together to see if agreement can be reached.  That sounds reasonable, although it is 15 years down the road.  If that does not work, what timescale should we be working towards?  If the two governments cannot get all the parties to agree to some bases in regard to a bill of rights, what should we be working towards?  It is not specifically a matter for us but for the two governments.  A meeting is planned between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, and the British Prime Minister said this was one of the issues that would be raised.  Does the delegation agree with that approach?</p><p>  There is also the important issue of synergy in regard to human rights.  If there is a bill of rights in the North there must be similar legislation in this jurisdiction, such as the all-Ireland charter.  How important is that?  The last thing we want is for one section of the island to move ahead on one issue and the other section to fall behind.  Some of the legislation being introduced would be the opposite of what is being introduced in the other jurisdiction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.760" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Durkan, MP" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100012#O00600"><p>I thank Ms Adrienne Reilly for her clarification.  In the discussion we heard about some of the political party opposition to this in the North.  We need to recognise that a very natural source of opposition in the North is the permanent government.  The Civil Service instinct, by and large, is to say that a bill of rights would create an impossible situation, as it would interfere with decisions on the planning and allocation of resources by the Government, and the Government would be second-guessed in every decision it made.  That is part of the argument that is made.  Those who make that argument have been able to ram it home in the years of certain masters in certain parties, almost to reinforce their own antipathy.  There is a certain Civil Service neuralgia around some of this.  That scepticism has been there for a long time.  We should not kid ourselves that there are only pockets of party political resistance or scepticism about this issue.  I say that not to agree with it but to recognise that it is part of the nature of the challenge.</p><p>  Like Ms Michelle Gildernew, I fully concur with the worthwhile suggestions that are being made to keep the ball rolling and get things moving.  My own observations earlier on the charter were not to look to the charter as an alternative to the bill of rights but maybe as a way of trying to achieve a different level of engagement, particularly from Unionist parties, given some of the issues they have raised about matters in this State and so on.  We may be able to create a situation in which they can engage with the charter and we can use that to create a different backlight around the debate on the need for a bill of rights.</p> <p> We need to give people an example of the difference a bill of rights may bring.  An emerging issue that will affect people right across the community in Northern Ireland and which will have a particularly sensitive impact on sections of the loyalist community, following the flag protest and arguments, relates to the welfare reform measures that are being passed.  The notion of a bedroom tax was suggested in Westminster as a way to deal with issues in London and elsewhere.  The justification for such a tax is that if people occupy social housing that is too large for them, the bedroom tax is a way of encouraging them to move to housing that is a better size for them, making the larger house available for others.  If we translate such a measure into places like the Fountain Estate in my constituency, we are basically saying to the small loyalist community members there that they should not be living there and should go somewhere else or should pay extra for being there.  The bill of rights proposed in the agreement would give people the right to choose where they live.  However, if the bedroom tax is implemented, people will be told that if they choose to stay, it will cost them.</p><p> We need to think about how the North could have been in a better position to influence legislation going through Westminster, that is now going through the Assembly in a sort of karaoke form.  If we did, Northern sensitivities based around rights and particular community sensitivities around those rights might have been front-loaded into that debate a lot earlier.  Even if we could not have changed the Westminster Bill fundamentally, there would have been a lot more leeway created for the North, but, unfortunately, the Assembly kind of slept in on that.  If there had been a bill of rights and people were alert to the situation earlier, some reaction might have kicked in and we might have a different outcome that would matter to people.  This is something that will hurt a lot of families in years to come.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.762" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Maskey, MP" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100013#P00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and appreciate the work that has been done and the contribution made to society.  As Ms Gildernew says, with regard to the proposals for a review and audit of the Good Friday Agreement, that is something we should do.  We called for this previously and I hope we can get agreement for this committee to look at that.  I do not think we can wait another 15 years for a bill of rights and that is the problem.  It is imperative on all of us to do whatever we can to ensure a bill of rights happens sooner rather than later and whatever this committee can do towards achieving that would be very useful.  Perhaps researchers in Leinster House might just do some quick research looking at some of the outstanding issues that have not been delivered on.</p><p>  I accept the point made that we need to meet all communities affected by not having a bill of rights.  Some 25% of our population are children and in some of our constituencies some 43% of children suffer from poverty.  This is a massive issue and I believe the committee should also look at taking some of the child and poverty issues on board.  As I said earlier, following on what Patricia McKeown said regarding poverty and other issues in our constituencies, the majority of people seriously affected by not having a bill of rights are those from a disadvantaged social and economic background community.</p><p>  Mr. Durkan has talked about some of the issues in the context of civil servants who advise something cannot be done because it will be too difficult, but this is something we must all challenge.  The reason our political parties are in government is to challenge these civil servants to ensure that the people affected are supported the most.  We must continue to do this.  It is not good enough that my constituency or Mr. Durkan's constituency have some of the highest unemployment rates on this island.  We must challenge those who have responsibility with regard to a bill of rights to deliver on that front.  I hope this committee takes up some of the recommendations put forward today and that we can implement them.  Hopefully, that will draw us closer to getting the bill of rights we all deserve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.763" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sara Boyce" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013022100013#P00300"><p>Ms Gildernew said we need real examples and both I and the consortium agree.  This is what the consortium has been working towards for many years.  Given our broad membership, with over 200 organisations, the real concrete issues are our starting point.  Many of these are social and economic issues, but there are also civil and political rights issues where breaches of rights are happening.  We take these issues and consider how looking at these issues through a rights-lens or framework would change things.  That is how we can convince people of the difference the protections in a bill of rights would make.</p><p>  Linking this to the example given by Ms Gildernew in terms of young people with disabilities, I know from our organisations - we work with many young 16 to 21 year olds - that some of them have learning disabilities and there is an issue with regard to the lack of continuation of services once they hit 18 and move into adulthood.  I am conscious that I am here as part of the consortium rather than in terms of a young people's organisation, but I would like to comment on where I see a bill of rights making a difference.  The consortium has been arguing that it does not look at the content of the bill of rights <i>per se,</i> because it is up to individual member organisations to argue for the content.  However, one of the bottom lines we have as a consortium is that it should build on international human rights standards, which are only minimum.</p><p>  Two obvious standards in this regard are the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the more recent UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.  In terms of the rights of children, article 23 would shift the debate and discussion and the parameters around which some of the decisions are being made or are not being made.  Currently, the only recourse desperate parents have - parents of children with additional needs are desperate - is a judicial review.  This should not be their only recourse, but should be an option of last resort.  This is not where we want things to be.  We want to have a framework that informs how policy decisions are being made.  As Mr. Durkan said, these decisions are often made by civil servants.  Such a framework must become part of the norm of how things are done and how decisions are made. </p><p>   I am sure Ms Flynn and Ms Reilly will also want to pick up on the issue raised by Mr. Durkan of where resistance comes from.  He said that resistance often comes from the permanent government and its mandarins, the civil servants.  In the North, our experience comes from the experience of the Human Rights Act and here in the South the experience comes from the constitutional referendum on the rights of children.  There will always be some opposition to these moves until they are in place and up and running.  Recently, I attended the launch by the Northern Ireland Policing Board of its annual human rights report and it was very encouraging to hear such a robust defence of the Human Rights Act by one of the assistant chief constables.  This Act is part of how the board makes its decisions and it sees the Act as a useful and helpful tool in terms of day to day decisions.  That is where we want to get to with the bill of rights.</p></speech>

Hopefully, this will have some interesting results.  On the issue of a timeframe for the bill of rights, that is not how we look at the issue.  Obviously, we do not want to double the wait from 15 to 30 years without a bill of rights.  We fear that we will get to 20 years, two decades, and we will still not have a bill of rights.  However, we do not feel it is helpful to think of that kind of timeframe.</p><p>  The issue of consensus is an obstacle, but we feel it is up to the British Government to create a process.  Ms Gildernew and Ms McKeown were present at the bill of rights forum where there was a process in place and people could discuss the issues.</p> <p>The problem now is that the UK Government, we believe, has no interest in actually having a process in place.  The process needs to come from the Government and we need the Irish Government to put pressure on the UK Government to put that process in place and to begin these conversations.  The bill of rights is one thing but the actual process of getting there and discussing rights and what they mean in Northern Ireland is another very valuable process for us.</p></speech>

In the Good Friday Agreement, the strongest and most cohesive message was that a bill of rights, based on protecting human rights and supporting what is contained in the European Convention on Human Rights, was necessary.  Before the last Human Rights Commission in Northern Ireland broke up and new commissioners were appointed, it put together a template involving a joint committee comprising members of the two human rights commissions in the North and the South.  It was like a tracking device of existing complimentary human rights mechanisms.  However, the bill of rights process has been much longer and much more robust.  It has come from the bottom up.  We have heard the suggestion today that perhaps we should start bottom-up engagement but we have had that for nearly 12 years.  It has come from the bottom up, from communities and the member organisations and has come with real examples of human rights issues and the need for a framework for them.  The bill of rights process is the best one, supported by a charter of all-Ireland rights.  We need parity of esteem and equality of human rights treatment.  That is why, from a consortium perspective, we strongly advocate that the bill of rights process is the one to provide the over-arching framework on which to move, either singularly or in a parallel process, so we do have equivalency of rights.</p></speech>

The Chief Constable made that very point himself when speaking in Derry last night.  He spoke about how important and valuable the Human Rights Act had been.  He was less emphatic about the importance of a bill of rights as well but I would suggest that he be invited to a session and I am sure he will be given a stronger orientation in that regard.</p></speech>

It has been our experience in our direct training work with groups from all across Northern Ireland that a lot of these groups have been very resistant to the idea of a bill of rights but want to engage with human rights mechanisms.  When we get into a discussion about this, the Eureka moment happens, the light comes on and then they fully support a bill of rights.  We see that all across the board.  It is a question of how we engage with people and that is actually why we are here today.  We need the committee to support what we are doing because while the process is happening on the ground, we also need the process to happen at Government level.  That is what we are asking for.</p></speech>

The one that stands out is for us to spend time with the groups and if we can do that, we will.  We are always delighted to go up North.  Indeed, we just decided in private session today that we will go up North again shortly.  We would be willing to do that and meet groups from within loyalism and nationalism.  We are trying to be the honest broker here and to facilitate the debate.  If there are divergent views, we need to hear them all and hopefully we can do that.</p><p>  Regarding where we are at, we are 15 years into the Good Friday Agreement and we are still asking the question as to how to move the process forward.  We must start by finding out where we are at now.  The UK Government, as recently as this year, said that it cannot achieve consensus on a pan-UK basis.  We must find out where we are at now.  The UK Government recognises the distinctive role for the Northern Ireland Government in looking at this issue in a distinctive fashion.  We need to open the channels of conversation between Westminster and Dublin.  As I said earlier, the Irish Government is committed to a Northern Ireland bill of rights and this committee can use its influence to help that conversation to progress.  Deputy Crowe mentioned that we do not know if it will be on the agenda for the meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister but we can certainly request that it would be.  Indeed, we would be delighted to do that.  </p><p>  We wish the witnesses well with their work.  We will seek their counsel and advice on reaching out to different groups, given that they represent an umbrella group for more than 200 organisations.  They have met them all and have worked tirelessly at a grassroots level and maybe the political needs to mix with the civil level more in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.778" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/989" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100003#E00300"><p>We are about to commence our consideration of COM (2012) 788, a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco and related products.  The current tobacco products directive, Directive 2001/37/EC, dates from 2001.  Since then, significant scientific, market and international developments have taken place.  For example, new evidence on flavourings used in tobacco products and effectiveness of health warnings has become available.  Novel products such as electronic cigarettes have entered the market and recent marketing strategies involve the use of attractive packaging and flavours.  The main objective of the revision is to improve the functioning of the internal market while ensuring a high level of public health.  In particular, the proposal aims to update already harmonised areas to overcome member states' obstacles to bring their national legislation into line with new market and scientific and international developments, address product-related measures not yet covered by the previous tobacco products directive, and ensure that the provisions of the directive are not circumvented by placing on the market products not compliant with the tobacco products directive.</p><p>  Given the complex nature of this directive, we as a committee agreed to an oral briefing from the Department of Health.  In this regard, I welcome Mr. Chris Fitzgerald, principal officer at the Department of Health and Children, and Ms Dilly O'Brien, assistant principal at the Department, to the meeting this morning.  I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Fitzgerald to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.779" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Chris Fitzgerald" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100003#E00400"><p>Tobacco consumption is the largest avoidable health threat in the EU.  There are approximately 700,000 deaths from tobacco-related illness in the EU every year.  In Ireland, approximately 5,500 people die every year from tobacco-related illness.  A Eurobarometer survey shows that 28% of the EU population smoke, which includes 29% of young Europeans aged between 15 and 24.  The overall prevalence rates in Ireland are more or less in line with European rates, at about 29%.  However, the percentage of younger people who smoke is increasing, which is a cause of some concern.</p><p>  I will provide some perspective in terms of cost to put the matter into context.  The cost of treatment for tobacco-related illness, plus an estimate for lost productivity in the EU, is in the region of &euro;33 billion annually, which equates to about 3% of total health spending across Europe.  There are further figures available relating to an estimate of the cost of premature mortality.  If one takes the figure based on monetising of lost years, it could be in the region of &euro;500 billion in the EU.  The cost to the EU is enormous and the cost to Ireland is, obviously, of the same proportion.  It is also worth saying in respect of the figures I have just quoted that more than 80% of all lung cancer deaths are directly related to tobacco consumption.  Clearly, if one is to address and ultimately eliminate tobacco consumption, one would go a long distance in terms of addressing and eliminating lung cancers.  It is a very important issue for Europe and Ireland.  </p><p>  Last December, the European Commission published a proposal for a new EU product directive.  As the Chairman stated, this seeks to update the existing tobacco product directive which was introduced in 2001 and is now over ten years old.  The proposal concerns the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products in the EU.  The overall objective for the revised directive is to improve the functioning of the internal market through greater harmonisation of existing measures.  The basis for this is Article 114 of the treaty, which is a market provision.  Article 114 does provide that a high level of health protection must be taken and this was taken as a basis when choosing between different policy options identified in the review of the directive.  It is expected, therefore, that the implementation of the directive's provisions will contribute to a reduction in tobacco consumption.  In its opening comments on this, the Commission estimated that it expects a reduction in consumption volume of about 2% as a result of this measure.  Specifically, the draft directive seeks to put in place measures to make tobacco products and smoking less attractive to young people, with an overall effect of trying to address initiation rates.  It is worth making the point that 70% of smokers across Europe started when they were under 18 and 94% of all smokers start when they are under 25.  The focus of this particular piece of legislation is addressing initiation rates by making tobacco products less attractive through their marketing and presentation to young people.  </p><p>  As the committee is aware, Ireland has been a world leader in tobacco control initiatives through the years, most recently through the introduction of the smoking ban in 2004.  The introduction of many successful tobacco control measures in Ireland has been facilitated by parallel developments in the EU.  It is important that our policy and legislative framework continues to develop within the context of European activity.</p><p>  The Commission has expressed the hope that the proposal will be adopted in 2014.  Progressing this proposal has been identified as a key priority of the Irish Presidency.  The Commission presented the proposal and the impact assessment to the first meeting of the working party on public health on 7 January, which was the first available working day.  The working party is, obviously, chaired by Ireland and has met three times on this proposal.  Approximately ten further meetings are scheduled between now and the middle of June.  It is important to make the point that this is a Commission initiative but it falls to be progressed during the Irish Presidency.</p> <p>Ireland's function is to facilitate agreement among member states and to progress the draft directive during our six month tenure.  Since the original directive was introduced in 2001, there have been significant scientific and market changes.  New evidence has become available on the flavourings used in tobacco products and on the effectiveness of health warnings.  Novel products, including electronic cigarettes, have come on the market while recent marketing strategies have involved the use of attractive packaging and flavours.  The draft directive seeks to revisit the tobacco control regime set out in 2001 to take account of developments in the meantime.  All EU member states are party to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, or FCTC, which is an initiative of the World Health Organization, or WHO.  Something of the order of 180 countries are signed up to the FCTC.  The draft directive seeks to track developments under the FCTC to ensure that the EU is in line with how the WHO is moving in the area.</p><p> The draft proposal covers ingredients and emissions which will be addressed by a ban on attractive flavours.  Increasingly, we have seen that flavours which might be attractive to younger people are being added to products to make them more palatable.  The draft directive seeks to ban the inclusion of certain ingredients.  The draft directive also deals in a very specific way with labelling and packaging and provides for joint text and picture warnings and specifies that 75% of the surface area of a packet must be covered.  If the directive goes through as currently drafted, all member states will see joint text and picture messages covering 75% of the surface area of cigarette packaging.  It will be a considerable movement on the current average in Europe.  Importantly, the draft directive further provides for new traceability and security features which are designed to address illicit trading.</p><p> The directive also addresses nicotine-containing products which are not cigarettes - in effect electronic cigarettes - and seeks to analyse how these can be addressed.  E-cigarettes were not on the market in 2001 when the original directive was developed.  Broadly, it is proposed that electronic cigarettes which have a nicotine content above a certain level would come within the ambit of the medicinal products directive and would have to be authorised as medicinal.  Those with a lower level of nicotine content would not have to be so authorised but would have to carry a health warning.  There continues to be a great deal of scientific debate on the efficacy and risks associated with electronic cigarettes.  The draft directive sets out provisions on cross-border distance sales of tobacco, in effect Internet sales.  The directive seeks to introduce age verification arrangements to ensure children cannot order and purchase tobacco products online.</p><p> In summary, the draft directive provides for standardised cigarette packaging, larger public health warnings on packaging, a total ban on flavouring such as menthol and the maintaining of the ban on tobacco for oral use.  The proposal aims to ensure that the provisions of the directive are not circumvented by the placing of products on the market which do not comply with it.  The proposals have been adopted following extensive consultation with stakeholders undertaken by the European Commission.  The Europe-wide public consultation exercise generated 85,000 responses.  In addition, the Commission undertook a thorough impact assessment which has been published and commissioned a number of studies to consider economic implications.  The Commission has done a great deal of preparation prior to bringing the proposal to the table.</p><p> In parallel with this process, the Department held a public consultation and invited submissions from members of the public.  The closing date for the process was 16 January 2013 which was chosen to ensure we had all the submissions before the debate on the directive commenced in Brussels.  We are analysing the submissions we received to establish the public view.  As one would expect, there has been quite a variance in the submissions.  Some responses were clearly organised.  We received submissions which were part of postcard campaigns on behalf of people with a commercial interest in tobacco sales.  There were also many responses from individuals and representative groups, including cancer societies.  We are also consulting other Departments to obtain their views on the proposal.  Other Departments will have particular perspectives.</p><p> A number of meetings of the working party are scheduled to take place in Brussels; probably ten.  We are at a very early stage of discussions and, as of the last meeting on Monday. have yet to complete a read-through of the document.  It is a complex and painstaking process.  Many member states continue to consult and continue to have reservations on the document.  Some member states have yet to show their hands entirely.  Of those which have, there is a high level of general support for the direction in which the directive seeks to go.  There has been a fair amount of unanimity on the need to tackle the initiation of young people into smoking.  A number of member states have difficulties with some aspects of it.  They are beginning to emerge but we will not have a clear picture until after two or three further meetings have taken place.  We are happy to revert to the committee at a later stage when the picture is clearer.</p></speech>

When the Minister attended the committee, he made a commitment that tobacco control would be a central plank of the Presidency, particularly the draft directive.  Mr. Fitzgerald outlined that there was a very strong tobacco control ethos in Ireland and that legislation here is very advanced.  The difficulty we have is that 29% of the population continue to smoke.  There are alarming trends among young people who continue to take up cigarettes.  An even more worrying trend is that there seems to be a high prevalence of take-up of cigarette smoking among young girls.</p><p>  While we talk about the directive and tobacco control in general, where is the Commission in terms of dealing with this as a genuine public health issue?  As long as we have huge disparities in the price of legally sold tobacco across member states, it is difficult for countries like Ireland to use high tobacco prices as a public health policy initiative.  While we support that policy, it creates the difficulty of illicit tobacco trading.  No one in Ireland takes that trade seriously and Customs and Excise, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appear to have turned a blind eye to it.  I can walk out of here and go to the main streets of the city and openly buy illegal cigarettes.  It is something we must tackle head on.  Clearly, nicotine is an addictive substance and many will go to extraordinary lengths to secure tobacco products.</p> <p>If as a health policy initiative we have high prices for tobacco but at the same time allow illegal cigarettes to be sold openly throughout the country, we are not taking our own policies seriously.  There is a lot of evidence to show that major criminal gangs are moving into the area of illicit tobacco trade because the authorities are not taking it seriously, and if a person is prosecuted, they will not end up behind bars, whereas if a person is dealing in narcotics, there is a good chance they will get a custodial sentence.  There are large profits to be made from this trade.</p><p> We have banned the ten cigarette pack and we are moving on this directive.  I published a Private Member's Bill on plain packaging which I would love to bring to this committee.  What scientific evidence does the Commission, the Department of Health or the tobacco control unit here use to assess the policies to be put in place to deal seriously with this problem?  Apart from advertising campaigns and the ban on smoking in the workplace which is moving across Europe, wherever one goes one sees a huge cohort of people starting to use tobacco products.</p><p> We need to deal with the legal organisations, the tobacco companies, which have massive resources and which in the past have lied to committees of the US Congress, saying that nicotine was not addictive and not bad for one's health.  These huge multinationals are making an insidious effort by changing flavouring and using subtle or covert advertising through modelling agencies and all that flows from that.  On what scientific basis does the Department or the Commission analyse the market and trends to see what policies would work as opposed to the window-dressing that is the case now?</p><p> How many submissions did the committee receive on this issue?</p></speech>

I get a sense from our scrutiny of the proposed EU directive that more stick than carrot is being used to address tobacco use.  With all the empty seats facing us this morning, the picture is not complete.  An awful lot of carrot is needed and we should perhaps have the Department of Education and Skills here with the officials from the Department of Health.  All the directives in the world, all the new regulation and enforcement will address the problem only at one end of the spectrum.  I am more interested in the other end because the consequence of this and previous measures is displacement from the licit to the illicit trade. I believe in discouraging and giving young people the strength to make informed choices rather than follow their peers or whatever they view as the consequences of smoking, apart from the health risks.</p><p>  I have no issue with the measures presented and I note the Department's recommendation but I am concerned that sufficient effort is not made to address the illicit trade.  Very little within the five points the officials outlined will impact on the illicit market.  Nobody within the illicit trade will be in any way unnerved by these measures whereas those who are involved in the manufacturing sector, and the many employed in the production of rolled tobacco in this State, are concerned.  We have already mentioned this in our private session.  The facts of the illicit trade are only guessed at and never really known but it is much more serious than the figures provided suggest.  Those involved in the illicit trade will not be in any way impacted by this directive which introduces tracing and holograms.  The Department of Health is perhaps only a part of the picture.  What efforts are being employed in tandem with others to discourage people from taking up smoking?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.786" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100005#G00400"><p>I have two or three questions.  In his opening presentation Mr. Fitzgerald said that based on EU research, the impact of tobacco consumption on the health budget is 3%.  That seems extremely small based on what we have been told anecdotally, that tobacco consumption has a huge impact on the health budget.  Could Mr. Fitzgerald please clarify that point?</p><p>  A number of years ago we banned packs of ten cigarettes and the minimum one can purchase now is 20.  The same provision is being introduced in this proposed directive in respect of loose tobacco to get rid of the smaller packages.  What impact has the removal of the ten cigarette pack had on consumption, specifically among young people? </p><p>  Could Mr. Fitzgerald elaborate on the point he made about flavours and what exactly he is talking about?  It seems that these are alcopops for smokers.  There was a huge public outcry when alcopops were introduced and tax was increased specifically on them because of the impact they had on young people, but now the same is happening in the tobacco industry with, for example, chocolate-flavoured cigarettes, which is totally unacceptable and needs to be banned outright.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.787" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100005#G00500"><p>Has any detailed research been done on what attracts young people to smoking when the health problems are already identified?  The witnesses spoke about figures in the 15 to 24 age group.  We also need to look at the ten or 12 to 15 age group.</p><p>  My next concern is the research and how we formulate policy to steer young people away from starting to smoke.  I am doing a research project in which we interview young people about their attitudes to the graphic pictures on the packaging.  I hope to complete it within the next four to six weeks.</p> <p>I am not at all sure from the initial results that it is having a huge influence and a few more people must be interviewed before we come to a conclusion.  I wonder whether we are aiming policy in the right direction.  Do we need to do much more research, particularly with regard to how we encourage younger people not to go down the road of smoking?  I am not sure we are doing enough research in this area.  Does the Department intends to take on any particular programme to examine this issue?  We did it with regard to road traffic over a period of ten years and made huge progress.  We need to research this issue far more and try to deal with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.789" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1029" speakername="Catherine Byrne" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100006#H00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and I must concur with some of what the previous speakers have stated on the various flavours of cigarettes.  In my youth I was in a band which sang in front of 500 or 600 people in various places.  I never smoked in my life but I should probably be long buried somewhere because of secondary smoking.  I often ask myself why young people smoke and I have come to a few conclusions.  These are that they think it is cool, and that social environment plays a role, as does family which has a great deal to do with young people smoking.  If it is done at home by family members young people will automatically follow.  The European survey is not correct with regard to the age of young people who smoke as I believe they are much younger.  I see many children as young as ten or 12 years of age smoking as they come from primary schools.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that all we can do is stop young people smoking.  There is very little we can do about older people smoking no matter what graphic images we put on cigarette packages.  Education is crucial and it should begin at first class in primary school.  Most schools now have CSPE courses and there is much that can be taught about health and smoking.  If a young person with a chest infection attends the family GP the doctor should examine the history of the family and make people well aware of the risks of smoking, particularly if this young person comes from a background where an addiction to smoking has contributed to the death of family members.  GPs and hospital doctors should play a key role by handing people leaflets or booklets on the risks of and statistics on smoking.  This would go a long way towards helping young children.</p><p>  I am disappointed that nobody has targeted young people with television advertisements on the health issues of smoking.  The advertisement campaigns on road safety have played a huge part.  I recently watched a very old film and I noticed that all of the famous actors in it were smoking.  Thank God this seems to have been removed from what many young people watch.  The characters in "Friends" and other television programmes do not smoke.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in that somebody from the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Social Protection should have come before the committee this morning to hear the views being expressed.</p></speech>

The more we increase the price of cigarettes the more we drive certain people towards buying illicit cigarettes.  As Deputy Kelleher stated it is not like one must go looking for them.  One can buy them on Grafton St.  In the pubs in my area they are advertised with telephone numbers one can call.  No one seems to be tackling this issue.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher stated 29% of the population is still smoking.  This figure seems static.  Will the witnesses identify the percentage by which the number of smokers has reduced since the introduction of the smoking ban in the workplace?  Has the number of smokers decreased since the removal of the box of ten cigarettes?  Does the Department know the percentage of tobacco consumed through the illicit trade?  We are all against smoking and we all acknowledge it is terribly bad for our health.  The one benefit of legal tobacco sales is that the national school aged children mentioned by Deputy Byrne cannot go into their local shop and buy 20 cigarettes because they will not be sold to them, but they can get cigarettes through the illegal trade.</p><p>  What percentage of the excise duty generated through the sale of tobacco is ring-fenced and given to the Department of Education and Skills to put in place a programme to educate young people on the dangers of taking up this filthy habit?  There is an overemphasis by the Department on increasing the price and reducing the number of cigarettes which can be bought in a box.  Now we are looking at reducing the size of a packet of rolled tobacco.  At the same time the illicit trade is being ignored.  Real jobs in the industry will be directly affected if the directive is implemented.</p></speech>

It is very important that we make people aware that smoking is very dangerous.  Putting a warning cover on the packaging is a step in the right direction.  It is also very important that people realise tobacco contains 70 cancer-causing substances.  It is wrong that tobacco should be flavoured as this will encourage young people to smoke.  A tracking and tracing system is very important as it would help find the origin of the product and would also stop black market activity.  I am very concerned about tobacco products being bought on the Internet.  If it is possible to buy tobacco on the Internet it should be stopped.  As has been stated, 70% of smokers began smoking under the age of 18.  Most families have a computer, so it is very important that the Internet sale of tobacco products is stopped.  Approximately 5,200 people in Ireland die every year from smoking-related illnesses.  The job being done is very positive and I have learned much this morning.  The more people realise that smoking is dangerous and the more we publicise this the better.</p></speech>

Ms O'Brien will pick up on some of the questions.  To respond to the point raised by Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and Kelleher it is important to emphasise that we are discussing a directive developed by the EU Commission.  We see it as part of what we are trying to do in terms of tackling the problems with tobacco.  It is now open to the 27 member states to develop and adapt this Commission initiative.</p> <p>We are involved in the process because it is on the table and Ireland has the Presidency.  It is a priority that we steer the issue.  We are broadly supportive of the directive, as it is consistent with what we want to do.</p><p> Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, Kelleher and Byrne asked a general question on what we know about the reasons people start smoking and what the proven interventions that states can make are.  We are constantly researching.  As Senator Burke mentioned, we can never have too much research in this regard.  In consultation with our colleagues in Northern Ireland, we have commissioned research on the reasons young people start smoking.  Research informs policy.</p><p> The kinds of measures that are proven and are broadly accepted internationally as being effective are pricing, legislative control, information and education, and offering cessation services.  These four are the tried and tested remedies.  We have consistently tried to keep the cost of tobacco high.  One of the complaints we constantly receive is that the cost of tobacco in Ireland is high.  We recognise the fact that cost is a factor.  The banning of packets of fewer than 20 cigarettes feeds into this thinking.</p><p> We have been at the forefront in terms of legislation.  A legislative framework allows one to take certain actions.  Legislation is important.</p><p> Information and education are very important.  Through the years, we have invested heavily in public awareness media campaigns.  To address Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's point, there is a cross-sectoral dimension, in that we must work in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills, community groups and whatever groups are working in this field.  This initiative cannot be driven entirely by our Department or from within a legislative framework.  Promoting school initiatives and so on are important.  The HSE has been involved in many initiatives, working with communities around a range of health promotion issues, of which smoking is one.  We must continue to be innovative in terms of how we reach out to young people in schools and communities and to adults in workplaces and so on.  There is a role for other actors.</p><p> Deputy Kelleher or Deputy Naughten asked about the percentage of cost.  The figures I cited were from the most recent EU study on this matter, which examined annual EU health care expenditure.  The spending is largely hospital based and amounts to &euro;25.3 billion, minus productivity losses.  It equates to approximately 3% of health spending.  However, if one considers the larger picture - the lost years of life and so on - the percentage increases considerably.</p></speech>

It is reflected as a percentage of health spending.  The total cost to individual member states would need to reflect substitution payments, for example, people in receipt of social welfare when they are off sick from work, a loss in productivity and premature death.  These must be factored in to increase the figure, but the pure correlation between health spending in overall terms and health spending on tobacco-related conditions is of that order.  It may seem surprising, although the figures are still enormous.</p><p>  A number of comments were made on the illicit trade.  Enforcement is a matter for Revenue and the Garda.  We are working with them.  Revenue is conscious of the issue and recently introduced a new initiative.  The directive attempts to address the illicit trade through the tracking and tracing provisions, but the existence of the trade and the associated criminality cannot be denied.</p><p>  I believe it was Deputy Naughten who asked what we knew about the effect of the ban on ten packs.  Since the introduction of the ban on the sale of packs of fewer than 20 cigarettes, our current figures for the ten year old to 17 year old age group have fallen from 21.2% to 12%.  It is difficult to know whether all of this decrease can be attributed to the elimination of ten packs, but we all know anecdotally that young children would not have the price of 20 packs.  The market for loose cigarettes and small quantities of cigarettes was, to a large extent, aimed at young people.  We believe that we got something wrong.</p><p>  The Commission's research referred to evidence of a movement within the industry to introduce flavours of all sorts to make tobacco more palatable and attractive and, therefore, to initiate young people into smoking.  There is no doubt about it.  There is every possible flavour, including vanilla.  One must assume that the only function of this is to make the product more palatable.  When introducing the directive, former Commissioner Borg stated that his objective was to make tobacco products taste like tobacco products, which was a good way of describing it.  Clearly, the industry is trying to make the product more palatable and, therefore, more acceptable to young people.</p><p>  We have also seen the emergence on the market of lipstick-type boxes of cigarettes, which are usually pink in colour and look like lipsticks or other cosmetics.  One must assume that these are not aimed at people of my age or disposition.  I will leave it to members' imaginations to decide who the targets are.  Slim cigarettes are another development along the same lines.  A great deal of study has shown evidence of a subliminal association between slim cigarettes and slimness and sophistication via the use of catwalk models and so on in their marketing.</p><p>  The directive is trying to tackle these issues.  From a public health point of view, its primary function is to attack the initiation of young people into smoking.</p></speech>

If I smoke menthol, cannot buy a similar product and am at an age at which I do not want to give up cigarettes, is there not a temptation to walk down the main street, buy illegal cigarettes and keep the illicit trade flourishing?</p></speech>

The Commission recognised this argument by including in the directive provisions on tracking and tracing.  Obviously, member states still have an obligation to address the illegal trade, but the directive is trying to focus on young people in the first instance by removing the industry's attractive enticements aimed at giving them the smoking habit.  The illicit argument needs to be addressed in parallel, but it would not be an argument for not doing what the Commission is trying to do.</p></speech>

The illicit trade discussion has taken place on a number of levels and I have referred to the framework convention on tobacco control, which has 180 countries signed up to it.  A new protocol on illicit trade was adopted at the last meeting of the framework convention in South Korea in November.  We are party to this.  At the EU level there is a specific provision within the directive to tighten up on tracking and tracing, which should address illicit trade.  There are other issues relating to the daily management of this and we are not in a position to comment on them.  The Department of Health wants to see the issue addressed in tandem with what we are doing with health provisions.</p></speech>

It struck me that those in the vending machine business were very much concerned about rolling tobacco.  The point was made by the witness that young people did not necessarily have the money to buy a pack of 20 cigarettes, and they may move to the illegal trade because of changes in regulations regarding pouches and vending machines.  Those in the vending machine business foresee a profound impact on sales when there is a price increase or change.  In local pubs in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere, people sell illegal tobacco, and it is of grave concern if we are encouraging people to go to the illicit trade.</p></speech>

We have not got into a detailed discussion about that element of the proposed directive but the Commission's view was that it had to try to deal with all the elements of tobacco sale uniformly, taking the view that there can be stricter provisions for one element without addressing another element.  It bears some further scrutiny with regard to the extent to which younger people are smoking rolling tobacco as opposed to manufactured cigarettes.  I take the point.</p><p>  Regardless of how the tobacco product is presented for sale, if we are successful, from a health perspective, in meeting our ultimate objective of de-normalising tobacco consumption, we should be heading to an end of eliminating tobacco consumption.  That will clearly have an effect on people with an economic interest in the sale of tobacco.  The difficulty is that on one level we are coming from a public health protection perspective, and other economic arguments must be balanced in this regard.  That is one of the principal reasons the Commission used article 114 as the basis for the directive, as it is about levelling the market's playing pitch.</p><p>  I will think about what was said and perhaps we can take the point up in Brussels.  We have not got into the detail in any great extent.</p></speech>

I will not detain the witnesses.  We must be very clear on the issue.  If we suspended the meeting and headed to Moore Street or O'Connell Street, I could openly buy a pack of illegal cigarettes.  We are trying to discourage people from smoking by increasing the price of tobacco and making it less attractive.  That is a public health policy.  The Department of Health should be very concerned about the number of illegal cigarettes on the street; it should be more concerned than the Departments of Justice and Equality or Finance because it is, fundamentally, a public health issue.  It is fine to say it is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality or Customs and Excise but if they are not being as forceful as they should be, it undermines the Department of Health's public health policy.</p></speech>

One organisation cannot have a policy of increasing taxes and making a product more expensive while it can be argued that there is a flood of illegal cigarettes in the country funding criminality and everything else.</p><p>  There is a similar context in the broader European debate.  Some countries in the EU have very cheap legal cigarettes, and it is almost a policy of government to keep them cheap.  In the same EU market, we are driving prices up.  Cigarettes bought legally in Europe can be transported here for illegal sale.  Nevertheless, they are manufactured and sold legally in the EU.  It is not joined up thinking.</p></speech>

The Department of Health is concerned about any cigarettes for sale or the consumption of any cigarettes, whether legal or illegal.  The health effects are probably not significantly different, although I suspect some of the illegal cigarettes may be more dangerous.  We are concerned that any amount of tobacco is being consumed, either legally or illegally.</p><p>  I share Deputy Kelleher's view in that it would make a nonsense of the issue if at one level we introduce a range of provisions and did not take a hard line with regard to illegal sales.  What we are discussing in the context of the directive addresses legally sold products so the two issues must move in tandem.  With regard to the detail and policing of the matter, it would not fall within our ambit.  From an advocacy perspective, we are of the view that we must move together.  That has been the case globally, in terms of the framework convention on tobacco control, which is a World Health Organisation initiative and which has recently seen a new protocol introduced.  I attended the convention discussions and there was a reluctance by member states to get into the area of fiscal policy.  The second point raised by the Deputy can only really be addressed by some sort of cohesion in fiscal policy, which will not be achieved.  The Deputy knows that as much as I do.</p><p>  We are concerned about the unacceptable level of tobacco consumption.  Any consumption is unacceptable but it is particularly so at 29%.  The directive offers a number of ways to strengthen our current regime and we are supportive of that.</p></speech>

The directive is one part of the issue and only relates to the products, their manufacture and sale.  There are other issues and the WHO has approved under the convention different ways to go, including increasing price and using enforcement to tackle illicit trade.  I agree that one area of price seems to push to another, and it is incumbent on the State to ensure that all arms are working together.</p><p>  The Department is developing a tobacco policy review group, with a report coming to finalisation.  It deals with many of the issues raised by the Deputy, including awareness.  Towards a Tobacco-Free Society was a strategy done in 2001, and much has happened since.  The new policy document will build on that, considering matters such as new legislation, awareness and education in schools and media campaigns.  There is an overall framework to cover all areas in the country.</p></speech>

In the context of what Mr. Fitzgerald stated about taking a lot at the issue, I will add a further comment.  The issue is between dissuading and the potential to displace.  Dissuading is my preference by a long shot.  That is why I made the point that we did not have an holistic, in-the-round address of the issue.  We only have it from the health perspective.  Although that is about discouraging, the measures being employed are more on the stick as regards manufacturing and promotion.</p><p>  The potential displacement is more likely under these measures, that is, moving people from the licit to the illicit.  The directive is flawed in that respect.</p><p>  What is the measurement in respect of the packs?  Is it 40g?</p></speech>

I can understand the ten cigarette pack argument in terms of young people, particularly a cohort of young , but they are not the image that comes to mind when I think of roll-your-own cigarettes.  It is a different cohort of users, people who generally have the choice and invariably have a particular common economic circumstance.  I do not know whether we are really addressing the issue by penalising people who truly cannot afford the larger option at any one given time.  I do not believe that we are serving the argument well by making it punitive for people to purchase 40g packs of tobacco-----</p></speech>

I hope they understand it was an important issue and we had to seek clarification on it.  I welcome Mr. John O'Dwyer and Mr. Declan Moran from VHI, Mr. D&oacute;nal Clancy and Mr. Christian Jaggy from Laya Healthcare, Mr. John Armstrong and Mr. Brian Dunne from Aviva Health Insurance Ireland, and Mr Jim Dowdall and Ms Teresa Kelly Oroz from GloHealth.  We are discussing the issue of private health insurance, an issue that concerns not just the minds of the committee but the members of the witnesses' companies.  It is an important issue, as discussed in October, and we will keep it on our agenda as we move towards universal health insurance.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. O'Dwyer to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.831" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Dwyer" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100010#N00400"><p>From the perspective of VHI, we would like to cover a few topics to remind the committee of our private medical insurance market and some of the rules in it.  We would like to talk about the importance of risk sharing and to examine the key issues facing the market.  We will make some suggestions on how to make progress.</p><p>  Some 2.1 million people in the country have health insurance, amounting to 47% of our population.  Some 390,000 customers are aged over 60 years.  The core principle by which we all compete is community-rated premiums, which means the same price for the same product in the case of a 20-year-old or a 60-year-old.  There is no risk selection and the sick and vulnerable have the same access to care.  There is a risk-sharing system, primarily to protect the elderly and the sick.  The key objective of all the rules is to ensure there is no incentive to compete on risk selection.</p><p>  We have community rated health insurance, meaning we charge someone who is 30 years of age the same price as a 70-year-old.  This is different to property insurance or motor insurance, where there is risk rating.  In community rating, we must have a risk-sharing system.  It is worth pointing out that the health care costs of different age groups, whether healthy or sick, are different.  An average 35-year-old costs approximately &euro;700 per year in health care costs, while the average 75-year-old costs nearly &euro;4,000.  In the case of a sick 75-year-old, the figure can be multiples of that and can easily amount to &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000.  Without risk sharing, sick and older customers will not be able to afford health insurance when they need it most.  All international markets with community rating have a risk-sharing system, including Australia, Israel, and our neighbours the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland.</p><p>  We welcome that the D&aacute;il has put a permanent risk equalisation system in place and we are pleased that, for the first time, health status has been introduced.  In the case of two 40-year-olds, the one with an illness such as diabetes costs much more money.  It is a positive step that we now have health status.</p><p>  While we are happy there is a permanent system of risk equalisation, we see areas for improvement.  The effectiveness of risk equalisation needs to be improved.  We estimate it is 55% effective, and it should move to closer to the Netherlands and other markets, for which the equivalent figures are more than 90%.  There is great room to improve health status and how it is measured.  It can be more sophisticated.  There is an opportunity to have one standard level of cover.  While we understand some of the motivation behind the current system of advanced and non-advanced cover, the solution is to have one standard level of cover with appropriate, fully effective risk equalisation.   </p><p>  Our risk sharing system is cost-neutral, with levies charged on each health insurance product and credits for companies that have elderly or sick people.  Rather than going into a central pot, the money from the levies goes to companies that have sick or vulnerable people.  </p><p>  Our presentation gives an example of why we would like the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme to improve.  If we examine the claims costs in the case of a 35-year-old after risk equalisation is applied and compare it to a 75-year-old, there is a difference of &euro;1,000.  A company with a 35-year-old, as opposed to a 75-year-old, is &euro;1,000 better off.  This incentivises cherry-picking in the market and we believe it is the key reason there are hundreds of products in the marketplace.  We would like to see the gap significantly closed.</p><p>  Looking at the challenges facing the market, the greatest challenge is affordability.  The single greatest challenge facing us down the road is an increase in public hospital charges.  The proposed increase, which we understand to be approximately &euro;250 million over a couple of years, will add significant amounts to premiums if the charge goes ahead at that level, no matter what we do in respect of cost containment.  I hope I speak for the industry on this point.</p><p>  We would like to see no risk selection.  We ask the committee members to note our key point, which is that we are looking for a simple and clearly understood standard product in the marketplace to cover people in the event of being sick.  The product should have risk equalisation of greater than 90% effectiveness supporting it.  Everything above that product can be risk-rated.</p> <p>This is not dissimilar to what happens in Holland.  Universal health care will take a number of years to introduce in its full form, but we can take many steps towards it with a standard product and also with the introduction of lifetime community rating.  We need to encourage young people into the market, but we also need to acknowledge that a person coming in at 30 years of age should be given some credit, as opposed to someone coming in at 55 years of age when they are more likely to need health insurance.  The concept of lifetime community rating should be introduced soon.  We could also look to make sure it is affordable for young people.  We could look for limited discounts for the under 30s.  </p><p> Whatever actions are taken and whatever the rules of the game are, all our actions should be directed towards supporting the long-term objectives of universal health insurance which we, in VHI, clearly support.</p></speech>

I offer apologies on behalf of Dr. David Muiry who was here the last day but cannot attend today.  We are joined by super sub Mr. Christian Jaggy from Elips Insurance who is equally versed in the international scene.</p><p>  The last day we specifically wanted to get the consultation process on the health insurance Bill going.  Arising from the consultation that occurred before Christmas, some changes were made which proved the importance of consultation to us.  We did not get as many changes as we would have liked, but we must acknowledge there were changes and that it is imperative such consultation moves forward in the manner of co-operation among the industry and the entire market.  Laya Healthcare should be involved, as we have mentioned many times.  We are not involved in the universal health insurance implementation group which should integrated with the insurance market, as well as with the other parties.</p><p>  Our primary concern is the sustainability of the market.  This is not unlike the conversation we had the last day and we will not go over all of the points we made on universal health care and the arguments Mr. O'Dwyer made about effectiveness.  We naturally disagree with the figures he produced to show an effectiveness rating of 50%, as do others in the market.  Our position is that consumers must be able to afford cover.  In the main, what consumers can afford is not considered.  We must have an open and frank discussion on how long the building blocks can continue to rise.  We have the recession, the levy and stealth taxes being introduced in the form of public hospital bed designations.  On top of this, with young and healthy people leaving the market, there will be more claims because consumers are ageing.  All this means is the price spiral will commence again. </p><p>  There must be an incentive, a matter we discussed the last day, to get young and healthy people to stay in the market.  We agree that lifetime community rating is an important feature.  However, we have to incentivise people to enter the health insurance market and stay in it.  Very simply, if one joins at 25 years of age, one should maintain the rates for the rest of one's time in the market.  The same goes for somebody who joins at 55 years of age.  It is as simple as that.  Someone joining at 55 years of age is on the same rate, irrespective of the fact that he or she is heading down the road that is more high risk.</p><p>  In regard to the levy, the fundamental issue is, as I said, the building blocks, on which we are reaching a tipping point.  I have articulated in the slides presented that we are talking about a figure of<i> circa</i> &euro;60 million.  I am talking about our customers specifically; I am making it personal because our members are being asked to pay an additional &euro;60 million this year.  That is the net impact.  The age related tax relief and the levy mean a &euro;60 million increase for our members which represents a figure of <i>circa</i> 20% year-on-year.  </p><p>  In addition, I agree with having a health status or, as it is called, the hospital bed utilisation charge.  However, it is flawed in the manner in which it is being implemented.  This hospital bed utilisation charge could incentivise inefficiencies in that it is judged by the length of stay for a procedure.  Across the board, it is recognised as not being satisfactory and needs to be rectified quickly because it should be judged on what the status is, not by how long one stays in a hospital bed.  Those who least can afford health insurance, those on lower plans, and children pay and will continue to pay the same levy as those staying in hotel-like accommodation.  </p><p>  On the concept of having advanced and non-advanced products, although admirable, the definition has made it such that, for example, all Laya Healthcare plans which provide essential cover fall into the advanced bracket; therefore, there is no benefit whatsoever.  That has put us in a position where we are looking at a levy which was set on the basis that 15% of products would be non-advanced, while 85% would be advanced.  However, because of the way it has transpired, 100% are deemed to be advanced.  Therefore, it is our contention that the levy rate, as set, is incorrect and seriously flawed.</p><p>  There are some technicalities in regard to the levy which I have outlined on the slides, but there is time to rectify them.  Simply put, if I was to downgrade, as many of our members have done, in the same year because I could not afford my current plan, I would have to pay the levy again, given the way the legislation is drafted.  That is a mistake and should be rectified in the Finance Bill.  There are many nuances around it, corporates, etc., and we have suggested changes which would rectify it the position.  One should pay one levy per year, not two or three, or, as it is written, potentially four.  </p><p>  The biggest threat which has yet to be faced by our group or any other is posed by the proposed additional public hospital bed charge.  This is definitely the latest threat to affordability for our customers and will directly result in what we understand will be between a 20% and 40% increase.  This is the way it is set out.  It will build and add to the levy expenses being incurred, the effects of the recession, the cost of claims and everything we have mentioned.  It will be the straw that will break the camel's back.  It will put another 40% on top of what is in place.  The way it is articulated and the way I understand it is that in three years time &euro;250 million will have been added to the pot and it will be game over.</p><p>  What we are saying is the current market will become a fraction of its size, customer rates will go up, as I have highlighted, and the effect on the Exchequer will be the reverse of the expectation.  What will happen is that more people will move into the public system and that the revenues currently extracted from the private sector in the public system will be eroded.  As time passes, there will be a clear divide and we will end up being in a solely risk rated market.</p><p>  There is a price spiral which has not stopped since we last spoke.  Lifetime community rating or some equivalent needs to be put in place to ensure the young and healthy will be incentivised to stay in the market.  The levy is set too high, with the ratio set, but it can be adjusted.  We have to look at the additional implications for consumers of the Finance Bill, as drafted.  Risk equalisation, as set, needs to be fair and, while not particularly wanting to redraft everything, the levy needs to be a proportion of what it is now.  It needs to be based on a core set of standard benefits.  Those on lower plans and children are cross-subsidising those on the higher hotel-type plans.  That is the system as we see it.</p> <p>I genuinely believe we do not understand the impact of what is being said about public hospital bed designation.  I honestly think this is a game changer.  The system will break down if this happens in the manner proposed.</p></speech>

I apologise to the committee on behalf of our managing director, Ms Alison Burns, who could not be here today.</p><p>  The committee has asked us to address the topic of health insurance and related matters.  I will start by considering the health insurance levies, as other speakers have done.  I will then set out our views on key issues for the future of the health insurance market in Ireland.  Our views are probably shared by the other companies.  I will focus on the affordability of health insurance, the management of costs within the system and the proposal, as outlined in the budget, to increase substantially the charge for health insurance companies using public hospital beds.</p><p>  Aviva Health is committed to the introduction of a robust risk equalisation system to support the public policy objective of community rating and, more generally, inter-generational solidarity in the health insurance market.  The updated levy and credit system, as introduced in legislation passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012, is a further significant step in the development of a robust risk equalisation system.  The issue concerns the quantum.  The levies equate to a high proportion - more than 40% in some cases - of the overall insurance premiums of customers on entry level plans.</p><p>  There was some consultation with insurers about last year's legislation.  We actively participated in the consultation in a constructive manner.  While some of our concerns were taken on board, the updated system has a number of shortcomings.  An emerging issue is the categorisation of products available on the market as "non-advanced" or "advanced".  The Health Insurance Authority was asked to categorise each product according to the level of benefits provided in a private hospital.  If these benefits are in excess of 66%, the product is categorised as "advanced" and, therefore, subject to a higher levy.  Anything below that figure is considered "non-advanced" and subject to a lower levy.</p><p>  On 31 December last the Health Insurance Authority notified all health insurers about the categorisation of their products.  To our surprise, all of Aviva Health's products were classified as "advanced".  The primary reason for this is that outpatient diagnostic treatments in private hospitals are taken into account in arriving at the categorisation.  One of the consequences of this is that insurers, including Aviva Health, will have to reduce some benefits on entry level plans to ensure they are classified as non-advanced products and thereby attract a lower levy.  We will continue to work with the Department of Health, the Health Insurance Authority and our competitor insurers through the Health Insurance Consultative Forum to overcome the shortcomings inherent in the new system for the benefit of all consumers.</p><p>  When we made a presentation at this forum in October last year, we provided some numbers on the changing age profile of the industry membership between 2008 and 2011.  For the benefit of members, we have included these numbers again in Annex 1 of the documentation we have furnished to the committee.  The numbers are telling in so far as they show that the age profile of the insured population is rising and that younger people are opting out.  While no numbers have yet been published for 2012, we do not believe this pattern has changed.  As a result of the continued and increasing pressures on budgets in all Irish households, including escalating health insurance premiums, this trend is continuing in 2013.  All stakeholders, including insurers and the Department of Health, have a shared responsibility to make the market sustainable.  We cannot achieve sustainability if we do not have an appropriate regulatory environment, with all insurers subject to the same rules, or if we are unable to manage costs to make health insurance more affordable for everyone.</p><p>  Aviva Health recognises that in addition to the quantum of levies, the management of costs by insurers is key to affordability.  For health insurers, this means, individually and collectively, controlling administration and claims costs.  Administration costs should account for a relatively small proportion of overall costs.  The cost of claims is a bigger issue.  Aviva Health has introduced a number of cost control initiatives.  We engage in robust negotiations with all of our private providers, including consultants.  With the advice of our own medical council, we have developed protocols for medical treatments.  We encourage early intervention and treatment in the community.  We have made significant savings through our claims investigation unit which reviews and monitors the billings of providers.  These initiatives are a source of advantage to us.</p><p>  There are ways in which insurers can work together, with the support of the Department of Health, to manage claims costs and, therefore, maintain the sustainability of the market.  The development of industry standard clinical pathways would ensure quality health care was provided for customers in the most efficient manner.  For example, guidelines on the appropriate setting for treatments - inpatient, day patient or at home - should be agreed.  There should also be criteria for the payment of certain procedures and the appropriate length of stay if inpatient treatment is required.  If medical practitioners and the industry work together, they can ensure the treatments provided are usual, customary and reasonable.</p><p>  Under current rules, insurers are not permitted to negotiate with public hospitals.  This is a barrier to an efficient market and reduced premiums for all consumers.  Insurers should be able to negotiate contracts with public hospitals.  The proposed new public hospital group structure may facilitate this and it should be introduced as a matter of urgency.  The industry also needs to encourage the use of primary care as an alternative to hospitalisation.  This includes promoting and covering treatments in the home or in a primary care setting.  We should adopt payment reforms across the market, with the State and health insurers working together.  As part of this, we need to counter fraudulent claims.  None of these measures will yield dramatic and immediate savings, but they must be part of a long-term project to help to keep the market sustainable.</p><p>  We want to impress on the committee the implications of substantial increases in the charge for privately insured patients occupying a public bed.  This is a matter of the utmost concern for us, as it should be for all consumers and public representatives.  It is inevitable that any move to redesignate bed charges will drive up premiums substantially because insurers simply cannot bear the cost while remaining in business.  In fact, it could well have substantial implications for the sustainability of the market as a whole.  This proposal raises fundamental questions for the health insurance industry and the health system in general.  Why should patients who have private health insurance and pay their taxes lose their universal entitlement to public health care funded by the State?  How can we expect the industry to retain its customers in the light of the scale of price increases that would result from this change?  If the market shrinks as we predict it will, how will the State fund the increased demands on the public system?  Will the public finances be better or worse on a net basis after the increase?  As young and healthy people continue to leave the market, how can we expect those who remain to bear the ever-increasing burden of premiums and levies?</p><p>  Bed redesignation represents a major shift in health policy.  The questions I have asked must be answered before further steps are taken towards its implementation.  I thank the committee for giving us an opportunity to present our views on important matters that are defining the shape of the health insurance market in Ireland.  We look forward to participating in this discussion and answering questions.</p></speech>

I welcome the committee's decision to revisit this subject and hope it will persevere with this issue until we see the reform needed to ensure health insurance is affordable.</p><p>  The problem of not seeing the warning signs at an earlier stage has been identified as having contributed to the economic collapse of recent years.  Similarly, we are now seeing strong warning signs that the health insurance market which serves over 2 million customers is fast approaching tipping point, at which it will become unsustainable.  Every month growing numbers of health insurance customers are being forced to give up their cover and fall back on the public health system which is already over-burdened.  Critically, most of those who are leaving the market are younger and healthier citizens, the exact people we need to retain if we are to protect the viability of community rating.</p><p>  The position has been made worse by the mishandling of the establishment of a new levy scheme, with two tiers of levy.  This scheme is supposed to protect those customers on the lower level plans.  The Minister could not have been clearer when he spoke in the Oireachtas in November.  He said he would not make health insurance customers with lower levels of cover pay a higher levy.</p> <p>However, when the Bill was enacted in December, it transpired that none of the plans in the market qualified as a lower level plan.  On the basis of this decision alone, an individual paying &euro;500 for a lower level plan will now pay the same levy as someone who can afford to pay &euro;4,000 for a higher level plan.  This is inequitable and wrong.  The Department's response to this reneging on a commitment given in the Oireachtas is to shrug its collective shoulders and suggest, in the style of Marie Antoinette, that clarity has been provided and that customers will just have to pay more.  According to it, an insurer could tweak a few plans to bring them into the lower tier of levy.  Unfortunately, what it considers to be nothing more than tweaking will amount to the removal of significant benefits from those insured under lower level plans.  For example, where previously a health insurer would have paid the full cost of an MRI scan, customers will have to pay a significant proportion of this cost.  There are many other similar examples.  If insurers are forced to reduce benefits to move plans into a lower category, the value of such plans will be reduced and those who purchase them will correctly think again before renewing.  For this reason, one can expect many more people to drop out of the market, rather than accept a lower level of cover.</p><p> I challenge some of the points often made by those who defend the current regime.  Only yesterday the Minister stated the health insurance levy had no overall impact on costs in the market.  As the sole shareholder of VHI and sole beneficiary of the health insurance levy, he would say that.  Let us be honest, the levy is not cost neutral to the three insurers which are subsidising VHI.  By the end of next month the health insurance levy will have more than doubled to &euro;350 for an adult since it was introduced only four years ago.  In that period the cost of health insurance has spiralled and we do not need to look far to find the main driver of the price increases.  The Department of Health's plan, if unchecked, will result in a family of four paying &euro;940 in levy charges alone from the end of March.  Let us be honest in this respect also, the levy is a transfer from the customers of the commercial and regulated private health insurers to VHI.  By the Minister's own admission, the cost base of VHI remains unacceptably high, as many examples highlighted recently in the media have shown.  Where is the urgency or incentive for VHI to cut its costs and become more efficient when it has a ready-made subsidy available from its competitors? </p><p> It is also claimed that the increased cost of health insurance relates to the cost of new medical treatments.  I have been involved in the health insurance market for more than a decade and in my experience customers always want and deserve the latest innovations, best treatment and most modern procedures.  This desire on the part of customers has not developed in the past three years and is not the primary cause of price increases.  What has developed in recent years is a levy system that provides a very expensive prop for the protected and privileged position of the dominant player in the market.</p><p> I ask the committee to focus on one simple issue.  Younger, healthier policyholders are critical to ensuring the community rated market is sustainable.  Retaining and attracting these customers is the only protection that ensures health insurance remains affordable for everyone, but we are losing this battle.  The question to be addressed, therefore, is whether the health insurance levy is part of the problem or part of the solution.  I am convinced the evidence shows that it is a major part of the problem.  I urge the committee to continue its work on this topic by turning over stones and challenging those responsible who confidently state, "Problem?  What problem?"  They are either oblivious to or, even more worrying, do not care about the impact these costs have on consumers.  At a time when people are experiencing serious financial pressures, increasing a self-defeating tax subsidy is counter-productive and plainly wrong. </p><p> Before the affordability issue worsens at the end of March, I ask the committee to request that the Minister postpone the intended levy increase as it is simply not appropriate in the current economic environment.  The Department of Health must be forced to move from its current approach of protecting VHI from its competitors at all costs, regardless of the serious impact it has on consumers.  A priority must be for the Minister and the Department to focus on addressing internal efficiency in VHI, an issue raised by the Minister recently when he stated he was less than satisfied with the company's progress in addressing its cost base.  The saving to VHI from greater efficiency could be greater than the levy subsidy received from its competitors.  This matter must be addressed before any increase in the health insurance levy is considered.</p><p> As the timeframe to intervene is short, I urge the committee to engage immediately with a view to protecting all health insurance customers and ensuring the objective of universal health insurance remains achievable on the back of a viable health insurance market.  I thank the Chairman and members for their time.</p></speech>

The issue before us has been discussed for some time at this committee, in the D&aacute;il and general public discourse.  There is no point in pretending the health insurance industry is not in crisis.  Families are being put to the pin of their collar as they try to retain private health insurance.  I have opposed, sometimes as a lonely voice, certain Government policies on health insurance, including imposing a full cost charge for private patients in public beds.  This and other policies are escalating the price of health insurance.</p><p>  As the dominant player in the market and the company which sets the trends and impacts on the other health insurers and broader health insurance market, I will first put questions to VHI.  The Milliman review of VHI was not especially complimentary.  It noted, for example, inefficiencies in administration and other areas where VHI's cost base needs to be reduced.  I find disturbing the charges the health providers levy on health insurance companies.  The average length of stay for procedures is also a concern, particularly given advances in technology and medicine.  Surely average stays should be diminishing rapidly, but this does not appear to be the case.  I refer to a highly disturbing, if isolated case, which raises a fundamental issue.  It was highlighted in a report by Susan Mitchell in the <i>Sunday Business Post </i>of 17 February.  She noted that in the case of one Dublin man who had spent the night in a private hospital in Dublin for a procedure on his eye, VHI had paid more than &euro;4,300 for the hospital charge which did not include pathology test fees or the payment to the surgeon.  These were detailed separately and amounted to an additional &euro;1,400 on the bill seen by the newspaper.  I have no reason to question the integrity of the eminent journalist in question and assume, therefore, that her report is factual.  Moreover, I understand the report was not contradicted by VHI. </p><p>  I have doubts about the proposal to move to a universal health insurance model, although it appears to be supported by most of the delegates.  If we are to do so, VHI and the Minister for Health should be trying to create a dynamic health insurance market that is competitive, robust and expanding, as opposed to contracting.  If we are to move from a position in which the number of people with private health cover is declining and adopt a universal health insurance model, a large gap must be closed.  This can only be done in one of two ways, either by direct subvention by taxpayers for individuals who will have to take out universal health insurance or a massive increase in premium cover rates.  VHI has a major obligation to try to reduce costs, as does the Minister, given that the State is a major shareholder in the company.</p><p>  If memory serves, VHI has a workforce of approximately 900, a significant number of people.  Administration costs must be reduced and the company must also try to force down the charges levied by health providers.  It does not appear to take a robust or aggressive approach to driving down costs.  I am sure Mr. Dwyer will have a different view on the matter, but there appears to be some evidence to support my view, including the findings of the Milliman review and others that have observed VHI's interaction with health providers.  </p><p>  On the full cost charge for private patients in public beds, most people are entitled to universal health care by virtue of their citizenship and status as taxpayers.  If we continue to charge the full cost of private beds in public hospitals, we will further drive up the cost of private health care.</p> <p>We are going to force more people out of the market, as is evident, and more people into the public hospital system.  It is straightforward arithmetic.  We are heading into it without observing the impact it will have in the short and medium term in the rush to seek the Holy Grail of universal health insurance.  I do not believe the policymakers, the Minister and the Department have examined the issue in detail to see the crippling impact it will have on people who are already struggling and trying to fund private health insurance, which is a noble aspiration in the sense that they want to remove the burden on the State in providing their health care.  They are willing to pay for themselves and they are utterly overwhelmed by the increased charges that are a direct result of policy decisions, not marketplace decisions, in terms of charging private patients in public beds.  Clearly, that is an issue that has to be revisited very soon.</p><p> With regard to the advanced and the non-advanced policies, I had assumed there were 47 policies that had been pointed out as being non-advanced.  When we debated the issue in the House, it was highlighted as part of the legislation that non-advanced policies would not attract the higher levy rate.  We now find there is no non-advanced plan in the State.  Were the insurers pretending they were selling non-advanced plans all along, or was there a policy change at some stage between the legislation being published and the legislation being passed?  This is critical.  This is about fairness and supporting people who are at the threshold of having to let go of private health insurance because they cannot afford it.  This policy change will have a direct impact on people's ability to take out and retain private health insurance.</p><p> Mr. D&oacute;nal Clancy mentioned that there are no non-advanced plans available and there will have to be a redesignation at some stage and new plans put in place.  Is he saying that would subsidise the hotel-type plans?</p></speech>

A White Paper on universal health insurance is coming down the tracks.  In terms of broader discussion on the sustainability of the health insurance market <i>per se</i>, how much open discussion takes place with the health insurers on trying to bring about a platform for a sustainable health insurance model prior to the move to universal health insurance?  I am aware there was discussion in some areas on the advanced and non-advanced plans but that obviously fell flat in view of the published legislation.</p><p>  The incentivisation of younger people was debated at length at the committee and raised in the House on numerous occasions.  Nobody has yet told me how we can go about incentivising young people to take out and remain in health insurance.  Everybody says it is an aspiration and that it should be done to maintain and support health insurance and the viability of the market.  What is the best way to proceed within the confines of the policy under which insurers must operate with regard to risk equalisation, the levy and so on?  Is there a mechanism available to the insurers to attract young people into the insurance market or are their hands tied because of the policy decisions and the legislation under which they must work? </p><p>  In terms of the requirement to be regulated under the Central Bank, there is a large shortfall in the VHI's solvency funds.  From where is the funding expected to come?  Will it come through a direct subvention from the taxpayer, through increased premiums or through greater efficiencies?</p></speech>

We have a serious problem within the health insurance industry where 200 people per day are giving up on their health insurance.  If the new levy goes ahead, as currently structured, far more families will leave the health insurance system.  Most of my questions are for Mr. John O'Dwyer but I have some for the other insurers also.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.853" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100014#R01000"><p>I shall keep to questions.  In his presentation, Mr. John O'Dwyer said risk equalisation was about 55% effective whereas the Department of Health was recently quoted as saying it was about 70% to 80% effective.  Why is there a difference between his interpretation and that of the Department?  Who is right?  That has a significant impact on the overall cost of health insurance for families.  He also said in his evidence that he does not agree with the two levy approach.  Perhaps he would elaborate and explain why he does not agree with it.  The reason we as legislators introduced the two levy approach was to try to put a safety net in place for young families who are carrying massive mortgages and massive child care bills while their household income is reducing on an annual basis.  They cannot afford to stay in the system unless there is a two levy approach.</p><p>  May I ask each of the insurers the actual financial impact if the Government goes ahead with its plan to have the full hospital charge passed on to insurers?  What does that mean in real terms for families who are struggling?</p><p>  Mr. John O'Dwyer made the point at our last hearing and also in the media that the VHI would be more profitable if it lost customers, which is bizarre, but I know where he is coming from.   What efforts has the VHI made to encourage its members to take up equivalent policies with some of the other insurers?  The Health Insurance Authority has made the point that people over the age of 60 years are buying policies from the VHI when they could get better value for the same coverage with some of the other insurers.  Is any effort being made to encourage them to move to other insurers?  Mr. O'Dwyer has also said he does not agree with the splitting of VHI.  Given the huge age profile, would it not make sense to split VHI or hand over a cohort over the age of 60 to the other insurers to balance out the market?</p><p>  In recent years staff numbers have increased at a time when the number of policyholders has decreased by about 30%.  Will Mr. O'Dwyer please explain that?  The average salary within VHI is about &euro;52,000 while for other insurers it is about &euro;12,000 less.  Naturally, most are administration and call centre staff and I do not believe they are in receipt of that level of pay.  Who is getting that level of pay in VHI?  How many staff are on more than &euro;100,000, because the public who are paying the policies cannot afford to continue to pay at that rate?</p><p>  In respect of VHI accounts, it was pointed out recently that there is a liability of &euro;28 million for providing subsidised health insurance for life for staff recruited prior to 2002.  How many staff are involved?  Is it just staff members?  Are spouses covered?  Are children covered and, if so, up to what age?  Mr. O'Dwyer has made the point in his interviews that the VHI will continue to provide that cover as long as it can afford to do that.  Does he believe, given the cost of insurance, that the company can continue to afford to pay while young families foot the bill for that perk?  Between 2010 and 2011, the VHI has lost 3% of those over 60 years of age who had policies with the company.  What impact has that had on overall claims cost? </p> <p>Does that feed into the 5.6% figure relating to the reduction in claims costs or is it over and above it?</p><p> Turning to the issue of health status, as I stated when the legislation came before the House, I have huge concerns over the health status index as it is currently structured because it is based on bed occupancy.  It is bad to see that in legislation and I have massive concerns about it.  What efforts are being made within each insurer's organisation to ensure we can move as soon as possible from bed occupancy as an evaluation of health status?  What sort of timeline is envisaged on that?</p><p> Deputy Kelleher mentioned the Milliman report.  One of the issues highlighted in the report was length of stay.  Some of the figures on that may be out of date, but in some examples the report showed that the length of stay for procedures under the VHI is five times that of some efficiently operated systems elsewhere.  Where is the incentive for any insurer to try to get a person out of hospital as quickly as possible when it is written into law that the hospital will be paid more based on the length of stay of a patient in hospital?  For example, a middle-aged Aviva patient is currently in University Hospital Galway, costing the insurer between &euro;800 and &euro;1,000 per day.  That woman must remain in hospital for another three weeks because she is unable to get a piece of equipment which costs &euro;4,000 that would allow her go home in two days time.  The insurer, Aviva, has refused to pay the &euro;4,000 and is prepared to allow that patient remain in hospital for the next three weeks, at a net minimum cost of &euro;13,000.  I believe the legislation we passed in the House a few months ago incentivises this practice, and this is unacceptable.</p><p> Mr. Clancy made the point that if someone moves mid-year from one policy to another, that person will have to pay the levy a second time.  Will the other three insurers comment on whether that is also their understanding of the legislation?  He also made the point that people at the lower end of the market will end up subsidising gold-plated health policies at the upper end of the market.  I ask for the other insurers to comment on that also.  In my view, that is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to happen no matter what system we have in place.</p></speech>

Everybody is looking around for a better choice in all areas, and whether it is looking for a television package or an electricity supplier, people are shopping around.  People make a choice when they buy private insurance, and they buy it for a number of reasons.  Some of them have the money to buy in, but they also want a fast track to getting a procedure done or getting into hospital.  The fact that many young people have no jobs and many others have been left suffering huge mortgage stress has led to them reconsidering their priorities.  Many of them feel they would rather pay their mortgage than pay for health insurance.  I do not have private health insurance and would find it difficult to pay it because I would need to cover five people.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten already asked the question I was about to ask about the hospital charge and about passing it on.  I also have a question with regard to the number of staff employed by health insurance companies and the huge variation in wages between the wages of CEOs and ordinary pen pushers or those manning the phone lines.  Recently, I had to go into hospital for a day procedure.  However, a person I know who has private health insurance went in for the same procedure and was kept in for four days.  This was nothing to do with the person's health not being as good as mine but to do with costs.  This is an issue that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

That report identified &euro;25 million of savings that could be made.  However, it acknowledges that some of its analysis was flawed.  It used a different system of comparison than we did.  To set the record straight with regard to length of stay, the VHI is extremely efficient and I can provide significant evidence in that regard.  For example, in the past number of years, hip replacements have been reduced from 14 days to seven days.  Knee replacement stays have been halved in length and some 80% of all procedures carried out are on a day case basis.</p></speech>

The most recent OECD analysis on length of stay was conducted a few years ago.  It showed the average length of stay was over seven days, and ranged from four days in Mexico to 15 days in Japan.  Ireland came in at just over seven days and the VHI is 6.1 days.  Therefore, any comparisons, internationally or otherwise, on length of stay clearly stack up.  We are obsessed with ensuring people have their treatment carried out in the lowest setting.</p><p>  On cost, we negotiate a package price with the private hospitals, based on length of stay.  Therefore, it is the same price for a hip replacement whether the person is in for five or eight days and there is no incentive to keep people in a private hospital.  These kinds of remuneration arrangements are very acceptable internationally and drive down costs.  We do not have the same privilege of negotiation in public hospitals.  Where somebody stays in a public hospital, we do not have a package price and the patient's bill is on a per day basis.  We would welcome the facility to negotiate with public hospitals in the same way we negotiate with private hospitals.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.875" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Dwyer" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100016#T00100"><p>With regard to cost containment and length of stay, Milliman identified close to &euro;25 million, which we are actively working on, representing 2% of our overall claims costs.  However, the Milliman report also said that some of the cost savings the VHI has implemented have not been seen anywhere else in the world.  Sometimes we can be selective in our reporting of the issue.  The VHI is obsessed with driving down costs.  As I said to the Chairman, we are not perfect but in the last couple of years we have driven down costs by &euro;200 million.  Consultants' costs, for example, are back to 2004 levels.  Maybe they should be lower but to drive them down to 2004 rates is good progress.  We often talk about the average consultant cost but a couple of years ago, the average consultant was getting approximately &euro;83,000 from VHI.  Today, that is down to just over &euro;60,000.  These are clear examples for the Deputies of the VHI driving down its costs.  We have a clear programme over the next few years to drive down costs by a further &euro;100 million or more.  However, like some of our competitors here, we are scared by the implications of this potential cost in the public hospitals of &euro;250 million.  This is, as Mr D&oacute;nal Clancy has said, a game-changer and will really hurt our business going forward.</p><p>  I wish to address a few other issues.  Reference was made to our staff and our administration costs.  VHI administration costs are 6.3% and would stand up anywhere in the world.  We are in the top decile.  If I could put it in sporting terms, we are in the Champion's League regarding administration costs.  Am I saying there is no room for improvement?  No, I am not because there certainly is but the issue is not the administration costs but the claims costs in terms of keeping health insurance affordable.  This is where we need to focus.</p><p>  Regarding the question of salaries, in our core health insurance business our staff numbers have come down slightly.  We have tried to look after our customers as they expect and have introduced a new home care facility in recent years.  Where a customer has been in hospital, we can treat him or her at home with our own doctors and nurses.  We have recruited specialist medical personnel, who are not cheap, to make sure we can take people out of hospital and treat them in the comfort of their own homes.  We tick two boxes here.  We delight the customer and we also reduce our costs.  We also have SwiftCare clinics in a number of centres in Dublin and Cork.  We have also been innovative in recent years in setting up screening centres in Dublin and Cork.  The chronic illnesses of heart disease, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes are a real problem in our society and we have screened up to 13,000 customers, free of charge, for these conditions.  We are looking to be preventative in this regard by making sure people take the appropriate action to minimise potential future costs.  This is where the VHI makes its investments and this is what our customers want.  These are the sorts of initiatives that will keep our customers well and out of hospital.</p><p>  On the question of young people, we believe there must be a system of lifetime community rating.  We cannot continue with a situation where a 30 year old and a 55 year old joining at the same time are treated in the same way.  We have inter-generational solidarity.  The rules of the game have been set, not by the VHI, but by society, and it has been decided that community rating is the way forward.  We do not have risk rating as is the case in motor and home insurance.  I have worked in countries where risk rating operates and when people get sick they are risk rated again and their premiums become so exorbitant that they cannot afford health insurance any longer.  We have decided in Ireland to apply different rules and that is why we have a risk-sharing system.  I do not mind, from a competitive point of view, if the legislators decide to create a risk-rated market - so be it - but as a taxpayer I believe the Government has made the correct decision because we need to protect all of the people in our society.  The way to do this is to have a community rating and risk-sharing mechanism.  I am not saying that either is perfect and I mentioned a number of problem areas in my presentation.  Deputy Naughten mentioned the issue of health status and I fully concur with his comments.  However, I am extremely pleased that the concept is introduced because it is standard in other countries where a risk-sharing mechanism is in place.  We have discussed this with all of the insurers and there is consensus that this has to change.  However, let us take the positive out of this.  For the first time, health status is legislated for and we believe there is much room for improvement in this particular area.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher asked about solvency and the VHI currently meets the minimum solvency requirement.  To get authorised, we will need more capital and we are looking at every possible avenue for securing that, in particular from reinsurance.  We are exploring all options.</p></speech>

We would be in agreement with much of what he said but on the issue of efficiencies, the VHI is the market maker and the main game player, whether we like it or not.  The Milliman group came in and produced its report, which must be taken at face value.  If it needs to be rebutted publicly, in terms of certain details, let us do that.  I would also point out that at Laya Healthcare, we provide 100% cover for essential care, including orthopaedics.  If we were to reduce that to 80%, I am sure we would have a big reduction in our claims too.  However, this must be about providing value for our customers.  If a person goes into hospital and is told that he or she has to pay 20% or 30% of the cost of the procedure, or in the case of non-advanced products, 34% of the cost, that can be an exorbitant amount in many cases.  If we were to introduce a policy of reducing the cover that we give, I am sure we would also generate additional savings.</p><p>  Like VHI, we believe that community rating is a good policy.  I have worked in other health insurance markets and would totally support the idea of community rating.  I also believe that Ireland should be proud of the way it has introduced community rating across the board.  I agree that lifetime cover needs to be introduced and believe that risk rating needs to take place on a standard product, and this comes back to Deputy Naughten's point about gold plating.  There is a fundamental social issue at play right now whereby we have people who are barely hanging on by their fingertips subsidising those who can afford hotel-type accommodation in the best facilities in the country.  There is a difference between providing essential cover that is equal and done on a standard basis and providing additional cover for services for those who want and can afford them.  It should not be done-----</p></speech>

What would he change in that regard?</p></speech>

After that, if a person wants additional services, they can be risk-rated and the customer must pay for them.  That can differ from facility to facility or by geography.  A person may want cover for a particularly active life, for travel abroad and so forth, while another person may never move outside the parish.  These are all elements that can be added in, but fundamentally, the core standard set of benefits should provide the essential cover that a person needs as a citizen and must be community-rated across the board.  If we are going to arrive at a meaningful universal health insurance system, we must have this in place.  We must be in a position to say there is a standard product, that is where the future lies and the entire market will operate on that basis and that is the basis on which subsidies in the fund should cross over.  We must protect the elderly and the sick but we must do so on an equalised basis on a standard product, and not on the range of products that are available right now.  As Mr. Dowdall pointed out, there are people who are barely hanging on and who will be paying &euro;350 from 1 April, compared with &euro;150 only two or three years ago.  That is a substantial difference.  At the same time, there are people on the high-value options, paying between &euro;3,000 and &euro;4,000 for cover.  While we welcome such customers because they are going into the pool, they are paying the same levy as everyone else.</p> <p>The subsidisation across those products, even within our plans, is the same as it is throughout the market.  It is simply not right.  It is an inequity and it should not be there.  The roadmap of the future of universal health care and reaching the needs of everyone is set out and this gives us a good option of having a standard core set of benefits.</p><p> Reference was made to the levy as it is set now and the way it has jumped.  The intention was to have an advanced and a non-advanced level, as Deputy Kelleher suggested, with apportioning of the products.  Unfortunately, it is set at a level which deems no one to be in that category and no one will qualify either because no one can afford 66% coverage of private facilities.  With the majority of operations, the average person will be stretched to cover the balance of 34%.  That is a fundamental issue.  The point has been highlighted here already but private cover in a public hospital at the moment is &euro;1,046, semi-private cover is &euro;933 and day-case cover is &euro;753.  We can discuss efficiencies and so on but many procedures are carried out in the wrong settings in public hospitals.  People are being charged for day-case procedures - that is, &euro;753 for procedures that take place in public hospitals - but such procedures should be carried out not in a consultant's surgery but in a general practitioner surgery.</p></speech>

I have referred already to a standard core set of benefits.  The solution is not to incentivise the hospitals and doctors to impose additional costs on the public side without providing any additional service.  There are cases of people who come in through accident and emergency departments with a burst appendix.  As it stands, such people have a right under universal care to be covered but such people will end up being charged for beds for no additional service.</p></speech>

When the legislation was passed in December I do not imagine any of the health insurers were especially pleased or held that it was altogether what they wanted.  This speaks to the fact that it is less than optimal in terms of what has come out or how it has been applied.  On that basis there needs to be ongoing consultation and that is a matter for the players in this room.</p></speech>

We will not comment on the specific issue but we will follow it up.  Our general practice is to try to minimise our claim costs and therefore we will work to ensure that in general claim costs are minimised and lengths of stay are reduced.</p><p>  The core issue or one of the substantial issues coming down the line is public bed re-designation.  That is probably the most fundamental issue on the horizon.  The implications need to be understood.</p></speech>

These are above all the questions that we need to focus on.  We need to maintain that focus in future because there are serious issues in the health insurance industry at the moment that are significantly affecting all health insurance consumers and, by extension, people who depend on the public health system.  We see a significant number of people falling out of the health insurance market and into an overburdened public health system.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten specifically asked about the hospital bed utilisation charge and what efforts are being made to move away from it.  GloHealth had full cover for day case procedures and treatment in our plans.  The irony is that under the new health insurance levy there are two tiers and we can no longer provide full cover for day-case procedures on the lower tier.  We have to strip it back to 66%.  Let us consider the type of people who are forced to buy lower level plans: they are people who cannot afford a higher level of cover.  Therefore, we are penalising those people more.  They will have a lower level of cover and a significant shortfall in the cost of procedures that are being carried out.  We should find a way to encourage and facilitate insurers to provide full day-case cover on lower level plans.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten asked about the gold-plated subsidy and whether it was the case that people on lower level plans were subsidising people on higher level plans.  That is absolutely the case.  Let us consider the numbers.  From the end of March people on lower level plans will pay 53% of the cost of health insurance towards the scale of the levy.  That is vast and absolutely not acceptable.  Their costs are going up by 10% at the end of March simply to facilitate the increase in the health insurance levy.  The Minister could change this.  This relates to the 330,000 people referred to by the Department and the Minister who are on lower level plans.  This could be corrected and the scale of increase does not need to be passed through to them.</p><p>  There was some debate about the costs from health insurers and their ability to negotiate on costs.  Some 40% of the premium cost of a typical health insurance plan is now due to the health insurance levy, and up to 40% of our claims typically relate to the public health system.  We have no ability to negotiate in either of these areas.  We have no ability to intervene or negotiate on the most significant part of the costs health insurers pick up, and that needs to change.</p><p>  With regard to some of the comments of our colleagues in the VHI and other insurers, I agree absolutely that the model needs to change.  Deputy Kelleher made some remarks in this regard as well.  He asked about discussions with the Department and broader discussions, and asked how open the conversations are.  My view is that there is a need to develop this area and make it more meaningful.  For example, GloHealth asked at the most recent health insurance forum meeting for a detailed analysis to be carried out on the affordability challenge.  What will happen to the market when the increased charges come through for the levy and the public hospital costs?  This call was supported by all the other insurers, but unfortunately the Health Insurance Authority did not agree that the analysis needed to be carried out.</p></speech>

The view was simply that it is generally linked to unemployment levels.  It is not that simple.  There is absolutely vast pressure on the consumer purse today and we need to examine price elasticity and the implications of these increased charges coming through.  We also need to consider the implications of devaluing the health insurance product.  If someone paying for private health insurance is in the public health system in a public bed next to someone who is not paying anything, it will devalue the proposition provided by health insurers.  Unfortunately, we got no acceptance that there was a need to do this analysis.</p></speech>

We have made that point on numerous occasions.  I think there is a disconnect between the understanding of the HIA and the Department of Health with regard to the serious implications for consumers of private health insurance and the affordability crisis that each of the insurers has referred to today.  I believe there is a necessity for the analysis to be done as a matter of urgency.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher raised another question about incentivising young people to come into the market.</p> <p>We discussed this at the previous committee meeting.  There has been discussion for ten years about lifetime community rating as a trigger to encourage younger people to come into the market.  A sub-group of the consultation forum on health insurance will examine this issue.  I think there is a necessity to impose a deadline on the Department of Health to complete this study within six months and to devise an implementation plan.  This would result in a positive injection into the market.  My concern is that this will drag on for another ten years before any progress or momentum is achieved.  </p><p> When it comes to encouraging young people to come into the market, GloHealth does not charge for children under three years of age.  We want to encourage younger families to either remain in the market or enter the market.  That group is the critical requirement in order to maintain a community-rated environment.</p></speech>

Is is considered to be in breach in the principle of community rating to charge a differential rate based on whether a person currently smokes?  It strikes me that it should not be, in the sense that everyone has the right at every age to be a smoker or a non-smoker so there is no breach of community rating in doing that.  It would be a very powerful incentive to people to stop smoking and in the interests of equity it would be a much fairer policy.  It can be argued that people cannot instantly choose to be obese or not obese because it requires a bit of work; nor can one choose to be young or old, or to have the right or wrong gene pool.  However, one can choose whether to smoke or to be a non-smoker.  That should be admissible, in my view.</p><p>  I sometimes pinch myself when I hear the conversations about moving to a money-follows-the-patient model and universal health insurance.  I do not think people understand what is involved.  This is a colossal and vast change.  I suspect the smart people in the insurance companies, especially those with international affiliates, will be able to tap into expertise from other places where this kind of model works.  In the view of the witnesses, do the skill sets exist on the other side of the table?  Do the hospitals, the Department of Health and the HSE - if it continues to exist - actually have the skills to be able to deal with a very different funding environment?  I do not think they do.</p></speech>

I am concerned that day procedures are carried out at huge expense because public beds are being used mainly by private patients at a cost to the individual patient.  Why is this the case?  Why are people being treated in inappropriate places?  Is it a question of culture or the practice among doctors?  Is it what people want?  All the evidence shows that the more we can look after people in the community and nearer to their homes, the better their rehabilitation and their outcomes.  This has been the finding of many studies.  I am interested to know what the problem is and what can we do to address it.</p></speech>

The <i>per diem</i> charge in public hospitals is a major concern.  In my view the grouping of hospitals would provide an incentive to ensure that the <i>per diem</i> charge remains forevermore.  We should be under no illusions; it is a money-generating measure.  The policy decision is not based on anything more than its being a method of raising funds to subsidise the hole in the public purse.  Until such time as we accept that this is a fact of life and deal with it, we will be talking in circles.</p><p>  Intergenerational solidarity - the young subsidising the old and the healthy subsidising the sick - is a policy decision which society has accepted.  However, we never bought into the concept that poor, struggling families should subsidise rich, well-funded Rolls Royce premiums.  This committee needs to deal with that issue.  The Health Insurance Authority must also be aware of this fact.</p></speech>

We were led to believe during the Second Stage debate that the high levy rate would not be applied but it is clear that this has not happened.  It will have a significant impact on people who cannot afford health insurance and it will have a positive impact on very affluent people who can afford the best insurance policy.  The situation is wrong.</p><p>  What is the state of play in the private health sector with regard to <i>per diem</i> charges? If the public hospitals are charging a <i>per diem</i> rate for orthopaedic procedures, for example, is there an alternative available in the private health system?  If so, why are the health insurers not taking advantage of that facility to reduce costs, as opposed to paying the <i>per diem</i> rate in the public hospitals?</p></speech>

I asked Mr. O'Dwyer about risk equalisation.  He states it is 55% effective, but the Department of Health states it is up to 80% effective.  I asked about the &euro;28 million liability for subsidised lifetime health insurance for staff and their spouses and children.  I refer to the point made by Mr. Clancy in his initial contribution that if a person changes insurance companies mid-stream he or she will be required to pay the levy twice.  Is this the other insurers' understanding of the legislative provisions?</p></speech>

We have made our views known.  Other views are that it is about 67% or 68% effective.  For example, in the minimum benefits as set down in legislation for the past 15 or 16 years - I cannot remember the exact figure - there is an allowance of approximately &euro;500 for a private hospital, where the charge is &euro;750.  Therefore, if one applies risk equalisation to the minimum benefits, it is in the region of 60%.  We see all the costs, because clearly it is a cost.  We will always have scenarios that need to be set out.  We just have a different view of how the market will be over the next 12 months; there will always be slight differences in it.  Risk equalisation is one of the key reasons.</p><p>  On the question about the &euro;28 million liability, up to 11 or 12 years ago, VHI had an arrangement that if staff worked their full 40 years their health insurance and that of their spouse was paid for.</p> <p>That was removed 11 years ago.  Even the commitment to the effect that "we will only give it where we can afford it" was recently removed.  That has been removed.  The VHI has taken many actions to reduce its costs and its administrative cost base, and that was one of them.  However, we have also stopped paying increments.  I am aware that this matter has been discussed in places quite near to where we now sit but the VHI stopped paying increments a couple of years ago.  We have also increased the pension contributions which people make.  We have taken many initiatives, including that which relates to the health insurance element.</p></speech>

My understanding is that we cannot in any way risk rate smoking.  According to the current rules, that would be illegal.  I am mildly asthmatic, so I do not like smoking.  If it were capable of being implemented, I could not see it causing too much harm.  It is difficult to implement.  Conceptually, it is good but implementation is difficult.  In life assurance, most people can be called for a medical examination.  In health insurance, we do not have that cost.  One wonders, therefore, which would be good.  Conceptually, I fully agree with the Senator.</p><p>  Senator Colm Burke referred to lengths of stay.  In the context of Ireland's level of efficiency, an international report compiled a number of years ago showed that this country was lower than average in the context of lengths of stay.  Lengths of stay for VHI customers are, on average, six days.  In private hospitals, the length of stay is five days.  In public hospitals, it is just over seven days.  The Senator inquired as to which model is more cost-effective.  There are <i>per diem</i> rates in respect of private patients in public hospitals.  If a person who has had a hip replacement is released from a public hospital within a few days, it can, in comparison to the position with a private hospital, benefit the insurer.  We do not have any negotiating power in the context of certainty.  As stated earlier, we have a fixed-price package in respect of private hospitals.  We pay a certain amount of money and it is clear there is no confusion.  In the context of public hospitals, we do not enjoy that certainty.</p></speech>

Has an analysis ever been carried out in respect of, for example, 100 cases dealt with in private hospitals and 100 dealt with in public hospitals in the context of which worked out cheaper and the percentage difference involved?</p></speech>

Quite often, this would make the procedure as expensive as that carried out in a public hospital.  In public hospitals, one pays a flat charge and one does not pay for the prosthesis.  It is much cheaper to have a procedure which does not involve a prosthesis in a private hospital.  There is no definitive answer in this regard.  It depends on the procedure involved and the additional costs that will be incurred.  As a result of the fact that we pay package procedure prices in private hospitals, one generally finds that turnaround tends to be faster, admissions tend to be quicker, they ensure the correct person is being treated and so on.</p><p>  We have more influence in respect of the settings.  This goes back to Deputy Conway's question with regard to impediments to making things happen.  In the private system, because we have a contract, we can explicitly state that we will only pay for a particular procedure if it happens on a side room basis.  If it is done on a day care or inpatient basis, we will only pay the side room rate regardless.  That is not the position when it comes to public hospitals.  We would, however, absolutely like it to be the position.  I suspect that once the contracts to which I refer are put in place, insurers gain influence and can drive behaviours in private hospitals.  If we could do the same in public hospitals, we would also be able to drive behaviours there and not just to be benefit of ourselves but also to that of the public hospital system.</p></speech>

It is not allowed to be included in the various risk factors at present and it would be very constructive if it were included.  I agree with Mr. O'Dwyer that there might be implementation issues but we could work around those.</p><p>  Public versus private is a difficult ask.  I concur with much of what Mr. Moran said.  Unfortunately, on the public side we are not in a position where we can outline how the protocols should be followed.  It is true to say that if one has a particular illness involved or if one wants to obtain the best outcome in respect of a critical or chronic case, then a public hospital is the place one wants to be.  There is a balance in this regard.  However, there is an adverse incentive here.  Incentive drives behaviour and much of what we are discussing here comes down to incentive.  It has been clearly articulated to us on many occasions that certain hospitals perform certain procedures in a particular way.  Much of this is due to the way the market behaves, both in the hospitals and among the insurers.  We accept this and we should not do so, particularly when it comes to our members paying, as I have already indicated, for procedures on a day case basis when such procedures should only be performed in a consultant's surgery.  Much of it comes down to convenience and habit but most of it is as a result of the fact that the incentive is there to do it.  We have to pay the &euro;700 or whatever is the amount.</p></speech>

Consultants receive the same amount of money regardless of whether they perform the procedures in their surgeries or in their rooms.  The hospital obtains the additional benefit of the day case rate.  In some cases it results from the fact that a surgeon will have his rooms in the hospital out of which he normally operates.  In such circumstances, he or she will state that the charge applies because he or she is obtaining consumables from the hospital involved.  I do not believe this is correct and we do challenge it.  In some instances, people have put their hands up in respect of this matter.  However, there are particular institutions which state that if we do not facilitate their particular way of operating, they will not do business with us.  That is extremely difficult for insurers to deal with, particularly if they are not game players.  Progress is being made but it remains a problem.  Perhaps Mr. Jaggy might provide examples of what happens elsewhere in the context of the public-private mix.</p></speech>

With regard to the problem Mr. Clancy mentioned, in Switzerland consultants can use operating theatres in hospitals.  They then receive a lump sum payment and half of this must be paid to the hospital which provided the facility.  What happens in Switzerland could be used to provide the type of incentives to which Mr. Clancy referred.  From what I have heard at this meeting, it seems that in Ireland there is a cultural achievement of private medical insurance.  That is something which the population of Ireland wants.  Price increases have been triggered by certain stakeholders in the market here and this has had consequences for health insurers.</p> <p>They need to increase the price, thereby destroying their currently healthy age structure.  One is really in a fragile set of circumstances if one imposes additional charges by means of the levy approach or by way of the public hospital bed.  That is just the short-term view.</p><p> With regard to the mid-term view, one should consider having a core set of benefits allowing for risk equalisation.  That is in place in Switzerland.  There could also be additional cover, perhaps based more on private insurance.  This has also been implemented in Switzerland, leading every year to a price increase of 4% to 7%.  One does not achieve the perfect position with that system either but one has a certain control.</p><p> The members know all the answers to the questions I have heard but I do not know whether they have the data required for analysis.  Information is supplied by the hospitals to the insurers on a manual basis.  Therefore, one does not get the codes of diagnosis or the treatment.  Therefore, how can one have a benchmark to know which hospital is providing the service in the most cost-effective way?  If this information is not obtained, one should implement control measures in order to measure who is providing the service in the best way, thereby putting economic incentives in place.  That is my perspective on what I observe internationally.  Those present know all the answers at the table and that is why I would also wish to have the insurers in consultation.</p></speech>

There may be a flaw in suggesting the price is a ten-year-old or 15-year-old price.  This is arrived at &ndash; people better than me can say this &ndash; by examining equalised benefit.  Basically, there is a set of procedures, be they right or wrong, in respect of which equalisation must occur.  Fundamentally, one needs a standard product that everybody around the table is moving towards.  It is on that basis that we establish the effectiveness, or otherwise.</p></speech>

I gave an example in our presentation of where a company is &euro;1,000 better off if it has a 35-year-old on its books as opposed to a person in the older age cohort to which I referred.  When the incentive in this regard does not exist, we will stop talking about effectiveness.  However, we must not allow that huge gap to continue to exist.  That is our issue.</p></speech>

The issue Deputy Naughten raised on the Finance Bill has emerged in recent days.  We have already started talking to the Department about it.  I subscribe very much to what Mr. Clancy said.  It is one of the unforeseen consequences of moving and the changes we made.  I urge the members of the committee to examine this carefully as the Finance Bill moves through the Oireachtas.  We have been engaging with the Department on it.  We will need to continue doing so.  It is a technical change but it will have quite significant implications.</p><p>  With regard to the advanced and non-advanced plans, there is obviously much discussion.  Having a standard plan, which we proposed originally, could largely get around the problem.  The difficulty in wanting to have an advanced-plan and non-advanced plan structure is that it involves a move to making choices and to choices having to be made.  Obviously, the interpretation of the legislation was regrettable from our side in terms of the advanced aspect.  It raises issues associated with the procedure in respect of lower-level plans.  We have been considering moving to a standard plan.  We would advocate it.</p><p>  Let me address a couple of points that Senator Crown raised.  His first question was a quick one but it raised quite profound issues over incentives we want to build into the system.  Having the stopping of smoking as a public policy objective needs to be considered carefully.  We have tools within the regulations to create incentives, and the incentive in question is a good one that we may want to act upon.  I would certainly be keen on examining the modification of community rating to allow for it.</p><p>  There is a range of issues associated with universal health insurance.  The process will be very complicated.  I have worked in a number of countries and noted they all have quite serious issues with the implementation of universal health insurance.  Many of the issues we have addressed today will need to be solved in some way in terms of bringing in effective universal health insurance.  They will need to be considered.</p><p>  The experiences of the VHI regarding public and private beds are similar.  This raises the issue of the inability of insurers to negotiate contracts with public facilities.  It hampers their ability to create the right incentives in connection with shorter lengths of stay, trying to discharge patients earlier and getting people into day-care services, etc.  The ability of insurers to negotiate contracts individually, perhaps as part of the new groups, would be an important and significant step in that regard.</p></speech>

I will just pick up on a couple of specific ones.  Mr. D&oacute;nal Clancy referred to an additional levy if someone downgrades.  Deputy Naughten's point in this regard is correct.</p><p>  Let me pick up on a couple of Senator Crown's questions.  I totally agree with all the insurers that there should be an opportunity for us to encourage people to adopt healthy lifestyles.  That is not facilitated at present.  It would be in breach of regulation if we in any way tried to do so.  Again, that is an example.  There are opportunities to do what is proposed.  With the Department of Health, we should be tasked to produce implementation programmes in this area.</p><p>  Senator Crown asked about money following the patient and the significant challenge this presents.  I completely agree with him in this regard.  Our experience of implementing considerable reform in the Department is not one from which we can take great comfort.  This will be a very significant challenge.</p><p>  Universal health insurance has been targeted for 2016.  The scale of the challenge is quite significant.  If we examine the recent levy scheme that was amended, we will note it failed and was a mistake.  What was committed to in November and what transpired in December and January was wrong.  If we get the first step wrong, we must question our confidence in getting it right as we move forward.</p><p>  Let me address a couple of points made by Deputy Kelleher.  If I understood him correctly, he referred to the Rolls-Royce subsidy in respect of the move from non-advanced to advanced plans.  He is absolutely correct.  There is a significant subsidy going from those people who can least afford health insurance to those people who can afford it.  That is an error; it is not what was intended.</p><p>  The Department of Health or Health Insurance Authority will tell one that insurers can just introduce more plans that can be non-advanced.  What they may not state is the fact that one must strip benefits from the new plans being implemented.  It is a question of stripping benefits from plans that people can least afford, which is absolutely wrong.  Insurers may tell one it is difficult, as with lifetime community rating or measures on some sorts of smoking activities.  Everything is difficult; we just need to be determined to make what we desire happen.  We can do that.</p><p>  Let me pick up on what our colleague from the VHI, Mr. John O'Dwyer, said.  I understand from his presentation that the VHI would prefer not to have two tiers of levy.  That is understandable because the VHI benefits from having everybody on a higher levy as it results in very significant increases in the associated age-related tax credit.  This has to be about more than the VHI.  That may be the reason the Department of Health has implemented the change in question and why the legislation is not as originally intended.  We need to call that because hundreds of thousands of health insurance customers will suffer at the end of next March because we have implemented a measure that was not intended, the beneficiary of which will be the VHI.</p></speech>

We had a very busy morning in the holding of our hearings and I again thank them for their patience and apologise for delaying them.  I welcome to the meeting officials from the Department of Health, Dr. Fergal Lynch, Mr. Dermot Ryan, Ms Roisin Cahillane and Mr. Eddie O'Reilly.  I also welcome to the meeting Mr. Liam Sloyan and Mr. Jim Joyce, chairman, of the Health Insurance Authority.  Before we commence, I remind witnesses they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and rulings of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

One of the first major issues raised this morning has been in respect of advanced and non-advanced levels of cover, as well as concerns regarding both the existence of advanced versus non-advanced levels of cover and how it is being introduced, the number of plans that will arise and so on.  It may be helpful were I to provide a little bit of background to this.  In operating the scheme, we are very concerned to ensure that those who buy the most basic plans with lower levels of cover do not effectively subsidise customers who decide to buy plans that offer higher levels of benefit.  A disadvantage of retaining a single level of stamp duty is that those on the lower plans would have paid a disproportionate amount of their premium in stamp duty relative to those on higher plans.  I am anxious to answer in particular the concerns raised earlier by Deputies Kelleher and Naughten regarding a subsidy in the opposite direction or in other words, from lower value to higher value.  In fact, the intention is the opposite, that is, to ensure that the subsidy travels in the opposite direction.  The last thing we would want is a subsidy going in the wrong direction.  This is the very reason we proposed this year introducing an advanced and non-advanced plan.  I think it is important to make this point and I can go into further detail on it later on if that is of assistance.</p><p>  As I stated, this split was introduced for this very purpose.  As for concerns about subsidisation in the wrong direction, I can make a number of points.  First, in examining this scheme the European Commission has been very concerned to make sure we do not overcompensate anyone, including a particular insurer, and that we are not unfair to different groups.  There is an approach in risk equalisation called top-slicing, which my colleague Mr. Sloyan in the Health Insurance Authority will be able to explain perhaps more clearly than will I.  Essentially, however, it means we do not use risk equalisation to attempt to subsidise absolutely everyone right across the board.  We take a view on how high or to what level of subsidies this should extend.  There already are specific examples in the market, particularly in respect of the VHI, which would itself state that its high cost plans, such as what used to be called plan E and plan D, are pitched at a rate that subsidises the lower level plan.  Consequently, I am anxious the joint committee would be clear that there is no intention, and as far as I am aware no actuality, of the subsidy travelling in the wrong direction.</p><p>  The second area that it may be helpful for me to cover pertains to the hospital bed utilisation charge.  Deputy Naughten in particular was concerned about introducing a negative incentive for insurers to find it more financially attractive to take people for a longer period of time.  We absolutely agree this is the wrong thing to do and that is the reason, when introducing the H-book as we call it, that is, the hospital bed utilisation credit, we pitched it at a very low level indeed.  It simply is &euro;75 per day, which would not meet anywhere near the full cost of treating a patient.  Therefore, we do not believe that a charge pitched at such a level creates the sort of incentive raised by Deputies Naughten and Kelleher.  However, our ultimate intention is to move to a much more sophisticated version of taking account of different elements of risk.  Specifically, we would like to take account of different forms of health status, such as chronic diseases.  We think this would be a far more appropriate measure than a &euro;75 payments in respect of the hospital bed utilisation charge.  That was simply a starting point and it is important to emphasise that.</p><p>  A number of members, as well as the insurers themselves, referred to the standard plan and the importance of a standard plan in the Irish market.  We absolutely agree and not only did we agree but it is fair to say the Department led on this issue, in terms of driving the initiative to try to put this in place because the consultative forum on health insurance will be meeting in a sub-committee form as early as next week to start the work on this matter.  I believe the Department made the first suggestion that this would be put in place.  We entirely agree with the insurers that it would be much more appropriate to risk equalise with respect to an agreed standard plan than to attempt to risk equalise right across the board.  We are working on this and I wish to put on record my thanks to the consultative forum for its assistance in this matter and in other matters, specifically the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012.  It was of significant assistance in helping both the Department and the Oireachtas to develop that legislation.  Certainly, we intend to move in that direction in respect of the standard plan as soon as we can.</p><p>  A number of members and a number of the insurers also spoke about the lifetime community rating and the case for it.  Again, we certainly are very open to that, obviously subject to the Minister's final decision.  We are conscious, however, that as we move to universal health insurance, where insurance will be compulsory, the issue of lifetime community rating will no longer arise.  Lifetime community rating effectively arises only in circumstances in which one has a choice as to whether one joins health insurance.  If everyone is insured, one then does not need lifetime community rating.  I would however observe that we are open to the argument that at the very least, it would send a certain signal in advance of universal health insurance.  We are very open to considering this and it is another element the consultative forum will examine in the coming weeks.  Consequently, we would hope to be able to make recommendations to the Minister in that regard.  As I stated, the ultimate pathway is towards universal health insurance where one then would not need a lifetime community rating approach of that kind.</p><p>  A number of members and the insurers raised concerns about the <i>per diem </i>charge in public hospitals and the reason insurers cannot be allowed to negotiate on that basis.  At present, that is the current scheme and is the manner in which the funding of hospital services is in part organised.  No one would regard this as being ideal.  We are particularly conscious, for example, that we do not take account in this charge of the difference between complex and less complex cases.  The payment is the same for a particular type of hospital, be it a regional hospital or a county hospital, as they used to be called, and so on.  That is not the ideal situation.  Last week, we published proposals in respect of money following the patient, which essentially are based on moving to a case-based charge.  In other words, charges would then be based not on a <i>per diem</i> or daily charge but specifically by reference to the type of treatment and procedure being given and the case being treated overall and therefore, charges could be differentiated as a result of that.  Our intention is to start with public patients in public hospitals and then to move to private patients in public hospitals.  I stress that all of this should be in place before universal health insurance.  Consequently, the Department is committed, and more importantly, the Minister is committed to moving to this type of approach and away from a <i>per diem</i> charge.</p><p>  As for the effectiveness of the risk equalisation scheme, a number of Deputies and a number of the insurers raised concerns about this.  There is no perfect way to calculate the precise effectiveness of a risk equalisation scheme and certainly, there has been a deal of publicity about our view of how effective is the risk equalisation scheme relative to the VHI.  The simple explanation is that it is based on widely differing assumptions used by the VHI relative to the Department.  For example, we use costs based across the entire market, whereas the VHI uses its own costs.</p> <p>VHI used more pessimistic assumptions than we would have regarded as reasonable.  We are working with VHI to get a better understanding of the differences between our respective calculations because there is no mathematically perfect formula and it is possible for us to move closer together.  The proof of the pudding will be in the eating and the extent of transfers from the risk equalisation fund to VHI and other insurers will become clearer overtime.</p><p> Risk equalisation is a market measure and is not specifically designed for VHI.  There is a perception that it is specifically aimed at assisting VHI because it has older customers.  VHI is a net beneficiary at the moment because it happens to have older customers but if in future years another insurer has a preponderance of older customers it in turn will become a beneficiary.  It is unfortunate that comments were made that implied the Department has a particular wish to protect VHI.  The Department is concerned with the sustainability of the private health insurance industry as a whole.  We have no concern or wish to support one health insurer over another and we are scrupulously honest and fair in our dealings with all insurers.</p><p> In regard to universal health insurance, a number of insurers pointed out that they are not represented on the universal health insurance implementation group, which I chair.  When the Minister established the group he decided to appoint individuals on the basis of their expertise in specific areas.  It is true to say that the group includes people with backgrounds in and an understanding of health insurance.  The Minister is open to looking at the membership of the group over time and he has made this clear from the very beginning.  In my view, however, the consultative forum on health insurance is the best vehicle to consult insurers on these issues.  In a previous meeting I gave a reasonably detailed presentation on universal health insurance and what we have done so far.  It is our intention to continue to consult insurers universal health insurance matters affecting them.  I hope I have provided a reasonable summary of the Department's current position.  I am more than happy to answer further questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.937" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Joyce" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100022#AA00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to address the committee.  My colleague, Mr. Sloyan, will make the presentation on behalf of the Health Insurance Authority but I wish to comment briefly on our role in respect of risk equalisation.  It is universally recognised that risk equalisation is essential to community rating in the market.  The system contains two elements, namely, levies on health insurers and credits for high risk subscribers.  These are calculated so as to be fully offsetting and, therefore, financially neutral for the market as a whole.  In general older people pay less and younger people pay more as a result of risk equalisation.  This is what we mean by community rating.</p><p>  In commenting on the risk equalisation system we must be careful to take the levies and credits together.  An insurer with higher than average risk profile can be expected to favour higher levies and credits, while the insurer with lower than average risk profile can be expected to favour lower levies and credits.  The authority endeavours to set the risk equalisation system at a level that is appropriate to the market and we are not biased one way or the other.  I agree with Dr. Lynch that transfers occur but it is better to think about them as transfers between subscribers rather then between companies.  The beneficiary of the transfer is the older customer rather than the VHI and the levy is subsidised by the younger customer rather than the company paying it.  Risk equalisation in itself has no effect on overall market premiums.  The determinant of overall levels of premiums is the insurer's cost of providing a service and the greatest element of this is the cost of claims.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.938" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Sloyan" time="12:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100022#AA00300"><p>I will begin by outlining the authority's key functions.  We regulate compliance with the health insurance legislation that sets out the rules and supports for the community rated market.  We provide consumer information on rights and options in the market and the range of available products.  We also have a role in monitoring the market and advising the Minister for Health.  Our key functions in the area of risk equalisation include advising on the levels of credit and levies, administering payment system on the risk equalisation fund and avoiding overcompensation, which is a key element of EU rules and domestic legislation.</p><p>  Credits are payable in respect of people from the age of 60 upwards and they increase rather rapidly with age.  A credit of &euro;425 is payable in respect of a male aged 64 years, whereas the credits of more than &euro;3,300 is payable in respect of a male aged over 80 years.  Recent legislation provides for a new development with the hospital bed utilisation payment, which is equivalent to &euro;75 per night in a hospital.  These credits are funded by four levels of stamp duty, for adult, child, advanced cover and non-advanced cover, respectively.  The stamp duty for non-advanced plans is approximately 85% of the level for advanced credits and levies.</p><p>  Other speakers have emphasised the necessity of risk equalisation in a community rated market.  Every community rated market operates a risk equalisation system because, while insurers are required to charge everybody the same premiums, their costs vary significantly.  The average claim cost for a male over the age of 30, based on the product with the most popular level of cover in the market in 2013, is projected to be &euro;5,000.  That compares to the average claim cost of &euro;1,100 for such a product.  Without risk equalisation the incentive for the insurer is to insure younger and healthier people while avoiding older and less healthy people.  Where insurers have older and less healthy people on their books the incentive is to sell them a different product in order to charge more.  The risk equalisation system protects the right of older people to purchase health insurance at a reasonable rate.  Risk equalisation also supports competition.  Without it competition is distorted in a community rated market because insurers with the worst risk profile are at a significant disadvantage.</p><p>  The structure of the risk equalisation system is set out in the Health Insurance Acts, as recently amended.  The system provides for a risk equalisation fund paid for by stamp duty payable by all insurers and credits are paid out in respect of insured people, particularly older people and those who spend time in hospital.  The credits also vary by gender and level of cover and the levy is calculated so that the credits distributed equal the levy collected.  In this way the system is neutral to the market as a whole.  Under the legislation the determination of credits and levies starts with the HIA analysing the market and advising the Minister.  In addition to its analysis, the authority's advice on credits is based on the criteria of supporting community rating, avoiding over compensation, market sustainability and the need to support competition.  The levy is calculated based on the amount necessary to fund the credits.  The Minister then proposes credits and levies to the Oireachtas for enactment.  Credits are provided for in health insurance legislation while the levy is included in the Finance Bill.</p><p>  The market impacts of risk equalisation are beneficial for consumers.  It supports competition by reducing the disadvantage faced by insurers with older and less healthy profiles.  Without risk equalisation the main way an insurer would make money is by managing its risk profile.  Risk equalisation forces insurers to find ways of making money that bring greater benefits to consumers, such as cost control.  </p> <p>It also supports community rating, first, by reducing the net claims costs for products that insure older and less healthy people and also, it must be acknowledged, by increasing the net costs for products to insure younger and healthier people.  While the impact of different products and different insurers varies, the overall impact on the market is neutral.</p><p> The next slide might be useful in the discussion about effectiveness and top slicing.  This chart sets out the claims costs for the most popular level of cover in the market.  These are the products on which the credits and the levy for the advanced contracts are based.  They are not based on what might be considered the luxury level of cover; they are based on the level of cover that approximately 75% of the market has.  The green line on this chart reflects the market average cost for that level of cover, the blue line is the raw claims data and the red line is the claims adjusted for the risk equalisation system.  For those aged under 60, the risk equalisation system lifts the cost from the blue to the red line and, for ages above 60, it reduces the cost from the blue to the red line.  A single figure for the percentage of effectiveness is difficult to talk about here because the reduction is much greater for a male in his 80s with the gap between the green and blue lines reducing by 87%.  It reduces by smaller percentages for other ages.  It also affects different products sold by different insurers by different percentages.</p><p> We have mentioned more than once in the presentation that all the levy taken from the market is paid back into the market and, therefore, the effect on the overall market cost is neutral.  That gives rise to the question of what is driving premium increases.  I thought it would be useful to set out in the final table what has happened to average premia and average claims paid in the market over the past five years.  These are averages and, therefore, obviously the cost of some products has increased by much more and others by less, but the average claims cost has increased by 67% while the average premium paid has increased by 56%.  The full increase in average premium over the past five years is explained by the increase in the average claims cost.  Something that should not go unnoted is the analysis of how claims have been increasing over that period.  In 2008 and, particularly, in 2009, there was a high level of inflation.  Some control was exerted on that in 2010 and 2011 but, in those years, ageing alone accounted for approximately a 3% impact.  However, 2012 gives rise to further concern in this area.  We are back up to a high level of claims cost inflation there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.940" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013022100023#BB00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Dr. Lynch, in his opening remarks, said:<blockquote><br />The Government's priority is to ensure a sustainable market for private health insurance, in which those who wish to purchase cover can buy it at an affordable price.  In addition to meeting the needs of today, the private health insurance market is also seen as a key building block on which to move to universal health insurance in the years ahead.</blockquote>Clearly, many of the policy decisions that have been made in recent times are contrary to this stated policy of making health insurance affordable.  The market is shrinking and there are huge difficulties for people because of the downturn, as they have less disposable income, but policy decisions have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to increased health insurance costs for families.  I refer to the recent legislation that was passed which was meant to differentiate between advanced and non-advanced plans.  The Health Insurance Authority conducted a survey, which pointed out that 47 plans would qualify as non-advanced.  Following the enactment of the legislation, non-advanced plan is available in the insurance market.  What do the officials expect people who are under huge pressure and can barely afford private health insurance as it is to do, given that health insurers told the committee earlier that the only way they can introduce non-advanced plans that will attract a lower levy will be to strip benefits out of their current plans?  The policy agreed by the Department, Government, HIA and so on is to ask those who can least afford it to put their hands in their pockets to pay for some of the benefits that have been stripped from plans.  This is bizarre if this is true.  Otherwise the health insurers are making it up but, one way or the other, this is a major problem.</p><p>  From the opening statements in the D&aacute;il on the risk equalisation Bill, we were led to believe there would be advanced plans.  We subsequently found out no such plan is available to anybody in the State from any insurer because of the criteria that are being used.  I am concerned about that for a number of reasons.  First, the stated policy seemed to disappear during the passage of the Bill without a rational explanation and, second, when people are forced to reduce their health cover because they cannot afford the rates, the health insurers will strip out benefits providing approximately 66% coverage for the non-advanced plan, which means the subscribers will have to pay the difference out of their own pockets, for example, when going for a scan which, traditionally, would have been covered by the lower cost plans.   It is utterly bizarre and I would like Dr. Lynch to explain this because nobody has explained how the policy changed in the meantime.</p><p>  Some health insurers have said this will substantially benefit the VHI because of the age related tax credits.  I accept they are for the benefit of subscribers and not the company but the Department has a vested interest in making sure the company is minded and put in cotton wool because there is a huge hole in its balance sheet which will have to be filled in the context of capital requirements under the EU policy on central bank licensing and governance.  Clearly, the Department has to look on the VHI with a slightly jaundiced view in comparison with the other insurers to make sure the company is protected.  Some of the changes in non-advanced care were undertaken primarily for that reason.</p><p>  On the issue of lifetime community rating and our move to UHI, I do not doubt the Minister's commitment, given it is his stated policy and that of the Government and the Department, but the timeframe is the issue.  If this drifts in the interim, huge swathes of people will leave the market and others will not take out health insurance policies.  That is contrary to the policy of encouraging as many as possible to take up private health insurance.  Lifetime community rating should be examined urgently because if UHI drifts for a year or two, the market will have shrunk further and younger people will be less encouraged to enter the market.</p><p>  I refer to <i>per diem</i> and the hospital designation of beds.  The insurers informed us earlier that this will have a catastrophic effect on the viability and sustainability of the heath insurance market.  If an individual has paid taxes and he attends an accident and emergency department, he is entitled to treatment.  If this designation happens, he will pay on the double through his taxes and his health insurance premium.  The health insurer will be forced to cough up, which effectively means the subscriber again.</p> <p>This is just a revenue-generating measure, full stop.  It has nothing to do with policy.  It is just about revenue raising, which is putting significant pressure on the insurers who are passing these inflated costs on to the subscribers and forcing more people out of the market.  In respect of the HIA's assessment of the market, it has quite a substantial cash reserve of &euro;8 million available to it.  Has it carried out detailed assessments of the levies, the advanced and the non-advanced plans and the impact this could have on families already struggling to retain the lower-level plans?  How often does it carry out detailed, independent analysis of the market?  Does the delegation accept the Milliman report on the VHI or does it think the VHI is correct in saying that Milliman looked at it through a different matrix?  </p></speech>

I will not repeat the questions that have been asked.  In respect of the revised statistics for health status, what specific measures are being taken by the Department and the hospitals to compile the data required for that?  What is the timeline for a revision of the legislation?  What is the Department's timeline in respect of recommendations to the Minister regarding any changes to lifetime community rating?  I echo Deputy Kelleher's comments about non-advanced plans.  Dr. Lynch made the point that the idea behind the non-advanced plans was to ensure that there would no cross-subsidisation.  When will the legislation be amended to facilitate those 47 plans that the HIA identified as being provided for under the non-advanced plans?  There seems to have been a change in the definition of what an advanced plan is from November when the HIA carried out its evaluation to the enactment of the legislation.</p><p>  Evidence was given earlier that if someone moves mid-year from one policy to another, he or she will have to pay the levy on the double.  Is that the case or will he or she have to pay any additional cost by moving mid-year?  My next question is for Dr. Lynch.  We heard evidence from the VHI earlier today about its 2011 accounts.  According to this evidence, the unfunded insurance premium provision in its accounts was &euro;28.2 million.  That provision was for 80 staff and, presumably, their spouses.  The cost of that per retired staff member is &euro;350,000 or each of those staff members and his or her spouse would have to live for 43 years beyond retirement to meet that liability.  Does Dr. Lynch not think these figures are bizarre?  What questions have been asked of the VHI in respect of them?  </p><p>  My final question is for the HIA.  How much of the levy is a direct result of the numbers of families and young people leaving the system?  It makes the point that its evaluation is based on the cost to 75% of the market.  With younger people leaving the market, based on its evidence presented to the committee during a previous meeting, policies are becoming more expensive which is feeding into the levy.  How much of it is a direct result of the haemorrhage of younger people out of the market?</p></speech>

It went up by 23% in 2009, 4% in 2010, 5% in 2011 and is now 12%.  Have we identified the reason for that significant increase, particularly the figure of 12%?  Is it because of additional Government levies?  What is the reason for that?  Why was there an increase of 23% in 2009?  It goes back to the other question about how we have allowed health costs to escalate in this country.  I know the cost of drugs is not directly related to the cost of hospital care but we have allowed the cost of drugs to increase from something like &euro;572 million ten years' ago to &euro;1.9 billion, which is an increase of 230%.  There has been a 67% increase in the amount paid out per insured person in a five-year period, which is a significant increase.  Have we identified how that increase occurred?</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher asked about advanced versus non-advanced plans and why there are no non-advanced plans on the market.  The critical date that perhaps has not been highlighted in the discussion up to now is 31 March.  The stamp duty rates change on 31 March and not beforehand.  The existing stamp duty rates remain in place up to 31 March and then we have the split.  The fact that there are no current non-advanced plans on the market is not of itself of concern.  The critical issue is the number of non-advanced plans that will be available after 31 March.  Even if we had ten, 20 or 30 non-advanced plans on the market getting the lower rate of stamp duty, that lower, favourable rate would not apply on any policy until a policy was written from 31 March onwards.  Even if I am in one of the 47 plans mentioned earlier by the Deputy, I would not have benefited from that unless I moved to the new-type plan after 31 March.  That there are no non-advanced plans on the market is not the issue of concern to us.  Obviously, it would be an issue after 31 March.  I understand health insurers have been talking to the HIA about their plans in this regard.  They have 30 days to notify the HIA.  The deadline for implementing a new non-advanced plan by 31 March would be 1 March, which is tomorrow week.  My understanding is that different insurers have been talking to the HIA in that regard.  Therefore, my expectation is that there will be non-advanced plans in the market after 31 March.  It is very important to clarify that date, which was not highlighted when insurers raised the issue this morning.</p></speech>

We made a decision based on what was available to set the rates at 66% - somewhere above and somewhere below.  We understand that a number of insurers have indicated that they will have policies which comply with the non-advanced category by 1 March.  We were faced with a situation whereby the insurers wanted absolute clarity about what was covered and what was not covered - what was advanced and what was non-advanced - and that is what we agreed to do.  We introduced that in legislation.  While plans have fallen outside it, we regard that as a temporary situation.</p></speech>

Even if health insurers do not submit new plans before 31 March 2013, there will be no non-advanced plans.  What will have to happen is a stripping of benefits from plans that are already in place.

We have seen a 56% increase in the premium paid per insured person from the time Deputy Kelleher was in government to now.  It beggars belief.  I listen to people every day of the week.  Mr. Sloyan said himself a few moments ago that 10,000 people have left the system since our last meeting in October.  People are opting out of different categories.  We have too many choices.  If I have to pay for a procedure when I am paying a premium for health insurance, it makes no sense.</p></speech>

The contracts were drawn up in circumstances in which the restrictions on advanced and non-advanced plans were not in place.  It would be unreasonable to expect them to have anticipated the structure that applies now.  As Dr. Lynch said, the introduction of the non-advanced plans was intended to reduce premiums for new entrants and lower-ranked plans.  It will do that.  The opportunity exists to restructure plans in light of the new definitions.  We are confidant that there will be non-advanced plans in the market.  Mr. Sloyan is correct that to meet the requirements of a non-advanced plan, it will be necessary in certain cases to reduce particular benefit.  It will also be possible for insurers to increase benefits.  The point is that it is a different structure.</p></speech>

In particular, it is related to rising costs generally in the health sector throughout the last number of years, which have been very significant.  The Minister has made his concerns at rising costs very clear.  He is concerned to restrict the increase in costs and to address costs in different areas.  There have been particular concerns, for example, about payments to individual health professionals and payment by procedure.  We are back to the earlier examples of the <i>per diem</i> versus procedures-based charges.  We are doing a number of things to eliminate costs.  We have been working with the consultative forum to identify ways to reduce costs.  It is very important to ensure that in doing so we do not offend against competition law.  We are addressing other market issues by examining areas in which costs can be reduced.  In particular, we are encouraging the VHI and others to address clinical audit, etc.  We are pushing a series of things through the consultative forum and elsewhere.  The clinical programmes which have been rolled out over the last while have considerable potential to address costs.  We must acknowledge, however, that we have an aging population and it is increasingly difficult to hold costs down.</p></speech>

Long ago, when we pressed button B in public payphones, we got our money back.  Now it is a question of reading the small print to the effect that if I get this, do I lose this and so on.  Why can we not make it simple for people?  We hear this every week in our offices from people who want health insurance and are concerned about affordability.  This is driving us.  We understand that the HIA has a job to do but from our perspective it is a question of the person who wants to have health insurance which will take the pressure off the State.</p></speech>

There has been a 56% increase in the cost of private health insurance in the past five years.  I have not been in hospital once in those five years, yet my premium has gone through the roof.  There will be people at home tonight struggling to make a decision about health insurance.  Someone telephoned me last night because the VHI received a bill for &euro;48,000 for a hospital stay.  This person is wondering whether to keep it going.  That is my point.  I am not being personal.</p></speech>

The rising cost of providing health care is a feature of the Irish health service on which the Minister and others have commented with great concern for a considerable time.  We are working intensively to address that.  In particular the focus is on insurers to audit the volume of procedures for which they pay, to audit the appropriateness of those procedures and to examine the prices paid in fees to health professionals, private hospitals and so on.  We are pursuing these issues very actively.  I will not pretend that there is an immediate simple answer that we can give tomorrow morning.</p></speech>

I would strongly welcome that improvement.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten raised a concern about the rules surrounding double payment of the levy on moving mid-year to another insurer.  This arose in the past few days in the context of the Finance Bill and we have raised it with our colleagues in the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Finance.  We are discussing it with them and hope to reach a conclusion as quickly as we can.  We would certainly like to deal with this issue as quickly as possible.</p><p>  In respect of the timing of lifetime community rating, we would like to put forward proposals as quickly as possible.  I take the point about any danger of drift in moving to UHI.  We are committed to moving to it as quickly as we can.  We are under no illusions that it is a complex system that will take time to put in place.</p></speech>

We certainly need to develop our skills.  We do not use the skills in the Department or the HSE or in any one agency.  We have seconded people with specialist actuarial and financial and other skills.  We buy those skills in for a period.  We do not operate under the illusion that we have all the answers or the skills built in.  There is a strong acceptance that in the hospital system we need to grow and develop hospital managers and finance managers to enable them to deal with universal health insurance and specifically, as Senator Crown said this morning, in respect of money follows the patient.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about that.</p><p>  In response to the other issues that were raised, we will move to lifetime community rating as quickly as we can.  On availability of data for moving to chronic diseases and improving our health status measure, we already have a good deal of data that we do not use to the fullest extent, particularly from the hospital inpatient inquiry, HIPE, data, and casemix data can be used for that purpose.  As we move increasingly in the risk equalisation space we will require more sophisticated data.  Some of them are available, some not and need to be built over time.</p></speech>

Dr. Lynch might answer it.  My understanding is, and he can correct me if I am wrong, that there was a change in the definition of a non-advanced policy from the time that the HIA made its assessment to the enactment of the legislation.  Is that the case and if so, why did that change?</p></speech>

We examined several alternatives and suggested some.  The main concern was to identify as quickly and clearly as possible the difference between an advanced and a non-advanced product.  We suggested several approaches and settled on one.  If the Deputy is asking whether we changed over time, we put forward several different definitions for advanced and non-advanced and settled on one which was published in the Bill.  There was an appropriate gap between the time the Bill was published, debated and enacted.  There was a difference over time in that definition but that definition was very clearly stated and once it was published in the Bill, it was not changed.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, several committee members cannot be here.</p><p>  I welcome Ms Deirdre Mortell from One Foundation; Mr. Paul O'Hara from Ashoka Ireland; and Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan from Social Entrepreneurs Ireland.  Each group will have 15 minutes to make a presentation.  I propose that the committee take a 15 minute break between the second and third groups.  When it comes to the question and answer sessions, I must give priority to the questions of committee members, but I will try to facilitate everyone.  I ask committee members to be brief and not make statements about how good the delegates are.  They are very good because otherwise they would not be here.  I also ask committee members to ask concise and precise questions.  If somebody rabbits on for four or five minutes, he or she will prevent other members from asking perhaps pertinent questions.  I hope we will all be sensible and mature.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence related to the subject matter of these proceedings should be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  I ask our first guest, Ms Mortell from One Foundation, to synopsise her submission.</p></speech>

It is exciting to know that the Seanad Public Consultation Committee is taking an interest in the development of social entrepreneurship in Ireland.  I will speak about One Foundation's role in the development of social entrepreneurship and, more particularly, why we chose to get involved in it and what we think social entrepreneurship contributes to Ireland.  I will discuss One Foundation's establishment in 2004, when nobody in Ireland had heard of the phrase "social entrepreneur", and the role it has played more recently in providing growth capital for the market.  I will also discuss the barriers and opportunities we see for social entrepreneurs and how the committee might be able to contribute in this regard.</p><p>  One Foundation is a private philanthropic foundation established in 2004.  We are funded by Mr. Declan Ryan of the Ryanair family and the fields in which we provide grant funding are children and families, youth mental health, the integration of minorities and social entrepreneurship.  We fund social entrepreneurship in Ireland and Vietnam.  Ours is a limited life foundation, which means we will close at the end of this year.  This will inform the remarks I will make on some of the opportunities and barriers for social entrepreneurs.  We believe we are part of a philanthropy relay race, have played our part in the past ten years and that the next generation of philanthropists will pick up the baton from us and play their role.</p><p>  We became involved in catalysing the social entrepreneur movement in Ireland in 2004.</p> <p>I wish to explain what it was that we saw occurring and what we believed was missing that led us to believe that doing so was important.  In 2004, I took a learning trip to the USA to try to find out what I felt I needed to know and I heard the term &quot;social entrepreneur&quot; for the first time.  When one considers the term, what it is and why a social entrepreneur is important are obvious.  We all accept that entrepreneurs are key to a healthy economy and innovation.  Consequently, social entrepreneurs are key to social innovation and a healthy society and social economy.  However, if they are so important, why could we not see them in 2004 when we were looking?  It is obvious that we had them even if we did not have the term.  We are all familiar with people such as Ms Mary Davis, Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy and Fr. Peter McVerry, but we could not see where the next generation of social entrepreneurs were.  I wondered where the people of my age, young entrepreneurs, college graduates or even teenagers were.  I could not see them emerging as the next generation of leadership following those who got involved in the 1960s and 1970s.  I was well networked in the social sector through my background in Oxfam and Barnardos, but I could not see such people around me.</p><p> It occurred to me that the entrepreneurs I mentioned started in the 1960s and 1970s when times were different.  Many of them had backgrounds in the religious orders.  If one is in a religious order, one does not need to worry about having a roof overhead or a hot meal every evening.  This factor influenced why the next generation was not coming through.  We were at the height of the Celtic tiger in 2004 and 2005 and parents and peers were more concerned about life choices that built people's status in society or ensured economic security.  Perhaps there was no room, moral support or encouragement for people who wanted to pursue other avenues, regardless of the financial aspect.  There seemed to be a need to consider how to cultivate the next generation of social entrepreneurs by creating space and providing moral support, credit and practical supports.</p><p> While in the US, I was given a copy of a book with which Mr. Paul O'Hara will be familiar, <i>How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas</i>by David Bornstein.  It is based on the Ashoka story.  It was hot off the press at the time.  The case studies involved certain people, but I was worried about the next generation.  It seemed like a fit for our perceptions of Ireland at that moment.</p><p> Mr. Declan Ryan, my co-founder in One Foundation, has an investment background and understands how to back entrepreneurs and expand their businesses and innovations in an Irish as well as a global context, mainly in terms of aviation but also other areas.  My background is in the voluntary sector, raising finance for organisations such as Barnardos.  It was clear to us that backing individuals with entrepreneurial qualities and innovations could solve some of the social problems that were either entrenched or increasingly emerging in the middle of the Celtic tiger era.  Someone needed to act.</p><p> The model seemed simple.  Social entrepreneurs need the same supports as entrepreneurs.  The model did not need to be invented.  We have venture capital funds, angel investors, Enterprise Ireland and many other supports for entrepreneurs in business, but there was nothing along those lines for social entrepreneurs or people acting in the social sector.  There was no practical support, targeted financing or, in particular, moral support.  When children in the generation after mine left college or did their leaving certificates, their parents did not tell them to consider what they could do for society.  There was a great deal of pressure to be a doctor, lawyer or banker.  People were not being encouraged to take that risk as a career or life choice.</p><p> To cut a long story short, we invited Ashoka to come to Ireland and supported it in its early years.  We also incubated Social Entrepreneurs Ireland under Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan's leadership.  Later, we decided to replicate Social Entrepreneurs Ireland in Vietnam.  What have we learned after ten years?  Mr. Coughlan, Mr. O'Hara and others have led the social entrepreneurship movement and we have stepped back as a result.  We have focused on growth capital for not-for-profit bodies.  I wish to discuss our work to date and some of the barriers and opportunities presenting.</p><p> In ten years, One Foundation has provided more than 35 organisations in Ireland with growth capital to make a step change in their impact on the fields of youth mental health, children and families, minority integration and social entrepreneurship.  We set ourselves eight ambitious goals, one of which was to transform youth mental health services in Ireland.  I will explain why we provided certain supports.  We call them our investment model.  I will outline a case study instead of giving a long theoretical explanation.  We have used a model of support that replicates the support provided by venture capital backers in business.  We know that high-performing entrepreneurs and not-for-profit organisations have the same needs as for-profit companies, namely, growth capital of a meaningful scale, technical supports that enable them to put that money hard to work - business planning, impact measurement systems, etc. - and networks that can bring other inputs to the table - for example, board members, capital, recruitment and talent.</p><p> My example is that of BeLonG To Youth Services, with which some Senators may be familiar.  Based in Dublin, it provides youth services to the lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender, LGBT, community.  These services were originally only available in Dublin, but they have been extended throughout Ireland.  We &quot;invested&quot; in BeLonG To Youth Services.  I use inverted commas because we are a grant maker, in that we do not look for financial returns from the grants we provide, but we always view it as investment because we want to be able to name and measure the social return on our grants.  We invested in BeLonG To Youth Services to help it expand its network of youth services for LGBT young people outside of Dublin.  When we first became involved in 2006, it was providing Sunday afternoon drop-in programmes on youth work.  People were getting the bus from Donegal to Dublin and back again on the same day, they were so desperate to access the service.  That the service was necessary was obvious, but there was no money.  If 5% to 10% of the population is LGBT, 42,000 people in Ireland between the ages of 14 and 23 years could not get support if they lived outside Dublin.  From other evidence, we know that mental health problems are most likely to emerge during adolescence and that this age group has a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.</p><p> We invested &euro;1.425 million in BeLonG To Youth Services over six years.  It is a big number, but we did not invest it all in one go.  We broke it down into three-year investments - they were really grants - that focused on different stages of the organisation's development.  We wanted it to expand its youth services from Dublin to nationwide, ensure that the Department of Education and Skills came on board to combat homophobic bullying, change public attitudes, promote solidarity among young people - befriending, basically - and increase the organisation's fund-raising capacity so that it could be strong after we left.  In line with our investment model, we first provided &euro;100,000 over a year to strengthen the organisation's core staff and tested its ability to deliver.  It did great.  We then paid for BeLonG To Youth Services to draft an ambitious business plan in which it could set out in writing and drill through the details of its ambitious goals and how it was going to achieve and measure them - for example, how long they would take, how many more staff would be required and what those staff would be doing.  This planning is harder than it seems.  We liked the plan when we saw it and contributed &euro;750,000 at the time to hire the staff necessary to expand services nationally and train youth workers in other youth organisations to fund-raise, handle communications and campaigning, etc.</p> <p>It was all about strengthening the organisation to achieve its big mission.  It was an investment in the core strengths of the organisation.  Much of the time this is referred to as "overhead" but to us it is growth capital.  I want to draw the committee's attention to the fact that organisations are often informed - in the media and other places - that they have too much overhead.  In business that is not referred to as overhead, it is what one needs to grow and to build one's mission.  Overhead, in terms of the way it is defined, is often a good thing and not a bad thing.  We are very happy to support that.</p><p> We followed up with a second round of investment of &euro;500,000 to take the growth to the next stage.  The organisation is now involved in dialogue with the political parties and the Department of Education and Skills on a campaign to tackle homophobic bullying in schools.  Essentially, it has achieved all the objectives in which we invested.  The guidelines were produced by the Department of Education and Skills, which is engaged with combating homophobic bullying in schools.  BeLonG To has expanded nationally and reaches 2,700 young people each year.  The number it probably needs to reach is 3,000, so it is very close to its goal.  We are really happy with BeLonG To's success.  It is a brilliant organisation.  We are of the view that we, together with the State, put in the right money at the right time in order to make that happen.</p><p> What we did was invest the risk capital.  It is extremely important to consider the role of philanthropy in a social democracy such as Ireland.  We can be the risk capital.  The State has the Comptroller and Auditor General crawling all over its money.  It is very difficult for the State to take risks.  This is because risk capital will sometimes fail.  It will fail quite often, actually.  It is very difficult for the State to take that risk.  However, philanthropy can take it and this can take the form of growth capital.  When that proves effective, for example, once BeLonG To has grown and we can see that the services it provides actually work, then the State can choose - if it believes in those services - to pick up the baton in the context of funding them.  Basically, we have taken the risk.</p><p> What have we learned?  Ireland can hold its head high with regard to its track record on social innovation.  Senators will hear some examples in that regard in a few moments.  Many of these have been developed by social entrepreneurs but barriers remain.  The first such barrier is the lack of growth capital in Ireland for the next generation.  We only worked in very specific areas and we did not work in lots of others.  There is a lack of philanthropic growth capital in Ireland, particularly at the scale required.  Our average grant was &euro;750,000.  That is a great deal of money.  Not many philanthropies in Ireland are giving out that kind of money and we are closing down our operations.  It is not possible to grow an organisation based on funds committed year by year.  That is how the State works at present.  There is not enough growth capital and it is drying up.</p><p> The second barrier is that the model of supports provided by venture capital for entrepreneurs is just not available to social entrepreneurs in this country.  Again, this is not at the scale it needs to be.  The funds provided need to be structured properly and they must be available for what is called - but what is not - overhead.  I refer in this regard to management, salaries, marketing, IT, etc.  Technical supports must be wrapped around these.  The committee will hear much more about that from Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and Ashoka Ireland.  Entrepreneurs require access to mentoring and to networks.</p><p> The third barrier is that State contracts for social services need to be clearer in their commissioning criteria in order to give new entrants a fighting chance of winning them.  Funding should, in particular, more often be contingent on the outcomes that are delivered rather than on historic funding relationships.  We see that happening right across the commissioning bodies throughout the State with responsibility in the area of social services, including the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Social Protection, agencies with responsibility for housing, etc.  We need to move away from the approach which states that "We have always funded them so they must be good and we know them well" to one where we evaluate - based on outcomes and value for money considerations - who can be the best provider of the services required.  We have not yet made that move in Ireland.  It is a significant challenge but it is something which we must do.</p><p> Ireland's Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising has been developing a national social innovation fund, which will be launched later this year.  The role of this fund will be to provide more growth capital into the market, not just in specific areas but actually for Ireland's best social innovations.  The latter could be in any area.  This is being developed under the auspices of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, who appointed the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising to consider how to stimulate philanthropy in Ireland and put it to best use.  The Seanad could really help by getting behind that initiative as it emerges.  We believe it should be launched at some point in the second half of the year.  As everyone is aware, however, nothing is launched until it is launched and Ireland is experiencing hard times.  We believe the money can and will be found.  However, we would welcome anything the Seanad can do to back that initiative.  We can have all the networks and technical supports we like but if we do not have the growth capital that goes with them, they will find it difficult to make a difference.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.</p></speech>

Does One Foundation have in place a review team to which those to whom I refer might present?</p></speech>

One Foundation would have set targets and would have informed BeLonG To that it needed to operate on a nationwide basis and so on.  That feels like a project with an end and I cannot quite work out what - with the exception of the change in the language - what is the entrepreneurial element.  I refer, of course, to calling it something other than overhead.  A project may be set targets and given the funding to achieve them and its progress may be monitored but I cannot identify where the transition to social entrepreneurship occurs.  It is not that I do not believe what has been said, it is just that I do not quite get it.</p></speech>

She highlighted the biggest risk that exists, namely, the lack of philanthropic capital and indicated how we might progress the recommendations from the report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.  Will Ms Mortell be more specific?  Perhaps she might pretend that this is the D&aacute;il rather than the Seanad about the crisis we face.  In that context, not only is One Foundation winding down its operations this year but many other philanthropies are also doing so.  If she were Minister, what would Ms Mortell do about the crisis to which I refer?  The Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and the Environment, Community and Local Government have a number of philanthropic initiatives and these are mediated by the Department of Finance, I presume, through the annual Finance Bill.</p> <p>Could I have the bottom line and a comment on the current legislative context?  If Ms Mortell were the Minister, what would she deliver?  What message could we send back?</p></speech>

Our funds are now closed and fully committed.  The straight answer is "No".</p><p>  On the question on the link between social entrepreneurs and growth capital, I will answer it in part.  It will be answered fully in the presentations that follow my contribution.  We are covering different matters.  Social entrepreneurs are usually start-up or early stage entrepreneurs.  Mr. Paul O'Hara's and Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan's organisations are working directly with social entrepreneurs.  One Foundation is not.  When social entrepreneurs emerged from support from Social Entrepreneurs Ireland or Ashoka, or both, they might have come to One Foundation for growth capital.  They would have tested their ideas and shown they could work, and they would have built some networks, etc.  On doing so, they say their initiative is working in Dublin and ask how it can be grown.  This process involves One Foundation.  It is not all black and white and there is some passing around.  The idea is that social entrepreneurs who have shown that their initiatives can work, have value for Ireland and can be cost-effective in some way and at some level but probably on a relatively small scale can avail of a bigger growth capital fund for the larger amount of money and wider supports that they require, perhaps on a national or international basis.  One Foundation would have provided that part, but there would already have been something to work with.</p><p>  BeLonG To was about five years old.  It had 100 young people coming to it every week in Dublin and this had been the case for four years.  It had four or five staff when we met the representatives.  We asked whether the initiative worked and how we could know this.  We also asked about the evidence base.  We asked whether the evidence base needed to be built a little more before we could think about growing the model and asked the right way to grow the model.  There is not a single way to take an initiative to a national level; there are three or four options.  In the business planning service we offered we could have examined the various growth models.  Should one run BeLonG To in every county, work with the mainstream e-services and just train those concerned?  Should one licence one's model?  There are many ways in which this could be done.  We would have examined all the options to determine what would work in the context of a given organisation, bearing in mind its skill set.  We would then have formulated a relevant cost and financial model.  This view will emerge in the other presentations also.</p></speech>

The forum on philanthropy has produced a wide set of recommendations.  I have not elaborated on all of them today, as it would take too long.  However, a number of them concern cultural change.  The social innovation brand is about the simple problem that there is not enough growth capital in the country.  That probably has the most direct effect on social entrepreneurship.  There are a number of proposals that affect the social and voluntary sector as a whole in regard to tax-effective giving.  Some specific sectors and some broader ones are being debated by the finance committee.  Examining and supporting them are important.  It is challenging to try to get tax incentives through the finance committee and the Department of Finance, but they could have a very real impact on supporting social entrepreneurs and the wider voluntary sector.  I encourage Senators to consider this.</p><p>  The forum on philanthropy will launch a national giving campaign later this year.  It will be about encouraging everybody in the country to give a little more in accordance with their means.  It will appeal to all of Ireland, including the corporate sector and individuals.  One does not have to be rich or poor; one can just give according to one's means.  It is a case of putting a bit of oomph behind the fact that we all need to give.  Perhaps we should think about giving in a more planned and structured way.  We are brilliant at putting the money in the pot &ndash; we are the best in the world at it &ndash; but  only approximately 15% of Irish people think about planning their giving.  If we decided to give &euro;5 per month to our favourite organisation instead of putting a tenner in the pot, it could be transformative for organisations in that they could plan what they were trying to achieve.  If the Seanad chose to take an interest in the giving campaign, it would be fantastic.  Those are the three points I would mention.</p></speech>

I apologise for having been a little late coming to the Chamber.  I congratulate the delegation on the work being done with BeLonG To.  I am very familiar with its work.  It has made exceptional progress in recent years in expanding, developing and rolling out services, which is really impressive.</p><p>  With regard to Ms Mortell's comment on the forum on philanthropy, my question is on the ending of philanthropy.  Senator Fiach Mac Conghail stated Atlantic Philanthropies was also ending its giving phase this year.  The end of the giving term is clearly a very common phenomenon in philanthropy.  What does one do afterwards?  Ms Mortell referred to the effort to try to encourage philanthropy generally.  As with the Obama campaign, it is a question of more people donating small amounts rather than large foundations giving larger amounts.  Clearly, there must also be a State take-up.  Is there another approach for foundations seeking to exit from donating without causing great upheaval in the social entrepreneurship sector they have been funding?  I am conscious that there will be many difficult transitions for those bodies that have been supported by philanthropic associations.</p></speech>

It is regrettable to see One Foundation coming to an end.  Irrespective of the financial element, could the human resources and expertise the organisation has developed in terms of mentoring, leading, engagement and development be harnessed and retained for the betterment of the country in general?</p><p>  On the principle behind the giving campaign that has been launched, the Irish are unique when there is a need for a meitheal effort.  A partnership between the Government and organisations to really promote this aspect could bring the concept of philanthropy to another level.</p></speech>

Having worked for an organisation that benefited from an investment by One Foundation, I say that from the heart to the foundation and Mr. Declan Ryan, in particular.</p><p> Having listened very carefully to what Ms Mortell said, I note that much activity surrounding social entrepreneurship and the examination of social change and its impact involve interaction with the State.  Let me ask a question on this because it indicates the role we can play.  Ms Mortell has outlined the very positive experience of BeLonG To and the positive interaction with the State.  What are some of the challenges for the organisations in which One Foundation is investing in terms of interaction with the State, scaling up and sustainability?  Ms Mortell talked about planned giving.  Most State funding lines are on an annual basis, not on a multi-annual basis.  Are these the types of issues Senators could explore with a view to determining the role the State could play?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1058" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Deirdre Mortell" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100005#D00800"><p>I thank Senator Martin Conway for his comment on the meitheal effort.  It captures the national giving campaign very well.  "Meitheal" may well be a word that will be used when the campaign is finalised.  The Senator might be pleased to hear that the intention in terms of financing the campaign is to have a co-funding arrangement between the Government, through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and philanthropic interests.  We are trying to have all of the initiatives walk the walk rather than talk the talk.  We would like all of the initiatives emerging from the forum on philanthropy to involve co-funding involving the State and philanthropic interests.</p><p>  With regard to philanthropic closures and what could be done, much is being done.  What more could be done?  From the State's perspective, the forum on philanthropy exits to determine this.</p> <p>I am a member of the forum on philanthropy and we have worked very hard in the past two years to produce a report that was launched by the Taoiseach last July.  We must get behind the recommendation to ensure the momentum builds.  The forum comprises different Departments and others, among them the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach, and responsibility for it transferred to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan.  The people from the different Departments need to do their bit.  The Minister, Deputy Hogan, cannot deliver it on his own.  It is like a cog in motion.  There are many moving parts.  Putting the momentum behind it is very important.  It might be a good idea to invite the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising to make a presentation as I think the forum would be very keen to make such a presentation.</p><p> As Atlantic Philanthropies and One Foundation bring their grant making to a close, that will remove &euro;40 million to &euro;60 million from the philanthropic funding market by the end of the next three years.  It will not finish next year but will be concluded by 2016 or 2017.  That is very significant.</p><p> We are not seeing new trusts and foundations being set up.  There are barriers to the establishment of such bodies which the recommendations of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising will address if they are followed through, but we also need the economy to lift.  There has been much wealth destruction.  We are not seeing the emergence of new big trusts and foundations.  We had hoped to hand on the baton to a number of different people whom we had hoped would have set up trusts and foundations and we could then apply to them for funding.  We do not see that happening.  At the same time there are individuals who can give in a more thoughtful way.  Until the economy lifts, we need to see a certain level of wealth lift in order to lift it completely.</p><p> I never want to lose track of the fact that we can all play our part by our own giving, by encouraging other people to give and by asking one's friends to whom they give.  We are a bit shy about talking about it.  It is similar to saying it is one's little secret.  Why should it be?  I ask my friends that question over dinner.  It tells me something about who a person is if I know what he or she supports.  I do not know why it would be a secret.  It is not something of which to be ashamed.  There is a little bit in the culture change about getting the conversation going and having it be part of what a person does.  We can take the issue very seriously when it can be very light and uplifting.</p><p> Members are probably wondering what the One Foundation is doing in its last year if it is not grant making.  We are working with our existing grant recipients to support them through the transition.  We are putting in many transition supports and a final round of strategic planning.  They are dealing with much cost cutting, both from our exit but also from reduced State support.  We help them to formulate strategies to ensure the cost cutting they do means they can grow again very quickly when the money flows.  We are putting in many technical supports, CEO mentoring, training and fund-raising to help them to make the transition as easy as it can be.  For some it will be done very successfully.  For others it will be a struggle.</p><p> In response to Senator Jillian van Turnhout's question on<b></b>State interaction, there are many different ways and places in which the State interacts with social entrepreneurs, whether early or later stage organisations.  It is difficult to summarise that into one or two recommendations.  I do not have a survey of the criteria the Government follows when commissioning services.  It would be very interesting to conduct a survey under the headings of whether there are criteria and how much money actually gets spent in that way on State services.  No one knows the answer to that, so there will be stories in the presentations this afternoon in that regard.  It would be great if there was a systematic approach by the State to how it spends our money and if the best service for the local area and for the money available was known when commissioning youth, disability or employment services for disadvantaged people.  Much of the time we do not have the data.  We do not ask the organisation to provide it and if they cannot provide it, the State does not pay for it either.</p><p> What is required is a level of clarity on commissioning criteria, because they are largely based on historical relationships.  That does not mean they are all bad, and probably many of them are fantastic, but we do not know.  What is also needed is to make the criteria focus on delivering outcomes for the group that is being targeted, as well as value for money, something about which we all know.  Value for money is not the same as cheapest.  These are the main points I would raise.</p></speech>

There is a common theme among all the presentations.  Members will be invited to ask further questions.  Before I call Mr. Paul O'Hara of Ashoka Ireland, who I understand is sharing his time slot with Ms Caroline Casey from Kanchi and Mr. James Whelton of CoderDojo, I must reiterate the ruling on privilege.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence related to the subject matter of these proceedings should be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>  Does Mr. O'Hara wish to share the time slot by allowing each speaker five minutes?</p></speech>

I thank everybody for hearing it.</p><p>  I wish to give the historical context to this global movement and introduce Ashoka and how it can change a nation.  The Members will then hear the contribution of two great social entrepreneurs as part of this submission and I will close with some ideas on how Oireachtas Members can work more closely with social entrepreneurs.</p><p>  The Ashoka movement was built by Bill Drayton, who could see that all the major social transformations throughout history had been driven by individuals, either visibly or invisibly.  He was thinking about people such as Maria Montessori and Florence Nightingale who transformed their fields.  They were, of course, not considered social entrepreneurs at the time, but effectively that is what they would now be known as.  They saw a problem in their field and they used all the entrepreneurial endeavour of a business entrepreneur to see that the field was transformed.  Bill Drayton spent a lot of time in India and was very challenged by the development gap between there and North America where he had grown up.  He thought a really key lever of development was identifying these individuals in local community who had transformative ideas across the fields of education, health care and so on.  He set about trying to identify them back in 1980.  He coined the term "social entrepreneur" and through identifying social entrepreneurs effectively, initiated the field, which has now grown.</p><p>  The Ashoka network alone has 3,000 social entrepreneurs across 72 countries.  The movement has grown far beyond that.  The media is covering it widely and there is hardly a business school that does not have a module on social entrepreneurship.  The majority of the top business entrepreneurs in the world, Richard Branson and Bill Gates and people like them, are backing social entrepreneurs in some shape or form.  It has started to enter the mainstream of politics.  Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso has been the champion of social innovation at EU level.  President Obama opened an office for social innovation at the White House in the first year of becoming President.  In Ireland, the Taoiseach is getting behind this movement, and the hearing today is a testament to it as well.</p><p>  Let me expound upon the role and value of a social entrepreneur.  Their primary function is to solve problems in society, but they also serve a very important role as mass recruiters of change makers.</p> <p>Therefore, in order to achieve their vision, every social entrepreneur has to recruit thousands of people behind what it is they are trying to achieve.  That has a significant impact because some of those change makers will go on to be social entrepreneurs themselves and it changes their identity and sense of responsibility as citizens.  In that regard, it is a snowballing movement that is irreversible, which is a hopeful thing to think about.  The reason so many people are into it is because it is extremely satisfying to give of yourself to society.  I am sure Members of the committee are familiar with that.  More and more people are recognising that fact.  In the Harvard Business School, more students are taking social enterprise studies than finance, which is demonstrable of this shift.</p><p> The role that social entrepreneurs play includes trying to change policy, which is why they will be interacting with the Oireachtas.  Some of them are creating entirely new markets that we did not have before.  They are building bridges between business and society, which were unbuilt over a few hundred years since the start of the Industrial Revolution.  Those bridges are important in tackling major social problems, with the Government, civil society and business working together.  Social entrepreneurs are at the nexus of that in many of the big transitions.  As I said earlier, they are master change makers, creating a new culture in society.  They are also cultivating empathetic ethics, which is an important transition for societies to take.</p><p> As regards the overall vision of this movement in Ireland and across the world, from Ashoka's perspective, we are seeking to build societies where everybody can be a change maker.  Social entrepreneurs are the key to bringing us there.  If one can imagine a world where everybody has the confidence and skill to solve problems where, or even before, they arise, it will equip society much better to deal with the social, economic and environmental challenges we face.  It will also be a critical success factor.  If Ireland wants to be successful in the global economy, a key thing will be the percentage of the population that are change makers.  That is true for any company, city or country.  The majority of the skills for change making are learned skills that we can all cultivate from a young age: creativity, leadership, the ability to work with others, and empathy.  All these skills can be practised over time.</p><p> Ashoka started in 1981 and spread across the world.  It started in western Europe initially in 2003.  We have since invested about &euro;50 million in supporting 360 social entrepreneurs across 18 countries in Europe.  We are trying to build the field from the bottom up.  We have supported 12 social entrepreneurs in Ireland, two of which the committee will hear from shortly.  As regards the impact of social entrepreneurs, 83% of them will have changed a system at national level within ten years.  That is a significant impact that they are all having.  More than 90% of them have their ideas independently replicated, which is another very good indicator.  If it is copied by somebody, it is a sign that it is a good idea.</p><p> We have built this network of 360 social entrepreneurs, as well as 220 business leaders investing.  We also have 100 corporate partners and 50 staff across 15 offices in Europe.  We now want to use that powerful network to build societies where everyone can be a change maker.</p><p> Change Nation was born out of a recognition that a lot of the solutions to Ireland's challenges exist both at home and abroad.  A few years ago we started to experiment with importing solutions, the first of which was Ciel Bleu, an organisation in France that provides adapted physical exercise for older people.  That is now functioning in about 30 nursing homes and community centres, with more than 1,000 elderly people availing of those services every week across the country.  It is doubling in size year on year, so hopefully more than 2,000 people will be involved 12 months from now.</p><p> As part of Change Nation, the vision was to bring 50 of the world's top social innovators to Ireland to start working on challenges we face in the fields of education, health care, sustainability, inclusion and job creation.  Last March, the 50 people came here and, at this point, some 20 solutions are up and running which impact on people's lives in Ireland.  There are another 20 still in the pipeline.  Many of the leaders of these ideas are sitting in the Visitors' Gallery, so one can see that they are quite a young contingent - the next generation of change makers in Ireland.</p><p> I will cite a couple of examples.  One is Roots of Empathy, which is a programme from Canada that has been proven to reduce bullying, aggression and violence amongst young people.  It increases pro-social behaviour as well as social and emotional intelligence.  For the last 15 years, this has been proven in thousands of schools in Canada and New Zealand.  It started in Ireland a couple of years ago and is now in 160 schools across the island of Ireland.  The goal with Roots of Empathy is that every young person will have an opportunity to participate in the programme by the end of 2016.  That is being done in partnership with Barnados and the HSE.  We hope to get the Department of Education and Skills on board with that one as well.</p><p> Another example is JUMP Maths, which is a Canadian innovation.  Using a new methodology for teaching mathematics, it allows even the weakest children to come up to a much more significant grade based on a new understanding of cognition and of how people learn maths.  Under the leadership of the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, that will be piloted in schools across Galway and the Athlone region, starting in September next year.</p><p> Project Echo is being championed in the Seanad by Senator Fidelma Healy Eames.  It is an innovation from New Mexico that uses video technology which allows consultants to distribute knowledge to general practitioners.  It significantly reduces waiting lists and costs in the health care system, thus empowering GPs to deal with more things at a local level.  It is done by case learning through video-conferencing.  As a starting point, we are seeking to pilot that in the treatment of mental illness, neurology and diabetes.  That is progressing along but is a little bit stuck in the HSE.  Hopefully, however, the committee might be able to help with that.</p></speech>

However, legislators enabled them to become such successful nationwide innovations.</p><p>  There are an unbelievable amount of solutions around.  My question is what are the things for which Senators will be able to legislate from the solutions that exist within Ashoka's portfolio and Social Entrepreneurs Ireland's portfolio?  What will this Government's legacy be to match the smoking ban?  I would hope it will be easy to emulate that.  There is a potential partnership between social entrepreneurs and Members of the Oireachtas because, to an extent, this is a closed shop.  For a social entrepreneur to have a champion within the Oireachtas could have huge value.  I would like to discuss that a bit more later on.</p></speech>

I apologise for being late, but I am a social entrepreneur and I was speaking at a sponsorship conference because I am chasing money.</p><p>  I have been asked to tell the committee about our work and some of the key changes that we would like to see happening.  There was a great quote from the Minister of State with responsibility for disability in Haiti recently.  He said that in rebuilding Haiti, we cannot ignore the tiniest particle of intelligence or the smallest particle of potential.</p> <p>What he is saying is that for us to rebuild Haiti, we need to have the contribution and power of every individual released.  Kanchi's mission is to unleash the power of the 1 billion people in the world with a disability.  We have over 400,000 people with disabilities living in Ireland and that figure is growing consistently.  Kanchi's solution for this is business.  It has been critical in driving solutions across a myriad of social issues but, oddly, it has not engaged in the issue around disability.  One of the key problems, one with which the Government would agree, is that disability has been framed as something of need, sympathy and charity, as well as been medically model-based.  Actually, when one looks at the opportunity from a business perspective of engaging these people as consumers, talents, members of the community and our market, we can reframe that thinking.  We still have a situation where the employment figures are tiny of those with disabilities who want and are able to work.  We have never been able to manage a switch from that because of the way we are framed.</p><p> As business is pervasive in all of our society, Kanchi believes that if we can change the thinking and behaviours of business, then society will become more inclusive.  Essentially, we are trying to create a global business movement, beginning in Ireland, of inclusive business.  We are looking at the global spending power of the disability community, its contribution and talent, and of retaining people who acquire disabilities in organisations that have already invested in them.  It must be remembered that 85% of people acquire a disability during their working lifetime.  We are looking at how we market and create reputation around our companies.  Essentially, what Kanchi has done has been to bring in one of the greatest catalysts for change and merged leadership from business, media and government in a multi-stakeholder approach to reframe this.  We have created models and methodologies which are simple for business to use, and which create mass awareness around the economic case for people with disabilities in business, and which really engender leadership.</p><p> One of our most significant programmes to date is the O2 Ability Awards programme.  It was sponsored by O2 and was run for four years in Ireland.  The results from it saw it touch 22% of the working population.  Up to 67% of the companies we work with through independent research have evidence to prove that they started to change their practices, policies and procedures.  They began to serve people with disabilities as customers as well as employing them.  When I started this off, people thought I was insane, so I certainly did not tell them I wanted to take it global.  A great piece of silver lining happened when Telefonica bought O2.  The president of Telefonica said he wanted to replicate the awards in Spain.  In 2008, we did a unique and distinct social franchise - the very first social franchise out of Ireland - where Telefonica paid a significant amount of money to license the ability awards in Spain.  We have just finished the second cycle of the ability awards there.  The Queen of Spain was the ambassador and chair of it and we reached 67 million people in our campaign.  We had over 450 entries from the corporate world.  This form of engagement is unheard of.  What is more exciting is that we are creating leadership from a multi-stakeholder group, case studies which can be replicated and role models that can be emulated, and we are beginning a massive conversation that reframes disability.  We want to bring the ability awards programme to ten countries in five years.  That is ten Heads of State and 1,000 ability companies, and that will be the trigger point for where one creates a movement.</p><p> The reason I am in this position is that I was the first Irish Ashoka fellow in 2006.  Ashoka helped us dream of bringing this idea and making it a systems changer across the world.  Without Ashoka, I could not have done that, not because I did not have the vision but because I needed the expertise and it gave us that beginning funding which was critical.</p><p> We are at this point where we have this extraordinary opportunity for change.  However, I got a telephone call two days ago which threatens the future of my business.  We are growing the ability awards programme across the world, bringing it to Brazil, Germany, Sweden and Austria in the next year.  We also have the Kanchi Network in Ireland, which is a chamber of commerce-based model which engages with 20 key businesses and chief executive officers in an area where nobody has engaged before.  One of the key points that Ms Deirdre Mortell spoke about is that we do not have growth capital.  If I were running a business right now, I would sell the shares because I have a track record, an open market and know what works.  However, I cannot get funding for Kanchi.  Here we are with one of the most extraordinary opportunities for change and this company has everything it needs to go but it does not have capital.  We need risk capital and scaling capital in this sector.  We are so good at funding people at the beginning, then they become successful and then we seem to just jump off a cliff.  I ask Members to find a way for securing risky growth capital.</p><p> We need to be very careful not to be personality leadership driven but system leadership driven.  Due to this country being small, I think we are so much about the personality, which weakens our business.  That is why I have decided to step down as chief executive officer of Kanchi, a hard thing to do, but it was affecting our business because people wanted to give Caroline, the blind girl, money.  The business is so solid that we need to take it away from personality and invest in the business solution.</p><p> I would also like if we were more cognisant of whom we are funding.  The Kanchi Network has engaged with 20 chief executive officers but we are seeing funding of new projects which Kanchi could help.  Where is that money coming from?  Are we double-funding?  Should we start looking to social entrepreneurs first before we start refunding or recreating the wheel?  Can we please map our sector?  I believe there are great opportunities for mergers that could make us more powerful.  We have so little cash that there must be a way for us to join people together in a far more powerful way.</p><p> Organisations such as Ashoka and Social Entrepreneurs Ireland are important when one is beginning.  Kanchi never had funding from a foundation.  Initially, when we set up the ability awards programme, we had Government funding which, subsequently and understandably, had to be removed.  Our engagement simply relies on business.  We have had to turn our business into a social business to avoid the fund-raising trap which exists to date.</p><p> I have just come from a conference on global disability in Vienna where Senator Conway was with me.  Ireland was extraordinarily represented at it.  Ireland shone at this.  We are the innovators.  We have extraordinary interpersonal skills.  We have something that we should really capture.  If anyone had seen our participation at this conference, one would know we have something powerful on which we need to expand and invest in our creators and innovators.</p><p> I now employ a group of 14 people.  As the ability awards grow and if I can get out of our fund-raising problem, we will be trebling that employment.  One of our employees, Amie Fitzpatrick, who is legally blind or visually impaired, has just received a place on the Social Entrepreneurs Ireland wave change programme.  She is 22 years old and thought she would never get through school.  She got through school because of the work we did with her.  She is now a wave changer participant and wants to look at the transparency of legislation.  That shows the legacy of special entrepreneurship.</p></speech>

It is very difficult to follow Ms Casey but I will try my best.</p><p>  I am before the committee as a product of both Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and Ashoka.</p> <p>My career as a social entrepreneur is now about two years in the making.  My background is I am a 20 year old who came through the usual system of primary school and secondary school, but decided to not go to college,  Instead, I opted for a movement that I started with a guy called Mr. Bill Liao in Cork called CoderDojo.  Essentially, this grew out of the frustration of being a young person who was not good at guitar or sport and was not good academically, but whose identity was computers in which there was no outlet.</p><p> It is quite weird being a social entrepreneur as a young person because the majority of my peers opted for college and there is still that sense of doom and gloom with everybody in my age group.  Thankfully, Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and Ashoka gave me great assistance at the start and really brought me to where I needed to be to make CoderDojo into an organisation that operates in 22 countries and has over 180 Dojos which today teach over 10,000 children around the world how to code.  Essentially, they showed me that social entrepreneurship was a viable path and gave me considerable support in funding, planning, introductions and so much more.</p><p> CoderDojo has always taken the grassroots approach.  Initially, we saw that the Government would be more of a hindrance than a benefit starting off and we opted to go directly to the teachers to avoid the Department of Education and Skills and collaborate with organisations such as the GAA and universities.</p><p> CoderDojo is addressing the skills gap in that it is a network of free programming clubs that teaches children aged seven to 17 how to programme and is completely free and volunteer driven.  It has several aspects that address the social side providing an identity for these young people.</p><p> As a society, we are moving more towards this age of the introduction of Bills, particularly in the United States, such as Children's Internet Protection Act, CIPA, Stop Online Piracy Act, SOPA, and PROTECT IP Act, PIPA.  We are seeing many measures that challenge our digital rights and digital freedoms and as a society, it is important that we have the technical prowess to be able to recognise the danger of these and address them in a fitting manner.  CoderDojo, in training a generation of young people in programming and being more adept to technology, allows them to recognise these matters.</p><p> Obviously, there is the matter of bridging the educational gap in programming and filling this void that is not being addressed in the schools at present, or that there is not even sufficient information being given in schools.  If a person wants to continue a career path in programming, web design or whatever, the increasingly rare breed of career guidance teachers are unable to give sufficient information on this.</p><p> On the technological side, it is a pretty amazing idea to think, if a young person has the ability to programme but continues a career in law or government, or in medicine, the person can use his or her technical ability to build something that could revolutionise the system.  There is also the economic side.  There is a skills shortage.  An increasing amount of companies are coming to Ireland because this is an English-speaking country, the corporation tax, etc., but are unable to find the talent to fill these roles, and universities are not pumping out graduates fast enough or at a high enough level for them to be adapted straight away.  CoderDojo is addressing these various aspects.  With a core value system of keeping everything free, helping each other and being altruistic, we are cultivating this next generation of creators in the correct fashion.</p><p> Really, it is the community that is driving this forward, self-selecting people from all over Ireland, and, indeed, the world, who are stepping forward to teach these young people and to facilitate these sessions taking place.  The involvement of companies such as Twitter, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, who have recognised CoderDojo as something that was born out of Cork, means they adopting it and bringing it into their offices.  Going even further, CoderDojos have been run here in Leinster House on its birthday, in the European Parliament, in the Scottish Parliament and, hopefully, soon in the House of Lords.  Indeed, we are working on the White House.  Something that was born in Cork is truly blossoming into an international movement through the power of its community, but also with the help of Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and Ashoka.</p><p> I am not really sure what to ask.  I will probably get into trouble here.  I will not pretend to know anything that I do not.  I am 20.  I am still silly by definition.  I have got four years until I have to grow up.  I will suggest that the discussions continue with the, dare I say it, older and wiser ones in this room.</p></speech>

Young people are trapped in the structure that one must go to college and take the safe career of being a lawyer, doctor, etc.  We all see that those markets are saturated, that there are graduates with masters degrees who are unable to find work.  This idea of being confined to the system and a victim of conformity is doing a great deal of damage in Ireland.  I would suggest that we must show that - the teachers will hate me - not going to college is not the end of the world and young people must see that it is possible to become empowered, step forward and drive major change.</p><p>  I understand the Government's hands are tied.  It is a very tough time.  I would say that the Government has a major ability to act as a platform to showcase and facilitate many of these movements, particularly as there have been outstanding people in government.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly MEP, brought CoderDojo to the European Parliament and ran it there with children from the various CoderDojo clubs from all over Europe, congregating and programming in the European Parliament.  This opened up so many new leads, such as the House of Lords.  We are rolling out over Belgium soon.  I refer to those such as the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, who has been instrumental in spreading CoderDojo in his area and also running it in Leinster House.  I implore more politicians to step forward, be genuine and passionate about this and try to spread it in their areas, but take genuine interest in these matters, or even, instead of formalised talks, merely meet for coffee.  I invite any of the Senators to come over and play playstation with me and my friends and we will talk about changing the education system.  I would ask them to continue the conversation.</p><p>  In all respects, social entrepreneurship in Ireland is a revolution in the grand scheme of things and I have seen that revolutions can be more powerful than evolution.  I would suggest that we continue to keep our ear to the ground to get more young people empowered to break them out of the chains of normality and get them to step up and take action, and continue the conversations with the older and wiser.</p></speech>

Recently, Mr. Des Bishop has been something of a social entrepreneur with his comedy.  The stuff that has come up in that programme, and our image abroad, is no laughing matter.  I would be interested to hear any ideas on which those in that area are working.  I would certainly be willing to champion it.  Sometimes it feels that it might be easier to get things done from outside of Government.  I know that sounds ridiculous, but Government is somewhat restrained or confined in what it can do.</p></speech>

I get slagged for being a bore for raising the issue all the time.  However, it is a serious issue.  We really need to take an urgent approach to the misuse of alcohol and its cost to the country.  I hope that, from outside of Government, they might be able to help us with the ideas of those working on it and perhaps provide a different perspective.  I would be interested in their comments in that regard.</p></speech>

I thank them for their presentation.  Ireland is very much an individual-based society and the leading person, whether in politics or in social entrepreneurship, is very much identified with the organisation.</p> <p>It is a great sign that Ms Casey is stepping down in the interest of allowing the organisation to outlast and grow beyond her.  </p><p> Some of the speakers touched on the issue of education and lobbying in their respective areas.  It is amazing that our education system does not factor in what the witnesses are striving to achieve, whether that involves women in politics, social entrepreneurship or volunteering.  We recently met a group of students and their teachers for whom civil, social and political education will be confined to one hour per week.  These matters are important to students' futures but our education system teaches people how to make a living rather than how to live their lives.  Have the witnesses lobbied coherently for the development of active citizenship as a subject on the curriculum?  I understand they have worked with 136 schools but it should be part of the curriculum for every school.  If what the witnesses are doing was added to the curriculum we would have a much better education system.</p></speech>

Ms Casey spoke about the importance of mapping the sector.  Is she speaking about starting from scratch or has anything been done already?   It may be of some benefit to Mr. Whelton to know that in conjunction with IT Sligo I am working with parents on a project on the STEM subjects.  This project was inspired by CoderDojo and I had identified a gap that existed in regard to parents.  He spoke about the lack of computer skills.  Sometimes parents do not know what is going on with their young people, and this is the gap I am trying to fill at a local level.</p><p>  One of my daughters attended a CoderDojo session in Sligo and found it a bit of a boy experience.  While it may have provided opportunities to meet boys, that is not the reason she attended it.</p></speech>

One can get far more done outside of politics - I am a rookie to this House - than one can inside for good reasons.</p><p>  I was impressed by all the witness but I was very impressed by Ms Casey.  Why is she leaving?  I do not believe people follow systems.  They follow the Ghandis, the Martin Luther Kings, the Helen Kellers, the Larry Pages and the Bill Gates.  There is nothing wrong with a wonderful and dynamic personality when one is able to express oneself to an organisation.  We need people like Ms Casey.  The idea of amalgamating into a system is rubbish.  People follow those who are generous enough to make the system better than themselves.  It would be a disastrous loss were Ms Casey to step down.  How much funding does she need to keep going, immediately and over the next five years?  I think she should enter politics.</p></speech>

When we first started Roots of Empathy we demonstrated it in a school in Killinarden in Tallaght.  The demonstration was attended by 30 key stakeholders from all sectors but the only negative voice was that of the Department of Education and Skills.  It did not want to see the programme happen, which only emboldened us to ensure it did.  Part of the challenge for the Department was that by endorsing the programme it would have to make it available to all schools.  It is ridiculous that it cannot simply pilot the programme in a smaller context.</p><p>  Tom Collins, who was then chairman of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, was also involved in the Ashoka network.  It became clear that the curriculum is cluttered and pressurised.  My mother is a primary school principal.  The system is good at adding new subjects - we are partly to blame for that with Roots of Empathy and other initiatives - but it takes real courage to remove subjects.  The problem is that we keep adding to the curriculum when we should be starting from scratch to identify the skills our children need for the 21st century.  The skillset they need is totally different from the one we learned but if they do not get these new skills, they will not be players in society as it evolves.  The rate of change is so fast that unless they have certain critical skills they will not be players.  We need to take a bottom-up approach.</p><p>  We have started at university level by cultivating change making campuses.  DCU is our first change making campus.  Our next step will be cultivating change making schools.  We will identify ten schools at first to see if we can cultivate a culture of change making in primary and secondary schools as a demonstration of what is possible for the rest of the education system.</p></speech>

I was not mentally ready to go near it again.  Many teachers and principals in today's educational system remain passionate about education and are stepping forward in CoderDojos.  We have opened up to teachers who want to learn how to code and observe our teaching style.  We found that a collaborative environment, with children helping each other, more project orientation and an emphasis on fun rather than delivering computer science education, fosters a better and faster learning outcome.  Going through the Department for real change in a short amount of time is the wrong approach.  I recently spoke about this at the Irish Primary Principals' Network conference.  One will waste one's time dealing with the Department as a whole not because it is full of time wasters but because not everyone will be interested.  It is important to find the self-selecting and passionate teachers who will champion change.  Their enthusiasm is infectious.  In achieving change in education over a short period, the grassroots level is most effective in Ireland.  It is a matter of identifying these characters and working with them.</p><p>  The question of gender imbalance in coding is a big issue in technology in general.  It is regularly acknowledged at conferences that only between 7% and 9% of all programmers are female.  People are scratching their heads about it.  A number of initiatives have been attempted around the world, such as female only programming sessions to attract more women over the age of 18 into programming and Black Girls Code, which is a San Francisco based programme aimed at getting underprivileged African American girls into coding.  We have seen in CoderDojo that for some reason programming attracts more males than females.</p> <p>This is reflected in a lot of sessions.  However, between 20% and 40% are female, which given the figure for females involved in the industry, is quite good to see.  We are seeing more females in programming sessions and classes in respect of the industry.  In several locations we see a 50:50 split if not more females in sessions, more so abroad for some reason.  New York, for example, has more females than males.  I cannot talk as a girl and have no future plans to become one.  I am still bemused as ever.</p></speech>

Some people have run female-specific sessions.  Overall our ratios are quite good, but we are looking at what attracts girls to programming and how we can reach out to them.

There is a lot of entrepreneurship around that; it is just that we do not see it in such a high-level way.  Ms Frances Black is certainly worth investigating and supporting.  She has done considerable work and has been connected to the Rutland Centre.  I have great respect for the work she is doing.  Addiction and alcohol addiction work under what we call the definition of disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  One of the key problems is for people who have had addiction issues and getting them into work and getting them recognised as valuable to the economy.  So they would certainly fall under the work we do.</p><p>  On the education issue, I heard Mr. Whelton speak, as I have heard him many times, about the sense of not fitting in and not doing it all the right way.  There is a really important need.  As far as I am concerned Mr. Whelton should speak at every school because it is about role modelling.  It is critical for people to understand that there is a different way to do things.  I feel there is something that one hugely has to offer.  I want to add to Mr. O'Hara's point that Ashoka University is looking at building change-maker campuses at third level.  We have a great change-maker back here, Sarah, and we are looking to meet all the deans of all the universities.  We would love any connections.</p><p>  Regarding the conversation on mapping, there has been mapping of the not-for-profit sector.  There have been two big initiatives on that and one of the things we have seen come out of that is GuideStar so that we look at organisations.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan gave me reference to two particular reports: the centre for non-profit management - the TCD report, and the Patricia Quinn report, the Irish non-profit knowledge exchange database.  So there has been mapping in the not-for-profit sector.  Where I am specifically coming from, which is really important, connected to funding are the sectors in which we operate.  Within the disability sector there are over 800 organisations in this tiny population.  I would like to see the disability sector mapped to see where there is overlap of mission, purpose and funding.  The National Disability Authority is perfectly placed to do that and we could achieve a huge saving.  Ms Deirdre Mortell said it better than anybody.  Value for money is not about being cheaper; it is about value for impact.</p><p>  I would be a dreadful politician - I am afraid I cannot keep my mouth shut and I do not have a tough enough skin.  I am respectful of everybody who serves in politics.  It is easy to be critical of politicians, but I do not believe I am hard enough for it.  Why am I leaving and is it a shame and a crime?  It is not a shame and a crime.  I am not leaving; I am not emigrating; and I am not putting on a big cape and going away.  I am taking a different role within the organisation.  I will be an adviser to Kanchi.  It is very important that I remain strategically from a mission perspective.  I choose not to sit on the board because if I want the leadership within the organisation I need to be mature enough to step away from some of the control issues that exist.  I feel very strongly about the issue of cult of a founder, both of businesses and social entrepreneurship.  I will always remain here.  I am very passionate about the topic, but I feel we have great leadership within Kanchi that I would like to see grow.</p><p>  I was asked how much we need.  Unfortunately Kanchi is a system-changing organisation.  Somebody recently asked my why we make it so difficult for ourselves and could we not just sell cheap wheelchairs.  Why should we give people wheelchairs if they cannot get into a building and why let them into a building if they do not have money to spend?  I passionately believe we need to change the system and we need business, media and Government leadership to do that.  Unfortunately we have never benefited from what is the natural charitable funding.  With the help of Ashoka and SEI in looking at breaking fundraising traps, we should be financially sustainable.  As the ability awards scheme goes around the world - we have a licensing model - it feeds money back into a profit base.  We currently need &euro;220,000 to survive in this year, &euro;180,000 to survive next year and &euro;100,000 to survive the following year.  We need approximately &euro;500,000 over a three-year period and then we will not need any more.  It is not an easy time to ask for that.</p></speech>

I congratulate the witnesses on putting this together.  I know all three of them as I have met them previously.  I remember that wonderful day in Dublin Castle March with Paul O'Hara.  Senator Healy Eames was one of those present with me.  I got to know Ms Casey many years ago with the ability awards.  I got to know Mr. Whelton at a very interesting event in Tralee for young entrepreneurs aged 15 or 16, at which he spoke.</p><p>  Ms Casey raised the question of funding.  I was in Estonia a few years ago and was very impressed by the funding system there, which is called self-bank, and a similar one in Britain called Zopa through which much money has been raised.  This is what is called crowd funding.  Has anybody experimented that here?  A very large number of people put a very small amount of money - perhaps only &euro;10 - into it.  In the case of Estonia, the bank thus formed is able to give that money to the good cause.  People have an ownership of it and get a feel for it.  Has anybody done anything like that here?  Is it successful?  Can we do something to make it more successful in future?</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. O'Hara about the whole curriculum development process.  We need to consider what we need for our young people for the future besides just piling stuff on top of what is already there.  I was very impressed with what he had to say about JUMP math.  I presume the Canadian teacher trainers will come to Ireland.  Will they work with teachers other than those in the pilot schools?  He said that Harvard now has more social entrepreneurship courses than finance courses.  Do any Irish third level institutions run social entrepreneurship courses?</p><p>  As always Ms Casey was highly impressive and inspirational.  She spoke about mergers and I agree that we are in times with minimal financial resources.  A particular group might be able to benefit from another group without knowing it.  Where does one go - perhaps Ashoka or Social Entrepreneurs Ireland - to find a database of projects perhaps that could help each other?  We should be about sharing resources and minimising cash need, etc., and learning from all that knowledge.</p> <p>I thank Mr. Whelton for being here.  He brought a positive side to the Playstation.  I have a son at home who would probably be on it all the time if I did not send him to school.  I know Mr. Whelton is a really good model but I still cannot risk that.  I am doing my best to set up a CoderDojo in Oranmore but am having difficulty getting enough IT-savvy volunteers to give up their time on a Saturday morning.  I have two people but I need more.  I know that perhaps I have not put enough into it yet but is there anything Mr. Whelton can say that can help me?  </p><p> Mr. Whelton should not worry about making everything school-based because when something becomes school-based, it sometimes gets lost.  The magic is where schools are begging for it so it is very important that we let things fly first.  I am looking to set up a CoderDojo in Oranmore on a voluntary basis yet I have managed to get it into the school and nobody really knows about it once it is in the school.  </p></speech>

She pestered me for a long time but we are here now.  There is some gratitude towards her.  I am just the Chairman.  I call Senator Conway.  I do not want a full rundown of what happened in Vienna but I will allow the Senator to ask questions.</p></speech>

I ask the Chairman not to give out to me because he regularly does so.  I have a very short commentary to make.  With regard to Ms Casey, it is wonderful that the first social entrepreneur to become an Ashoka fellow happens to be a person with a disability from Ireland who has ability and leadership qualities.  I can say with my hand on my heart that the disability community in Ireland is extraordinarily proud of what Ms Casey has achieved.  She is not just a national leader; she is a world leader.  To see her in Vienna and the respect she receives from people throughout the world proves that Ireland can set best international practice.  We do not need to be told or shown what best practice is.  We have the ability to set it.  We have the talent and skill set here to do that.  I wanted to put that on the record of Seanad &Eacute;ireann for Ms Casey who I consider a friend.  She would be excellent in politics because I cannot keep my mouth shut either.  They will tell her that here.</p></speech>

I am sure there are many social entrepreneurs developing technology to make it more accessible and to make the employment of people with disabilities more amenable.  Could the delegation make a quick comment on that?  I have heard Mr. O'Hara speaking before but could he do so again for the benefit of others here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Hara" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100012#L00600"><p>I will take a few of the questions.  The crowd funding movement is at a very early stage but has enormous potential.  It has become part of a jobs Act in the US to legislate for it in the for-profit world.  Matt Flannery is one of our Ashoka fellows who was part of Change Nation and the founder of Kiva, which is one of the pioneers of the microfinance movement.  Kiva enables people to make small loans to start-up companies.  This initially happened in Africa but it is now doing it in the US.  Mr. Flannery is of Irish extraction and is based in San Francisco but is originally from outside Loughrea.  He is committed to having Kiva's Europe headquarters based out of Dublin.  It will be a few years before we see a flow of money to small enterprises in Ireland and across Europe using that platform.<br /> There are a few platforms on the social entrepreneur side.  GlobalGiving grew out of the World Bank and allows social entrepreneurs to put their projects up there to crowd fund through.  Again, this is primarily focused on the developing world but anybody can do it.  We are partnered with Indiegogo, which is the biggest privately funded crowd funding platform.  A number of the Change Nation initiatives will be piloted to see if we can raise some seed capital through that.  We have funded the cultural sector which is being led by the Business to Arts team, which comprises Stuart McLaughlin <i>et al</i> and has been a great success.  It seems to be successful for projects around the &euro;5,000 range, which encompass launching a CD or putting on a play.  That has been a great example of success in Ireland.  This is a great way to leverage the diaspora with a crowd funding platform so that people can give to schools their great great grandfathers went to or the village their people came from.  This is a piece of technology that would enable that.  There is enormous growth potential in crowd funding for all sectors - social and economic.  </p><p>  Teacher training is just with the teachers of the pilot schools in the initial phase but, ultimately, we want to be working with St. Patrick's College and having this included as part of training for all teachers.  My understanding is that there will be 40 pilot schools, 20 of which will have the JUMP Math programme and 20 of which will be regular pilot schools to act as a comparison.  </p><p>  Social entrepreneurship courses are emerging at third level.  Trinity College Dublin and Dublin City University have embedded social entrepreneurship in a number of their courses.  University College Dublin had it initially in the Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and has extended it to the Quinn School of Business.  NUI Galway is looking at it while the business and humanities group across the institutes of technology invited me to speak today, which was the clash.  That will happen in a few months so they are looking at how they can bring social entrepreneurship into their curricula.  It is at a reasonably early stage.  There is significant potential but also considerable demand.  Mr. Coughlan can probably build on that.</p></speech>

His business was one of our leading companies around the inclusive business model.  His leadership attracted further leadership, which is very important and shows the need for role modelling and leadership so I thank him personally.</p><p>  In respect of crowd sourcing, Mr. O'Hara referred to organisations like Kanchi and other bigger organisations.  It is the projects that are much smaller.  Stuart McLaughlin's <i>fundit.ie</i> or <i>mycharity.ie</i> are fantastic but changing work in big systems is more difficult from a crowd sourcing perspective for organisations like us.  </p><p>  I thank Senator Conway for his very kind words.  I would like to point out that Mr. Whelton is named as one of Forbes' movers and shakers under 30 so let us note that there is a global leader sitting right beside us.  In respect of mergers, while the Government is looking at new types of initiatives to fund, it should go to SEI and Ashoka and see what is already going on out there before it funds them.  We heard of a new initiative which is pretty much the same as one of our initiatives.  We were more than happy to share and could have reduced those costs and ensured the learning was passed on.  The Government needs to go to these types of organisations and see what is happening before it funds.  A market analysis needs to be carried out prior to funding.  </p></speech>

There is a lack of skilled IT professionals in certain areas who can volunteer.  People with technical skills and programmers would often come to the cities which again relates to the global issue of depopulation.  While starting with a small number of technical volunteers, one of the core beliefs is getting kids to teach other kids.  Once a kid gets to a sufficient level of knowledge and ability, he or she will teach the other kids in his or her club, which will create an ever-growing cycle.</p> <p>We are seeing this in Cork where there are 14 year olds teaching 12 year olds.  It has become a great system and frees up the time of volunteers to help other bases to set up.  It is an issue we have noted.  We are trying to address areas that do not have volunteers or which have a large amounts of volunteers.  As we are getting ready to move into Africa to start teaching in developing economies, we have been examining the delivering of content and help on Skype, etc., and looking at the work of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.  The children have a programme.  As their economies develop, they will have a technological boom from which they will have the skills to benefit.  We are considering how to deliver content and provide for teaching in remote areas to spawn similar clubs there.  I will also be happy to speak with Senators afterwards.</p></speech>

We have heard many powerful stories of individual entrepreneurs and seen examples.  We have heard about the context in which social entrepreneurship occurs within Ireland and internationally.  We have heard about Ashoka, the originator of the social entrepreneurship movement, and One Foundation which has been the stimulus for bringing it to Ireland.  We are Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and our job is to support social entrepreneurs.  Having everyone as a social entrepreneur would be a disaster and we do not want that.  There are lots of skills, talents and contributions to society and the country.  Just as we do not want every single person to be a business entrepreneur, though a significant incidence is necessary, we do not want everyone to work within a larger corporate environment or be in the arts.  We want people in all of these sectors.  That is critical.  While we do not want everyone to be a social entrepreneur, we want and need some to do it.  One of the themes to emerge in the last couple of hours of discussion has been that social entrepreneurs play a critical role in developing society and moving it forward.</p><p>  Ms Deirdre Mortell and Mr. Paul O'Hara referred to social entrepreneurs as the inspiration for change-making among people in general.  Social Entrepreneurs Ireland started in 2004.  We have talked about the great initiative, Change Nation, which was run by Ashoka and saw 50 solutions from abroad.  I am not a very complicated person and think of Change Nation as the IDA of social entrepreneurship.  Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and Ashoka - through its Irish fellows - are more akin to Enterprise Ireland.  The indigenous talent is really strong.  We have fantastic individuals with powerful ideas who are changing Ireland daily.  To realise that potential and be able to find solutions to the entrenched environmental and social challenges we face, we must be able to support these individuals and develop their ideas.  That is where Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and Ashoka come in.  We fund early stage projects.</p><p>  We have spoken a great deal about the necessity for both growth capital and early stage investment.  Our view is that money in and of itself is not the solution.  While it is an important part of the solution, if we write a cheque and walk away, the money will not be used very effectively.  We can see the analogies in the commercial sector.  Where private or State agencies invest in early stage commercial entrepreneurs, they do not simply write a cheque and disappear for a year before coming back to ask, "What are you doing?"  A set of training and mentoring activities is built up around these entrepreneurs to ensure they are effective and help to grow their organisations.  That is the job of Social Entrepreneurs Ireland which runs an awards programme.  On Monday of this week we closed our call for applications for this year.  We have &euro;500,000 in direct funding that we are going to disburse this year to eight social entrepreneurs and their projects.  At the top level, we will invest &euro;130,000 in three early stage projects.  Typically, we are the first funder into these organisations.  We will invest &euro;22,000 in five of the projects.  On top of that financial investment, we build an intense programme of training and support to help social entrepreneurs move their projects forward.  We discussed social entrepreneurs working on alcohol issues and one of the people referred to was Ms Frances Black.  We were the first funder of her RISE foundation.  With our support, RISE has extended its reach to people nationally.  Frances Black is not in attendance because she is on a fund-raising trip to the United States of America which we financed to have the necessary growth capital which her organisation is struggling to find to continue to grow and expand.</p><p>  We know that this stuff works.  We see internationally from the statistics of the Ashoka network that there are 3,000 social entrepreneurs.  It is a fantastic resource to be able to look at to see what works and what does not.  We can also see it in Ireland.  In the past seven years we have invested in 161 social entrepreneurs.  We have raised and written cheques for more than &euro;4.9 million for their projects and have not received or sought any State funding.  It is all money that has been raised privately.  Every year we examine the impact our social entrepreneurs have.  Another question that arose was how this stuff was measured.  Those 161 social entrepreneurs have had a direct impact on more than 200,000 lives in Ireland.  They do not just change lives, they contribute to the real economy.  There is a win on all fronts.  They have created over 800 employment opportunities in full-time, part-time and contract work within their organisations.  We see fantastic leverage also.  People want to invest in success.  Having Ashoka or Social Entrepreneurs Ireland behind someone gives him or her credibility.  In the past 12 months every social entrepreneur in whom we have invested has been able to raise for every euro from us an average of &euro;10.83 for his or her project.  While he or she would raise some of that money anyway, the programme of support we provide is critical to upskill and build capacity which makes him or her much more effective at his or her job.  Making him or her more effective is not the end goal but the impact he or she will have on real people's lives.  The Seanad committee will hear from one other social entrepreneur when I finish.  The impact is real and tangible.</p><p>  We are very interested in supporting individual projects.  Our success is entirely based on the success of our social entrepreneurs.  We only exist to help to make their projects happen.  While we need to get behind individual projects, we must also create an environment that will allow the sector to grow and thrive and realise its potential.  That is critical.  Money is an important element of creating that environment, but it is not the only one.  We have talked about mergers and acquisitions and replication and duplication in the sector.  It is encouraging that a large group of organisations operating in the social enterprise space have coalesced to form a task force - the social enterprise and entrepreneurship task force.  We do not want to compete with each other for attention or have a purely narrow self-interested organisational focus in our conversations.  We want to build a sector that will include more people like Mr. James Whelton, Ms Caroline Casey and Ms Frances Black.  We want to see the sector grow and thrive.  There is great potential and we are not only looking for the Government to support us.</p> <p>We want to see that sector growing.  There is huge potential because not only are we looking to Government to support us but to the corporate sector.  As Deirdre said there has been a major withdrawal of philanthropic funding following the exit of the One Foundation and The Atlantic Philanthropies.  The corporate sector will not replace that money but the amount it gives in Ireland is way below average for a developed country.  Corporates by and large want to contribute but they need to find how to do that in a way that makes sense for them.  One of the interesting things about social entrepreneurship is that it speaks their language.  We are talking about entrepreneurs and they understand that.  Social entrepreneurship can provide a very interesting bridge between the social and not-for-profit sectors and supporters of Ashoka and our organisation are beginning to build that.</p><p> Many exciting things are happening but in order to realise all of this potential we need money and other things.  The social enterprise and entrepreneurship task force came up with a set of specific recommendations.  These are real, tangible issues that the Legislature could move forward.  I will outline a couple which are specific, realisable and do not require budget allocations.  The first is that we need the Government to focus specifically on this sector.  We want there to be a Minister of State with responsibility for social entrepreneurship and social enterprise.  This is not a matter of finding money but of developing policies to create the environment that allows the social entrepreneurs to grow and thrive.  Our view is that the most logical place for that to happen is within the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation because that is its role.  There is a conversation in government about where that should sit.  Should it sit with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or in one of the big spending Departments?  This concerns entrepreneurship and enterprise and the journey that social entrepreneurs go on is the same whether they are commercial or social.  The expertise and all the resources are in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We would really like to see some momentum and support to move that agenda forward.</p><p> The second recommendation is that we would like to see social entrepreneurs and enterprises getting access to State supports.  We do not understand why our people cannot get access to the non-financial support provided by the county and city enterprise boards and the Enterprise Ireland mentoring schemes.  Our work contributes to the real economy, creates better communities and helps vulnerable people.  Why does the State not make those existing resources available to social entrepreneurs?</p><p> The third recommendation stems from the fact that regulations preclude credit unions from lending to social enterprises and entrepreneurs.  That legislation should be changed because the credit unions could provide the capital and funding which is such a critical element of our work.  We would also like to see community or social benefit clauses added to the State tendering process.  That does not cost any money but it would use that tendering process to contribute to communities.</p><p> The last point is that we would like to see an educational environment that supports and encourages this work.  There have been some encouraging developments along these lines.  Social Entrepreneurs Ireland funded Educate Together to develop a teaching module on social entrepreneurship for every class from junior infants up to sixth class.  Our criteria were that it had to be made freely available to every primary school teacher in the country, not just to Educate Together.  Those modules exist.  All we need is for the Department of Education and Skills to promote them.  They are not being used enough because teachers do not know enough about them.  DCU has taken a leadership role at third level by launching the first masters programme in social enterprise.  It is running at the Ryan Academy for Entrepreneurship which is affiliated with DCU and 40 people will soon be the first masters graduates in social enterprise in this country.</p><p> The potential is enormous.  There are organisations and individual social entrepreneurs that change lives daily.  Support organisations like ours and Ashoka create the environment for these people but we cannot take this journey alone.  Without support we will leave potential on the table which will leave vulnerable people without the supports and solutions to problems that they might otherwise get.  We need money but we also need an enabling environment.  This House has a tremendous opportunity to help us and together we can move the agenda forward and get the Government to take on board some of the non-financial measures, thereby creating the potential for much greater change.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Gallagher" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100014#N00300"><p>I thank the Senators for the invitation to speak here, particularly Senators Mac Conghail, Quinn and Healy Eames for organising this event.  It is important for us to see our work recognised in this way and to see it finally on the political agenda.</p><p>  I am here to give a flavour of some of the work that Sean has talked about.  Women for Election won the Social Entrepreneurs Ireland impact award in 2011, one of its higher level awards, worth &euro;200,000 over two years in a mixture of cash and business support.  I hope I manage to communicate in my speech the value of that award.  It was unbelievable and overwhelming for us to be able to step from an idea about something that we knew could and would work to actually going out and doing it.  That is what Social Entrepreneurs Ireland did for us.</p><p>  I know that the women in the room are familiar with Women for Election.  Our organisation inspires and equips women to succeed in politics.  We do that through tailored training, mentoring and support programmes for women who want to take the step from interest in politics to action.  We do this because we have a vision of an Ireland with a balanced participation of women and men in political life.  Michelle O'Donnell Keating, my business partner, and I really believe what Paul O'Hara said about social entrepreneurs solving big social problems.  One of the biggest problems facing the country, and it has faced it for several decades, is the desperate lack of balance in our political system.  That results in a lack of women's voices in this House and more seriously in the D&aacute;il which is a failure to employ our country's talent in making decisions that matter and impact on all of us.  In the D&aacute;il 15% of elected representatives are women which means that 85% of those making decisions are men.  Representation in the Seanad is better, at 30% but we are still not there.  At local city and county council level the figure is 16%.  We have a long way to go.  Women for Election believes that by providing tailored supports we can push the figure up and bring balance into the decisions that matter.</p><p>  The solution to this problem is a combination of things.  We will not solve it on our own.  The evidence shows that a mix of hard and soft measures will make the difference in getting more women into those roles.  The hard measures are quotas.  I attended a super debate in this House about the legislation on this issue that was passed in the summer.  Senator Ivana Bacik and others championed it from beginning to end.  It is fantastic news but any of us active in this space know that we need more than the quota to make sure that we have a long, strong and really effective change in our politics.</p><p>  The soft measures are training, mentoring and support for the women who are going to stand up and put themselves on the ticket and for the women behind them.</p> <p>We are discussing supporting women from interest to action.  This does not mean that everyone needs to be an elected representative.  It is as Mr. Coughlan stated, in that I could not imagine a more chaotic environment than one in which everyone was a social entrepreneur.  Similarly, it would not be a pretty sight if every woman we met decided to run for election.  Under the interest to action idea, we are supporting women to go through the political pipeline, to get active as canvassers, to become party political activists, to start considering how they could be campaign managers and to examine how their business, community and trade union skills might translate into political life so that it can be richer.</p><p> Since winning the Social Entrepreneurs Ireland award in 2011, Women for Election has run an INSPIRE one-day programme eight times around the country.  It focuses on campaigns, confidence and communications, the three areas with which women told us they wanted support if they were to make the next step.  Some 350 women from political and non-political backgrounds have gone through the programme.  We have seen an interest from women who are leaders in community groups or run their own businesses.  It is an interesting mix of people.</p><p> This year we will launch our three day campaign school, EQUIP, the first campaign school at this level in Ireland.  It is based on a couple of models that run in the US.  It will work intensively with women who will contest the 2014 local and European elections to support them in being the best candidates they can be.</p><p> All of this contributes to the movement of women we are building around Ireland to be part of that change, but what difference will it make?  Women for Election is slightly more abstract than some of the organisations traditionally associated with social entrepreneurship.  We do not fit, silo-like, into education, health or environmental impact.</p><p> We have spent a great deal of time examining the evidence of what difference is made by having more women elected in those countries that have managed to reach the tipping point.  There are four changes: policy, power, priority and process.  In a practical sense, women tend to be more open and transparent in how they conduct politics, for example, by putting the minutes of their meetings on their websites, discussing who they meet and inviting groups not traditionally associated with politics into the political space.  They have a different attitude to power, which is evident across business and communities as well, and they can focus on different priorities at times.</p><p> In terms of policy, we have traditionally stated that women are more focused on issues associated with women's equality and rights.  Last night, however, Women for Election had the privilege of meeting an Australian woman who used to be a Minister in Queensland for a number of years.  She discussed her experience in that Parliament, which had 36% female representation at the time, and the difference that participation made.  Before being elected, all of the discussions she had heard were concerned with women's impact on issues of women's rights.  When she joined the Parliament, though, she saw that women had the greatest impact on gun control.  She stated that it was not a question of the four P's, process, policy, priority and power, but of perspective.  Women bring an entirely different perspective to debates on every issue.  This is the area in which we are working.  The difference is intangible, but important.  This is what Women for Election is about and is what Social Entrepreneurs Ireland recognised.</p><p> We found it difficult to make our case in the initial days of approaching Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and trying to get funding.  We do not fit into a traditional charity bracket.  Ms Michelle O'Donnell Keating and I believe that we are entrepreneurs and that the change we are trying to make will have a significant impact, but it cannot be measured or fit into the grant-making structures.  Grants are awarded to migrant organisations or educational bodies, but Social Entrepreneurs Ireland understood the intangible difference that measures such as ours could make to Ireland.  For this reason, it backed us and we won the award.  I like to believe that we are delivering for Social Entrepreneurs Ireland by trying to make that change, but we will see whether that is the case in the 2014 elections and the general election that follows them.</p><p> I will build on Mr. Coughlan's point about money.  Money is important, but it is not the only part of the solution.  One of the most important aspects of the Social Entrepreneurs Ireland award is the combination of cash and business support.  When we were starting our movement and organisation, all that we could see was our need for money so that we could give up our day jobs and focus on getting everything off the ground.  Instead, the difference has been made by Social Entrepreneurs Ireland, which pulled us back to focus on the milestones that it set with us, concrete business goals of operations, financial, governance and succession planning, and pushed us in terms of the strategic side and meeting our goals.  If we do not meet them, our organisation will flop once the money runs out and we will have made no difference.</p></speech>

I am familiar with Ms Gallagher's terrific work.  She was right to make a point about intangible outcomes.  There will be a tangible outcome in terms of the number of women running for election in 2014.  Measuring the impact of any one organisation on that outcome will be difficult, but Ms Gallagher's organisation is tackling one of the key obstacles to women's progress.  All of the research that anyone involved in this area has done shows this to be the case.  It is a tribute to Social Entrepreneurs Ireland that it saw the potential in Women for Election's work.  I just wanted to make that comment and do not have a question for our guests.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1176" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100015#O00300"><p>I congratulate all of the delegations on the work of One Foundation, Ashoka Ireland, Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and the extraordinary entrepreneurs in attendance as well as their colleagues in the back.  They have had a profound impact on me and my colleagues.  A good number of Senators have attended this meeting beyond the committee's number.  I am certain we will find ways to respond at various levels, be that in the form of legislation, debates or motions.  I thank the delegations for the great contribution they have made today.</p><p>  I wish to ask two questions, the first of which is on funding.  I am aware it is not the only concern, as emphasised by all of our guests.  The issue is one of growth capital, which Ms Mortell and others mentioned, and sustainability capital.  Will they comment on the opportunities for systematising a way of matching growth capital between philanthropic and State money as it comes in and goes out?  I was particularly intrigued by Mr. Coughlan's suggestion on a Department that would be in charge of supporting the development of social entrepreneurship, a matter we have discussed previously.</p><p>  We are moving towards debating the Bill that will establish SOLAS, which will bring together the areas of further education and training.  Yesterday, the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, outlined the various types of pilot funding initiatives that could be found in terms of further education and training.  Do social entrepreneurs have access to this funding?  Many Departments are funding sources for social enterprise.  I am aware of the social innovation fund, the Flannery report and so on, but it is a question of matching growth or sustainability capital as it comes in and goes out.  I would welcome comments in this regard.</p><p>  My second question is on mergers.  Ms Casey, Mr. Coughlan and everyone else touched on this subject.  I was struck by Ms Casey's comments on a need for mapping in the disability or ability sector.  Are our guests developing a template for analysing a mapping of some of the different sectors as a first step towards mergers?  It could be helpful.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100016#P00100"><p>I thank Mr. Coughlan and Ms Gallagher for their presentations.  I agree with Mr. Coughlan that entrepreneurs get this because social entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs with social goals.  However, the enterprise boards do not get it.  I have approached them in regard to a social enterprise.  They continue to see enterprise as they always did.  Would Mr. Coughlan be willing to brief them?  So long as there is a narrow view of enterprise, the social impact and societal good will be lost.</p><p>  It was stated that credit unions are not permitted to fund social enterprise.  That is not quite true.  Credit unions provide support for Leader projects.  Much depends on how a project is presented.  Currently, credit unions provide matching funding for Leader projects.  There is an avenue therein that might be worth looking at.  I would welcome the delegates' comment on whether they have any experience in this area through Leader.  There is a problem in terms of Leader and the multi-annual financial framework.  The next EU multi-annual financial framework is for 2014-2020.  As such, existing Leader funding is probably allocated and by the time the next round is available, it will probably be 2015, which means there will be a gap of two years.  Perhaps the delegates will comment on that matter.  I am aware of a social enterprise requiring this funding.</p><p>  I congratulate Women for Election on its award.  I also congratulate Social Entrepreneurs Ireland for recognising the value of Women for Election.  Ms Gallagher referred to policy, power, priorities and process.  I believe women bring a difference to perspective in a way that influences those four areas.  I do not and never have believed in quotas only.  I support them but do not really believe in them.  For women to make a difference in politics we need a cultural change.  I note the proposed use of quotas to bring about that cultural change.  Cultural acceptance is important.</p><p>  Women for Election is doing great work around helping women trying to get into politics for the first time.  What is it doing around women already in politics who are also experiencing barriers?  We are all only as good as our last election.</p></speech>

The duplication of function is also an issue because there is a danger that one or two organisations would be gotten rid of.  Let us be honest; that is what this about.</p><p>  I have a specific question in regard to procurement.  I am currently involved in research of Departments' support of local business in terms of their purchase of Irish produce and services versus import of produce and services.  I am trying to get around the EU laws around procurement and look at this from a social conscience aspect.  I would welcome comment by the delegates on that matter.</p><p>  Ms Gallagher referred to succession planning for women in politics.  Did she mean that women as politicians are less likely to think of succession planning?  I am also interested in the delegates' responses to Senator Healy Eames' questions.  The delegates will be aware of the discussion last weekend at the constitutional convention around tokenism.  There is a danger of quotas and so on leading to tokenism.  It has already been said to me that I will definitely be a candidate in the next general election, not because I might be a good candidate but because more women are needed in politics.  I am interested in the delegates' comment on that matter.</p></speech>

First, I congratulate all of the delegates on their contributions this morning.  This, for me, has been a memorable day in the Seanad.</p><p>  The delegates obviously derive satisfaction from what they do.  Is there any fun for a young man or woman getting involved in social entrepreneurship at an early age?  I recently met a young Irish man who lives in the United States and has been involved in corporate America for the best part of 20 years.  He told me that the seeds of his working for himself had been sown in his mind, and that of his fellow students, 25 years ago by a national school teacher.  While he had gone on to gain third level qualifications, he had been impressed most by the man who made it fun for him to learn and recognised his ability at an early age.  In my view it is important to get the message into the national schools.</p></speech>

My first question is directed to Mr. Coughlan and relates to his organisation's recommendations.  I am aware his organisation has met previously with the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Has there been any indication from the Department that it is looking favourably at the recommendation that a Minister of State be given specific responsibility for this area?  I believe that is where responsibility for it should rest.  I am conscious of the number of jobs created in my area by social entrepreneurs.  There is huge potential in this area.  On the reshaping of the enterprise boards and so on, would Mr. Coughlan see that as a positive development?  Does he believe opportunities will emerge from the restructured enterprise boards, which might be more forward thinking and progressive than has been the case to date?</p><p>  My next question is directed to Mr. Whelton of CoderDojo.  We would all like to see one in our towns, particularly towns in major areas.  How is Mr. Whelton making a living?  I am aware, from his many visits to Leinster House, that he is doing fantastic work.</p> <p>How is he surviving?  What can we do to spread the gospel of CoderDojo in our own communities?</p></speech>

It is great to have others answering questions and it has been a very enlightening few hours.  The witnesses are absolutely wonderful.  If they had two or three messages that we could bring to the Government, what would they be?  I thank the witnesses for their comments and I enjoyed every minute of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100017#Q00400"><p>That is how a question is asked.  It was very concise for which I thank the Senator.  I have a question on the gender balance and focus.  The party to which I belong has a new policy trying to encourage gender balance and I am sure almost all parties have the same idea.  There is a practical difficulty.  When I was in college there were no females in the engineering class and when I studied law, perhaps a tenth of the class were girls, with three or four of them in a class of 30 males.  That has changed naturally and there are now more lady solicitors in Ireland than male solicitors.  There are many female engineers and they are commonly working in councils.</p><p>  Politics, as we know it, is unattractive to people.  I come from Cork and I know from more than 25 years involved in politics that at the level of the town council or the county council, it is almost impossible to get women to get involved.  It is a practical view.  In other words, it is not an exact science.  The legal, medical and engineering professions saw scarce female involvement, for various reasons, when I was in college in the early 1970s.  There has been an evolution but there has been no natural development like that in Irish politics.  It is not an attractive career for many reasons.  The quota system can be dangerous as we could end up with people working in politics not because it is their passion rather because they are being pushed into it.</p><p>  I will finish up this module.  There was a kite flown by Senator Mullins at the rear.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100017#Q00500"><p>I will touch on a couple of the questions.  The question was asked about developments with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have seen significant interest within the Department at a political level and we are unsure at a departmental level where things stand.  It is interesting that from what we have heard, it appears we need no more than two or three civil servants within the Department to be assigned to this in order to allow it to happen.  It is a sizeable Department and there is a large cadre of civil servants in it.  From the outside, using two to three civil servants does not seem like a massive ask.</p><p>  There are no formal developments on the political side yet but in the jobs plan a report was commissioned by Forf&aacute;s to report on the potential for social enterprise around job creation.  That is with the Government but it has not yet been published.  That will contain a series of recommendations and we met personnel from Forf&aacute;s when it drafted the report and gave our perspective, as did others on the social enterprise and entrepreneurship task force.  We are hopeful that this will be largely positive and we are awaiting developments.</p><p>  This leads to questions about the enterprise boards and whether we will brief them.  We would jump at such a chance.  If we brief the boards, it would be one conversation, but if we go with representatives of the Department, with the idea that it is part of our remit to perform such briefings, it would be a very different conversation in changing the thinking around enterprise boards.  The two ideas are linked in that sense.</p><p>  I may be incorrect and I am happy to be corrected but my information is that social enterprise has many legal structures but credit unions are precluded from investing in organisations with charitable status or companies limited by guarantee with no shared capital.  Those are two particular legal structures.  Credit unions, as far as I am aware, cannot lend to those specific types of structures and institutions.  The real challenge is that the vast majority of credit unions are set up in those structures.  Although there are ways in which credit unions can lend to social enterprises, the movement is probably not open to the vast majority of social enterprises, which is a challenge.</p><p>  The question on mergers and acquisitions was very interesting.  My day job is chief executive of Social Entrepreneurs Ireland and I am also chairman of The Wheel, a national representative body for the community and voluntary sector.  It is one of the organisations in the community and voluntary pillar in discussions with the Government.  We have many discussions about this not just in social entrepreneurship but in the wider sector.  There are challenges and we referred earlier to organisations not being personality-led.  One of the challenges around mergers and acquisitions is that if the process is personality-led, a person may feel it is personal rather than the right thing to do.  There are some cultural or attitude challenges around that.</p><p>  We have seen some very positive examples, with one of the effects of the current economic climate being that those conversations are coming more to the fore.  We had Volunteer Centres Ireland and Volunteer Ireland as an example.  I know people involved in both and they have been very clear about the difference between them.  Unless one ate, drank and slept volunteering, they nevertheless looked very similar from the outside.  In a positive action, they merged into one organisation to promote volunteering in this country.  Those sorts of example must become more common; we spoke of the importance of role models in social entrepreneurship but role models in this area would also be very beneficial.  There are challenges in merging because of much organisational cost.  One must work through negotiations and if we are really interested in promoting this process, it might be good to have a fund to support mergers and acquisitions.  It would get people interested.</p><p>  There was a question on procurement and EU laws.  We must be in compliance with EU regulations.  If we include social clauses in the tendering process, the likelihood is that organisations that can meet those social clauses or score highly in them are more likely to be indigenous rather than organisations outside the State.  They will understand the context, and social clauses are all about local social issues.  That might be a way of at least encouraging companies in competitively tendering while doing good in the world.</p><p>  There is the idea of making this fun.  Senators should understand from our comments that we are passionate about this process and we believe in it because we see the results.  We get up every morning and look forward to going to work.  We try to speak about this; we are doing it in this forum but we can also do that in the media.  We must get around what we call being worthy but dull, WBD.</p> <p>Change Nation, for example, was a huge event in that sense.  It created energy, excitement and enthusiasm, and Paul O'Hara and Ashoka Ireland did an amazing job.  The fun element comes into that category.  We have to start projecting that while it is all good, it is a great journey as well.  There are many very interesting organisations among young people.  There is the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, which the One Foundation has supported.  It is doing great work in getting young people, particularly in transition year, to think about setting up their own micro businesses.  There is also Young Social Innovators which was set up by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, one of Ireland's great social entrepreneurs.  It has a 50% footprint in secondary schools throughout the country.  Initiatives such as those should be encouraged.</p><p> The last issue was opportunities in terms of the State and the private sector coming together.  The One Foundation has shown real leadership in this.  Perhaps Deirdre would discuss it.  From my perspective and from the examples I am aware of anecdotally, one of the things that One Foundation has done very successfully, along with Atlantic Philanthropies, is use that combination of private and State money on the basis of a clear strategic plan in terms of what it wants to be achieved and invest it in the performing organisations rather than the ones that are struggling, because that is where one will get results.  It has been able to broker those co-investments.  That brokerage function is critical to maximising the benefit we get from the investment.  Does Deirdre wish to comment?</p></speech>

If we have time, we will get to that.  I have been in the Chamber since 10.20 a.m. without a break.  If you like, we can break for half an hour and resume, but there will not be many Members here.  There were some questions for Ms Gallagher and if there is time later, we can return to it.</p></speech>

I agree with her point about quotas.  Our strong position is that quotas are part of the solution but not the entire solution.  That is why we have built and structured our organisation around training, mentoring and support.  We are very much focused on building a movement of women throughout the country to try to influence this change and be part of it.  Part of that is the critical mass and the numbers that will start to influence the cultural shift the Senator was discussing.  The other part that is important is developing our male support base.  We are looking at that this year.  I have met a huge number of men, both in politics and outside, who want to be part of this movement because they recognise the different perspectives and the value they add.  I could see many of the men nodding when I spoke about this.  While we are getting there, the Senator's point is very well made.</p><p>  What we are doing for women who are elected is also an important part of it.  As Social Entrepreneurs Ireland awardees, we work quite intensively on business planning.  We are not trying to do everything in year one, but what we are really anxious to do in the next number of years is look at how we might work with elected women.  We are focused on the next local elections in 2014 and we will support a number of women who will be candidates.  We will not drop them the day they get elected.  In fact, we would love to have a big session for them a couple of days after the election to try to work with them on what they are expecting.  We will refer back to the Senator about that.  I thank her for flagging it and I will put that down as a demand from elected representatives.</p><p>  Senator Noone asked a question about succession.  I was referring to Caroline's point about succession planning for social entrepreneurs.  When there is a founder and if that person wishes to move on, it can be difficult for the organisation.  It is one of things on which social entrepreneurs work with us.</p></speech>

That point came from the floor and it was one with which I was not as familiar, that women do not necessarily plan for succession to their seat in the same way men do.  It is something I must think about in the women's re-election piece as well.</p><p>  The other point the Senator made was about tokenism.  We hear that a great deal.  My heart sinks when I hear it because I only ever hear it with regard to women.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-02-21a.1146" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Niamh Gallagher" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/PCJ2013022100018#R00700"><p>I find it difficult to engage in the discussion about it.  If one is really honest and looked at candidates that are run throughout the country for different geographical reasons and so forth, there are a number of token candidates.  If we are going to talk about tokenism, let us look at the various reasons that tokenism exists, not just where there are female candidates.  In my experience and in view of the women we have met through the programme so far, it will be very difficult to make that point at the next election.  There are many women getting geared up for that election, so let us wait and see.</p><p>  Senator Mullins raised the point about making a living and Senator Brennan asked if there was any fun involved.  It is brilliant to get up in the morning and work on a thing one cares passionately about and on which one really wants to work.  It is a huge privilege for anybody to get the opportunity to do that.  However, Senator Mullins asked about making a living.  That is a really important point.  We make a living because Social Entrepreneurs Ireland supports us, along with the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, the Ireland Funds and the Equality Authority.  Our programmes generate a significant proportion of our income, but not all of it.  There does come a point when it stops being fun, when one is so worried about how one will make a living that one cannot bring that passion to one's work.  That links back to what Deirdre was talking about earlier with regard to growth capital and building organisations that are sustainable.  One does not want people such as Caroline and James, and all the other awardees, beaten down and no longer enjoying it because of those challenges.</p><p>  Finally, on the point the Leas-Chathaoirleach made about trying to find the women, we hear a great deal that women are not inclined to find politics as attractive as men do.  It appears to be the last bastion, in a way, of this level of imbalance.  He referred to law, engineering and other areas, but politics has not caught up at the same pace as those.  The report of Senator Ivana Bacik and the Oireachtas committee on women's participation in politics looks at the barriers and classifies them as the five Cs - cash, culture, child care, candidate selection and confidence.  Confidence is the one that emerges a great deal with the women we have been meeting around the country.  It appears that more persuasion is required to encourage women to recognise the ambition within themselves and be strong enough to declare that they can and will do it.  Our experience is that with our support they become more inclined to be able to make that leap.  Not only do they recognise that there is an organisation to support them, but they are in a room with 50 other women who have also started to name this ambition.  One begins to see some peer support.  We talked about role modelling in respect of social entrepreneurs but there have been few female role models in this space, so it was difficult for them to relate to other women.</p><p>  The other aspect is a lack of good news stories.  We hear a great deal about the long hours of D&aacute;il sittings, but there are 25 women in the D&aacute;il.  Over 1,000 local, county and city council seats throughout the country are filled by women and many of those women would say it is quite a positive experience to be able to marry their family and home life with their role as a local councillor in their community.  We should not just see women in politics as women in the D&aacute;il but tell some more of those other stories.</p></speech>

I wish to refer also to Senator Zappone's question about the interaction between State and philanthropic funding.  It is very important, but we have under-utilised that tool both ways.</p> <p>State funders have under-utilised the tool in terms of bringing and inviting philanthropies to come to the table and co-fund services or other initiatives and philanthropy has underutilised the tool in terms of bringing the State to the table.  It is something we could all do much more.</p><p> Speaking from my experience, One Foundation is ten years old and typically agreed three-year contracts with our grantees.  The final three-year contracts, which generally were negotiated between 2008 and 2010, focus very explicitly on what we call leverage.  We know in advance the spending will end because we will close, so we focused on how to bring other funders to the table at an earlier stage to make the transition easier.  I spoke about BeLonG To, and its final year's money of &euro;150,000 was conditional on it matching the amount through fund-raising.  I am thrilled to state it hit the fund-raising target in December 2012 and we have released another &euro;150,000 for the organisation for this year.  This is an example where the State had already stepped up.  BeLonG To needed to build its fund-raising skills and capacity, and needed to start practising early and not wait until we were gone and putting the incentive in place worked.  State funders could speak to philanthropists and there could be much more dialogue at all levels.  As actors we are very siloed and we could have much more reaching across the divide.  At present it is not built into the structures in any way.</p><p> The social innovation fund is intended to be 50:50 funding between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and private philanthropy money to be raised.  The initial funding committed from the Department is &euro;5 million.  This needed to be matched by &euro;5 million from philanthropy.  This is now built into the next stage, assuming it gets off the ground.</p><p> My recommendations to the committee are to support the social innovation fund, ask questions, drive it forward and put pressure on the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to deliver.  I am sure he will, but the more support he feels he gets, particularly cross-party support, will help.  We have spoken about growth capital and committee members have heard how important it is.  Everyone here is agreed.  Mr. Se&aacute;n Coughlan mentioned the recommendations from the social enterprise and social entrepreneurship task force.  These are small things which are very easy to do but they need to happen.  They work across Departments which always makes it harder to deliver.  I encourage all committee members to take an interest.  The committee should back Change Nation.</p><p> We can export these initiatives.  We do not have to just import them.  We can bring in fantastic international initiatives, but we have global world-class social innovations in this country which are not being exported at the scale they should be because they struggle to get off the ground in the first place.  For&oacute;ige, in our portfolio, was recognised by UNESCO this year.  Its leadership programme for young people is officially world-class.  BeLonG To has been recognised as world-class and it is only ten years old.  It spoke at a UNESCO conference this year and was presented as official best practice.  We have many others, including the people here.  We can hold our heads high but we need to get behind them and help push them out.  We can be very proud but there is more we can do.</p></speech>

A total of 28 Senators attended the Chamber at some stage or another which is almost half of its membership.  This is more than usual so the witnesses have attracted much attention and had a very captive audience.  I thank everyone for being here for almost three hours.</p></speech>
