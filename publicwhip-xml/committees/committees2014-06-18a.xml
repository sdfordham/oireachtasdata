If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements you have submitted will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I remind the witnesses and those in the Gallery that we are requested by the broadcasting and recording services to turn off our mobile phones or to put them on airplane, safe or flight mode as otherwise they will interfere with the recording.<br />In recent times concern has arisen on the part of pupils, parents, teachers and communities over plans to open, close or amalgamate schools in a number of locations, including in Cork and Dublin.  The reasons for these plans are varied, including the numbers of enrolments, duplication of facilities and moves to divest responsibility for schools or to have a greater range of patrons.  We will look at this next week when representatives of the Archdiocese of Dublin have been invited in.  I advise the representatives of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust that this is part of an ongoing review of the issue.  To assist our committee to consider the concerns that arise I am pleased to welcome the representatives of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust: Mr. Patrick B. Diggins, chairperson of directors; Mr. Gerry Bennett, chief executive; Ms Louise Callaghan; Mr. Tony McCann; and Ms Helen O'Brien.  I invite Mr. Bennett to make his presentation.</p></speech>

Mr. Patrick B. Diggins is the chairperson of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  Three members of the executive are here: Ms Louise Callaghan, Ms Helen O'Brien and Mr. Tony McCann.  I work as the chief executive of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  We are delighted to be here and we would be most willing to provide the committee with any assistance we can.</p><p>  The Edmund Rice Schools Trust has responsibility for 96 schools, secondary and primary, in the Republic of Ireland.  The trust advises and supports its schools and their students, teachers, principals and voluntary boards of management, members, directors and staff in line with our charter.

The new trust was established in May 2008 and on 1 September 2008 it became operational.</p><p>  The Edmund Rice primary and secondary schools are Catholic schools whose unique characteristic spirit is expressed in the Edmund Rice Schools Trust charter.  The role of the trust is to uphold our ethos and provide Catholic education in the spirit of Edmund Rice for the people of Ireland.  Our schools are open and inclusive; many are DEIS schools and are committed to serving the communities in which they are located.</p><p>  I will first deal with primary schools and the role of trustees and patron under the Education Act.  The legal role of the patron is set out in section 8 of the Education Act 1998.  The patron appoints the board of management which manages the school on his behalf.  In the case of the majority of primary Catholic schools and parish schools, the patron is the local bishop.  The patron of our 34 primary national schools in the Edmund Rice Schools Trust is the local bishop and not the trust.</p><p>  As trustees of the primary schools, our role mainly relates to ownership of the schools and to the characteristic spirit, that is Catholic education in the Edmund Rice tradition.  The patron has a legal role which includes the appointment of the board of management, the determining of the future status of a school, including deciding if it is to become co-educational, single-sex, to amalgamate with other schools, close, etc.</p> <p>All such decisions are carried out after full consultation at local, trustee and patron level and with the final agreement of the Minister for Education and Skills.<br />The Edmund Rice Schools Trust is a trustee of 34 primary schools but patron of none.  Therefore, it does not make decisions in respect of the future of any of the 34 primary national recognised schools under the Act.  The patron alone has the power to appoint and dissolve the board and to determine the status of a school and approve the appointment of the principal.  As primary trustees, we hold none of the functions of patron as outlined in the Act.<br /><b></b>On ownership of primary school property, most of our primary school properties are owned by the Edmund Rice Schools Trust and subject to vesting leases.  The leases, as with any other school vesting lease, are in standard terms, and essentially comprise the Minister&rsquo;s security in respect of grant moneys provided for capital grants to the school.  As per the charitable objects set out in our memorandum and articles of association, ERST seeks to ensure and foster the advancement of education and to further the aims and purposes of Catholic education in the Edmund Rice tradition in colleges, schools and other educational projects in Ireland and, generally, to further the interests of Catholic education in Ireland and around the world.  Therefore, any property transactions must be in furtherance of the main objects of the Edmund Rice Schools Trust.  Further, ERST is obliged to apply all of its assets, including any real property such as school sites, and also other property, including the proceeds of the sale of school sites, towards its objects.  The disposal of ERST property is currently subject to the regulations of the charity commissioners, who require that any disposal of charitable property be at market value.<br /><b></b>On the role of ERST in relation to its 60 voluntary secondary schools, patronage structures are similar to primary schools, but the trust is the patron, as outlined in section 8 of the Education Act, of our 60 secondary schools.  The Trust appoints the board, makes decisions on the future of schools and is responsible for the characteristic spirit, finance and property of the schools.  Decisions on the future of a school are made following a process of consultation at local level, with other trustees, diocesan offices and the Department of Education and Skills.  Many of our second level schools are currently oversubscribed.  We have a number of DEIS schools, which provide a unique service to the communities where many young people are vulnerable, disaffected and in need of specialist support.  Our schools provide examples of best practice in educational provision, attendance strategies and advocacy for those who are marginalised.  Parents of approximately 36,000 students choose our schools. <br />The Edmund Rice Schools Trust provides a network of support for all its school communities.  Examples of best practice are shared, newly appointed principals and deputies are mentored and boards of management are provided with ongoing advice and support.  In the norm, our schools are managed by an eight-person board of management which carries out dedicated work on behalf of the trustees, with reference to the legal requirements and in the service of their school community in a voluntary capacity.  The trust is served on its boards of management by a unique group of skilled management personnel, past pupils, parents and teachers.  It is our belief that the sacrifices made by these volunteers should be properly acknowledged, valued and affirmed in more practical ways by the Department and Education and Skills and society as a whole.  We can never afford to take these volunteers who manage our schools for granted.  The trust has a major role in sourcing board members, training them for office and building a strong network among all those associated with or involved in our schools.<br /><b></b>An area of concern for ERST is funding into the future for secondary schools.<b></b>The State contributes less to children in voluntary schools than it does to those in VEC schools or community or comprehensive schools.  In 2013, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, produced a substantial report entitled Governance and Funding of Voluntary Secondary Schools in Ireland<i>.  </i>This report advised that in 2011-2012 there were 722 second level schools in Ireland, catering for 359,047 students.  Of these, 52% were voluntary secondary schools, 35% were vocational schools and 13% were community or comprehensive schools.  The ESRI findings indicate a disparity in the funds available to and the costs to be covered by voluntary, vocational and community or comprehensive schools.  It is clear that voluntary secondary schools receive a significantly lower proportion of funding from the State and, as a result, are more reliant on voluntary contributions from parents and on general fund-raising.  <br />An area of inequality is the funding of the trustee function.  Trustees of schools have duties that are identified in the Education Act 1998.  The trustees of any school promote and protect its ethos and philosophy.  At least some elements of the trusteeship function of VECs, now ETBs, are funded through the block grant, and the centralisation of specialist services and expertise at VEC level reduces the need for specialist legal and finance capacities at school level.  In contrast, the trusteeship function of voluntary secondary schools is paid for by religious orders or the education trust companies directly by providing support to schools and indirectly through the provision of specialist expertise on a voluntary basis.<br /><b></b>Article 42.3.1&deg; of the Constitution states: &quot;The State shall not oblige parents in violation of their conscience and lawful preference to send their children to schools established by the State, or to any particular type of school designated by the State.&quot;  The Edmund Rice Schools Trust will therefore promote diversity in our schools and excellence in educational provision and provide ongoing support, particularly for marginalised and disadvantaged communities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014061800004#D00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee to discuss this issue.  Obviously, I have an interest in this matter because of the proposed amalgamation of North Monastery primary school in Cork with another school.  I have listened with interest to what Mr. Bennett had to say in relation to primary schools, namely, that the ERST is the trustee but not the patron.  I do not know if anybody has yet said that to the bishop of Cork, because at the time it was proposed to amalgamate the two schools and to close the North Monastery primary school, he stated on several occasions to local media, parents and at public meetings that he was not the patron of the school.  One can understand, then, from where the confusion arises.  We were told that the proposal to close the North Monastery primary school had come from the ERST.  Mr. Bennett will be aware that there is a primary school and a secondary school on the campus about which we are speaking.  Despite the fact that both are located on one campus, the ERST is patron of the secondary school but not of the primary school.</p> <p>There is a still a lot of confusion in Cork on the future of the North Mon primary school and I hope that we can clear up some of it today.</p><p> One of the reasons given at the time for the proposed amalgamation of the school with St. Vincent's primary school was falling school numbers at the North Mon.  There is currently a proposal by parents to enrol junior enfants which has the support of the teaching staff at the North Mon.  As the delegation will be aware, the North Mon only enrols from first class upwards but there is a move to rectify the situation which would address some falling numbers.  Obviously the initiative would have a knock-on effect for primary schools in the area such as North Presentation so there must be discussion on the matter.  </p><p> I ask the delegation to take me through what is the crux of the matter.  We did not have this meeting at the time, which is unfortunate, because people were unavailable.  Therefore, we are still not clear in Cork about the future of the North Mon primary school.  We know that any proposal, at this time, to amalgamate or close the primary school is off the table.  However, we do not know whether discussions are taking place in the background between the patron and the trustees on the future of the primary campus.  We know that there are moves in regard to the second school in terms of intake.  This year three sixth classes will leave the school this year but there are only two classes coming in at a time when there is a desire and demand for three classes, not just from the local community, but also from the teaching staff and principal of the school.  As a result, some students have not been accepted into the North Mon Aonad Gaelach secondary school and have been forced to find educational needs in schools elsewhere, outside of the community.  </p><p> At every opportunity, when these questions were asked, particularly of ERST, we were told that it was an issue for the bishop.  When we asked him we were told it was an issue for ERST.  Parents did not get answers.  Confusion has been generated because ERST is the patron of the secondary school but not of the primary school.  There may have been cross-wires regarding this issue.  The bishop has said that he is not the patron and ERST is saying that it is not the patron but both schools are on the one campus.  The confusion over the matter has fed into uncertainly in the community.  </p><p> Let me turn to a wider issue.  Is it true that the proposals to amalgamate or close the primary schools under the trusteeship of ERST do not come from ERST but the bishop, school staff or the community?  Is it true that ERST does not put forward proposals to close or amalgamate primary schools?  Obviously if a proposal is made to the board of ERST it will be considered.</p><p> Finally, I seek information on the consultation process that would be undertaken on foot of a proposal to amalgamate or close a primary school.  What has happened in Cork is unfortunate and lessons must be learned by everyone, including ourselves and ERST.  In that situation the principals of the four schools were called to a meeting and told that the North Mon primary school was closing, that a decision had been made by ERST to close it and the bishop's hands were tied.  That is what was said.  A campaign was then undertaken to reverse the decision.  It could have been avoided if people had been aware of the process which should be undertaken if a proposal is made.   Where did the proposal come from?  Was it from ERST or from the bishop?</p></speech>

As we said earlier, we do not have the authority to sanction an amalgamation at primary level.  That is the duty of the patron who is the bishop.  We are the trustees and are not the patron.  We do not have that authority at all.  We are part of a process for determining the future of a school.  As trustees, we have absolutely no authority to instigate or decide on the matter.</p><p>  The overarching principle that should permeate all considerations is the educational needs and benefits of young people.  That principle should permeate all considerations regarding proposed reconfigurations.  The objective of an amalgamation is to provide an enhanced learning environment for the students, in any situation.  The students and their needs should be at the base of this matter.  Let us take one aspect at a time, if we can disentangle them.</p><p>  First, for those who are not aware of the campus.  The North Monastery campus has three schools, Scoil Mhuire Fatima primary school, the Aonad Gaelach gaelscoil and the North Monastery, an English speaking secondary school.  All three schools are located on the North Monastery campus.</p><p>  With regard to Scoil Mhuire Fatima North Monastery, the chronology is as follows.  We do not normally go to a board of management looking for an amalgamation.  That is not what we do, as trustees.  Normally, a board of management would come to us and we would provide advice and assistance to the board of management in terms of progression, how best to improve their school, if that is the case, how best to communicate the good practice of their school, etc.  Generally speaking, we do not go to a board of management to look for change.  It is the other way around.  A board of management will normally come to the trustees.  That is the universal situation.  There may be one or two exceptions but I do not know of any.</p><p>  The board of management of Scoil Mhuire Fatima North Mon came to us, as trustees, and applied to first introduce enfant streams to its school.  It came to us, in the first instance.  We wrote to the patron in support of the request.  The patron requested that we consult with other trustees at that time. Subsequently and very shortly afterwards, the patron turned down the request for the Scoil Mhuire Fatima school to become co-educational or take in enfants.  That is the decision for the patron.  The reason being, we assume, that it would affect the other two primary schools located in close proximity to the school - St. Vincent's school and the Presentation school which are both girls schools.  We assume that was the reason given.</p><p>  The patron said "No" so we turned down the request.  We requested a further consideration and the patron requested that we would consult further around the provision of Catholic education in the area.  Therefore, we supported the school, went to the patron, but the patron said the other trustees in the area should be consulted.  The four trustees in the area are ERST, the Sisters of Charity, the Presentation Sisters and the diocese itself.  The negotiations, or discussions, got under way.  Then a proposal was drawn up and presented to the board of management of the four schools, at the same time, by the four sets of trustees for discussion among their boards of management and parents.  The boards of management were asked to supervise the consultation process with their own teachers, board, parents and school communities.</p> <p>It was given a fairly short timeframe - I think it was 7 February - to come back to the various trustees with their view on the proposal, presented to them as a proposal by the trustees.</p><p> The trustees do not have the authority to make a decisions.  We were there as part of meeting with Scoil Mhuire Fatima.  The other trustees met with their schools at the very same time on the very same day.  The parents and the board of management of Scoil Mhuire Fatima rejected our proposal and we withdrew the proposal which was up for consideration by the school.  After that, Scoil Mhuire Fatima decided to announce the introduction of infants to the school in September 2014.  This was not in keeping with what the teacher unions, the CPSMA, the patrons and  the trustees had agreed in terms of how to change the status of a school.  There is a process for doing that.  There was a meeting with the patron and the boards of management of the four schools.  Scoil Mhuire Fatima has since withdrawn the proposal of taking in children into junior infants.  The patron has convened a meeting of the boards of management of the three schools and requested the chairs to meet to discuss further proposals.  ERST will consider its support for any proposal that evolves from these meetings.  That is the chronology of what happened.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014061800006#F00200"><p>Where the confusion arises is that initially, there was a proposal to enrol junior and senior infants.   The next thing parents and teachers knew was that there was a proposal, which was presented as a proposal from ERST, to close the school and amalgamate it with St. Vincent's.  Now when that hit the airwaves, there was pandemonium.  We are talking about a school on a campus, which has sports facilities and 250 years in education, and it was being proposed to amalgamate it with St. Vincent's, which does not have a school yard the size of this room.  Nobody knew, or knows, the rationale for that proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Bennett" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014061800006#F00300"><p>I suppose the context of the proposal was around the falling enrolments in the North Cathedral parish.  As we know, there has been a considerable decrease in student population in that parish.  I suppose behind the proposal was an attempt to consolidate Catholic education in that part of Cork and how to go about doing that.  What was proposed to the board of management and the teachers was not a decision but a proposal to go to the school, the board, the teachers and so on and to come back to us in a very short period of time to see whether it was acceptable and if not, to come up with alternative proposals.</p></speech>

Nobody has answered those questions.  What Mr. Bennett has told me is that what happened was that there was a proposal to address the falling enrolment numbers by allowing the school to enrol junior and senior infants.  That was turned down by the patron.  Nobody has given a reason for that.  I agree it is probably because of the knock-on effect on the Presentation school and St. Vincent's and that is a real concern for those particular girls' schools.  However, we got from that situation to a proposal being presented to the school to close the very school which has a long tradition of education and which is on an educational campus.  The school building was just going to be left idle.  There was talk about moving Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers into that school building but I do not know whether that was the case or what was the proposal for the school building.  Regardless of all that, we are at situation where, according to ERST's press release, the proposal is off the table at this time.  We have to presume that discussions are ongoing around the future on the North Monastery primary school.</p></speech>

It was not the only proposal put to the staff at those meetings.  Four different options were put, including that the three schools remain as they are and maintain their status.  There is a decreasing enrolment in that area, so that did not seem like the wise thing to do.  Another option was for the three schools to go co-educational but there are not enough students in that area for three schools to go co-educational.  Another option was for the three schools to become single sex schools but we felt this was not what parents would want because that is not the trend.  The option the trustees came up with was that two of the three schools would amalgamate, resulting in possibly two co-educational schools in the parish.  It was not the intention to close Scoil Mhuire Fatima, the North Monastery primary school.  It was an attempt to find a way to reconfigure the schools in the area to ensure the continuance of the schools in that parish.  It was a genuine attempt.  The proposal put to the local people was not acceptable, which is fine.</p><p>  As Deputy O'Brien knows, very close by, the Gaelscoil is growing very rapidly.  The diocese took that into account as one of the aspects of the discussion because the trustee of Gaelscoil Pheig Sayers is the diocese.  That was taken into account as one of the four options in this area of the North Cathedral parish and surrounds.  That is from where this came.  It was a very genuine attempt to address a situation to ensure the continuance of the three schools in the North Cathedral parish.</p><p>  I take Deputy O'Brien's point in regard to the site suitability of St. Vincent's in terms of not having the sporting facilities that the North Monastery junior school would have.  I appreciate that but it was said that if there was an agreement, those playing fields would be made available to the St. Vincent's school for all its students - boys and girls - to utilise.  That was said at that time but I take the Deputy's point that it would not make sense to put all the students on a smaller site. </p></speech>

There is no magic wand.  That is the position currently.</p><p>  The patron has said to the boards that they need to sit down together, which they have done, and to put options forward for the best approach.  The patron would want to go along with that.  The trustees have been asked to get involved in that also.</p> <p>A situation arose but it was not acceptable.  The questions asked were genuine; I understand that.  The North Monastery campus has a lot of history attached to it.  When it comes down to it, as I said already, this is all about the children in those schools and ensuring appropriate provision is made for them and a quality education is available in those schools.  If the numbers keep going down, that becomes more difficult so something has to be done.  It would be remiss of the trustees and patrons not to begin to address a situation where there is an obvious difficulty in terms of enrolments.  Although it might not suit people to have a school like the North Monastery being discussed in the context of a possible reconfiguration, it may be in the best interests of that school in the longer term.</p></speech>

Is the approach being taken by the trust similar to that of other religious orders?  Has the trust had discussions with the patron in this instance, namely the bishop in Cork?  Is it standard practice that when a school is proposed for amalgamation with another, the order or trust responsible discusses it with the patron first?</p></speech>

There is a process to be followed by the trustees and patrons.  Basically, there are a number of stages involved.  The documents, published by the Department of Education and Skills, outline the reasons for amalgamations or reconfigurations in various situations.  We follow those documents rigidly, which set out the process to be followed at both primary and secondary level.  The author of the document is Frank Murray, on behalf of the Department.</p><p>  As I said earlier, there are various reasons for either amalgamations or reconfigurations which are listed and include a decline in enrolments, curriculum developments, the fact a school may be too small, the need for improvements to a site, changes in the circumstances of the patron, an application for major capital funding, enhancement of student learning, provision of an effective educational programme, demographic changes that result in a decline in enrolments, the desire for co-education, maintenance of a particular ethos or characteristic spirit, poor condition of school buildings, financial concerns, parental or teacher demand and the objectives of the Department.  As can be seen from the aforementioned, there are a range of reasons for a school going into a reconfiguration or amalgamation process.</p><p>  The initiative for an amalgamation can come from a variety of sources, including the staff, the board of management, the patron or the Department itself.  Any of those groups of people can instigate the amalgamation or reconfiguration process.  In that process, there are three stages which are outlined in the documentation.  Stage one is the preliminary phase which involves discussion, data collection and consultation.  That consultation process involves the teachers, the board of management, the trustees, the principal, the patron and other stakeholders at local level.  Following the process of consultation, any decision by the trustee or the board of management must have the sanction of the Minister for Education and Skills.  There cannot be any change without the sanction of the Minister.</p><p>  Stage two is the decision stage.  In the primary sector, the decision is normally taken by the bishop, who happens to be the patron for the Catholic schools.  That decision would be forwarded to the Minister for approval or sanction.  At second level, we would take the place of the bishop as patron.  Again, there would be a long process of dealing with the school, examining proposals, investigating the financial aspects and the possible educational impact and so forth.  Then we would make a recommendation to the Minister.  They are the steps that we would follow.</p></speech>

Out the road a bit towards Limerick was a vocational school while way off in the hinterland there was a Patrician Brothers school in Ballyfin.  The latter school was made an offer from an American developer for its site which it could not resist.  The numbers attending the school were diminishing rapidly-----</p></speech>

The Brigidine convent was wonderful in the 1950s but it was in a serious state of disrepair and the VEC school was very small.  The Patrician Brothers in Ballyfin decided that they wanted out.  They had a boarding school and a day school which was serviced by pupils being bussed in every day.  They decided, as school communities, that they would bring all of this together to give the students a better deal.  After around three fairly hard years of work involving consultation, communication and so forth, agreement was reached that a new community college would be erected on the Limerick Road outside Mountrath.  It is a beautiful, well-appointed school.  The Brigidine convent school reverts to whatever it can revert to.  The Ballyfin site is now host to a very successful business.  All three schools came together to develop a new school.  I visited the new school recently and it is in wonderful shape.  I had the privilege of working with the stakeholders over the three-year period to help to bring about this amalgamation.</p><p>  No two amalgamations are the same.  They generally happen because one school has seen its numbers dropping.  With falling numbers comes falling teacher numbers and a crisis point is reached.  Sometimes another school appears out of the blue with what looks like a good deal but it may only be a good deal for that particular school while the other one will suffer.  Out of that, one must try to create some method of consultation that will make the best building available for the purposes required.  It is no different in Cork.  There are many schools there watching each other.  One group gets a privileged position while the others suffer and so forth.  It will require a lot more consultation and I hope that process has now begun, although it should have begun in a different manner.</p></speech>

Deputy Jonathan O'Brien raised the issue of what was happening in Cork.  We have a charter with five key elements, one of the elements of which is that we promote partnership in the school community.  It is vital in any school that the parents have their say.  There is a process in place to deal with matters that arise.  In the case of an amalgamation, it can be the parents who instigate the idea of an amalgamation or some change in the status of the school.  It is probably unlikely, but it could come from the parents.  Normally in a situation where there is a change in status of a school, the board of management is asked to liaise with the parents' bodies and the teachers' bodies.  The parents council has a statutory right under the education Act to be consulted on all matters to do with budgetary or other issues concerning the school.  Certainly, the parents have a right to be consulted.  They are one of the partners in the school and that is one of their rights.  If the parents in Cork are opposed to the proposal, it falls.  Schools are set up to serve children.</p></speech>

It was informative to listen to the delegates.  I take the point that in the context of things changing, it is a messy business.  That is what is in prospect until there is a change.

It seems the religious patron bodies are consolidating.  Am I correct in saying that is what the delegates were saying?</p></speech>

The following three amalgamations have taken place: Scoil San Seamus in Dublin, Tramore, County Waterford and Doon, County Limerick.  The Edmund Rice Schools Trust has not initiated proposals for amalgamations.  There are ongoing discussions between the trustees and boards and we support and advise boards.  These are sensitive and cannot always be placed in the public arena as they could have a negative effect on the school.  There is agreement on the amalgamation of three primary schools in Wexford.  There is also agreement that the three second level schools in Ennistymon - the CBS, the Mercy and the VEC schools - will amalgamate.  We are very fortunate and privileged to be asked to become the patron of the new school in Carrigaline and the beautiful new school in Tramore.  </p><p>  From our perspective, there is not a great deal happening in terms of amalgamations, openings and closings.  We came to this meeting hoping there would be a sharing of concerns.  Our major concern is the future funding of voluntary secondary schools which account for the largest number of schools in the country.  We have information to be gone through with members of the committee and would like to place this body of work with the committee because it is such a serious matter in terms of the future of trusteeship and schooling in Ireland.</p></speech>

We can take it on board and raise it to see if something can be done about it.

We have two types and the voluntary secondary school sector is the larger part and should be funded properly.  There is common ground between us on that issue.</p></speech>

If it was in the VEC or some other system, it would not be in the same bother.  Voluntary schools comprise 52% of schools and educate 58% of students.  The VECs, now the ETBs, have 35% of schools but only 25% of the students, while community and comprehensive schools which comprise 12% of schools have 17% of the students.  There are three ways of funding these schools.  Voluntary schools are funded by way of a <i>per capita</i>grant, that is, per head of population in the school.  ETBs receive a block grant from the Department of Education and Skills, while a different model applies to community and comprehensive schools.  Where are the disparities?  According to the ESRI's report, insurance costs are paid centrally for VECs; the pay of non-teaching staff is covered by the ETBs and so on.  There is a list of items for which the voluntary secondary schools have to pay, whereas the State is paying for them in State schools in the VEC sector and also community and comprehensive schools.  That works out to be a considerable sum of money.<br />The ESRI states clear differences are evident between the three sectors.  Voluntary secondary schools receive on average just over two thirds of their funding from the Government, while the proportion is much larger for vocational and community schools, with  average figures of 90% and 93%, respectively.  That is a significant difference in the amount of funding allocated to the schools from the State.  The ESRI states it is clear that voluntary secondary schools receive a much lower proportion of funding from the State.  That seem to us to be absolutely unacceptable - that children are afforded different amounts of moneys for their education, depending on what school type they are in.  The knock-on effect is that 44% of voluntary secondary schools were found to use parental contributions to cover the cost of secretarial services, caretakers, light and heat, which is met by grants in ETB schools.  Voluntary secondary schools are at the pin of their collar in trying to pay for light bulbs as they do not receive any extra State funding to meet educational provision.</p> <p> On one or two final points, the percentage of total funding from fund-raising and the voluntary parental contribution together, 6.14%, shows clearly that the voluntary secondary schools are much more dependent on discretionary payments than other schools.  Thus, an average of over 12% of all income in the voluntary secondary schools comes from the parents, compared to 5% in the community schools.  Faced with the recent and current economic conditions, this militates even more against the voluntary secondary schools, where parents do not have the funds to up the difference between what these schools are getting and what the VECs and community and comprehensive schools are getting.</p><p> The ESRI report has pointed out that the cost of the trusteeship function, what we do and what we are tasked to do under the Education Act - a large amount of work - is not funded by anybody.  We are funded from the Christian Brothers with a seed grant, we have some funds that come from the schools for capitation for the students we have and apart from that we look after everything else in terms of the school.  According to the ESRI report, the cost of the trusteeship function for the student is &euro;25 per head.</p></speech>

The trust cannot have it both ways.  It cannot look for the same State funding and keep its private assets.</p></speech>

Could we not turn that argument on its head and say the voluntary secondary schools paid for their school buildings?  They provided the school buildings for the State, whereas the other schools did not.  Therefore, we can turn that argument on its head.</p></speech>

Many of them have nobody in them and many of them have had to pay significant moneys to keep older members of those communities in homes and may have to sell parts of the schools.  However, he is making a point about an unintended consequence of raising a caste system - of a percentage for one and a lesser percentage for another.</p></speech>

However, in terms of what schools are providing, the educational sector is similar across the country now.  Why then should we continue to provide increased funding to two sections of the community but not provide it at all to the other?  We are finding that our schools are under more and more pressure, yet 58% of students attend these schools.</p><p>  We want it put on the agenda of this committee that this is not something small.  This is a strategic and structural issue.  It is about the future of education in Ireland and the future of trusteeship in Ireland.  It is a big question and we would like it to be put on the agenda and taken seriously.  If the committee wants to meet us again to discuss and go through the issue, or if it wants us to meet a small sub-committee, we would be willing to do that, as we feel this is so important.</p></speech>

However, the solution is something that would have to be negotiated between the State and the trust and other voluntary bodies.  I am sure there is a solution, but it will have to be negotiated.</p></speech>

I wish to draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br />In this session we are dealing with the closure of private colleges and language schools.  Over the past two months or so, five private colleges have closed, and the possibility of further closures has not been ruled out.  Many students attached to these colleges have been affected by the closures.  Many have lost substantial fees and many face an uncertain situation in regard to their continuing immigration status as a result of the closure.<br />I welcome the Irish Council for International Students, represented by Mr. Dave Moore and Mr. Bruno Mateus Francio.  I invite Mr. Moore to make his presentation.</p></speech>

ICOS is an independent organisation, founded in 1970, advocating for the rights of all international students in Ireland.  We have been responding to the many issues related to the recent closure of five private colleges that occurred in a five-week period during April and May.  Some students have now spent more than nine weeks out of class.  The closures displaced several hundred international students who were already in Ireland and have jeopardised the studies of many more who had booked and paid but were yet to travel.  The students we are working with are mostly young adults, with a high proportion coming from Brazil, Venezuela and other countries in Latin America to study English.</p> <p>The affected students come from a range of countries, from South Korea to Malawi, and include students pursuing further education and degree programmes.</p><p> It is widely acknowledged, including by the Minister for Education and Skills, that there has been a lack of regulation of private colleges for some time.  Plans to add a new quality assurance framework were announced in 2009 but are still under consultation.  This has meant the proliferation of small, private colleges has continued for a number of years with inadequate oversight.  Around 270 are listed as running approved programmes on the quality and qualifications, QQI, internationalisation register.  Inclusion on that register confers the ability to recruit students that require study visas.  Many schools on the list meet high standards but many others have owners whose motives, ethics and activities are highly questionable.  All of the closed schools were listed as running approved programmes on the international register when they closed their doors.</p><p> None of the colleges were closed down by the authorities, though some were under investigation.  In each case the owners packed up and left students high and dry.  The Minister for Education and Skills has acknowledged that more colleges are expected to close and ICOS agrees.  This is not the first time several private colleges closed in a single year but this situation is unique in the sheer extent of student displacement and the lack of preparedness exposed.  </p><p> Many of the students involved have left their home countries for the first time and have been left uncertain and worried about their future studies.  They have suffered consequential financial hardship and some students from Venezuela lost access to their Government's currency exchange programme that allowed them draw down funds for living costs and course fees.  Many students are anxious to keep their visas in order as their immigration permission may have expired before there was a solution on the issue of emergency renewal.  Several students lost part-time jobs as a result of this.  Students have been left without insurance for medical emergencies because premiums were not paid by colleges.  Students are generally expressing a sense of losing precious time they will never get back.  They feel they have been defrauded by college owners who have walked away with their money and this is one of the most hurtful aspects.  They feel bewilderment at the fact that it appears the authorities have done nothing.</p><p> The majority of the hundreds of students displaced were English language students.  At the moment their situations vary and their positions are inequitable.  Many have given up on Ireland and returned home early while some have attained places at other language schools at little or no charge.  The circumstances are akin to a lottery.  Others, who have seen no clear sign of a solution from the authorities, have felt forced to spend significant additional money on new courses.  In several cases, even at Government-accredited colleges, the new courses have been turned down for visa purposes leaving the students stuck and deflated.  Many English language students have simply been waiting in the hope of a solution because they lack the resources to do anything else.</p><p> The measures announced yesterday essentially say students should pay again for what they have already bought and this is not a fair solution for them.  Only students of Eden College, which was formerly accredited by the Government and the Advisory Council for English Language Schools, ACELS, and was a member of the MEI language schools group, are covered by any arrangements on protection for learners.  These arrangements are being applied restrictively so that only students who physically attended classes in 2013 are eligible to transfer at no fee.  Students who bought courses in 2013, while Eden College was still accredited by ACELS, and in early 2014, while it was still listed on the MEI website, have been told they are not protected.  This runs counter to the expectations of students.  Many of them chose courses because they understood ACELS accreditation meant quality and protection.</p><p> There is a major problem for the credibility of learner protection.  Students are expected to pay up-front for courses to obtain visas but do not receive up-front protection if their chosen college folds before they see the inside of a classroom.  Learner protection that can evaporate is no protection at all.  Eden College students who heard the offer made by MEI on Monday are extremely unhappy.</p><p> Alongside yesterday's announcement was the welcome launch of a new student task force information website but many urgent questions asked by students are not answered.  There is a long way to go to answer those questions and ICOS has been hampered by the unclear answers to questions thus far.  Students want the Irish authorities to show a human face and ICOS has articulated this for them.  They want people to come out from behind e-mail addresses to speak to them about their concerns but this has not happened enough.  There have been too many public statements referring to students with suspicion and too few with compassion as this situation is not of their making.  On "Morning Ireland" a few hours ago the Minister said if there are hardship issues we will look at them.  There is no "if".  Many students are in acute situations and need support well beyond the limit of a small, non-profit organisation.</p><p> ICOS has been thoroughly supportive of the principle of the quality mark system and has actively participated in consultations on the initiative.  However, if the private college sector is to be cleaned up and to shift from poorly regulated to well regulated the process must be very well managed.  We must ensure the fallout from recent college closures is not a foretaste of further distress and displacement of students.  Plans and resources must be put in place to protect students who may be victims of the failure of a college to meet the required standards.  Robust learner protection arrangements and a proper support framework, including hardship provisions, are crucial in finding a way forward.</p></speech>

In his initial contribution, Mr. Moore stated, "The key question for ICOS at this time is not what led to the closures but how many more will follow".  I beg to differ.  The key question relates to what led to the closures, what were the reasons involved and why was action not taken either last year, the year before or five years ago in order to prevent the closures.  It is only now, with 2,000 students out on the street, that action is being taken.</p><p>  Loose regulation, improper accreditation and the other elements that constituted the perfect storm did not just come into being last week or the week before.  The key question is what led to the closures.  That is what I want to discover.  If I cannot obtain the relevant information here, I will obtain it through the press.  What actually happened that allowed 2,000 students to be left out on the streets?  The idea that students who have nowhere to go will be looked upon benevolently is ridiculous.  They must all be offered places on alternative courses of some sort.  I am on ICOS's side.  I am merely trying to discover what led to the closures.  When did ICOS first become involved with this matter?  For how long, in what way and to whom has it being flagging the problems that exist in the five years since Mr. Moore became head of the organisation?  My questions are designed to show that I am on Mr. Moore's team.  I am not questioning his authenticity.</p></speech>

It should have been arrived at last year or in the preceding three years.  This is the tragedy.  What is being stated now is that we are moving on and doing things differently.  This matter has been bubbling away for the past three to five years and the relevant individuals have been getting away with it during that period.  That is my point.</p><p>  If the students involved were issued with visas, then that implies State responsibility.  In that context, therefore, students would have assumed that there was some form of regulatory authority in place.  That is ICOS's calling card in the context of the State's calling card of benevolence.</p></speech>

I am completely sympathetic to the plight of the students involved.  It is they who are the victims in all of this.  I commend Mr. Moore and his organisation on the efforts they are making on their behalf.</p><p>  What does ICOS see as being the specific role of the Department of Education and Skills in respect of this sector?  This whole sorry saga reminds me very much of what happened in the travel industry previously.  Thankfully, the problems by which that industry was affected have been resolved.  Similar problems appear to be afflicting private colleges.  It strikes me that the issue which arises is one of a consumer rights nature and that it is not really relevant to the Department of Education and Skills.  Mr. Moore referred to compassion and people's need to see the face behind the e-mail.  With respect, while these might appear to be important, I am of the view that people need more than compassion and to be able to see the face of the person sending the e-mail.  Will Mr. Moore indicate specifically what he believes the Department of Education and Skills should do into the future?</p></speech>

Obviously, I have drawn attention to the fact that students who were not in the country when the colleges closed would have no protection in the context of the way in which things are currently being done.  Earlier today, we submitted specific proposals around the whole issue of learner protection.  Other countries have watertight services in terms of protecting fees whereby they are held in an escrow arrangement and drawn down on a gradual basis rather than colleges receiving them in their entirety upfront.  We have seen the repercussions of the latter, with students losing sums amounting to &euro;7,000 in certain instances.  That model is used in other countries.</p><p>  Students in public sector colleges can avail of the services of the Ombudsman.  There is no structure in place that offers any kind of protection for students who attend private sector colleges.  A substantial issue arises in the context of the agents with whom students book their courses.  In a fair proportion of cases, students book their courses through third parties rather than directly with colleges.  That is an unregulated and extremely problematic aspect of this matter.</p> <p>We have certainly seen agents in Mumbai still selling courses for colleges that are closed.  There are serious issues around the roles agents play.</p><p> Much more proactive information needs to be made available for students to steer them in the direction of sound course choices.  The only publicly available document at present which offers students any guidance as to what are approved courses is the internationalisation register, and that has been the problem more than the solution in recent times because all the colleges that have closed were on that.  They were listed as approved.  There needs to be an entirely new frame of reference for students seeking to choose their programmes, obviously based on solid, quality assurance measures for the programmes that make the list, and once those regulations are in place, they need to be robustly enforced.  As a student said at a meeting in the context of the status of the colleges, they are private businesses but they are not candy shops.  They are organisations where hundreds, if not thousands, of students' futures are on the line, and if they are not rigorously regulated, we could have repeats of what has happened.</p></speech>

I commend Mr. Moore and his organisation on the representation, work and support they have given the many students who found themselves in a desperate and stressful situation as a result of what happened.  It is a sad reflection that something like this could have been allowed to happen, to go on for so long and that this area remained unregulated such that we have had this collapse which has left many students stranded.  Also, there is the fact that visas were issued to colleges, which visas were subsequently withdrawn overnight, leading to five colleges closing in short order.  I do not know if Mr. Bruno Mateus Francio attended one of the colleges which closed.  I would like to hear of his experience, how he chose that course, and his background.  He might also advise us of the circumstances facing many of his friends and colleagues who were attending those colleges.</p></speech>

I booked for a course in Brazil.  I looked at many websites on the Internet to see if the courses offered were good or not.  I saw that Eden College was on the ICOS website and also on the MEI site, so I booked with it and I paid for the course in January.  I came here and attended classes for one and a half months and then the school closed, which left all the students out on the street, as it were.  Nobody, other than ICOS, was talking to us.  We have sent many e-mails to the immigration service, INIS, and the MEI, but we never got a reply.</p><p>  I have some friends in Brazil who paid for this course and they are still in Brazil.  Some of my friends will go back to Brazil.  I paid &euro;3,000 for the course.  It is a lot of money.</p></speech>

I came to Ireland to study for six months and then go back to Brazil.  Now I am on holidays but I do not want to be.  I am already two months on holidays.

Mr. Francio referred to having checked the international register and the list of approved courses.  The course must be approved on the register before the Department issues a visa for someone to study on it in this country.  There are question marks over the existing regulation and how one would get on the register.  In order for students to come to this country to study we must issue them with visas.  There is an obligation on us to ensure that where we consent to allow students to come here on visas, there is an implicit belief that the course is valid, of quality and one for which the State is willing to issue a visa for someone to come to this country to study.  Much work needs to be done to ensure that is the case because otherwise the system will be damaged.</p><p> Five colleges closed in quick succession when visas were withdrawn.  There are 270 colleges overall.  Could Mr. Moore outline how many students are involved in those colleges?  Are most of the students in the 270 colleges English language students?  How can we be sure that problems will not arise for colleges that are currently recruiting for upcoming language courses?  More action must be taken to ensure colleges that are currently recruiting are not in danger of closing in three or four months' time.  What can be done to ensure that assurances can be made to students?</p><p> Reference was made to the QQI, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, internationalisation register in terms of the regulation of the 270 colleges.  What type of inspections are carried out currently in existing colleges?  What is the role of the QQI in such inspections and in terms of the international register?</p></speech>

I am sorry his experience was so bad.  I hope the situation will be rectified in some way.  Does Mr. Moore think the Government is doing enough to assist in the situation?  It was announced that 70% of students would be redeployed.  What does Mr. Moore believe must happen now?</p></speech>

What they have clearly said is that after an extended wait to hear what resolution could be provided, the idea of paying again for what they have already paid for is unjust and is simply not an option, as Mr. Francio said, for a great many students.  If the authorities hear what the students have to say I hope there would be further reflection on whether Ireland has played fair by the students affected.</p></speech>

International registers are one thing but it is up to a state to ensure all is well when people are being given visas.  Responsibility comes with such a situation.  In one way that is an overarching red herring.  It is up to each country to regulate, ensure quality assurance and look after young students who go to language schools.  The Government should not get off the hook.</p></speech>

Before we commence business I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off to avoid interference with the broadcasting of the meeting.<br />I welcome the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his officials to the meeting.  The witnesses are here to assist the committee in its examination of the June ECOFIN meeting agenda, including the recently published country specific recommendations.  The discussion will begin with opening remarks by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, following which questions may be put by members to the Minister.  <br />I wish to advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009 they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the joint committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br />I thank the Minister, Deputy Noonan, and his officials for attending.  I understand the Minister must leave by 6 o'clock so I ask him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

The ECOFIN Council usually meets on two occasions a year in Luxembourg &ndash; in June and October.  As members know, we have agreed, subject to scheduling arrangements, that I will attend the committee on a quarterly basis to update it and discuss developments occurring at the ECOFIN Council.  My officials also provide written briefing on a monthly basis to the committee.  This is a very useful and positive arrangement, and I look forward to our continued engagement today.<br />As we approach the middle of the year, this will be the last Council under the Greek Presidency.  I would like to acknowledge the success of the Greek Presidency and the <font color="#00201F">progress it has made.  O</font>ur Italian counterparts will take over the Presidency role on 1 July, and I wish them every success with that undertaking.<br />In their invitation the members asked me to brief them on the items on Friday&rsquo;s ECOFIN agenda.  I understand the committee has already received the draft agenda for the June meeting and background material.  A number of key issues are listed for discussion, and hopefully significant progress will be made at the meeting.  The members specifically mentioned the country specific recommendations, known as the CSRs, which were published by the European Commission earlier this month.  As members will be aware from the ECOFIN agenda, this is an item for the ECOFIN meeting so, as per usual, I will brief them on the matters to be discussed at the meeting as they appear on the agenda.<br />After outlining the key issues that are likely to arise at Friday&rsquo;s meeting, I will be happy to take questions and observations from members.  As ever, I would like to remind them that this is a draft agenda but changes can still be made between now and the meeting in terms of content and the order of the discussion.</p> <p>In addition, work is ongoing at the level of officials in order that there also can be more substantial changes in terms of how the discussions will evolve.</p><p> The formal ECOFIN meeting is scheduled to commence at 10 a.m. on Friday.  Earlier that morning, as usual, we will have what is known as a breakfast meeting during which I expect the Commission will give a view on the economic situation in Europe.  There also will be an opportunity for the Finance Ministers to contribute their views on general economic matters.  The agenda is heavy in content as matters stand.  It will begin by considering the legislative deliberations and this takes place in public session.  Based on the draft of the agenda before the joint committee today, there are three items scheduled for discussion, namely, the draft general budget for 2015, the taxation of parent companies and subsidiaries and, under any other business, a discussion may take place on current legislative proposals and a state of play update on level 2 legislation concerning bank contributions under the directive on bank recovery and resolution and single resolution mechanism, BRRD-SRM.</p><p> On the issue of a draft general budget for 2015, this is an annual item.  The Commission will present its proposal for the EU budget in 2015.  Over the next few months, the Council and Parliament will take positions on this proposal and will come together in November to reach a compromise agreement.  As per normal protocol arrangements, the incoming Italian Presidency will chair this item and this reflects the fact that the negotiations on this file with the European Parliament will be managed by Italy's Presidency.  As for dealing with the taxation of parent companies and subsidiaries, this was originally introduced to avoid double taxation of companies in the Single Market.  The focus of this amendment is to close certain loopholes in this directive.  This proposal is fully consistent with the work of the OECD on base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, and Ireland can support the Presidency compromise proposal.  This file was also discussed at ECOFIN in May but agreement was not possible at that stage.  Finally, under any other business, the Presidency will provide the usual summary on ongoing work on financial services dossiers and in respect of level 2 legislation concerning bank contributions under BRRD-SRM, a state of play will be provided.  The Commission will brief the Council on the preparation of implementing legislation that will determine the contributions to be paid by banks to resolution funds established under the directive on bank recovery and resolution, BRRD, and the regulation on the single resolution mechanism, SRM.</p><p> Turning now to the non-legislative activities, based on the draft of the agenda before members today, there are four items scheduled for discussion.  These are a report on the code of conduct with regard to business taxation; the contribution to the European Council meeting, namely, the European semester; the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and ECB-Commission convergence reports; and enlargement of the euro area.  Beginning with the code of conduct, this item may be taken as an &ldquo;A&rdquo; point, which means it may be endorsed without discussion.  The report, which deals with business taxation and in particular harmful tax competition, is a regular item at the end of each Presidency.  This report has been prepared by the code of conduct group on business taxation.</p><p> I will now turn to the next item on the agenda, that is, the contribution to the European Council meeting on 26 and 27 June and the European semester, which members also highlighted in their invitation to me.  As members may recall, when I spoke to the joint committee last February, we were dealing with two related important items under the annual semester process, namely, the annual growth survey and the alert mechanism report.  The committee will be aware that the European semester process has been in operation since 2011 and is a regime for economic surveillance.  As Ireland was in the EU-IMF programme until December 2013, it did not fully participate in the first three semester cycles.  However, as we exited the EU-IMF programme in December, Ireland is now fully participating in the 2014 semester process, which is part of the normalisation of our position as a post-programme country.  The annual semester process is part of the new economic governance regime of the EU that has been established to underpin sound public finances, sustainable and inclusive growth and the correction of macroeconomic imbalances across the European Union.</p><p> The European semester has two distinct phases, the first of which is horizontal and the second of which is more country-specific.  Broad horizontal guidance was provided by the European Heads of State or Government at the European Council in March and then the process became more country-specific in orientation.  For Ireland&rsquo;s part, in April my Department submitted Ireland&rsquo;s stability programme to the Commission and members will recall my appearance before this committee that same month to discuss it.  The Department of the Taoiseach then submitted the national reform programme on structural reforms and measures to boost growth and jobs, also in April.  The Commission then assessed all member states&rsquo; documents that were submitted and, following bilateral engagement with the member states, the Commission issued proposed country-specific recommendations, CSRs, on 2 June to 26 member states.  Greece and Cyprus did not receive any CSRs due to the fact that they still are in EU-IMF programmes.  The CSR proposals are intended to provide specific, tailored guidance to each recipient member state on how to achieve sound public finances, what structural reforms should be implemented to achieve smart sustainable growth and how to correct macroeconomic imbalances.  The CSRs were directly examined and scrutinised by the relevant Departments with a written response to the Commission as per the CSR process.  Member states' CSRs already have been discussed at a number of preparatory committees over the last two weeks with varying amounts of amendments being accepted by the Commission.  The objective of Friday&rsquo;s ECOFIN meeting is to approve the recommendations for member states.  It is intended that these recommendations will be endorsed by the June European Council and finally adopted by Finance Ministers at the July ECOFIN Council.</p><p> In respect of Ireland&rsquo;s country-specific recommendations, they are wide-ranging in nature and cover issues that cut across a number of different Departments.  In view of this, the Department of the Taoiseach co-ordinates Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the semester process.  However, the Department of Finance plays a central role for the following reasons.  First, economic and financial issues remain of primary importance on the European agenda and second, the CSRs are adopted by Finance Ministers at the ECOFIN Council, following discussion and, in some cases, amendment by the ECOFIN preparatory committees.  Ireland received seven country-specific recommendations covering the areas of the public finances and growth outlook, health care sector reform, labour market activation polices, labour market participation, SME initiatives, mortgage arrears and legal services reforms.  A number of constructive bilateral meetings took place over the past number of months between Ireland and the Commission and the CSRs received were mainly as expected.  The CSRs contain an assessment of our stability programme update, which as I mentioned was submitted in April, and the Commission has endorsed the Government&rsquo;s fiscal strategy to reduce the deficit to below 3% in 2015.  The Government remains committed to continue to make progress and we have the policies, set out in the Medium-Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020, to enable it to so do.  The Government will set out budgetary policy for 2015 on budget day in October of this year.</p><p> As for the item on the agenda regarding implementation of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of member states, as I mentioned previously, the Commission issued CSRs for 26 member states on 2 June.  These CSRs were subsequently examined at official level meetings and some changes were made to the texts.  At this meeting, ECOFIN will be asked to approve a draft of the recommendations for the 26 member states and I note other relevant Councils also are discussing the CSRs.  The European Council on 26 and 27 June will be asked to endorse the recommendations and ECOFIN then will be asked finally to adopt the recommendations at its July meeting.  Turning to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, following the deficit and debt notifications in April and the publication of the Spring forecast, the Commission will make recommendations for Council decisions closing excessive deficit procedures in six member states, namely, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia.</p> <p>They will also assess measures taken by Croatia and Poland to correct their deficits.</p><p> The final item on the agenda, the ECB-Commission convergence reports and enlargement of the euro area, deals with Lithuania's fulfilment of the criteria to join the euro.  The Council will be asked to adopt a recommendation on the adoption of the euro by Lithuania - only member states the currency of which is the euro are allowed to vote in this respect.  The Council will also approve the text of a letter to be sent by its President to the European Council with a view to discussing the issue at its meeting on 26 and 27 June.  After consultation with the ECB and the European Parliament, the Council could adopt the necessary legal Acts at a subsequent meeting.</p><p> As the agenda stands, there are no items under the heading of any other business.</p><p> I hope the committee has found useful this brief outline of ECOFIN's agenda, including the CSRs, and that it will serve as the basis for an engaging discussion.  As we discuss all of these items, we are reminded of how important it is that we continue to engage with the EU institutions in a proactive and constructive way so as to ensure the European Union evolves and develops in a way that it beneficial to Ireland and the Union in general.  I thank the committee for its attention.  I will be happy to respond to questions or observations members may have.</p></speech>

Before I call them, the Minister might address one simple question on the country specific recommendations, of which Ireland has received seven.  Where do the seven recommendations go next?  How will they be monitored?  Will they be monitored by the Commission?  The Minister stated they would be agreed to at ECOFIN also.  Ultimately, will penalties be applied in the event that they are not being met and is there a timeframe in which there is an expectation that they will be met?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.201" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061800005#G00300"><p>They are processed by ECOFIN; they are then advanced, as I stated, to the Council of Heads of State and Government and come back for final acceptance, subject to amendment by ECOFIN, at the July Council meeting.  Normally, there is an engagement between the Commission and member states on how they will meet the recommendations, but there is a separate excessive deficit procedure.  If there are comments on deficits, there is another process.  Excessive deficit procedures are dealt with on the insistence of the Commission and ECOFIN with action taken to eliminate the excessive deficits.  That is the process used.  In the excessive deficit procedure countries can be pushed hard and subject to penalties if they do not comply.  We have seen this happen in the past when the procedure did not apply to us because we were included in a programme.  For example, in the autumn Austria did not meet what was considered to be the budgetary requirements to bring its deficit below 3%.  ECOFIN acts as a kind of peer review of a country's budgetary position.  During the peer review Austria was instructed to come back at the next meeting having taken extra budgetary measures.  Austria's Finance Minister came to the meeting with a further &euro;1 billion worth of budgetary measures to bring the deficit below 3%.  That is the way it works.  It is done by dialogue and an exchange of views on the policy matters surrounding legal proceedings, legal reform, etc.  However, on specific deficit management, there is a harder edge to the process.</p></speech>

There is a 12 month cycle and one would want to show progress.  However, sometimes the specific excessive deficit procedure has to match the budgetary cycle of individual countries.  If the budget is in accordance with the calendar year, there is not much point in taking corrective action the following October.  Obviously, there are time constraints in making budget corrections.</p></speech>

Continuing from where the Chairman left off on country specific recommendations, does Ireland have issues with the recommendations made by the European Commission in the report?  Is it the Minister's intention to address all of the issues raised or does he take issue with any of the points the Commission has made?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.205" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061800005#G00700"><p>There is post-programme surveillance.  Instead of one visit a year by the troika which would be common across all countries of the European Union, we have two.  There is an additional visit - post-programme surveillance.  The issues raised with us on the country specific recommendations flow, almost seamlessly, from the troika and the end of the bailout programme.  They continue with issues that were active when we exited the bailout programme last December.  To specifically answer the Deputy's question, we have no issues with the recommendations; we are not surprised by any of them and we continue to work towards fulfilling them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.206" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061800005#G00800"><p>Certainly, there are common themes running through the report and the report of European Commission staff.  The IMF's report was released today.  These issues are not on the agenda, but many of them run through all of these documents.</p><p>  Let me take the Minister to the issue of the public finances and the excessive deficit procedure which is dealt with in the country specific recommendations.  With the budget coming up in October, both the European Commission and today the IMF are taking a hard line on the fiscal adjustment, stating it should not be less than &euro;2 billion.  Is there any change in the Government's position?  Is it still its position that it will achieve a deficit not greater than 3% and that it will reach the required level of adjustment to achieve this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.207" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061800005#G00900"><p>That is it in a nutshell.  We put forward our stability programme in April and the figure of &euro;2 billion.  At the time the best information at my disposal was that it would require an adjustment of &euro;2 billion to get under the 3% deficit figure by 2015.  There are a lot of moving parts as the year passes.  I could not give an exact figure, but I am fairly confident in saying it will now take less than that figure to achieve a deficit of 3% because a lot of matters have been moving in the right direction.  Some have been moving in the wrong direction also.  However, on balance, there are more pluses than minuses in terms of the budgetary position in the first five months of the year.  The Deputy will recall that while our target deficit for 2014 was 5.1%, we decided to go a little lower and built a budget on the expectation of a deficit of 4.8%.  With the evidence for the first five months of the year, it seems we will come in somewhat lower than that figure, but I am not in a position to say by how much.  The Deputy will be aware of the factors involved.  Tax receipts are running significantly ahead of budget; expenditure is under control and there are other items in terms of the general fiscal position that are favourable.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.209" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061800005#G01100"><p>Frequently, commentators confuse the target with the ways and means of achieving it.  The target is to have a deficit figure below 3% in 2015, which will be the last budgetary adjustment.  The ways and means of getting there involve an adjustment of &euro;2 billion.  That was the estimate when it was being planned on a multi-annual basis.  That remained the best estimate when we published and discussed the stability programme in April.  On the current position, I refer to the position at the end of May, not mid-June, because the evidence comes in in monthly cycles.</p> <p>The end-May position would suggest an adjustment of &euro;2 billion would not be required to get below 3%.</p><p> The policy position is that whatever it takes to get below 3% will be done, but we are not trying to beat that target.  We think there is enough growth in the economy now so that post-2015 the deficit will continue to go down simply because of that growth, and further fiscal adjustments will not be required.  The Deputy will see how the medium-term economic strategy is built into achieving a balanced budget by 2018 without further adjustments.  </p></speech>

There is no choice in that matter and we need to do what is required to achieve that.  If that can be secured with considerably less than the &euro;2 billion adjustment, we should do so.</p><p>  We have heard trenchant views from the European Commission, the IMF and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which are all adamant that we should stick with &euro;2 billion and no less.  What is the Minister's headline response to their views which are consistent across the board?</p></speech>

They are <i>ad idem</i>with what we said in the stability pact in April.  They are probably working off the same data that were available to us then.  Since then, however, there are pieces of evidence - ranging from hard fact to anecdotal - which would suggest that our position is improving as the year goes by.  I am grateful to the august bodies the Deputy mentioned for their well argued advice.  From my perspective, as Minister for Finance, it helps me that they are spelling out to the public that an adjustment is required and that the opening position is &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council made the point that that is an unnecessarily short period in which to achieve a balanced budget.  Today, the IMF said that it could require a fiscal adjustment of about &euro;7.5 billion between now and then in order to achieve that.  Does the Minister have any intention of reviewing that timeline to achieve the medium-term objective of a balanced structural budget by 2018 and to lengthen it?</p></speech>

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council seems to be working from a different assumption.  I would like my officials and those of the IFAC to see if they can reconcile the differences in approach.  It comes back to my opening position that if the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's view of what is required is correct, that makes the budgetary process easier for me or my successors as we go towards 2018.</p><p>  As regards fiscal and economic management, my view is that the public and the economy have been under pressure for a long time now.  Therefore, I will do whatever is required to meet targets but I will not go beyond that in terms of corrective action.</p></speech>

That is what we have spelled out in the medium-term economic strategy.  The structural deficit is a difficult concept.  The easiest thing is to ask what are the permanent features of the economy and what is cyclical.  Whatever is cyclical rises and falls with the business cycle, so if one strips out what is cyclical the structural part is left.  If there is a structural deficit the business cycle will not remove it.  One must address the structural deficit as a specific piece of economic project work to remove it, whereas the cyclical deficits will be removed by the business cycle as it moves on.  Calculating that is extremely difficult in an economy like Ireland's, which is so open and has such a high level of exports.<br />There is room for debate and we have had that debate with the Commission.  We are not always happy with the Commission's view of the calculation of the structural deficit.  Some things could be structural but may be due to cyclical influences or <i>vice versa</i>, so it is a bit tenuous.  If the Deputy asked me to provide a hard and fast definition of what a structural deficit is, there are variations across textbooks and across countries.  In general terms, however, if the lead-in point is to ask what a cyclical deficit is, it is the rise and fall of deficits as the economic cycle proceeds.  When one gets high growth levels the deficit goes down on the cycle, and when one hits recession the deficit goes up.  That corrects over the cycle, so that is not the real concern.  We need to take out of the system the rocks in the stream that inhibit the flow of economic activity, which are there due to the malstructure in an economy.  If one takes out those pieces one is then dealing with the structural deficit.  That is the best I can do to describe it.  </p></speech>

We are now approaching the second anniversary of the agreement by Heads of State and Government to separate the sovereign debt from banking debt.  To say the least, however, there has been considerable delay in implementing that in practice.  In recent days, off-the-record briefings have been given to Tony Connelly of RTE by a senior eurozone official, which dampened down any expectation that Ireland will get a deal through the ESM on retroactive bank recapitalisation.  Where does that matter stand now?  The Minister keeps saying that he is working on it and is continuing to try to secure a deal.  Does the Minister intend to raise it at the ECOFIN meeting?  Are active negotiations ongoing concerning this or does the Minister accept it is becoming less likely that a deal will be secured?  These briefings are coming from somewhere.  Senior people are briefing against Ireland, saying this deal is not going to happen.  We deserve to know where it all stands.</p></speech>

There are 28 countries and officials from all the countries, including permanent representatives in Brussels from everywhere.  There is constant briefing and re-briefing by practically everybody out there, so we should not get too excited by one briefing.</p><p>  As regards the recapitalisation of banks by an agency other than sovereign governments, the European Stability Mechanism or ESM is the relevant European institution.  The ESM and its regulatory regime are not yet fully in place.  </p><p>  In discussing the regulations under which the recapitalisation would operate, we have made progress and have succeeded in maintaining a position whereby retroactive recapitalisation may take place by unanimous decision of the ESM governors who are the finance ministers of the 28 EU countries under a different title.  That has now been agreed and it is going through the lengthy bureaucratic process that normally occurs in Europe.  It will not be implemented until November, so there is no opportunity for us to file an application for retroactive recapitalisation until after November this year.  We are reviewing the position as we go towards that date and we will see what the position is then.  The difficulty in negotiating it will be that it requires a unanimous decision.</p> <p>Our argument is that when the heads of State and Government in June 2012 promised that action would be taken, the argument was about the sustainability of the Irish debt.  Things have changed dramatically since 2012, however.  Our ten-year bond prices are approximately 2.4% yesterday and today, while Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece and Slovenia are trading outside us - in other words, they have higher interest rates on their ten-year bonds.  It is very hard to convince Ministers from those countries that Ireland needs additional assistance to make its debt sustainable when the markets have decided that we are in a more sustainable position than they are.  That is where the argument becomes difficult.  We will evaluate the situation.</p><p> The other thing that has changed is that what was envisaged at the time of the commitment was that there would be some exchange of Irish bank shares for money and that the ESM, through some mechanism or other, would acquire some or all of the Irish bank shares.  In exchange, it would give us money which we would use to reduce our debt.  That was the simple and obvious way.  It is perhaps more complex, but that was the simple idea behind it.  Since then, Bank of Ireland, for example, has paid back &euro;1 billion more than the taxpayer committed to it.  On top of that, we own 14% of its share capital.  It does not make any great sense to give away some of the shares in Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

I am providing context.  AIB has a value also.  It has been valued by the National Pensions Reserve Fund at approximately &euro;11 billion, which is against an input by the taxpayer of slightly in excess of &euro;20 billion.  Its independently assessed value is approximately halfway there.  My point is that while circumstances have changed, we have succeeded in the negotiation of the rules and regulations of the ESM in keeping in place the power to retroactively recapitalise banks under the regulations.</p></speech>

The IMF has come out very clearly today in its report to say it supports the retroactive recapitalisation of the Irish banks.  It does not represent people on this island.

I believe genuinely that the Government intends to drag this out in the hope that there will be public fatigue, the shares in AIB can be sold to the market for &euro;12 billion and there will then be no real reason to apply to the ESM, the rules of which are strict and difficult to apply retroactively.  Even if we were to wind back the clock to 2008, there is no guarantee that we would get all that money from the ESM as we would have had to inject some of our own capital to bring the banks up to a 4.8% core tier 1 ratio.  We would then have to have a bail-in and, at that point, we would get money back.  Is it the case that the rules could be so restrictive in terms of retroactive recapitalisation that it would be less beneficial to apply to the fund than to sell the shares on the open market?</p></speech>

The Minister falls into the old system of claiming it is begrudgery or the building of a movement on the pain and suffering of the Irish people.  This is a genuine question and the Minister is belittling my contribution to the committee, as he does every single time genuine, serious questions are asked about how we can retroactively apply the instrument and whether it would be more beneficial to sell bank shares on the open market, given the restrictions that apply to the direct recapitalisation instrument as it exists today.</p></speech>

Effectively, the Deputy is trying to get an answer and then will twist my views subsequently.  I have laid out what the situation is.  If the Deputy believes it would be of greater benefit to the taxpayer to sell the bank shares on the open market than anything we would get from the ESM, he will be right.  However, that is not going to prevent me from filing an application to the ESM and exploring all possibilities in the best interest of the taxpayer.</p></speech>

He should have stood up for Irish interests.  He is about to amend legislation to allow for a banking union to exist with no real commitment to direct recapitalisation.  We met with German Bundestag Members today who spoke about the lack of political opportunities and the fact that it is impossible to sell the Irish retrospective bank capitalisation idea in Germany, with a list of people from Klaus Regling to Jeroen Dijsselbloem to Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble stating that it is politically impractical.  The Minister is trying to drag this out for as long as possible.  I would support him 100% if he took a more robust stance with his European colleagues to fight this corner.  My opinion, however, is that he is not doing that.</p><p>  To move on to the countries-----</p></speech>

The problem is that he just does not like them.</p><p>  He claims the negotiating strategy adopted by me is leading to a situation in which we will not be successful, and that we should be more forceful.  He took the exact same view when we were negotiating the promissory note, the maturity of the official loans from Europe, as well as the reduction of the interest rates on those loans.  He took the exact same view when we went into government and were renegotiating the bailout programme.  We were successful in all of those, however.

These include the language on the binding nature of the expenditure ceilings, the timeline for introducing health identifiers, and the purpose of improved data collection in the Courts Service.  We expect to see agreement on suitable amendments before the CSRs are finalised.</p><p>  There were horizontal recommendations to the CSRs.  The broadening of the tax base for the property tax was one of these.  Twenty-five member states received a recommendation from the Commission on taxation.  Similarly to ten other member states, including Germany, France and Italy, Ireland received a recommendation to consider raising revenues through broadening the tax base and to enhance the growth and environmental friendliness of the tax system.  It is a general recommendation which the Commission considers applicable to many European countries, including the larger ones such as France and Germany.  I have no plans to extend the scope or incidence of the property tax.</p></speech>

As I announced in last year&rsquo;s budget, we are looking at the appropriateness of all the tax measures in the agrifood industry and are in full consultation with all the interest groups involved.  The OECD, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, will probably bring forward recommendations in September on the BEPS, base erosion and profit shifting, project.  I would be surprised if, again, we do not have a provision in the Finance Bill on corporation tax, running from either the recommendations of the OECD or the consultation with the Commission on the state aid issue which was brought to public attention last week.  Broadening the tax base does not mean introducing new taxes.  Nobody has ever thought that before.</p></speech>

Is the Department and the Minister of the view that a structural deficit rate of 0% must be reached by 2018 to meet commitments under the fiscal compact treaty?</p></speech>

My officials will consult with Professor John McHale&rsquo;s organisation to reconcile the data and the manner in which it was treated.  We are also consulting with the Commission to see exactly whether it will be 2018 or 2019.  There is flexibility to allow for the structural deficit position whereby one can be at 0% or even a minus rate when at the top of the business cycle and then run a deficit during a recession.</p> <p>This is where the half a percent differential or flow arises.</p></speech>

We have had a referendum on this issue.  As far as I understand, it is written in the legislation or the treaty that 0.5% is the figure.</p><p>  I will turn to other issues that have been identified and challenges we face in respect of the medium-term objectives.  It has again been pointed out by the Fiscal Advisory Council that trying to maintain the level of spending over the next five years at the level anticipated by the Minister that is spelt out in the stability programme update will result in real pressures, particularly on health and education.  Again, it has asked the Minister to look at that area.  Indeed the IMF has asked that as well.  Is that something the Minister is considering?  </p></speech>

They are looked at by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I think everybody knows that there have been difficulties in health but in a very big budget, the kind of deficits it has run from a percentage point of view are quite small relative to a budget of &euro;13.2 billion.  In respect of the Deputy's earlier accusation that we are ignoring what is the legal position, the aim is to have a balanced budget in the way we define it but part of the definition is to allow for the business cycle, which can be plus or minus a half percent around zero but not necessarily zero.  That is what is meant by balance.  The only disagreement between us is on definition.</p></speech>

In respect of the budget, the Minister has made it very clear, as he has every year, that it is the deficit targets and not the adjustment that is at issue.  I have made the point that it is not even the adjustment figure that we should be debating but rather how that adjustment is applied - who pays the price.  The CSO is reportedly looking at our data in terms of GDP.  This will include illegal trade areas.  The CSO will include in its June figures prostitution, drugs, pornography and other activities within the economy that will boost our GDP.  Some have suggested that this would boost our GDP by close to 1%, which would have the effect of reducing the budgetary target .  I think the British figure was 0.7%.  Does the Minister have any view as to how much of our GDP will rise as a result of those calculations and what effect it would have on the budgetary adjustments?</p></speech>

I understand it might do so before the end of this month.  It is undertaking two distinct pieces of work.  One involves having Ireland's GDP calculation in compliance with the new European rules.  In the new European rules, as the Deputy outlined, illegality, the proceeds of crime and various other things can now be brought in for the purposes of GDP.  We do not think this will be very significant in Ireland.  The Deputy mentioned the UK.  Military spending will now be calculated as an investment in rather than as a cost in countries with heavy military budgets so that will be of significant benefit to the GDP calculation of some European countries, particularly the NATO countries.  Where Ireland benefits more is not from any of those but from the fact that in future, research and development under the new rules will be treated as an investment rather than a cost to industry.  From what I read some weeks ago, I think it can be recalculated back to 1994 but do not hold me to that date.  We think that will have a significant positive impact on Ireland's GDP.  GDP is the denominator so when one gets a deficit calculation, obviously, the higher GDP is, the lower the deficit is without any further correction.  I am not quite sure where it will fall.</p><p>  The CSO is continually revising its statistics as better data comes in.  There is an anomaly in the statistics at present at which it is looking.  I do not know which way it will fall.  The Deputy saw that the calculation for GDP last year was as if growth was in decline but at the same time, it is not consistent to argue that a declining economy would create 1,200 extra jobs every week.  It looks as if the GNP figures are more reflective of what is happening in the real economy than the GDP figures.  Again, in its normal routine work, the CSO is looking at that area.  I do not know whether that gives us a plus or not and am not in a position to predict.  The CSO is very secretive about its figures.  I would be confident that the technical adjustment will give us a plus of GDP.  It is up to the CSO to announce what the amount is but I think it will be in excess of 1%.  </p></speech>

It will be welcome and significant but we will wait for the CSO to come out with the figure.  It will be of benefit.  If the figure of 4.8% was to go down to 4.7% as a result of technical adjustment, the other rule of thumb I use is that every decimal point - every 0.1 - is about &euro;170 million of an adjustment.</p></speech>

It will be the end of June.  It will be an adjustment that will say that because of the technical adjustments, Ireland's GDP is no longer &euro;166 billion or so, it is a little bit above that.

In order for a resolution fund to be able to operate it has to be financed appropriately by the institutions which may potentially benefit from it.  In this regard both the bank resolution and recovery directive, BRRD, and the single resolution mechanism, SRM, established target levels that must be reached within a prescribed period.  In the case of the BRRD, member states are required to ensure that the available financial means of their funds should reach at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits in all the institutions authorised in their territories by 31 December 2024, with a start date of January 2015.</p></speech>

The best way to consider the matter is that the mission statement of the European Central Bank is to keep inflation near to but less than 2%.  It is well shy of that figure at present.  There are benefits from low inflation because it reduces the cost base but it also reduces economic activity.  In our case, budgets are formed on nominal growth, that is, real growth plus inflation.  It makes the budgetary position more difficult when there is very low inflation because we do not get the inward tax flow.  They are well down the road in debating this, however, and action is being taken.  The announcements by the European Central Bank during the week before last on what it will do to combat low inflation are the first phase in this.  I hope the actions will be of particular benefit to SMEs in Ireland.  Frankfurt will supply a flow of money to the sovereign central banks in the eurozone at 25 basis points and a handling charge will be added before the money is made available under certain conditions to the non-mortgage lending sector.  That should benefit SMEs in Ireland.  There is also a multiplier effect in that by lending more money to SMEs, the banks will trigger more money from Frankfurt to provide an additional flow of funds.  It is a first gradual step by Mr. Draghi in moving the European Central Bank to a more active role in monetary policy.  We wonder whether there will be a phase 2, involving widespread purchasing of sovereign paper by the European Central Bank to increase liquidity across the system.  That is the acknowledged orthodox way of combating deflation or low inflation.</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;40 billion of that figure is bank debt and, when one takes all the swings and roundabouts into account, the cost of that portion is a shade less than &euro;1 billion.  The gross cost is &euro;1.6 billion but 80% of the coupon we pay on the Irish paper held by the Central Bank comes back the following year as excess profits from the bank.  One of the big fallacies in the public debate on the Irish debt situation is that we are paying back other people's debts and that it was all the banks.  We were driven to our debt position of more than &euro;200 billion by accumulated deficits over the years.  It was all our own work.  The bank debt is significant but it is the minority portion of the debt and because of the various deals we have done, if the &euro;8 billion paid out in interest annually was netted out, the banking call is approximately &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

At the last ECOFIN meeting, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne raised the possibility of taking a legal challenge against the imposition of the FTT, and Ireland is not going to support him in that.  Approximately a year ago we had a conversation here with Patrick Honohan, who seemed to have softened his approach to the FTT.  He felt circumstances had changed and that it would not have as detrimental an effect as previously perceived.  The argument is that we would not support it if the UK did not support it, and that the UK would not support it if New York did not support it.  Is that still our view, or has it changed?</p></speech>

If we were to apply a tax which made Dublin less attractive than London, there could be a transfer of companies from Dublin to London.  While I do not want to speak for Mr. Honohan, he may have appeared to have softened in his view because when the FTT concept was originally promoted, it appeared to be a very onerous tax on all financial transactions.  However, it now looks like it would be akin to a stamp duty on shares and maybe other financial transactions.  In our tax code we already have a 1% stamp duty on the sale of shares, while the UK charges a 0.5% tax on them.</p><p>  The UK's worry is probably about the movement from the buying and selling of shares into other trading of financial instruments, particularly with the multiplicity of trades that can take place on computer systems in the space of a minute.  If one is doing 1,000 transactions per minute and is being charged separately on every one of them, even if the rate is minimal, it will have an impact.  It might be a good thing and stop much of the malpractice that comes from accelerated trading on the markets.  The view emerging is that when it finally settles, it may not be as onerous a tax as when it was first conceived.  My latest information is that it would be akin to our stamp duty on share transactions, but at a much lower level.  This might be just a first step from which it might move on.  We hold our position, namely, that we are not getting involved because of the possibility of the transfer of business and jobs from Dublin to London.</p></speech>

The German finance committee met the Minister today and the Minister said a politician must manage a Department and make decisions in a different way from an economist.  One of the pieces of advice the committee gave us was that we should hire a very good PR firm in Germany to convince the voters that they must deal with the legacy debt, because politicians there have to sell the same concept about legacy debt to the German taxpayer.  I do not know if they gave the same advice to the Minister.  The Minister said indications suggest growth will take us below 3% in 2015.  He referred to hard facts, by which I presume he means the fact that tax income is ahead of profile and that the drop in spending is less than the profile and other elements we have seen in the early part.  Have I missed any hard facts that suggest we will hit below that 3%?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.335" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061800011#N00500"><p>For the first five months of the year, the tax take is above profile by &euro;446 million and the swings and roundabouts on the expenditure side at least cancel each other out.  Anecdotal evidence suggests economic growth is accelerating.  Job creation is moving faster than we calculated at budget time.  Because interest rates on our debt are lower than we estimated at budget time, the NTMA will have unanticipated savings, so there is a margin there.  The Central Bank may make excess profits that were not signalled at budget time, again because things are going right.  Examining a series of factors that affect budget positions, many of them are positive, and if it continues for the rest of the year, our position will have improved significantly.</p><p>  There are also negatives.  Although it is an open secret that there is an overrun on health expenditure, it is more than compensated for by the underspend due to additional people returning to work.  Another piece of the jigsaw people do not immediately see is that while the tax flow comes to the Exchequer, the flow of PRSI receipts from the extra people at work goes to the Department of Social Protection.  Therefore, as well as having lower expenditure because fewer people are on the live register, the Department of Social Protection has an additional inflow of money from PRSI receipts.  Another down side is that when the troubles in Ukraine developed, our agency that examines strategic energy reserves wisely got into commitments on the spot market.  These liabilities affect the budgetary position.  Although there are swings and roundabouts, if the swings are the positives, there are more of them than roundabouts, but we are only five months into the year.</p></speech>

We have previously had years in which we had a good first half and it fell away in the second half.  I could give a figure, but I might give a false steer.  We are travelling hopefully and the indicators are positive.  The other positive aspect to the excess tax take in the first five months of the year is that the increase was across all the sectors, which is the sign of an economy on the move.  Again, I do not want to exaggerate any position, as it could fall away.</p></speech>

When one does year-on-year comparisons, the margin between 2014 and 2013 will be smaller because of the strength of the tax take in the second half of last year.</p></speech>

The figures that came from the IMF, the Commission and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council were based on figures supplied in part by the Department.  Were they pre-April figures?  How recent were the figures on which they based the project of keeping to the &euro;2 billion adjustment?</p></speech>

Given that we always publish the monthly revenue flows and returns, that data would also have been available to them.</p> <p>I am not quite sure what they took into account when they were doing their assessment and they would go into the process of doing a report.  Some of what I am telling the committee is fact such as the Revenue figures for the first five months of the year but some is what is called "soft data" and they would not have been in possession of some of that, about which I am giving the committee an indication.</p></speech>

We need to know those data the Commission has taken into consideration in its projections and the need to cut by &euro;2 billion.  I do not know what access the Minister has to that.</p><p>  The Minister mentioned possible excess profits from the Central Bank and dividends being paid to the Exchequer.  There is a profile for the sale of the IBRC promissory notes to the market and there is pressure to sell them into the market earlier.  Currently, the notes are effectively recycled and the State receives the interest coupon.  Is it the view of both the Minister and the Central Bank that they should be sold at the slowest pace possible to make sure that is of most benefit to the State?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014061800012#O00300"><p>There is a schedule of sales of Irish paper held by the Central Bank and the agreement was that this would be subject to review against the background of market sustainability.  According to the current schedule, a sale is due at the back end of this year.  That is a commitment of the Central Bank.  However, there are swings and roundabouts because a coupon is paid by the Exchequer on the paper that is being held by the bank.</p></speech>

When the paper is sold, it is sold to a private sector investor.  One therefore pays the full coupon but there would not be a return on it.  On the other hand, because of the falling interest rates, which have gone down so much since we made the arrangement last year, the nominal value of the Irish paper held by the Central Bank has gone up by approximately &euro;4 billion and, therefore, any sale now will show a capital gain and that will come back to the Exchequer.  One would need time to do all the calculations and the pluses and minuses.</p></speech>

If the schedule is speeded up, it is flagged as a danger.  There needs to be caution in this regard to ensure the best value is achieved.  How open are the Central Bank and the Government to pressure to sell the promissory notes into the market more quickly?</p></speech>

If one were to dump a lot of Irish paper on the markets, the effect would be that interest rates would go up and, therefore, nobody would ask to do that.  That is not the position.  Currently, we are not under pressure to accelerate but it is in a provision and it would involve a dialogue between the officials in Frankfurt and Dame Street to decide what that would be.  It would not be a political decision.  I stress that it is not all downside.  Because of the increase in nominal value of the paper, a capital gains element comes into the calculations, which offsets the loss on the coupon.</p></speech>

This is particularly important because the meeting is being broadcast live.</p><p>  The subject matter of the meeting is important; it is one that has been ongoing since the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, namely, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership agreement, better known as the TTIP, the discussions on which are ongoing.  One year ago the Trade Council of the European Union agreed to formally launch negotiations with the United States on the TTIP and in the intervening period a number of rounds of talks have taken place.  The joint committee has been involved to the extent that we met the then president of the Irish Farmers Association last October.  Today we are meeting representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.  I welcome its new CEO, Mr. Mark Redmond, as well as Mr. Brian Cotter, its public affairs director.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear a presentation by Mr. Redmond which will be followed by a question and answer session with committee members.  I am delighted to see so many of them present for the presentation and I am sure they all regard this issue as being extremely important.  If there is a successful outcome, I hope it will lead to the creation of extra jobs in the country.  I call on Mr. Redmond to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.379" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Redmond" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014061800002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us to speak to them.  As the Chairman stated, I am joined by Mr. Brian Cotter, director of public affairs at the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland.  We are here to discuss the potential benefits for Ireland of a comprehensive transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP, or EU-US trade deal.  With the Chairman's permission, I will begin by talking about the work of the chamber and the importance of the bilateral economic relationship between Ireland and the United States.</p> <p>The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland represents the 700 US companies which have created jobs in Ireland and which directly employ at least 115,000 people.  At least the same number of jobs has been created indirectly as a result of US company employment here.  These companies account for over 70% of all IDA Ireland-supported employment.  Total US investment in Ireland stands at $204 billion and represents 26% of GDP.</p><p> It is important to note that this is a two-way street.  The relationship is bilateral - 230 Enterprise Ireland companies have created at least 130,000 jobs across the 50 states of the United States.  We are constantly amazed at the vote of confidence of the United States in Ireland.  The total investment here exceeds the combined investment by the United States in France and Germany and exceeds by 20% the combined investment in the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China.  For such a small country we have succeeded exceptionally in becoming a global location of choice for investment and trade.  Ireland is home to nine of the top ten pharmaceutical companies in the world and 13 of the top 15 medical technology companies and is rightly considered the Internet capital of Europe, with all ten of the top ICT and "born on the Internet" companies located here, creating fantastic jobs.</p><p> These companies and their 115,000 employees are creating outstanding products and services that are making a difference to people's lives throughout the world.  For example, four out of every five medical stents used throughout the world, 50% of all hospital ventilators which save and help to maintain lives throughout the world and one third of all contact lenses which are very important in the context of the events of this week are made in Ireland.  They have an impact on our social fabric, the education system, the job opportunities available to young people and our physical infrastructure.  A short walk from here the "digital docklands" have been transformed by the vote of confidence of these companies.</p><p> The chamber's role is to encourage a policy environment that attracts this investment and keeps these jobs in the country by fostering the development of bilateral trade and investment flows between Ireland and the United States.  Reasons for our success include certainty in policy; the commitment at the highest political level to ensuring we create a jobs-friendly environment; the outstanding qualifications of Irish people; the transparent tax system; and, most important, as recognised throughout the US foreign direct investment community, the ability of Irish people to deliver successfully on the mandates they are given by US companies.  We are positioned as a provider of products and services consumed globally and used daily for the reasons I have outlined.</p><p> The TTIP stands apart from other international trade agreements for several reasons.  First, the scale of the existing economic relationship between the European Union and the United States is unprecedented.  Nearly half of global economic output is generated by the European Union and the United States, which is extraordinary.  The total commercial relationship generates &euro;45 billion in commercial activity each day and supports 15 million jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.  Second, this commercial relationship is not based solely on commercial interests but on shared values such as democracy, civil liberties, the rule of law and a long and rich history of friendship and strategic partnership.  Third, the TTIP is unique because of its potential to set high standards for 21st century trade and investments agreements around the world in areas such as protecting intellectual property, cultivating the digital economy and combating trade and investment protectionism.  This is a particularly important point.  The benefits could be immense.  Ireland is positioned as a gateway for the United States to the European market.  Given that Ireland is the largest export platform in the world for US companies, we have the potential to emerge as a significant beneficiary of a successful and comprehensive transatlantic free trade deal.</p><p> The TTIP would increase the volume and value of transatlantic trade and investment, create employment opportunities, boost incomes for citizens in both the United States and the European Union, and improve the global competitiveness of both parties.  Because Ireland exports 80% of everything we produce, tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of Irish jobs depend on good foreign trade relationships and agreements.  Reducing barriers to trade would make a significant difference to businesses of all sizes throughout Ireland.</p><p> Various levels of monetary tariffs are imposed and average 4%.  They can have an impact on Irish businesses and their reduction or removal would have significant consequences for sectors in which Ireland is commercially active.  There are also non-tariff barriers and the greatest benefit of the TTIP would come from reducing these blockages which increase the cost of doing business and restrict market access.  Different regulatory structures make it difficult for firms to enter the market across the Atlantic and, according to estimates, these bureaucratic hurdles alone are equivalent to customs duties of 10% to 20%.  They inflict significant trade costs on industries in which Ireland has been successful in attracting investment, including manufacturing, chemicals, finance and ICT.  Improving the compatibility of standards and regulations and greater mutual recognition of standards would eliminate many of these barriers.</p><p> By co-operating, both the European Union and the United States would be able to achieve legitimate policy objectives such as protecting the environment and public health, without any diminution of standards, while avoiding the duplication of effort that makes goods and services more expensive.  For example, the pharmaceutical industry is one of Ireland&rsquo;s biggest industries, creating significant, high value employment and producing ground-breaking treatments that are saving and enhancing lives around the world.  We have nine of the top ten global pharmaceutical companies located here.  Having a set of common standards would increase or maintain safety, while cutting costs.  Because Irish pharmaceutical products are thoroughly tested here, they can be sold throughout the European Union, but they must undergo costly testing again to enter the US market.  This is despite the fact that Irish pharmaceutical plants have an outstanding record in terms of FDA inspections and are rated extremely highly globally.</p><p> Although the Internet allows small retailers to sell their products easily across the world, exporting can be difficult.  Retailers can be hindered in their exporting abilities by having to comply with a plethora of customs rates and import rules for all the products they sell.  This is particularly burdensome for the small and medium-sized business sector.  Eliminating tariffs and streamlining regulatory procedures will make it easier, faster and cheaper for online retailers to ship their products and access markets that were too complex to tap into before.</p><p> The Centre for Economic Policy Research, a leading independent, pan-European economic research organisation, has predicted that an ambitious EU-US trade deal would increase the size of the EU economy by approximately &euro;120 billion, 0.5% of GDP, and the US economy by &euro;95 billion, or 0.4% of GDP.  I need not tell members about the difficulty in our current straitened budgetary times of coming up with innovative ways to stimulate the economy and create jobs.  This is a very important opportunity for us to do so.</p> <p> Ireland is well positioned to benefit significantly from a successfully concluded transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  As I hope the committee has seen, we have built a very strong and solid foundation for investment in our country and we foresee substantial opportunities arising from greater and easier EU-US trade and investment.  The small and medium enterprise, SME, sector has most to gain from these new possibilities as removing tariffs and reducing red tape and regulatory burden for them will, importantly, allow access to new export markets and opportunities that are currently out of reach.  I assure the committee that the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland will continue to support the efforts on all sides to reach an ambitious and comprehensive agreement and spread the positive message of the EU-US trade deal.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention and we are happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

Yesterday we saw protests outside Agriculture House and I know the US Secretary of Agriculture is paying a visit here.  Will we see much benefit from a trade deal in agriculture?  The beef market with the US will open imminently, and we have hormone-free beef and good quality products.  The Americans have a tariff on beef currently but would a deal boost agriculture?</p></speech>

Currently, Ireland produces enough food for 30 million people, and we understand that rate will double in 20 years.  The export opportunities are therefore superb.  Ireland has a quality reputation, and the Chairman mentioned Irish beef, which is grass-fed, and we also have an outstanding reputation for dairy products in the US market.  There is tremendous opportunity, although we are not na&iuml;ve about the scale of the US agricultural machine.  With Ireland's reputation for quality, there is a super opportunity.  The European negotiators have been very clear from the word go that hormoned beef is off the agenda in these talks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.384" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014061800004#C00400"><p>I thank Mr. Redmond for this contribution, as he has outlined very clearly the importance of US investment in this country and the creation of much-needed employment.  That has been a feature of US investment for many decades, and I am glad Mr. Redmond also mentioned the major contribution of Irish companies to employment in the United States, as it is often forgotten.  Great credit is due to the companies employing approximately 130,000 people in the US.  Some of these are brands for Ireland, particularly in the food industry.</p><p>  Mr. Redmond mentioned that the US and the EU account for half the world's economic output.  I read recently that a third of global trade is represented by the EU and US, so any trade agreement is of major significance, not just for those two trading blocs but for the entire world.  Naturally, we want proper standards achieved, with the benefit of trade deals accruing from extra business and the creation of employment.</p><p>  The World Trade Organization seems to have been sidelined to a certain extent.  President Barroso has been very keen to advance the Mercosur deal and if agreement is reached, there will be very big down sides for Ireland, particularly the food area mentioned by the Chairman.  There may be one or two sectors in the food industry that would welcome the Mercosur deal, such as the drinks industry, which has great potential to export to South America.  Is there an impetus to complete the Mercosur deal before this European Commission's term of office expires before the end of the year?</p><p>  I have a concern about one element of TTIP, the clause dealing with investor to state dispute settlement.  My understanding is that the provision would allow investors to challenge countries in international courts.  If that is correct and it is part of an agreement, it would curtail a government's ability to respond to some issues.  For example, climate change is not addressed enough in any trade deal over decades, as far as I can see, and countries are sidelined in some of the decision-making processes.  A country may wish to introduce new climate change policies, strengthen energy efficiency standards and provide better support for renewable energy in general.  A greater reliance on fossil fuels runs counter to the ideals of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and any of us in Parliament should uphold the primacy of governments being able to make their own decisions and retain competencies to the greatest extent possible.  If states do not retain competence and policy flexibility to regulate the exploration and exploitation of their own natural resources, we will be moving to a very difficult area that may not be beneficial, particularly for less developed countries.  We must be careful of that issue, although we support a deal that would be balanced, protect workers' rights and offer adequate support for the environment.  It should help to improve and advance human rights throughout the world.  These are basic factors that should form an important part in any final agreement.</p></speech>

As he correctly states, this is the largest trading bloc, and for that reason the trade agreement is important not only in itself and with respect to the trading relationship between the EU and the US but also as an example for future trade agreements.  That is one of the key reasons this investor to state dispute settlement mechanism mentioned by the Deputy is a component.  It is not necessarily a burning issue for the two trading blocs which are negotiating this agreement but it should be present because the agreement will provide an exemplar for trade agreements with other parts of the world where the legal framework may not be as robust as it is between the United States and the European Union.  If somebody is to invest seriously and create jobs in a territory, they want to ensure that investment will not just be protected but will remain undamaged by elements like expropriation of assets and so on.  It is interesting to consider the record of using that mechanism over recent years in trade deals, as it has been used 60% of the time by EU member states and 7% of the time by the US.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to the Mercosur deal but I am not very close to it.  As I understand it, that is a very different market with different concerns, particularly for the beef industry.  With regard to the timing of the TTIP deal, the US will want to conclude the trans-Pacific partnership deal before TTIP.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cotter" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014061800004#C00800"><p>I will not add much but I agree that the farm industry is quite sophisticated.  It combines not only traditional but nutritional sectors, including companies producing infant milk, for example, for a significant share of world markets.  Considering the relationships between Ireland and the United States, the investor relationship is very important and Irish companies generate more sales from Irish investments in the US than in trade.  Similarly, US investment here generates much more in terms of sales than the exports of US companies to Ireland.  That is an important consideration.  The Deputy has indicated that when we consider the totality of the impact from the trade deal, we must consider it at many levels to see what sectors gain and lose, etc.</p> <p>A lot of the reports that are produced, and the economic analysis, examine this matter.  Broadly speaking, our members are involved in industrial trade and would welcome greater harmonisation of high standards to support trade and a reduction of barriers.</p><p> The trade investment agreement has not been an issue for Ireland because it has not been a part of our tax treaty networks and otherwise.  That is because the rule of law here is well respected.  About 1,400 agreements exist between European countries and others so it is quite complex.  The Lisbon treaty transferred that competency to the Commission to standardise the process.  I agree that the main objective is to ensure that in areas where the rule of law might not be as robust, there is some degree of arbitration when a dispute arises.  In particular, if it exists between the United States and the EU, when other trade agreements are made, be it the WTO or other regional trade agreements, the important principle of having an investor to state agreement is enshrined, at least, in one of the biggest economic relationships which was just outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014061800005#D00200"><p>I welcome the delegation here this afternoon.  At one level everyone agrees that trade between countries and regions is a positive thing.  I do not think there is anyone present who would disagree with my comment.  However, trade needs to be based on fairness, sustainability and respect for citizens.  There are trade agreements with countries that have a poor human rights record.</p><p>  Part of the difficulty with TTIP is that there has been no real debate on it in Ireland.  There have been catchy headlines along the lines of "Over 500 billion positives" regarding trade.  Underneath all that there has been no debate.  Therefore, I welcome the fact we are here today to discuss this matter for the first time.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs had people in last week and the week before but that was the first time we had a debate on the matter.</p><p>  Would the delegation agree there has been secrecy surrounding the negotiations, particularly in Ireland and right across Europe but not in the US?  During the third round, 50 stakeholders were brought in to take part in a debate.  Does the delegation think that would be a positive thing for the Irish Government and others involved in the negotiations to do?  Should we include everyone who will be impacted by these negotiations, for example, the trade union movement that represents workers or sectors such as the beef industry and agrifood?  Would their inclusion be a positive move?  If we do not have such scrutiny, people will ask where are we going and what are we being sucked into in regard to this matter.  It would be positive to have such scrutiny to develop this matter.</p><p>  The elimination of regulation, such as non-alignment tariffs, which were mentioned, and the elimination of blockages for business were put forward by the promoters of TTIP.  No-one would oppose anything that eliminates blockages to business and eliminates bureaucratic hurdles.  However, some of the areas covered by non-tariff measures are very sensitive such as food and beverages, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and automotives.  In terms of balance, safeguarding public policy in these areas is probably the most crucial aspect.</p><p>  In terms of a common standard, we must ask ourselves the following questions.  Will the standard go up or down?  Are we dumbing it down?  Will we have a level playing field?  Everyone agrees with a level playing field but we know to our cost that some countries have higher regulations than others in this matter.</p><p>  With regard to investor to state dispute settlements, I can give an example.  Last week the Seanad held a debate on the packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products.  One of the issues that arose under this policy in Australia, for instance, was that court cases were taken against the Australian Government by some of the companies.  That would be a concern for me, as it would be for any reasonable person.  Fracking caused similar difficulties for the Federal Government in Quebec.  Fracking is a controversial issue here.  Does the delegation believe that the inclusion of an investor to state dispute settlement measure is a negative or positive step - if there are positives, I would like to hear them - in the context of EU countries having a policy without fear of unfair litigation?  That is one of the policy areas we would like to tease out and hear more about, particularly from companies, and I have given two examples.</p><p>  With regard to EU trade, five papers have been prepared in this area and four of them have been fairly positive.  One paper was commissioned by the United Left in the European Parliament and the group gave its submission to the Joint Committee on European Affairs.  It was a bit critical but such papers help the debate.  We need to examine all of these matters.  Everyone has spoken about the positives but that group suggested there could be negatives in some cases such as employment. Some countries will do well with the increase in trade but there is a danger that some will not be able to compete with cheaper exports.  That situation will affect not only trade between the US and Ireland but trade within Europe.  Some countries do not have such high regulations in respect of climate change, for example, and these are additional costs, which means those countries will face difficulties.  One can say that this matter forms part of the debate but we are not hearing that and that is why I keep coming back to this matter.</p></speech>

He is anxious to answer some of them.  I will call on the Deputy again afterwards.</p></speech>

I will make a few comments which will be followed by a few comments by Mr. Cotter.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Crowe's analysis that we need far more debate on these talks.  Today's discussion is an important contribution to that debate.  We, in the American Chamber of Commerce, are doing our very best to create an awareness of these talks in Ireland.  I give credit to the American embassy which has worked with us on a number of events to create awareness.  As I said in my remarks, if the agreement is done successfully, it would be particularly good news for consumers and small businesses here.</p><p>  With regard to the question on the privacy or secrecy of the talks, one must strike a balance.  During negotiations one cannot reveal one's cards.  Having said that, I would give credit to the efforts made by the European side to be as transparent as possible, and I will give examples.  At the last round of negotiations, 700 representatives of trade unions, federations, NGOs and consumer protection agencies were involved.  Last February the European Commission established a new advisory group to assist it with the negotiations which comprised 14 representatives from sectors including trade unions, consumers, environmental protection and so on.  We think these elements are very important, but we also agree with the Deputy that people do not know enough about these talks.  We can all play a role in improving that situation.  Let us remember there are 115,000 direct jobs, and the same number of indirect jobs, involved and we all know families who have benefited from this process.  Therefore, it is in our interest to have an informed debate on this matter.</p><p>  The Deputy is right about standards.  It is important that our EU negotiators continue to insist, as they have done throughout, that there will be no diminution of standards as part of this process.  However, people need to hear that message more.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cotter" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014061800005#D00500"><p>On the question of the various economic reports, the contribution made by the Austrian think tank was quite useful.  It was very clear on the conditions of its analysis.  In particular, it tried to estimate potential dislocation costs etc., which I thought was useful.</p> <p>I note that the author said that, long term, the implications were positive, as reflected in the Deputy's comments.  Looking at the industry make-up of Ireland, it is less exposed to these dislocations.  The clusters Ireland has built in its trading sector are strong.  Ireland exports such a huge proportion of its output that it is quite sophisticated, has high skills and is competitive in the international environment.  Exporters are well placed to benefit from the industry clusters in the life sciences, ICT, Internet companies and traded services.  The dislocation costs may not be that significant.  The committee may want to note that the Department is planning to launch a report it commissioned to assess the impact.  One of our messages to the Department was not to focus exclusively on trade, which would be important and have an impact, but also to consider the question of how it impacted on the investment relationship which would be more important to Ireland because it acted as a key in the international cog of the activity of our members, US multinationals servicing the world.  It is tricky, but our members seem to believe anything that enhances economic activity and trading and investment activity between the United States and Europe will give Ireland opportunities.  That is what we want to emphasise.</p></speech>

There are concerns in civil society and among NGOs about the lack of serious and meaningful debate.  I take it that the delegates welcome the debate and that there has been a start made in Europe.  There needs to be a start made in Ireland and I hope the committee will encourage hearing the other side of the argument.  I hope we will propose that a debate be held in the D&aacute;il on these important issues.</p><p>  The delegates referred to harmonisation and regulatory standards.  Other trade agreements have seen a race to the bottom when it comes to the environment, labour and consumer standards.  That has happened in the past.  How can we ensure this agreement will be different?  With regard to employment creation, the Single Market and the common currency have led to job losses.  As we now have a figure of 26 million people unemployed in Europe, what we have seen to date has not created the employment the delegates seem convinced we will see.  I accept that they are saying they hope it will lead to improved standards, but other agreements have not done so.  I accept the facts presented about multinational companies in Ireland, but we have had multinational companies that availed of the tax breaks and tax concessions and left, leading to the loss of employment.  We see others that are planning do this or downsize.  There must be greater job security  There are fears that we are seeing what are termed yellow pack workers.  The incident at Bausch &amp;amp; Lomb in Waterford shows that workers are being told they can take it or the employers will leave.  We see aggressive lobbying for them to move to New York.  We are up against the idea that firms can come and go.  We must be careful about this.</p><p>  In respect of the United States and Europe, Ireland is the gateway and benefiting.  How will it continue to benefit after the TTIP is agreed to?  </p><p>  My other question concerns the tax implications.  We do not want Ireland to be a tax haven, yet we see aggressive tax avoidance measures by multinationals.  How can we ensure a free trade agreement will not make profit shifting easier?</p></speech>

We had a major debate that was not just confined to D&aacute;il committees.  It took place in schools, universities and pubs and involved every citizen before the major decision was made.  It is valid that we should have a debate on this agreement and I can understand people's fears about the investor and state dispute settlement.  While we understand that if there is no rule of law to protect investment, it will not happen, there is a fear that the expertise, money and might of big investors against poor countries might give them an unfair advantage.  Many of people's questions and concerns relate to the fact that the European Union is a trade bloc, but it also has the European Commission ensuring harmonisation of standards and mutual recognition to the highest standards.  Not alone does it make standards, it enforces them, even though there are still offenders within the Union.  Ireland is often threatened with fines.  The concerns my colleagues are expressing are valid.</p><p>  Having said that, I support the notion of a trade agreement.  While there are problems, there are also major advantages for all sides as it will allow countries to capitalise on their absolute and comparative advantages and brings jobs and investment to both sides for their mutual advantage.  The European Union did this for Ireland and all other countries, but there were losers in certain sectors.  Do the delegates foresee that sectors in Ireland will struggle as a result of this agreement?  I can understand they may be reluctant to name them in response to that difficult question, but not everyone can be a winner in a case like this, although we hope that it will raise all boats.</p></speech>

It is correct that this is not a magic wand and it should not be portrayed as such.  It will not solve the problem of the 330,000 jobs we have lost since the crisis.  As I said, Members of the Oireachtas recognise the budgetary challenge of trying to incentivise the creation of jobs.  This is a move in that direction, by making it easier to trade with our largest trading block, without expenditure to the State.  It is right to raise and debate the issue of the diminution of standards.  European Commission negotiators are adamant that there will be no diminution of standards and the same point is made by the US negotiators.  We must monitor this, but, as Mr. Cotter said, the levels of standards among the member companies we represent such as the pharmaceuticals and medical appliances industries are exceptionally high on both sides of the Atlantic, as they should be.  We are suggesting we should not duplicate a set of high standards and should see if we can provide for synergism.</p><p>  On the tax haven debate, Ireland is absolutely not a tax haven.  I always try to think of the 115,000 great people working for US companies here producing great products and services, creating jobs and spending &euro;20 billion in the economy every year through payroll, goods and services.  That is real substance and the opposite of a tax haven.</p><p>  On the idea that companies come and then depart, the company mentioned in Waterford is staying in Ireland.  Thank God, 400 new jobs were announced this morning in PayPal in Dundalk.  It is a great boost of confidence for Ireland and people in the region are delighted with the news.</p></speech>

We must reinforce the point that the negotiations' objective is the mutual recognition of equal or higher, not lower, standards.</p> <p>Interestingly, we understand from civil society in the US that one of the reasons the negotiations with Europe have moved along with more enthusiasm is that some groups in the US look to Europe for those higher standards in terms of the environment and labour that they do not necessarily get at the state or federal level in the US.  It is interesting from that perspective.</p><p> I agree with Mr. Redmond that it is complex from the point of view of the industrial base.  However, we can say that the traded sector in particular, that is, the exporting sector comprising multinationals and indigenous companies, has performed very strongly at a time of great economic turbulence and global uncertainty.  Such companies are always competing and changing.  There are organisations which employ the same numbers of people now as ten years ago but what those people do might be completely different.  There will always be change and the Deputy will appreciate the importance of a skills strategy in that context.  We must be very cognisant of where the future opportunities lie for companies and what people will need in terms of training and so forth.  That is an ongoing debate.</p><p> It is interesting to look at the profile of our member companies.  Many of them have a global role.  They have responsibility for operations not only in Ireland but all around the world.  They have a unique perspective and I would encourage the committee to get that perspective on more strategic issues.  They see competition coming, from an investment perspective, years ahead of competitors in their trade or service because they need to win the investment first.  It is complex and very intense.  That intensity has existed for a number of decades in Ireland and that is why traded industry in Ireland has been a strong contributor during this recessionary period.  They are proud of their contribution and want to do more.</p></speech>

I strongly support the concept of the removal of barriers, whether technocratic or bureaucratic, as quickly as possible.  At the same time, we must bear in mind that any trade agreement is a two-way process.  We must always recognise that there are benefits and losses and we must try to minimise the latter.  There is not much sense in entering into an agreement that is beneficial to one or two sectors but hugely damaging to others.  That must be borne in mind in the context of the negotiations taking place.  The EU and the US are natural partners.  They are both huge trading blocs with an enormous amount of production and have great potential to complement each other's efforts.</p><p>  I am concerned about the ongoing references to Ireland as a tax haven because it is damaging.  I am not having a political dig at my colleague here but much of the commentary is being trotted out in a way that is undermining our attempts to attract foreign direct investment and create employment.  Often times there is a lack of objectivity and I cannot understand where it is actually heading.  We hear foreign commentators regularly refer to the "double Irish" in a sneering way which is not helping our efforts to create employment and encourage foreign direct investment.  We must be very aware of that.  Any attempt to pretend that this is not damaging is wrong.</p><p>  I attended a meeting six months ago where an international entrepreneur of considerable wealth had a swipe at us for the so-called "double Irish" in a way which clearly illustrated his belief that we were up to some kind of chicanery, had double standards and were not being honest.  We are trading in the international arena and must take cognisance of the fact that all of this information goes abroad and can gain traction in a way that is damaging to our economy.</p><p>  It should be clarified that profits earned in this country are taxed in the normal way at 12.5% and that there are no exceptions to that.  It is open to companies which have operations in other countries to reroute their profits through EU states, but it is for them to decide whether to pay tax in the countries in which they have a manufacturing base.  We should avoid attempting to undermine our own credibility in this area to the extent that we have done.  Certainly, we should not collaborate with others who have a vested interest in competing with us in the international arena.</p><p>  In the context of the point made by Deputy Smith, there is an enormous amount of Irish overseas investment at present.  There are many major international companies located all over the globe which are providing jobs and benefiting local economies.  It is not a one-way process and we should recognise the huge contribution made by such firms over many years.  The day is gone when we were simply begging bowl artists.  We now have a highly educated population with highly advanced technical skills.  Our education system has produced some of the finest entrepreneurs in the world who are sought after internationally.  We should not be apologetic about the fact that we have the power and the wherewithal to compete with anybody and to do so regularly.</p></speech>

These are major factors in terms of international investment.  We are not looking for easy options or concessions as we are well able to compete in the open market in our own right.  The reliability of the services in a country is a major issue for international investors.  When investors are considering where they will invest in the world, the criteria are the consistency, reliability and trustworthiness of places, and if those boxes are not ticked, they do not want to go there.</p><p>  The issue of climate change was raised.  As we know, some countries do not recognise the need to take measures on climate change and that can place at a disadvantage countries that are introducing such measures.  We need to ensure the playing pitch is level and that recognition is given for meeting the requirements on climate change.</p><p>  During a previous round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, we had submissions from NGOs and others on EU trade with Africa in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy, and the thrust of their argument was the need to facilitate the poor farmers in Africa.  It had nothing to do with that but with multinational corporations that were anxious to seize a larger slice of the markets and did so to the disadvantage of the poor farmers in Africa.  I would always be anxious to facilitate people across the globe who might be in a difficult position, to encourage them and to offer them options.</p><p>  I agree that common standards applicable to international trade are of major importance.  I give as an example the three pin plug versus the two pin plug.  When I was young, I was told there was nothing to beat the three pin plug as it was the ultimate in safety.  It may well be but it is not recognised all over the world.  Different standards apply in the US and in Australia and their economies do not collapse as a result of having different standards.  We need to recognise that universal recognition of our standards is for the betterment of our respective economies on both sides of the Atlantic and globally.</p></speech>

Our exports to the US are in the region of about &euro;23 billion and our imports are approximately &euro;6 billion, so the balance is very much in our favour.  Since 2010, Ireland has won 14% of all US investment into Europe although we are only 1% of the population.  It is estimated that the benefits of the proposals could be in the region of 4,000 jobs, which would be a plus for us.  Round five of the negotiations have been quite successful.

That is the point that I want to have debated.  We did not touch on the issue of job displacement.  All of the studies suggest that there will be job displacement.  Again one of the studies raised the cost of unemployment and that the costs arising from job displacement have not been considered.</p> <p>The impact of an agreement on least developed countries, LDCs, was downplayed in many of the studies.  One of them refers to a possible reduction in real GDP of up to 3% in these countries.  While we heard that this figure was not conclusive, it is a substantial decline, especially in light of the European Union's commitment to reduce poverty in LDCs.</p><p> We also heard some frightening figures on internal trade in the European Union.  One of the studies indicated the reduction in intra-EU trade would be modest at 3%, while another predicted a much more substantial decline of 30%.  Clearly, there is a significant divergence in opinion on this issue.</p><p> I heard reports that the Irish Farmers Association would not have a problem if a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement were reached.  Given the importance of the agrifood sector, I would have expected farmers to have major concerns about a possible agreement.  That does not appear to be the case, however.</p><p> We have not heard a great deal about genetically modified foods and opinions in the European Union and United States on the potential impact of a TTIP agreement in terms of GM foods have diverged.  Do the witnesses agree that further study is required on the potential impact of a TTIP agreement on agriculture, GM foods and least developed countries?</p></speech>

Does the expiration of patents have any implications on the commitment of major pharmaceutical companies to maintain a base here?  It will clearly have implications for their productivity.  Does it also have implications for employment and Ireland's ability to attract similar industries to locate here in future?

Senator Walsh is well aware of the strengths of the sector.  I wish to link my comments to the issue of dynamics as Senator Walsh put his finger on a particular dynamic in the pharmaceutical industry.  It is notable that the employment strength of the life sciences sector remains high.  Significant new investment is being made here, with new companies locating to Ireland and current companies making new investments.  As we discussed, this is a global competitive environment and some of the companies which have patents are looking closely at how they will compete in the relevant businesses.  Some will remain and compete with a different business model, while others will divest of the relevant investments.  This is a reflection of the type of activity one sees in the pharmaceutical sector, with companies asking whether the portfolio of plants they operate is suitable for the businesses in which they want to be involved.</p><p>  In general, Ireland has a reputation as being a centre of excellence from a manufacturing perspective.  This is a major advantage in whatever business one wishes to be engaged.  From our perspective, we want to hold on to this centre of excellence in manufacturing and build upon it by ensuring companies find it attractive to invest in research and development and seek to partner with universities, etc. here in the life sciences sector.  There is, therefore, much to play for in the sector.  While some of the macroeconomic figures from the Central Statistics Office have been impacted by changes to patents, they do not appear to have had a significant impact on employment in the wider industry base.  This is, however, an issue to watch.  Speaking to members, they see more upside and opportunities, notwithstanding the obvious threats arising from the issue the Senator identified.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Crowe and an earlier questioner that there is room for more analysis.  A large number of reports have been published on the investment environment.  One of the interesting reports was produced by the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London, which examined intra-trade and the investment relationship.  It is curious and very positive that CEPR, in its research, suggests that for American companies operating in Europe, the employment of EU workers may increase by 11%.  Given the share of US investment Ireland attracts - the Chairman referred to a figure of 14% - we are very well positioned in the sectors in which US companies are involved.  Moreover, there are important indigenous companies involved in these sectors.  Deputy Crowe referred to the nutritional business and food.  Significant investments are being made in high technology nutritional products and services, not only by US companies but also Irish companies.  Kerry Group, for instance, is making an investment in west Dublin focused on innovation and research and development that will create 1,000 jobs.  The group is a significant player in the ingredients marketplace in the United States.  The Irish Dairy Board and Glanbia are also significant players in this sector.  All of these companies trade on the excellence of manufacturing and the reputation of Irish management and workers for delivering high quality manufacturing facilities that meet the highest standards in the world.  These sectors can create considerable positive spillover for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>  On the issue of small and medium companies, we welcome the decision to open a new chapter in TTIP looking at the impact on SMEs, in particular the commitment on both sides of the Atlantic to carry this forward past the negotiations to ensure any blockages to SME access to markets or obtaining information about how to access markets are addressed.  This will be very important in enabling small companies to take advantage of opportunities.</p></speech>

Deputy Anne Ferris regrets that she will not be able to attend this part of the meeting, but she may attend later.  </p><p>  The purpose of the meeting is to hear a presentation on UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.  It is a very important resolution.  On behalf of the joint committee, I am very pleased to welcome Ms Liz McManus, chair of the monitoring group.  She is most welcome to this unfamiliar place.  I also welcome Mr. Greg Heylin, director of COSC, National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which comes within the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Mr. David Byrne from the Department of Defence is also very welcome and I thank him for being present.  I welcome Ms Helena Keleher, deputy director of the conflict resolution unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Comdt. Jayne Lawlor from the Defence Forces and Ms Salome Mbugua from AkiDwA who is a member of the monitoring group.  It is nice to meet her again.  She is very welcome and I thank her for attending.</p><p>  The format is that delegates will be invited to make an opening statement of approximately five minutes.  I urge them not to go beyond that time as there are many speakers and time is limited.  The presentations will be followed by a question and answer session with members.  </p><p>  I ask members, delegates and observers in the Visitors Gallery to please turn off all mobile phones or else to leave them in airplane or flight safe mode, depending on the device used.  It is not enough to leave them in silent mode because they interfere with the sound transmission in committee rooms which impacts negatively on broadcasting.  If, in the course of proceedings, there is interference, I will ask that phones be turned off completely.</p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of the proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that, under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>  I apologise for the late start.  We had some private business to conduct before we could meet in public.  I invite Ms McManus to commence her opening statement.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the committee has a lot of work items on its agenda and it is really appreciated that time has been made available to us.<br />United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, UNSCR 1325, recognises the unique and disproportionate impact of conflict on women, but it is also about the critical role women can play in war prevention, peace building and post-conflict reconstruction.  As a consequence of signing the UN resolution, Ireland produced a national action plan that was published in 2011 and which set targets both in terms of international engagements but also in terms of domestic work, specifically the work of this committee and that of the Department of Justice and Equality, and the role of the Defence Forces.  We are talking about the recruitment of women into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces and the approach taken in our overseas work.  We also focus on the services provided in this country for women who come from conflict zones.<br />I am the independent chair of the monitoring group which is composed 50:50 of civil society organisation, State agencies and Departments.  I pay tribute to all of the members who give of their time to make the group work.  One of the tasks we had to fulfil was delivery of a mid-term review which was ably carried out by Ms Karen McMinn and Ms Bronagh Hinds.  The report is lengthier than the national action plan.  It sets out clearly what progress has been made and what work still needs to be done.  <br />It is worth noting that the Defence Forces come in for particular praise in how they have responded to the national action plan.  Work is also being done by the Department of Justice and Equality, but there are also outstanding issues.  I will quickly read the recommendations made and conclusions reached:<blockquote>The Department of Justice and Equality should progress actions to promote awareness and provision of support services to women and girls from conflict-affected areas living in Ireland who are experiencing or recovering from domestic, sexual or gender-based violence [in their country of origin].  The Department should co-ordinate a holistic approach to women from conflict-affected countries involving effectively the range of divisions and agencies in the Department that have a role.  CSOs [civil society organisations] should be involved in assisting to document the women's experiences.</blockquote>When one talks about women in conflict areas, the use on a mass scale of rape as a weapon of war across many parts of the world is something of which we are very conscious as one aspect of the impact conflict has on women.</p> <p> I ask the committee to consider the national action plan review and, if possible, engage with the key agencies but also submit to the consultative process being carried out for the next national plan because there are measures that have been taken, measures that need to be taken and measures that cannot be taken.  We recognise it is a work in progress.</p><p> I invite the other speakers to contribute.  They are David Byrne, Department of Defence, Jayne Lawlor, Irish Defence Forces, Greg Heylin, Department of Justice and Equality, and Salome Mbugua from AkiDwA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.440" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Byrne" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014061800004#C00200"><p>My role here is to outline what the Department of Defence does with regard to the area of women, peace and security.  Our role is particularly at the strategic and policy level.  I work in the international security and defence policy area.  I also have responsibility for European Union issues.  That is not always a neat fit, so to speak, but when we are looking at EU missions going abroad, the gender aspect comes into it.  The international security and defence policy unit of the Department of Defence has responsibility for this issue.  We have responsibility also for defence related issues arising in the EU and the United Nations along with the European Defence Agency.</p><p>  My area of responsibility covers EU issues, particularly the common security and defence policy, CSDP, of the EU and assisting in developing Ireland&rsquo;s views in this area as well as the issue of women, peace and security.  The CSDP is the way the EU meets its international obligations to maintain international peace and security.  This is done by the CSDP providing the EU with an operational capacity to undertake crisis management tasks outside the territory of the EU.  This does not just refer to military tasks as there is a significant civilian and humanitarian dimension to dealing with such crises.  The EU has developed what it calls a comprehensive approach to dealing with crises and includes economic, diplomatic, political, military and humanitarian instruments.</p><p>  As part of my brief I have responsibility for UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the associated resolutions which deal with women, peace and security.  Every document that emanates from the EU that involves defence issues crosses my desk.  This can range from rapid response concepts to mission updates to developing new missions.  We co-ordinate closely with our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs to ensure a national approach is taken.</p><p>  The development of new missions and the reviews of existing missions is where we can achieve most with regard to women peace and security.  When missions are being established, they go through a number of phases, and the documentation is reviewed each time at various committees.  This is where we have our national input in that any mission must have unanimous agreement of all member states at Council.  For example, when the EU training mission to Mali was being discussed, Ireland ensured there were specific references to human rights and gender awareness included in the relevant planning documents.</p><p>  The EU also has a policy for the implementation of the Security Council resolutions in the context of CSDP missions and operations.  This document takes account of lessons learnt and has the aim of ensuring gender mainstreaming and implementation of the resolutions from early planning through to the conduct of the operation.  That is a brief flavour of how, strategically, we undertake our role in this issue in the Department.</p><p>  Ireland is also a member of the NATO Partnership for Peace programme.  As such we develop national goals to be achieved on an annual basis.  We in the Department negotiate these partnership goals, one of which was on gender perspectives using UN Security Council Resolution 1325 as the departure point.  That led to the Defence Forces implementing this goal from an operational perspective.</p><p>  NATO has also issued its own review relating to its implementation of the resolution in the conduct of NATO-led operations and missions.  As members will be aware, NATO undertakes missions and operations on behalf of the UN, and this review has looked at the practical side of addressing Resolution 1325 specifically in its missions.</p><p>  The final area I will briefly touch on is training.  Ireland is a member of the board of the European Security and Defence College, ESDC, which undertakes training in the area of common security and defence policy; it is a virtual college.  This college regularly runs courses on gender and operations covering areas such as gender in the planning process of operations, conflict related sexual violence and gender in security sector reform.  Courses are also run on the reform of the security sector itself, which includes modules on gender sensitive peacekeeping operations.  We in the Department have been strong supporters of the college and chaired the steering board of the college during the Irish Presidency of the European Council.</p></speech>

Ms McManus asked me to come here today to explain what the Defence Forces are doing to implement Resolution 1325 in the Defence Forces.</p><p>  The national action plan lists 12 specific tasks and the Defence Forces are listed and named in six of those tasks.  After the Department of Foreign Affairs, we are the second most heavily tasked organisation in Ireland.</p><p>  In terms of how we go about implementing these tasks, which was the main objective that fell on my shoulders when I took over this role, I wrote a Defence Forces action plan on the implementation of Resolution 1325.  At the time we were only the second military in the world to do that.  The action plan outlines in clear, concise format how we will to do it, the reason we are doing it, the timelines and the objectives.  It is all set so that at the end of it we can tick the box and say we have done something, or have not, and the area in which we have fallen down.</p><p>  UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the national action plan are built on a number of pillars.  The three main pillars that concern the Defence Forces are protection of women and children and the vulnerable; prevention of violence against women and children, particularly sexual violence; and participation.  For us that means increasing the number of female personnel in the Defence Forces.</p><p>  I will give a brief example of the way the Defence Forces can make themselves known and go about our job is in protection and prevention.  We had Irish troops stationed in Chad, and one of the main jobs we had to do was the protection of the IDP camps.  In terms of what was happening, as the women were leaving the IDP camps to go to the local town-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Commandant Jayne Lawlor" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014061800004#C00600"><p>Sorry; internally displaced personnel.  It refers to refugees who have not crossed a border.  The women and children were leaving the IDP camps to go to the local towns and villages to sell their wares or to buy food and necessities for their families, but once they were away from the camp and the protection ceased, they were being abused and raped.  There was no protection afforded to them.  One of the Irish soldiers, who happened to be a female soldier, was in the camps one day on official business and she was approached by a person from a non-governmental organisation who brought what was happening to her attention.  Until we were told about it we were not aware of it.</p><p>  There are two aspects to this, first, having a female peacekeeper present and the fact that the NGO found it much easier to approach a female.  The second aspect is that when she returned, she brought the issue to the attention of the commanders and a very simple plan was put in place whereby the Irish patrolled those roads on the day.  Their presence was a show of force and as a result the women could go about their local business in a protected fashion.  It is a very simple example but highlights an easy way of how we  go about the business.</p><p>  On what does the Defence Forces action plan on implementing Resolution 1325 concentrate or how do we go about implementing gender perspective?  The key is education.  From the day one joins the Defence Forces until one becomes a general, when one gets promoted and does a career course one has gender awareness, gender-based violence or sexual exploitation and abuse lectures at every stage.  The lectures are tailored to one's rank and experience to ensure one is not getting the same lecture repeatedly.</p><p>  On pre-deployment training, before we send people overseas, they receive six hours of human rights training and specific gender training.  That covers basic gender awareness but it also covers gender-based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse.</p><p>  We discuss issues such as codes of conduct including concrete measures to ensure the soldiers know the behaviour that is acceptable and unacceptable.  We have turned the UN blue card, which is a list of "do's" and "don'ts", into an Irish soldier's card and made it much more personal to us.  That outlines the behaviour that is and is not acceptable.</p><p>  In terms of when I talk to the soldiers, it is a male-dominated and quite macho environment, but I use that to my advantage and appeal to the protective nature of each soldier going out on missions.  I tell them that the onus is on every one of them to be aware of these issues and look out for human trafficking, gender-based violence and systematic rape and then take appropriate action, whether that is reported up the chain of command or, if possible, to intervene on the ground.  That depends on our mandate at the time.</p><p>  The third point is integrating a gender perspective.  I am operating at Defence Forces headquarters level.  We also have other gender advisers operating at the brigade and formation levels, and then we have gender focal points operating at the lowest unit level.  They are people who have a greater awareness of gender issues and they are then able to implement a gender perspective at the lowest level at all times.</p> <p>As for the greatest challenge in the future, probably the biggest point brought home to us in the mid-term review was about increasing female participation in the Defence Forces.  Obviously, the female members of the joint committee will be aware of the challenges of recruiting female personnel into certain fields, as well as their retention in those fields.  This is something on which I have been working extensively.  At the beginning of this year, we wrote to 400 schools and personally visited 140 schools, targeting female personnel and explaining to them what the Defence Forces can offer as a career and how it is something they should consider.  It is a challenge, particularly because we have full equality and full integration of our female personnel.  Consequently, we must ensure we are getting the right standard of person who is able to do the physical aspect of our job without dropping our standards.  That is my greatest challenge for the future and I thank members for their time.</p></speech>

I will address each of these actions in turn.<br />As for promoting awareness, the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, in the Department of Justice and Equality has recently agreed a RIA policy and practice document on safeguarding RIA residents against domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and harassment.  This policy was agreed between RIA, Cosc, AkiDwA, Ruhama, the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, the Domestic Violence Advocacy Service, the Irish Refugee Council and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and is available to download from the RIA website.  A training programme for staff and an awareness-raising campaign for residents will follow shortly.  The policy will be officially implemented once the required training takes place.  In advance of this, information posters already have been distributed to all RIA centres.  These posters, which are available in five languages including English, provide information on accessing professional help if residents have suffered or are suffering from domestic, sexual or gender-based violence or harassment.  All potential victims of human trafficking who are notified to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are informed of the services and supports available to them, including the services of the Reception and Integration Agency, the Health Service Executive and the Legal Aid Board.  These bodies also are informed of the person&rsquo;s details.  Each individual can then decide of which services to avail, depending on his or her individual circumstances.<br />Documenting experiences is the second measure we are required to action and in 2012, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, funded AkiDwA to produce an awareness-raising booklet entitled We Lived to Tell.  This booklet aimed to raise awareness of domestic violence and to challenge the culture of minimisation and denial of domestic violence among migrant communities.  It also aimed to empower and support survivors and those who experience domestic violence.  The booklet can be used as a resource tool for service providers, the public and educational institutions and was launched by me on 30 November 2012 at the invitation of  AkiDwA.  One of the stories details how a woman had to flee the country where she was living when war broke out and there were accounts circulating of women being raped.  When she went with her boyfriend to live in his country, she was subjected to domestic violence.  I believe Ms Salome Mbugua will talk about this project in more detail.<br />As part of the review of the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in Human Beings on Ireland 2009-2012, a pilot user satisfaction survey regarding the State&rsquo;s anti-human trafficking services was conducted with a sample of alleged victims of trafficking.  On the basis of the pilot study, it was found that obtaining the views of victims on their satisfaction levels was an achievable goal.  However, the means by which information is collected requires further consideration if this approach is to be used generally in the future.  The Rape Crisis Network Ireland produces detailed annual statistics on users of all rape crisis services in Ireland.   Six graphs and tables refer directly to refugees or asylum seekers, outlining the gender of the victim and the type of violence experienced.  Safe Ireland, the national body for domestic violence organisations, produces a single-day census of users of 37 front-line services.  This census gives a breakdown of the nationality and ethnic origins of the women using the services.<br />I will now turn to the final item, that is, the single application process.  The introduction of a single procedure for protection applicants will result in a re-organisation of the protection processing framework that will see the removal of the current sequential processes.  This will allow a protection applicant to get a final decision on his or her application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and should reduce greatly the time taken to process a case to finality.  In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 170 of Thursday, 12 June, concerning immigration reform and the publication of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, the Minister stated as follows:<blockquote>I wish to assure the Deputy that the Government remains committed to immigration reform as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme.  Since my appointment as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have been considering the many and varied issues that have arisen, and continue to arise, in relation to this key area of statutory reform.  Quite clearly significant legislative reform is required in this area - not least because of evolving jurisprudence and developments elsewhere.  Moreover, some of the reform measures required are patently more urgent than others.  For example, legislating to provide the means for a single procedure and related issues to deal with all protection claims is of priority in that it will provide the legislative framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system.  I am particularly anxious, therefore, to ensure that legislation to deal at least with the more urgent issues is brought forward this year.  In that respect work by my officials on legislative reform in this area continues including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel.</blockquote></p></speech>

Before proceeding further, I wish to acknowledge the Africa Day Award made to the committee on Saturday, 7 June.  This award recognises the very important work this committee undertakes and I congratulate all members for their efforts.  As members have heard, I am Salome Mbugua, the chief executive officer of AkiDwA, which is a national migrant women&rsquo;s network in Ireland.  I also am the former vice chair of the National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland.  In 2010 I was involved in the development of the national action plan on Resolution 1325 and I currently sit on the advisory and monitoring group of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p><p>  My organisation, AkiDwA, has been working with migrant women of all backgrounds and with different immigration status for more than a decade.  Over the years, we have supported many women that came to Ireland seeking protection and ended up within the asylum system.  My presentation to members today is therefore informed by AkiDwA&rsquo;s experience of engaging with women from war-torn countries.  I also have personal first-hand experience of engaging directly with women living in armed conflict through my voluntary work with Wezesha.  Wezesha is an African diaspora in Ireland initiative, of which I am the co-founder, working in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Kenya.  Since 2012 I have visited Africa on a number of occasions and the Democratic Republic of Congo in particular and have engaged directly with victims and survivors of violence and conflict.</p><p>  I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the Irish Government for the support it has given and continues to give to countries that have less.  I thank in particular the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and its Irish Aid programme.  The Irish Aid programme has supported many positive initiatives in Africa that have had a positive impact on people&rsquo;s lives and have improved their educational and economic status.  Much of this work has had a particular focus on improvements to the lives of women and children, which is to be commended.  The development of Ireland&rsquo;s national action plan on Resolution 1325 and its implementation clearly confirms the commitment that our country has made in addressing the matters contained within the resolution.  We have made good progress and I am sure much more will be achieved, as this is an ongoing process.</p><p>  Objective 3 of the national action plan seeks protection for women from gender-based violence and other forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.  In the action plan, Ireland has committed to increase access to justice for women and vulnerable groups, to promote awareness of and provide reasonable access to support services for migrants, which can assist them with their recovery from domestic, sexual or gender based violence.  Again, I commend Departments and agencies of the Government, as well as NGOs, on advancing actions in respect of objective 3.  I thank in particular the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive's social inclusion unit for being to the fore in progressing work on female genital mutilation in Ireland.</p> <p>One Senator, a member of the committee, Senator Ivana Bacik, was key in pushing it forward.</p><p> The Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012 took effect in September of that year.  Last month the Irish Family Planning Association, with funding from the HSE, opened a one-stop clinic which will provide survivors of female genital mutilation with a range of specialised services, including counselling and treatments.</p><p> Other areas in which I can cite progress include our dealings with COSC which Mr. Heylin mentioned, awareness raising and publication of the book and the Reception and Integration Agency in the development of policy.  Through direct engagement with these bodies, policies have been developed on preventing and addressing sexual harassment and gender based violence within direct provision centres, whether by managers, staff or residents.  However, these policies have yet to be implemented which gives cause for concern.  A further source of concern is the lack of monitoring of the 2012 Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act and the fact that there has been no official awareness-raising of the Act to inform victims and survivors of its provisions.</p><p> While we acknowledge all efforts and support from various Departments and Government agencies, we are concerned that Resolution 1325 is not taken seriously enough within Departments and institutions that have the greatest influence on the lives of women that the resolution seeks to protect.  The Department of Justice and Equality and its various offices and agencies such as the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Reception and integration Agency, COSC and the Office for the Promotion of Migrants Integration have most influence and authority over the lives of women and children now living in Ireland whom the resolution targets.  These bodies have to be to the fore.</p><p> Some areas need to be highlighted, the first of which is moving beyond basic needs.  While the basic needs of most women within the asylum system in Ireland might have been met and while they may feel more secure, their psychological and social well-being has not been addressed.  The majority continue to struggle with trauma.  Some, even though they were not raped, would have witnessed their family being killed in front of them.  There are definitely gaps and a lack of specialised supports available.  Other challenges include language barriers and the lack of support networks.</p><p> The second issue is applying transparent gender asylum guidelines.  Since 2008 AkiDwA has advocated for the implementation of asylum gender guidelines in order that the gender specific concerns about rape, female genital mutilation and exploitation during conflict would be recognised within the asylum process.  Based on statistics available to AkiDwA, at least 3,780 women are in need of such protection.  We have advocated for guidelines in line with those used by the UNHCR.  The Refugee Applications Office states it has implemented its own guidelines.  However, they are not publicly available.</p><p> The third issue is the length of time spent in asylum centres which affects the psychological well-being of women, the majority of whom, some from war torn countries, have been living in asylum centres for years, some for up to eight years.</p><p> The fourth issue is deportation.  On World Refugee Day last year, for example, deportations were carried out to the Democratic Republic of Congo where there was an ongoing conflict.  The way deportations are carried out tends to be more traumatic for women and they return more traumatised than when they came to Ireland.  There are no transparent, objective and published guidelines on which asylum decisions are made, including application criteria and grounds for refusal.  In 2012 the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner invited AkiDwA to make a submission on domestic gender guidelines; however, we are yet to see the final draft and the guidelines being made public.</p><p> The fiifth issue is that that there is a need for the provision of training and support for all those working with vulnerable groups such as women who have experienced gender specific harm to ensure culturally competent health responses.</p><p> Support is needed for organisatiodns working with migrant women.  While AkiDwA is the only migrant-led organisation working on the issue of female genital mutilation or supporting migrant women, particularly from war torn countries, we depend on a half-time member of staff to provide support for survivors and raise awareness country-wide.  This is a clear indication of how under-resourced is this important work.</p><p> There is a need for interdepartmental co-ordination and commitment from all Departments and units involved.  This is crucial if Ireland is to achieve its commitment to Resolution 1325 and hence uphold human rights for all.  I call on the committee to include the Department of Education and Skills because it is important to have it on board.</p></speech>

We have received a good overview of the work being done on the monitoring plan for Resolution 1325.</p><p>  I have a specific question for Ms Mbugua to whom I should say "Thank you" for the mention in connection with the Female Genital Mutilation Bill 2010.  In fact, I have two questions, the first of which is on awareness-raising of what is now the Criminal Justice (Female Genital Mutilation) Act 2012.  I attended the opening of the Irish Family Planning Association's one-stop clinic which it is running with the HSE for women who have experienced female genital mutilation and it is a positive step forward.  What specifically should be done to raise awareness among women who may have been victims of female genital mutilation and to ensure there will be greater awareness of the legislation to criminalise it?</p><p>  My second question is to Commandant Jayne Lawlor whom I thank for the excellent presentation on the impressive work being done in the Defence Forces.  I am conscious that, traditionally, there have been low numbers of women recruited to the Defence Forces, as she stated.  As a result, is it too soon to see an increase in the numbers of women coming forward?  What proportion of new recruits are women?</p></speech>

As she will be aware, when we developed the first national action plan on female genital mutilation, no Department took ownership of it and it has been difficult to move matters forward.  I named the Department of Education and Skills because its help is needed in moving forward.  What is needed to raise awareness further is resources.  As I stated, AkiDwA is the only group or organisation trying to reach the health care professionals and those who have either experienced female genital mutilation or supported them.  We definitely need resources.  We have trained more community ambassadors from the affected communities to reach out to a large number of people around the country.  We have asked the Department of Health and the HSE, with which we are working, to help us to come up with a second national action plan in order that the HSE can help us in monitoring what is happening in dealing with the issue of female genital mutilation.  In Ireland there are 3,780 women who have endured female genital mutilation and definitely need support.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.458" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Commandant Jayne Lawlor" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014061800006#E00700"><p>Approximately 560 out of 9,500.  There are two main reasons - recruitment and retention.  In terms of recruitment, we started this year.  Because of the moratorium in the public service there was no recruitment, either of males or females.  What happened was that the school visits ceased, while the Defence Forces presence at the career option events came to an end because there was no recruitment.  We need to get out and raise awareness and we started this year by contacting schools.  I wrote to every school in the country that had more than 200 female pupils and asked if we could visit them.  That is something we need to continue.  Other measures at which we could look would include visiting sports clubs to try to get girls who are interested in sport.  Obviously, there is a suitability aspect and they should be physically capable of doing the job.</p><p>  Retention has always been an issue.  We are examining a number of family-friendly policies.  One of the main factors for us - it is specific to the Defence Forces - is that many of our courses tend to be long residential courses.  I have four children at home and it is difficult to go and spend nine months at the Curragh.  We are looking at modularising these courses in order that one can take them over two years.</p><p>  The second main factor is serving overseas.  If one has a young family, it is difficult to go away and leave one's children for six or nine months.  We are looking at job-sharing overseas in order that will one spend, perhaps, three or four months overseas at a time instead of six.  We are trying to look at different ways of doing things and different initiatives in this regard.</p></speech>

Is that the best place to have families that have endured the type of experience about which we are talking in terms of domestic violence and sexual violence?  What is the Department's view on that?  Is there an intention to cease the practice of direct-provision centres?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.461" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/978" speakername="David Stanton" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014061800007#F00200"><p>We will deal with that question first and I will come back to the Deputy for the second one.  I call Mr. Heylin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.462" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Greg Heylin" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014061800007#F00300"><p>I thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn for that question.  I am afraid what I have to say as a civil servant is that it is Government policy to continue with the direct provision through the Reception and Integration Agency.  Until Government policy is changed, the Department will continue to provide the best care it can within the Reception and Integration Agency.  I cannot say anything further than that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.463" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014061800007#F00400"><p>I appreciate Mr. Heylin cannot challenge Government policy on this.  In terms of the Department's responsibility to this plan, if we are to implement the objectives of this plan, the direct-provision centre environment is not appropriate to support women and children adequately.  It strikes me that we are not really serious about this plan if we insist on having women and children live in those environments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Greg Heylin" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014061800007#F00500"><p>I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from in that regard.  I reiterate that it is Government policy and within that Government policy the Reception and Integration Agency is doing the very best it can, for instance in the introduction of the new protocol on sexual and gender-based violence within the centres.  That is not just going to deal with incidents in the centres, but it will raise awareness of the residents to the services provided by rape-crisis centres and domestic violence services.  We have evidence that people are using those facilities or using rape-crisis centres from the statistics that Rape Crisis Network Ireland gathers.  The awareness of those services will be increased within the RIA centres through the new protocol and the staff will be trained and tuned in to the whole issue of gender-based violence within the centres.  Once people are listening for gender-based violence, they will hear it much more broadly and will not just be hearing of incidents that might happen in the centres.  They will begin to create an environment where people will be able to come forward and say, "I was raped in a war situation and I need some service and assistance."</p></speech>

However, as I outlined in my presentation, it has been eight years for some people.  Even if they are experiencing domestic violence within the direct-provision centre, they cannot leave because where do they go to from there?  When one talks about even refugees and people who can take them, they are entitled to accommodate people because they are taking public funds, as asylum-seekers sending them out of the direct provision centres.  The problem is the length of time and the conditions within those centres.  While we appreciate it is a Government policy, it is a Government policy that has failed in some ways and needs to be looked into.</p><p>  We had asked for a women-only centre.  One can naturally imagine even trafficked women are also put into these direct-provision centres.  They are not secure there and their needs are not very well met when they are in the direct-provision system.</p></speech>

We certainly will continue with that.  The Reception and Integration Agency and the centres will be part of that work.  We hope to have a report ready to go to Government on that in early autumn, which will feed into what Deputy Mac Lochlainn said about changing policy.</p></speech>

In 2001 research carried out by Dr. Tom Cloonan, who was then a serving member of the Defence Forces, found an alarming level of sexual harassment of female soldiers, right up to reports of allegations of attempted rape.  At that time there was clearly a serious problem.  He has written a book, Whistleblower, Soldier, Spy, which outlines his experiences, having revealed this through his own research.  He was treated appallingly, according to his account, by his former colleagues.  There was a culture of resisting the change that was necessary in creating an environment that was safe for the women there.</p><p>  Since then I understand there have been very significant changes in the environment in terms of the equality structures that are in place around that.  It is not unique to our Defence Forces.  As we know, unfortunately, in the military across the world it is a real problem.  In the United States 15% of women veterans who served in Iraq and Afghanistan were victims of sexual violence, which indicated a massive problem in military organisations in terms of sexual harassment and violence against women.  It is also against men, but predominantly against women.</p><p>  I want to get a sense from the representatives of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces of what has changed since the revelations from Dr. Cloonan?  What message can we send out to women that they are absolutely safe within our Defence Forces and that when they report complaints they will be vigorously investigated?</p><p>  There has been criticism in Britain that the allegations of sexual harassment or violence are being investigated within the internal investigatory structures within the British military.  Is that the case in Ireland and if so are there any plans to change it?</p></speech>

Following the revelations in 2001, the Defence Forces instigated at the time what was called the independent monitoring group review.  We were the first public sector body to bring in an independent outside group into the Defence Forces to examine all our policies, plans and training.  They visited institutions and took a real root-and-branch look at the Defence Forces.  It was chaired by a renowned academic, Dr. Eileen Doyle.  Once the report on that was published there were a number of recommendations and we have implemented all those recommendations.</p><p>  The IMG was then invited in a second time five years later to see if we had implemented the recommendations made and the findings were generally very positive at that stage that we had made changes.  There is currently a third iteration of the IMG, whose report is due shortly.</p><p>  What have we done on the ground to change it?  We have what is called our administrative instruction A7.  It is a very robust, anti-bullying and harassment policy.  We have a number of different measures in place.  We have what are called DCPs, designated contact personnel.  We have those at the lowest levels.  We are talking about trying to look at conflict resolution at the lowest level.  We have qualified mediators; so we now have mediation services within the Defence Forces, as well as the official formal and informal complaints procedure.  We have a very robust system in place.  That is what we have done.</p><p>  In addition everyone who comes into the Defence Forces is fully briefed on that.  There is no point in having a robust system if people do not know about it and how to approach it.  That is part of what we do.  We have an induction handbook and lectures, and everyone is aware of the anti-bullying and harassment procedures and policies.  There is zero tolerance.  Dignity in the workplace charters are evident everywhere we work.</p><p>  Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question about the US Army, I agree there are alarming statistics.  Having worked with the Americans in Afghanistan very recently, I found that much of it comes down to the fact that the American women do not have equality; they are not allowed to be front-line soldiers.  Therefore they are seen in many respects by the American male soldiers as not being equals.  It is very important, therefore, that we retain that equal status, as many Western nations do.  However, many militaries do not.  It is something to which we should hold onto tight.</p><p>  The Deputy's final question was about the British system.  Allegations are dealt with internally through our complaints procedure, formal and informal.  We also have the Office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which is obviously an external agency.  However, courts martial have taken place for inappropriate sexual behaviour.  It is not something we try to sweep under the carpet.  It is something that exists.  They are out in the open - the courts martial are public.  People have been brought to justice over any possible allegations.</p></speech>

Mr. Heylin referred to promoting awareness of and reasonable access to services.  When the chair presented her report, however, Mr. Heylin indicated that we need more progress in the provision of some services for women, particular in the context of direct provision.  This follows on from Deputy MacLochlainn's question.  Ms Mbugua also spoke about the need for additional services and I would agree that direct provision is an appropriate context.</p></speech>

Given the fact that we do have direct provision, do we need extra services in addition to what is already provided in order to implement the plan effectively?  As I read it, the Department of Justice and Equality is saying that its responsibility is to promote awareness of and reasonable access to services, as distinct from additional or more appropriate services.</p><p>  Women who come from conflict zones may have been traumatised and violated.  If their applications to reside here are unsuccessful and they have to return to those war zones, are there any guidelines governing that process?  Is the fact that they are returning to where they were violated, incompatible with the implementation of the national action plan?</p></speech>

I wish to commend all the parties concerned for this interesting discussion.  I agree with the comments of Deputy MacLochlainn and Senator Zappone on direct provision.  I contend that in years to come this State will be compensating some of the people who have been locked up in direct provision.  The way in which those in direct provision are treated will be a negative reflection on us as a society today.</p></speech>

I commend Commandant Lawlor's presentation, which was both powerful and welcome.  She spoke about job-sharing options for those with children who are going abroad.  Have the Defence Forces ever considered allowing families, including children, to relocate with serving members who have to go abroad?  If that option were available it would be family friendly.</p></speech>

They are provided through the voluntary sector.  The main State funder is the Child and Family Agency, while it was previously done by the HSE.  Rape counselling is available through those specialised services.  They have been operational for a long time so they have much experience in that area.</p><p>  The Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, protocol is that if someone has an experience of rape they need to report it to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that will be done, but support services will be made available through existing services.  The RIA policy and guidelines were developed at the instigation of Akidwa but also of Ruhama and the domestic violence advocacy service in Sligo who were actual providers of services.  Those are the ones that pressed RIA to have that service.  That is the main way in which support is provided to people who have experienced rape in Ireland or, more particularly in the context of this committee, in war zones.</p><p>  As regards those coming here from war zones, that is a matter for immigration policy.  One of the main policies of the asylum seeking system is that one does not send someone back to a situation where they will be in danger.  I am not an expert in that area and have not been fully briefed in it, but that is the fundamental principle.</p></speech>

The Department also has roles under the national action plan or NAP including, for example, on Northern Ireland co-operation and the overseas development aid programme.  I am wearing a different hat today, however.  The conflict resolution unit is also the secretariat to the monitoring group.  We are leading the drafting of the second national action plan.</p><p>  I wish to pick up on Senator Zappone's point about the difference between providing services and having access to them.  Best practice so far has been to consider the NAP as a living document.  Therefore, if there are actions in it that are phrased in a way that is impossible to implement, they should be revised.  We have revised some of the actions as a result of the mid-term progress report.  </p><p>  Ms Mbugua mentioned interdepartmental co-operation.  In that context, another suggestion in that report was to bring in other statutory actors that had not been involved in drafting the first NAP.  We are about to start the process of the second national action plan and a representative of the HSE's social inclusion unit will be sitting on the consultative group for that plan.  That unit works in a lot of the areas that were raised in the discussion.  We hope that aspect will be better drafted and reflected in the second national action plan.</p></speech>

It is important to mainstream services, as Mr. Heylin said, so they can deal with people who have come from war-torn countries or have experienced gender-based violence.  It is equally important that the services are competent and understand the culture of immigrants and what they have gone through.</p><p>  Akidwa has been calling for services in Ireland to be culturally appropriate and competent.  People have to understand the cultures involved.  Ireland is new to immigration issues so such services should be mainstreamed, rather than having specific services for different groups.  One Department alone should not be left with so much to carry.</p><p>  The role of the Department of Education and Skills is important, especially concerning female genital mutilation, FGM.  To this end, we have been trying to access schools.  For example, if a child has been taken out of this country for female genital mutilation to be carried out, when they come back to school and report it to the teacher that teacher may not understand because he or she has never heard about FGM.  The same applies if a child is raped when visiting a war-torn country.</p><p>  It is important to bring everybody together in order ultimately to achieve our goal.  All the relevant services need to equip themselves and become competent in that regard.</p></speech>

Ms Mbugua referred to people working together, which is the essence of UN Security Council Resolution 1325.  We are referring here to Government Departments and, hopefully, the Department of Education and Skills may be part of the next plan.  In addition, civil society organisations should be involved.  We are all learning because it is a relatively new phenomenon for us, but an essential one.</p> <p>What has happened today is one of the indications that we can take a certain pride in the fact that Ireland has led the way in regard to preparing a national action plan which is both outwards and inwards looking.  We have included civil society organisations and are setting up a consultative group now, the chairman of which is with us.  We are taking the idea of people working together very seriously.</p><p> It is worth mentioning a point which is of some concern to me, which is that our national plan can only have very limited impact in Northern Ireland.  The UK national action plan, however, does not recognise Northern Ireland as an area where there was conflict.  It is something we must maintain an awareness of in the future national plan.</p><p> With regard to the specific area of women coming here, there is work to be done.  We all recognise that.  There has been an honesty here about what needs to be done in regard to the future.  I am very hopeful.</p><p> It is a great idea to invite the people who prepare the next national action plan to come back if at all possible because it is an ongoing process.  We very much appreciate the committee's time.</p></speech>

I am from Carnaross, Kells, County Meath, where I live with my wife and our three children.  I went to school in Kells Community School and then to Dublin City University where I graduated with an honours degree in accounting and finance in 1995.  I qualified as a chartered accountant in 1998 and spent several years in KPMG before joining Kingspan Group PLC in 2003.  In 2005, I joined Russell Brennan Keane Chartered Accountants and worked there as a partner for seven years, before leaving in 2013 to establish my own practice in Kells, County Meath.  My wife is chartered accountant and we met while we were in KPMG.  She also works in the practice with me.</p><p>  This is an historic moment in the history of the charity and voluntary sector.  We have a significant weight on our shoulders and a significant amount of responsibilities.  I look forward to embracing all of these challenges and responsibilities with passion, hard work, integrity and honesty.  The functions of the Charities Regulatory Authority are clearly defined in the Charities Act 2009.</p> <p>The role of the authority is enshrined in law.  </p><p> In conjunction with these functions, there is an immediate need to restore confidence, transparency and assurance to the charity and voluntary sector in Ireland.  There is also a need to build a framework for registration, regulation, reporting and compliance.  This must be done in a proportionate and balanced manner.  We need to work hard on framing this strategy and developing the framework for the delivery of this strategy in the coming years.</p><p> Perhaps one of the most important immediate objectives for the board will be to develop the short to medium-term strategy of the authority and to ensure it is rolled out.  As the committee is aware and as defined in the Act, the charities regulator will be officially appointed on establishment day.   I am delighted to learn that the establishment date is now set at 16 October 2014.  This day will crystalise the formal appointment of the charities regulator, the authority and the CEO.  This will also crystalise the dissolution of the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations &amp;amp; Bequests in Ireland, which will be integrated into the authority.</p><p> There are 16 board members of the Charities Regulatory Authority, including the chairman.  The board shall adopt and maintain the highest of standards in how we operate, how it is governed and how it works together as a unit.  The board shall implement and adopt best practice corporate governance.  In accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, the board shall establish committees to ensure that it is always informed, that the work of the authority is focused on key areas and that the authority works in a structured and strategic manner.  To conclude my opening foreword, I wish to say that I am excited about the work of the Charities Regulatory Authority and the work that I look forward to carrying out as chairman of the authority.</p></speech>

I am delighted to see that he has put in writing that he is excited about the work of the Charities Regulatory Authority.  I have a few questions and will address one of Mr. Woods's last points first.  It relates to the establishment of subcommittees in key areas.  Can he comment on how he envisages these subcommittees being structured and composed and the key areas he intends to prioritise within the authority?</p></speech>

That is<i>in situ </i>at the moment.  The subcommittees have yet to be formed because the board has only met once.  We have two meetings scheduled inside the next five weeks.  The composition and membership of those subcommittees will be decided upon at those two meetings.  The composition will centre around the strength of the individuals' expertise at board level.  For example, the composition of the finance subcommittee may consist of members of the board who have expertise and skills in that area.  In respect of the governance subcommittee, there are a number of board members who have expertise in areas of governance.  The composition of the board subcommittees will consist of members of the board with skillsets in those specific areas.<br />In terms of which subcommittees we will form, these have yet to be ratified and approved by the board but it is likely that there will be subcommittees around areas like finance and governance and perhaps the integration of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations &amp;amp; Bequests in Ireland into the authority as some work will be required to ensure this smooth transition into the authority.  We envisage that our subcommittees will, hopefully, be formed by the end of July and they will consist of people from the board who have strengths in those specific areas.</p></speech>

Resources are always a challenge.  We are a new authority with a very clear conviction as to where we want to go as an authority and board.  As chairman of this authority, I will lead that out to the execution of the full delivery of the Charities Act.  However, we are in an era where resources are tight.  We have limited resources and we will work with the Minister and the Department to ensure we have the resources at our disposal to allow us as an authority to implement the full strands of the Act.  We are acutely aware that resources will be a pressure point but we just have to work with that and with the Minister in the coming months to ensure we have what we need.  That will obviously be a challenge but we must work on dealing with that.</p></speech>

An issue of concern is the number of un-incorporated charities.  Others have been established as companies and would be subject to the rules as set down by the Director of Corporate Enforcement but other charities have been established as trusts.  Can Mr. Woods comment on the obstacles he foresees when consolidating the many forms of charities under the authority's regulations because there are so many of them with different names or labels?</p></speech>

The Deputy made a very important point in the context of the cocktail of different types of entities that exist for charities.  I do not see that as being a challenge because a charity is a charity is a charity.  If it is a charity, it will be governed by the Charities Act irrespective of what legal form it takes.  There may be nuances around initial reporting because some charities will report into the Companies Registration Office and others will not because they are not companies.  We will be working with the different arms of the State such as the Companies Registration Office and the Revenue Commissioners in ensuring that reporting is streamlined over time so that regardless of the legal form a charity takes, it is under the auspices of the Charities Regulatory Authority and must abide by the regulations stipulated in the Charities Act.  The Act is flexible and allows organisations to take different legal forms.  Certain jurisdictions have gone down a route whereby if an organisation wants to become a charity, it must become a specific type of legal entity.  That is one option that could be explored but it could be years away because there are many hoops to jump between now and then.  Certainly, the fact that charities take different legal forms has thrown up challenges in the past because they have different responsibilities in terms of reporting and different obligations as trustees or directors.  Directors have fiduciary duties in accordance with the Companies Act whereas trustees do not fall under its remit.  Thankfully, we now have an Act that governs all charities.</p></speech>

The Charities Act does allow for charities to be charged a fee which may be determined by the Minister and will be set by the authority.  Those costs will be charged to go towards the cost of establishing and maintaining the register.</p> <p>It would be premature at this stage to indicate the level at which the fees will be set because the board has to go through its own process in conjunction with the chief executive designate and her team.  Some form of fee will be coming down the track, however, and we will be consulting the Minister to work out the details of the fees in a collaborative manner.</p></speech>

On our establishment day we will have a complement of 11 staff, of whom seven will come from the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  In considering what we want to achieve and the number of organisations and charities that we will be regulating, we can examine the structures in other countries, such as structures for compliance, monitoring, enforcement and regulation, with a view to emulating best international practice and standards.  The charity sector is quite a large sector, with overall income of &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion.  It is estimated to produce 3.5% of our GDP.  We have to put proper resources in place if we are to deal with the sector.  The board will have to evaluate our budgets and costings but we will certainly have to develop the office of the chief executive and her team if we are to execute the strategy.  We could ultimately require between 20 and 30 staff if we are to deliver on what the Act requires from us.  The board has only recently been formed, however, and these issues will be ironed out when we sign off on the strategy.  We have a good feeling for the different arms of the organisational structure we require, and our requirements will certainly not be achieved with current staff numbers.</p></speech>

We are building this register for the first time but the Revenue Commissioners have a record of all charities with tax exempt status.  That is the best yardstick at present.  With the register, which is a key element of the Act, we are building a proper record of charities for the first time in this country so that information is available to us, as regulators, and to the public on the standing of charities and details about their trustees, their premises and their activities.  It will give clarity to the public, which is a key issue for us, on the identity of registered charities.</p></speech>

I am the director of the Irish Institute of Naturopathic Medicine.  I served on the executive committee of the initial UK cranial osteopathic association.  I have initiated and led the development of a major regime in the treatment and management of violence in UK and Irish prisons under court order.  I served on the internal task force on the prevention of suicide in high security UK prisons.</p> <p>The research and the programme initiated and developed treatment of violence in the prisons, communities and prevention of suicide was undertaken by Kings College Hospital Centre for Crime and Justice Studies UK in 1998 and was commissioned by the then director of operations, Professor Alan Walker.  The Irish Institute of Naturopathic Medicine was the overall institute of complementary and natural medicine UK award winner in 2009.  I have been involved in suicide prevention paediatric conduct disorders programme for young offenders, autism and special needs, and I have provided conflict mediation in the treatment and management of violence in deprived, disadvantaged communities with a high suicide rate in Ireland.</p><p> Our research was presented at an EU seminar in Brussels in 2013.  In December 2013, I was invited to meet the EU health commissioner, Jurgen Scheftlein, in Luxembourg to discuss the treatment regime as it was receiving global attention.  The Irish institute is in collaboration on EU pilot projects research and medical training with the National University, California, which has invited us to work on research with it, in amelioration of depression, offender behaviour, post-traumatic birth injuries, suicide prevention and post-traumatic neurological disorders with war veterans.  That is the university's speciality.  In June I will speak with the British College of Osteopathic Medicine, of which I am a member, about the pioneers of cranial osteopathy in the UK conference.</p><p> I an here to discuss an important matter of keeping people alive and preventing suicide in prisons through the provision of an integrated medical health regime pilot project in the Irish prison system.  Mental health and suicide prevention is an important issue highlighted by the Global Alliance for Chronic Disease and the European Commission and represents a real cost to the national health service and the Department of Justice and Equality.  In a recent meeting in Munich hosted by the International College of Neuropharmacology the need for future funding in this area in Ireland was highlighted.</p><p> As I said, I met the EU Commissioner, Jurgen Scheftlein EU Commission in Luxembourg in December and we discussed steps for inclusion in Horizon 2020 for EU projects stemming initially from Ireland.  There is global interest in the treatment developed by the Irish Institute of Naturopathic Medicine.  In the discussion there was an option for integration for the prevention of self-harm and suicidal ideation.</p><p> The economic benefits include reduction in cost of treatment, hospitalisation, violence and suicide among young offenders including male and female prisoners.  The Irish Institute of Naturopathic Medicine aims to build on the research and evaluation of the regime which I developed, which was undertaken in the UK by the Centre of Crime and Justice Studies, King's College Hospital.  Suicide is an added dimension to death in the family of a prisoner.  The person's family loses him or her in a violent death separated in fear by circumstances they do not understand.  The loss affects the family from generation to generation, forever feeding a need for failure and the cycle of wasteful tragedy.  One suicide within prison is too many and is everyone&rsquo;s trauma.  What is being done to prevent it?</p><p> A serious observation and constructive approach to self-inflicted harm and death through suicide, taking into account survivors' opinions, is necessary.  As a community, we need to understand the pain held by the person who is lost to failure and doubt about his or her ability and purpose in living.  We do not want our lives decentralised by a gaping wound from the past.  It is costing us more than billions of euros to manage the symptoms of the problem.  Depression, self-harm and attempted suicide are the most frequently reported symptoms of patients with histories of trauma, violation and childhood deprivation.  Clinical studies will be reviewed that show a significant reduction of attempted suicide in individuals who have undertaken the programme.  I have made some of this information available.</p><p> The object of the pilot project within the Irish prison system is the preservation and protection prisoners' health, well being and quality of life.  It also supports their co-dependents, others working within or relating to a prison environment and those affected by crime.  The provision of professional, comprehensive, medical treatments, including a wide range of natural therapeutic practices, requires the application of a specific treatment programme; the provision of training and education to individuals about the treatments; and the promotion and carrying out of research, evaluation and clinical trials and the dissemination of their results.</p><p> The pilot project, for which we are asking the committee's recommendation, has collaboration with significant academic researchers and professors including Dr. Harald Gaier, of the Steinbeis-Transfer-Institut, Berlin, who is a homeopath, naturopath, acupuncturist, medical herbalist and teacher trainer for the university.  Professor Jack Hamlin, National University, La Jolla, California has issued an agreement for research to the Irish institute, which awaits our signature.  Professor Hamlin holds a degree in sociology and psychology from San Diego State University, a masters in forensic sciences from National University La Jolla and a juris doctorate from the University of San Diego, school of law.  As an associate professor and lead faculty members for the alternative dispute resolution programme at National University, he has lectured internationally regarding conflict transformation theory and practice.  For the past five years, he has been a mediator and trainer for the San Diego restorative justice mediation programme.</p><p> We request that the Joint Committee for Justice, Defence and Equality consider a recommendation to implement an integrated medical health regime in the treatment of suicide prevention and violence pilot project within the Irish prison regime.  I am happy to answers any questions.</p></speech>

There would be a pre-admission of ten to 30.  In the UK, we expanded it to 19 prisons.  The recommendation was that it be made available throughout the prison system.  In Ireland, we could have a programme for women prisoners, young offenders and male prisoners.</p> <p>We included mandatory drug testing as part of the programme.  The prisoners were in a full-time programme Monday to Friday and there were activities for them at the weekend.  In the United Kingdom requests started to come from all over the system to be transferred to the prison.  Eventually one prison became a recovery prison and the prisoners were offered an opportunity to participate in a programme which, if they completed successfully, helped their parole or ongoing sentence management.  It was an option as part of their sentence management.</p></speech>

One prisoner with whom we worked in the Irish prisons under a court order was referred to me by his doctor.  He had had 150 pervious charges.  His father had been murdered and he came to us under a court order in 2006.  He had had a history of drug and alcohol misuse and violent crime and, therefore, was a serious problem for the community.  We were given a court order because there was nothing for him.  He was out of control following the murder of his father.  We agreed to undergo a pilot project for him in the prison and the judge said he would look at sentencing.  We saw him for three months in the prison where I had a team.  It was difficult work because it was a team of ten dealing with one prisoner.  He has been involved in no further violent crime since.  He is a deprived member of the community and has not completed his programme.  We were there for three months and he was then released into our care and there were no issues or incidents with him.  He was released back into care in Wicklow on condition that if there was a further incident, he would be looking at three years imprisonment, but there was not and, therefore, he was not imprisoned.  However, this is not something we have the resources to facilitate.  I have sent on some of the doctor's information on this young man.</p></speech>

In the United Kingdom they initiated it with life sentence prisoners.  I spent two years working with them in Wormwood Scrubs and some of them had given up the will to live.  My initial training was with the prison staff looking at suicide prevention measures for prisoners who had given up, as they had nothing to look forward to.  As the system was tougher than the regime here, some of them had given up and did not want to live.  The prison service was looking at a suicide prevention option for them and it developed from there.  In the Irish regime it would be a matter of negotiation as to where was the greatest need.  It needs to be available to whomever needs it most, but we would discuss the pilot project with the prison service.</p><p>   I was contacted last week by a father who had a son out of control and I told him to call the Garda.  For some of them, the first step in the recovery option is when they are incarcerated.  They need that regime to start with.  This young man could not be handled in the community.  That is why it works so well in the prisons in the United Kingdom.  The prison staff came on board and asked to us to see different prisoners.  The programme then spread throughout the system.  Prisoners were given an option and it was phenomenal in Coldingley prison.  The governor was receiving requests for prisoners to be transferred there to be permitted to undertake the programme.  Our team comprises osteopaths, acupuncturists and so on.  For many prisoners, drugs are not the answer to the problems of drug addiction.  We were the start of an option that was completely drug free.</p></speech>

Cranial osteopathy involves working on the flow of fluid through the brain and the spine and the aim is to improve the function of the mechanism.  Many of the prisoners have histories of deprivation culturally, mentally and emotionally and birth injuries.  Osteopathy represents one the main functions.  We work with a doctor if a prisoner is on medication and co-consult.  That is how we work.  We have about 100 medical referrals.  We only see people who are referred; that is how we work in the prisons.  We have an interdisciplinary meeting with the doctors who ask if we can take someone on and if there are worries, we get in touch with them.  However, under the programme, a person would receive osteopathy and acupuncture services and we look at diet and nutrition, whether he is eating or sleeping and the underlying causes of stress.  This ties in with the research with a national university that many of them suffer from undetected and untreated post-traumatic stress based on family histories.  On top of it, they drink and take illegal drugs.  We work with them to get them working without the need for drugs and alcohol and a side effect of our treatment is that they stop using.  The intention is to keep them alive and get them to start working on straightening out their lives.  The main aim for them is to get their family back, to sort out their lives, to become focused on work and to be free of the need to use at any level.</p></speech>

I ask members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or left in safe or flight mode as they interfere with the broadcasting system, even in silent mode.<br />I welcome Dr. Edward Horgan, Ms Margaretta D'Arcy and Mr. John Lannon and thank them for forwarding to the committee a copy of their presentation which has been circulated to members.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. <br />Before inviting Dr. Horgan to make his opening remarks, I draw attention to the fact that today the Seanad Public Consultation Committee published a report entitled, Report on Ireland's Compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with Observations and Recommendations to the United Nations Human Rights Committee and to the Irish Government.  Of particular interest are the following comments made on page 6 on extraordinary rendition:<blockquote>The Committee takes note of continued calls for the establishment of an independent, effective and comprehensive investigation concerning the use of the State party&rsquo;s territory for the purposes of extraordinary rendition.  The SPCC further recognises the outstanding need for an oversight mechanism to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s territory may not be used for any such purpose in the future.  Specifically, the Committee notes the potential for a Parliamentary Committee to undertake this role in the future. <br />The Committee strongly recommends that the Human Rights Committee pursue this issue with Government in its upcoming review and suggest specific measures that should be taken to ensure effective oversight of the use of the State&rsquo;s territory and airspace in order to ensure compliance with Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the ICCPR. </blockquote>The delegates may want to obtain a copy of the report.  I am sure members are already aware of it.  I invite Dr. Horgan to make his opening statement on behalf of Shannonwatch.</p></speech>

As legislators, members play a vital role in ensuring public service oversight and accountability.  While, in so far as we know, nobody has been killed or tortured at Shannon Airport, hundreds of thousands have been killed and tortured in middle eastern wars.  Successive Irish Governments have been complicit in these crimes.  An Iraqi child killed in a US air attack or an Afghan resistance fighter tortured at Bagram airfield are just as important as an Irish child or soldier.  The thousands of Afghan and Iraqi dead children are just as important as the 796 children buried in Tuam.  At the apparent behest of the Government, garda&iacute; at Shannon have consistently refused to investigate these issues.</p><p>  We are a group of peace activists trying to ensure compliance with Irish and international laws.  I am a former Army officer and a former United Nations military peacekeeper.  I lecture part time in politics and international relations at the University of Limerick.  As a civilian, I have been promoting democracy and the rule of law in post-conflict countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, the Balkans and the former Soviet Union.  I am accompanied by Ms Margaretta D'Arcy who is a committed peace activist and a member of Aosd&aacute;na.  She is a founding member of the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp set up in the 1970s to protest against cruise missiles which members may be aware were armed at the time with nuclear warheads.</p> <p>The cruise missiles at the time were armed with nuclear warheads.  In the meantime, the nuclear warheads had been replaced by what are called sub-nuclear warheads.  Coincidentally, we are now aware that in June 1999 two airplane loads of these cruise missiles passed through Ireland, probably through Shannon Airport.  At the time, cruise missiles were being used to bomb the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade and the television station.<br />Dr. Margaretta D'Arcy is a writer and dramatist and she uses dramatic actions to expose what is happening at Shannon Airport.  Dr. John Lannon is a human rights activist of long standing with Amnesty International and other non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  He is a full-time lecturer at the Kemmy Business School at the University of Limerick, is a founding member of Shannonwatch and has produced the booklet on the legal aspects of what is happening at Shannon Airport.<br />Today we wish to present to the committee what is happening at Shannon Airport and the significance of these events, in the expectation that the committee will take appropriate actions to investigate and achieve some accountability for what has transpired.  The details of our presentation are contained in our written submission, which has been circulated to the members.  In our verbal submission we will highlight the key issues.  I will focus on neutrality, Ms Margaretta D'Arcy will speak on the failures to inspect or investigate what has been happening at Shannon Airport and on the probability that Ireland has facilitated operations by US special forces, including the US drone programme, and Dr. John Lannon will explain the scale and scope of the US torture rendition programme and the extent to which successive Irish Governments have been directly complicit in this programme, in contravention of the UN Convention against torture and the Irish Criminal Justice (UN Convention Against Torture) Act 2000.  He will also sum up our presentation and outline what recommendations we would like the committee to undertake.<br />Neutrality is not just a piece of legal terminology.  For small states such as Ireland it is an important concept of international law that enables us to avoid being dragged into unjustified wars and also to promote genuine, altruistic foreign policies that promote international peace.  The broadest definition of neutrality comes from international law experts Oppenheim-Lauterpacht, who state that any state that is not a belligerent in a war is considered to be a neutral state and is therefore bound by international laws and rules of neutrality.  Some states declare themselves to be neutral states either by writing it into their constitutions or having neutrality as their declared policy.  The US was a neutral state for the initial stages of both the First World War and the Second World War.  Switzerland, Austria and Finland have neutrality written into their constitutions and Sweden, Malta and Ireland have neutrality as their declared national policy.  All Irish Governments have pursued a policy of neutrality since 1939 and this has been strongly supported by the Irish people, as was demonstrated in 2013 in a Peace and Neutrality Alliance-commissioned Red C poll which found that 78% of the Irish people believed that Ireland should have a policy of neutrality.<br />There are several misconceptions about the rules of neutrality.  Ireland sending weather forecasts to England during World War II was not in fact a breach of Irish neutrality.  However, one of the most basic rules, from Ireland's point of view, is Article 2 of the Hague Convention V on neutrality, which states: &quot;Belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of either munitions of war or supplies across the territory of a neutral Power&quot;.  Therefore, a country such as the United States, at war in Afghanistan and Iraq, is not supposed to move troops through Ireland.  A clear example of the failure of Irish legislators to curtail abuse of authority by the Irish Government occurred on 20 March 2003, when D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved a Government motion that, in effect, claimed to state that US military use of Shannon Airport did not amount to &ldquo;participation&rdquo; in the US-led invasion of Iraq.  The motion stated that D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann &quot;endorses the decision of the Government that Ireland will not participate in the coalition's proposed military action against Iraq;&quot; and &quot;recalls the long-standing arrangements for the overflight and landing in Ireland of US military and civilian aircraft; and supports the decision of the Government to maintain those arrangements&quot;.<br />These statements are incompatible and are an attempt to say that black is white and that participation is not participation.  This was clearly identified by Judge Nicholas Kearns in the High Court case Horgan <i>v</i>. Ireland in April 2003, just a month after the D&aacute;il motion, when he ruled that: &quot;The court is prepared to hold therefore that there is an identifiable rule of customary law in relation to the status of neutrality whereunder a neutral state may not permit the movement of large numbers of troops or munitions of one belligerent State through its territory en route to a theatre of war with another&quot;.  I was the Horgan in that case.<br />The members of this Oireachtas committee, in their role as legislators, have a very important role in ensuring that the Irish Government complies with the basic rules of international law.  It is not just a few dozen troops that have passed through Shannon Airport.  A total of 2.5 million armed US troops, huge amounts of munitions and other material have passed through Shannon Airport since 2001.<br />There are very grave matters of human rights involved in Ireland participating in unjustified wars and being complicit in breaches of the UN Convention against torture.  There are also positive things we should be doing in matters of international relations that are being neglected or damaged by our participation and complicity in wars.  Ireland&rsquo;s very beneficial role and its credibility in promoting international peace and justice are being severely damaged.  In the long term, it is important that neutrality should be written into the Irish Constitution.  In the short term, steps should be taken by this committee and D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann to end the Irish Government's abuses of international and Irish laws, and this should entail immediately ending US military use of Shannon Airport.  If there is some legal technicality whereby the Garda cannot search US military aircraft, no US military aircraft should be allowed to land at Irish airports.<br />As we meet today, civil war is spreading across Iraq.  The roots of this civil war were sewn on 20 March 2003 with the US led invasion of Iraq, just as Irish legislators were passing a motion in the D&aacute;il that Irish participation in this Iraq war was not participation.  Dr. John Lannon will explain some problems we have encountered with the Office of the Attorney General with regard to garda&iacute; failing to search and investigate US military aircraft at Shannon Airport.  We have also experienced some difficulty in recent times with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, which has failed to investigate properly virtually all the complaints by peace activists to that office about Garda misbehaviour at Shannon Airport.  In recent weeks, also, we have encountered indications that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions might have been failing in its duty to act independently in matters relating to the prosecution of peace activists at Shannon Airport.  All of these are serious matters that this committee should examine.</p></speech>

I have been a do-gooder all my life.  Being a do-gooder means being out protesting, sometimes with a few people and sometimes with many people.</p><p>  My do-goodering has now exposed the medical cards issue, and I am proud of that.  That was a bloody mess.  Now, due to pressure from people like me and others, it has been decided that the medical cards are a mistake.  What about the Magdalen laundries, infected blood and women whose pelvises were cut open?  As we have gone through what has happened in this country with infected blood, cracked pelvises and medical cards withdrawn, let us now look at Shannon Airport.  Have any of the members seen the movie "Life of Brian"?  Shannon Airport is definitely what is known as a Monty Python scenario.  There are civilian airplanes, military airplanes and the Irish Army.  I always thought the Irish Army was there to protect the Irish people, but in this Monty Python scenario the Irish Army is there to protect the US military, who are there to destroy half the world.</p><p>  We had a very interesting time in Buswells Hotel.  It was a shame the committee members could not come there to listen to Tom Clonan.  I learned something new.  Before the Iraq invasion, there was a conference led by a US military gentleman.  He said the purpose of the Iraq war was breaking and killing people.  Our Army is there to protect the US military, who are there to break and kill people.  Is that not funny?  Is it not just hilarious?</p><p>  There is another matter I find quite interesting.  It involves a new phrase which the members might note and search on Google, "virtual forward airbase".  Have the members heard those words previously?  It is a phrase that Donald Rumsfeld used for Shannon Airport.  Shannon Airport, and indeed our wonderful country, is at the centre of an aggressive illegal war which destroys people.  Do we believe in words?  This is a really good thing for the Monty Python up on the cross.  Ireland affirms its adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination.</p> <p>These are wonderful words but I have two questions for the committee.  Do words mean anything?  If words do not mean anything then what have we got? </p><p> I shall continue to outline the scenario at Shannon.  Believe it or not, we will hold a fun-run on the runway where we have the military and a history of rendition flights going through the airport with torture on their agenda.  The fun-run will be held in aid of the Samaritans.  As Members will know, it is an organisation that tries to prevent young people from killing themselves.  However, we will hold a fun-run in a crime-laden place of murder and assassination.  To help the young people to understand, this is a bit like having a fun-run in Auschwitz.  It is most bizarre to have a fun-run in the middle of one of the bloodiest messes in the Middle East.  Can we really say that our young people will be given the confidence to live by holding a fun-run at Shannon Airport?</p><p> I want members to take my following question very seriously.  Do people of my age have anything to live for when we can see that the Irish State had dishonoured us?  There was a time when I travelled abroad.  I have gone abroad and been to Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.  On my travels I always felt very proud because Ireland was a neutral country and thus not part of the complicity taking place, at the time, in Afghanistan with the presence of the Russians, Americans and Chinese.  I felt good that Ireland was a nice neutral country and believed it might have something to contribute to the world.  However, we are now a blood-ridden country.  If I went to Afghanistan, Iraq or Iran now and said I was Irish they would say to me that I have blood on my hands.  The Government's failure to protect us has led to the possibility of us being accused of being war criminals.  That is the reason I would prefer to blow myself up on the runway with petrol rather than go down in history as being a war criminal.</p></speech>

It has been a logistical fulcrum for the invasion and occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan.  We know the chaos that both of these countries are suffering right now which is a direct consequence of airports like Shannon being used.<br />The other serious issue that I want to draw attention to today is the rendition planes.  We know that the CIA rendition plans have used Shannon Airport.  Shannon has been used to commit torture and we have been used to commit torture and to destroy by allowing Shannon Airport to be used by those planes.  <br />I want to draw the committee's attention to three specific points regarding the planes.  First, I wish to refer to the narrow interpretation of the State's responsibilities when it comes to rendition planes.  There does not need to be a prisoner onboard a plane in order for it to constitute torture.  Let us remember that Ireland is a party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which make it illegal to facilitate torture.  The 2006 report compiled by Mr. Dick Marty for the Council of Europe states:<blockquote>Ireland, could be held responsible for active or passive collusion (in the sense of having tolerated or having been negligent in fulfilling the duty to supervise) ...  for permitting stopovers for flights involving the unlawful transfer of detainees. </blockquote>Second, the Irish Government has relied on diplomatic assurances from the US Administration that prisoners had not, or would not, be taken through Shannon.  We know from experience, and I am not going to go through the catalogue of incidents that shows that the US Administration has lied about what it has been doing around the world.  However, we know that the Irish Human Rights Commission, Amnesty International and the European Parliament have said that diplomatic assurances are not sufficient to comply with Ireland's international human rights obligations.  <br />The third area of concern for us is how the State has responded to complaints about rendition planes, or suspect rendition planes, at Shannon.  We have provided in our report to the committee a redacted list of over 40 complaints relating to requests to search particular aircraft at Shannon which were made to garda&iacute;.  This is not a comprehensive list.  The number of complaints that we have made which have gone unanswered is estimated to be over 100.<br />The Air Navigation and Transport Act gives and has given power to the Garda to search rendition planes.  Activists, like ourselves, have brought the presence of those planes to the attention of the Garda.  On a number of occasions it has referred to either an instruction, policy decision or letter of advice to the effect that the US military and CIA planes at Shannon were not to be searched.  In 2006, and again in 2007, officers have said, and referred to the fact, that the direction had come from the Attorney General.  We have written to the Attorney General on this matter and her office has said that the allegations are completely without foundation. <br />To be clear, we are not making unfounded allegations or accusations, against the former Attorney General, of wrongdoing.  We are simply repeating what the garda&iacute; have said to us and seeking  clarification on the matter.  How did the garda&iacute;, at Shannon, arrive at an understanding that they were not to search US military or rendition planes?  <br />In light of information that we provided in our longer submission that we presented today, I want to briefly highlight five key recommendations to the committee.  First, the State should provide comprehensive information on all complaints that were received by the Garda regarding aircraft suspected of being involved in renditions, or suspected of carrying munitions that were illegal and destined for destruction and for human rights abuses, and also for planes that were basically in violation of international and national laws.  We have had incomplete and selective reporting.  It highlights the Government's failure to protect the rights enshrined in the treaties that it signed up to, such as the convention against torture.  It also suggests that the Garda has failed in its duty to investigate complaints made to it regarding very serious matters of life and death.  <br />I am pleased to note the Chairman's point about the Seanad and the International Covenant on Civil Right and the recommendation to have an investigation and oversight of rendition planes, which is long overdue.  We reiterate our calls to hold an independent impartial inquiry into the use of Shannon in the CIA's illegal rendition programme which should also address the failure to inspect.  We need to learn from what has happened in Shannon over the past ten years.  We must ensure it does not continue and that we are not complicit or continue to be complicit in crimes.  The Government should also review and, if necessary, strengthen procedures governing the inspection of aircraft.  If we do not have enough powers to do so then we must ask that the power to search and inspect aircraft is given to the Garda. <br />It is fundamentally important that no special agreements are made with the US, or other governments, and that precludes the routine ongoing inspection of state military aircraft through Irish airports.  Goodness knows we can recall that when an Irish State aircraft was destined for America the Americans insisted on searching it.  The former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, I believe, had planned to travel on the aircraft.  We need to do the same with planes that we know have been involved in appalling human rights abuses  and war crimes.  <br />We need greater transparency regarding matters that are of fundamental importance to Ireland's foreign policy.  The first step should be full disclosure of all agreements currently in place regarding the US military and the CIA's use of Shannon Airport.<br />As I said, Shannon has become the logistical fulcrum in ongoing wars, invasions and occupations by the United States and NATO.  It has become a route of preference for all US soldiers.  When they go to serve abroad they pass through Shannon Airport.  Therefore, it has become known globally as one of the airbases that is used by American.  That makes it a tempting target for radicalised elements who wish to target American soldiers or state aircraft.<br />I shall return to what Dr. Horgan mentioned about neutrality.</p> <p>The final point we would make is in regard to recommendations.  We need to enshrine Irish neutrality in the Irish Constitution because this is in accordance with the wishes of the vast majority of Irish people.  Those wishes must be recognised and steps must be taken to give effect to them.</p><p> As we were preparing for this meeting, it was reported last week that when the NSA whistleblower, Edward Snowden, made his way to Russia last year, a secret US Government jet, which was previously used for renditions, flew into Europe in an effort to bring him back to the United States.  The committee may be interested to know that this aeroplane, which had a registration N977GA, is still a regular visitor to Shannon Airport.  Why is it at Shannon Airport?  Who is on board?  Is it still involved in kidnapping and torture?  We do not know because the people who have responsibility for finding out will not use their powers to do so?  It means the serious issue of renditions and of involvement in wars are not a thing of the past.  They are both still with us and they need to be dealt with urgently as a matter of very serious public interest.</p></speech>

I commend them on the fantastic work they have done over the years, week in, week out and month in, month out at Shannon Airport.  Trying to raise this issue and bring it to national understanding is a very important petition and one we need to take very seriously.  I take on board the recommendations put before the committee and we have a number of options at which we need to look.  </p><p>  Dr. Horgan mentioned the fact we send our peacekeepers abroad, are very proud of the work they do abroad and are a peacekeeping nation but that we have questions to answer about the way we deal with people on our own territory.  What we have seen at Shannon Airport is an Irish solution to an Irish problem in that successive Governments have done deals, which are not obvious and possibly are not on paper, about how Shannon Airport can be used and they have looked the other way on the rendition flights and the other atrocities happening around the world which have been facilitated by the use of Shannon Airport.</p><p>  Ms D'Arcy raised the fact a civilian airport is being used for both civilian and military aeroplanes and the potential danger that brings is a huge issue.  The witnesses have given us a lot of food for thought in the recommendations and the committee will obviously deliberate on them afterwards but it strikes me there is a number of possible routes we could take.  We could ask the Garda Commissioner to come before the committee and possibly answer a number of the questions the witnesses put to us around any understandings the Garda has on the way the policing of Shannon Airport can be done.</p><p>  The witnesses might tell us a little bit more about GSOC.  They mentioned there was an issue around GSOC not dealing with complaints.  GSOC has been a regular visitor here and it would be interesting for us to invite it to address some of those issues. </p><p>  Other NGOs, such as Amnesty International, have also gathered information and it might be useful for us to hear from them at some stage about the evidence they have gathered over the years to build up the body of information this committee has in any deliberations.</p><p>  From my understanding, the understanding we have with the US authorities on this is a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality and possibly for the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It might be interesting to discuss that with them.  </p><p>  This is definitely an issue which has been bubbling under the surface for many years due to the fact that the witnesses have focused so much attention on it but it has never been addressed in a forthright manner by a committee such as this and I welcome the chance this committee will have to bring in witnesses - I welcome the evidence the witnesses have given us today - to ask and tease out these very important questions, so that we can all be comfortable that Irish neutrality is front and centre and that nothing is happening on our watch that can bring harm to or maim anybody anywhere else in the world.</p></speech>

That is our understanding.  We have been told by a detective superintendent, a superintendent, an inspector and by at least two other members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that there is a letter of advice of some sort from the former Attorney General to the Garda Commissioner advising that garda&iacute; should not inspect or search US military and CIA aircraft.

I have a number of questions but they are not all in a logical order, so forgive me.  The Chairman asked if there was a piece of advice in regard to complaints.  Dr. Horgan said the piece of advice relates to lack of inspection of aeroplanes.  Is the Chairman also correct that there is a separate piece of advice which relates to garda&iacute; not following up complaints or is that the witnesses own observation of garda&iacute; not following up complaints?</p></speech>

It is a separate issue that we have been told by garda&iacute; that the former Attorney General, and possibly the current Attorney General, advised the garda&iacute; either not to inspect the aeroplanes or that they are not legally bound to do so.  Clearly, we have been unable to get a proper response on that.</p></speech>

There is a lack of clarity around this but as Dr. Horgan said, we have been told in many different ways that they are not effectively going to search those aircraft.  To reiterate what Dr. Horgan said, from the number of complaints and the number of requests we have presented to the garda&iacute;, there is clearly no intent to search them.  I have noted that from Ireland's State report for the fourth periodic review of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that there was some very selective reporting in regard to the cases they said had been followed up on.  There was one where it was claimed there were some golfers on an aeroplane after it had been inspected.  There may well have been golfers on that aeroplane on the day it was inspected but it is very surprising that the only thing they find when they search aeroplanes known to be involved in renditions, kidnapping and torture and know to have been at Shannon Airport was one set of golfers.</p></speech>

We always go to the garda&iacute; to ask if they will inspect the aeroplanes and they say "No".  When I ask who has told them not to inspect to the aeroplanes, they do not give an answer.  There is actually a climate of total disdain when we ask these serious questions.  They tell us that if we find something, bring it to them.  We ask if we can look at an aeroplane if we find something.</p> <p>Instead, we had a whole barrier of garda&iacute;, paid overtime to prevent us from going in.  To my mind, this is corrupting garda&iacute; because they should be able to tell us who has told them not to search the planes.  </p></speech>

The US Government is not being charged for those military flights under the Eurocontrol agreement.  In theory, Irish State aircraft that overfly the US or fly into the US do not pay charges and in reciprocation, US aircraft using Irish airports or Irish airspace do not pay charges for same.  We probably have only one or two Irish State aircraft going to the US every year whereas the US has thousands, if not tens of thousands, of planes using Irish airspace annually.</p></speech>

To be clear, effectively what the witnesses have drawn is a conspiracy which involves the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Attorney General, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and GSOC, among others.  It is an enormous conspiracy of silence that the witnesses have painted and I am not saying I do not believe them.

We have asked repeatedly for clarification on the benefit of this, economically or otherwise, to Ireland but have never been told of any benefit accruing.  The only benefits mentioned are vague references to employment and foreign direct investment.  However, as we all know, foreign direct investment decisions made by corporate entities in Ireland are not linked to the use of Shannon Airport by the US military.  We know that Dell computers moved out of Shannon to the detriment of many people, even though the military continued to use the facilities at Shannon.  There is no link between the US corporate presence in Ireland the US military's use of the airport.</p></speech>

The Department's letter states that Ireland has co-operated fully with investigations into the practice of extraordinary rendition carried out by the temporary committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners, the TDIP committee of the European Parliament and the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe,  which are mentioned in the petition to this committee.

The letter made clear that Ireland's reply was one of only 13 responses from 45 submissions which did not require further clarification.  Therefore, the suggestion from the Department is that it's house is effectively in order.  I am asking what the Department is saying there because the witnesses are obviously not in agreement with it on that point.  What did Ireland say in its submission that made the EU committee say, "That's grand, thanks very much.  That's fine".  What I am saying is that the witnesses are drawing the TDIP committee in too and accusing it of not doing its job.  I just want to be clear that this is what the witnesses are actually saying.</p></speech>

Ireland has been selective here because as far as I recall, the report to the ICCPR listed either 11 or seven incidents but we have listed 41 in our report.  What we are saying is that we want to hear about what happened to all 41 incidents.  In fact, we want to know what happened to all of the hundreds of complaints and requests for inspections that we made.  While we would note that the Irish State and the Department engaged with TDIP committee and is being given credit for the fact that it was one of the few states which did so, we would also note that the Human Rights Committee of the UN has said in its third periodic review that the Irish authorities have been deficient.  They are still deficient because they have not addressed the specifics of that committee's recommendations.</p></speech>

It states that the Government received clear and categoric assurances from the US that no transfers of prisoners subject to extraordinary rendition had taken place through Ireland.  Effectively, the witnesses are profoundly disagreeing with that and saying that it is not true.</p></speech>

One is that the assurances may be interpreted as meaning that no prisoners were taken, shackled, through Shannon Airport.  We have said repeatedly and state again today that there does not need to be a prisoner on board the plane in order for it to be complicit in torture, human rights abuse and extraordinary rendition.  We know from reports by the likes of Amnesty International, including Breaking the Chain: Ending Ireland's role in renditions, that there have been at least four - or six according to other researchers - incidents where planes that were directly involved in rendition circuits used the facilities at Shannon Airport.</p> <p>On that basis we refute the diplomatic assurances that Ireland has not been involved in renditions.  I would draw the attention of Senator O'Keeffe and the other members of the committee to the fact that the United States gave similar assurances to the British Government a number of years back but it was subsequently discovered that a prisoner, Diego Garcia, had been taken through British territory they had to roll back on that assurance.  Based on that evidence, there is no reason to believe the diplomatic assurances.</p></speech>

This was partly investigated by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and was not substantiated but I believe the prisoners had been taken to Shannon Airport.  This garda had no reason, that I know of, to make a false allegation and I believe what he told me was true.

I welcome all the witnesses to the committee and I commend them for their tremendous work and commitment over many years.  Ms D'Arcy may be doing this work for the longest time but Dr. John Lannon and Dr. Edward Horgan have gone above and beyond the call of duty in trying to safeguard, as they see it, and I agree with them, our neutrality in the very serious matter of war and military intervention.  They have made enormous sacrifices to do this work.  Very recently Ms D'Arcy was shamefully imprisoned for doing nothing more than wanting to uphold the idea of peace and neutrality.  Let me say "Well done" to all of them.</p><p>  I missed some of the earlier questions, but as I understand it, and perhaps the witnesses can confirm it for me, it is not the case that we want peace or we have a certain idea of neutrality and we do not believe the Government is living up to it, but the arguments the witnesses put forward are based on international law, human rights law and the obligations of the State authorities to investigate human rights abuses and breaches of the law.  Those are very serious issues regardless of people's particular political views on American foreign policy or whatever else it might be.  We have international obligations, as we have signed up to treaties, and to international definitions of neutrality and we are flouting them.</p><p>  Similarly, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for reasons that are not fully explained, does not seem to be responding to complaints about very serious issues in the way it should respond to any complaint that is made to it.  Is that not the heart of the issue?  That is the reason it is relevant to bring the issue to this committee.  The job of this committee is to ensure the State complies with the law in terms of its obligations.  It is a very serious matter that has to be investigated fully to find out if there is political interference.  It seems to me that is what we are talking about.  Is there political interference with the State carrying out its legal obligations to investigate very serious complaints on breaching conventions, treaties and laws that we should comply with.  Would that be a fair summary of what the witnesses are saying?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.623" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Edward Horgan" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014061800008#J00900"><p>Yes, I think it is.  It is important to say that we are not conspiracy theorists as such, but we have a strong impression that there is a sort of conspiracy to silence the likes of us and I have experienced this myself.  I have been charged on four separate occasions with spurious crimes all relating to Shannon Airport, all of which were subsequently dismissed.  In dictatorial countries, we often have what is known as punishment without trial.  In respect of Shannon Airport, in Ireland we have a system of punishment by trial.  The garda&iacute; have brought cases against me and others on several occasions, knowing that there was no proper basis for the case.  The case is processed through the court and I have to go to court time and again as the case is postponed and take time off from what I am doing and hire a solicitor and a barrister at considerable expense, knowing that I will get off eventually.</p><p>  An even more worrying aspect occurred quite recently, in a particular case in which I had already made a complaint to the Garda ombudsman which had more or less summarily ignored or dismissed my complaint.  The Garda ombudsman did inform me in writing that it had sent a copy of my particular complaint to the Director of Public Prosecutions with a view to informing the DPP that the case should be dismissed or should not go ahead, yet the DPP's office appeared to have ignored that.  I have been told anecdotally that there is a standing instruction in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions that any cases involving protesters at Shannon Airport should automatically be let go to trial.  If that was the case it would be very worrying that somebody has attempted to interfere at the level of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which should be independent of political interference.  There is evidence that there is a web of interference in order to silence the likes of us and to avoid investigating what has been going on at Shannon Airport.</p></speech>

This frightens people.  They do not want to come to the vigil if they feel that suddenly everything they do has to be written down.  It is a way of limiting the numbers who come to our monthly vigils.</p><p>  I have heard the way the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na discusses Dr. Edward Horgan.  When we went to Ennis to make a complaint, the Garda behaved with total disdain and asked why we wanted to make a complaint.  It was really humiliating for somebody such as Dr. Edward Horgan who after all had some kind of status.  He has served in the Irish Army and defended the country.  Equally, when I was there they said they saw that Ed Horgan slinking around.  They have a personal disdain towards Dr. Edward Horgan and Dr. John Lannon, which then catches on.  People regard us as losers who are not getting anywhere.  As I stated at the very beginning, we are a small group and we are moving forward and in the end it will turn out that we are absolutely right that the airport should not be used by the military.</p></speech>

We have come with a series of questions, to which we need answers.  There is a legal basis as well as a moral basis for what we are doing.  To return to the point made by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh on ministerial responsibility and the importance that the matter needs to be given.  At a political and ministerial level we have found repeatedly that when we need to get information, that small snippets come from different Departments.</p> <p>Therefore, the Minister for transport will give a small piece of information in regard to what is happening at Shannon, the Minister for justice will give a small piece of information, the Minister for Defence may give a small piece of information and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade may give a small piece of information, but nobody takes responsibility for these serious matters nor for all of the issues we and others have presented on numerous occasions, matters we are presenting again today.  We need oversight of these matters.  The issues are far too serious for Ministers to be passing the buck from one to the other.  For example, when we ask about specific planes, we are told they are technically civilian aircraft rather than military aircraft, so instead of asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, we must ask the Minister for transport about them.</p><p> A co-ordinated and cohesive response must be provided to the serious questions we are raising.  We need clarity around what Ireland is doing and supporting and around why we have been involved in the millions of deaths in Iraq, why we have been involved in deaths in Afghanistan and why we have been involved and complicit in torture.  Somebody needs to take responsibility for this.</p></speech>

The motion that was passed in the D&aacute;il at the time essentially gave a green light to Irish facilitation of the US military machine.  The arguments put forward in that regard have been absolutely exposed, because the preamble to the motion which concludes the arrangements that facilitate this should continue is all about Iraq's failure to comply properly with allegations it may have had weapons of mass destruction.  We have subsequently discovered there were no weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, it could not possibly have complied, or it had complied because it did not have those weapons.  Therefore, the entire basis on which the war was conducted has been exposed as having been flawed.  Consequently, the justification provided at the time by the Government for facilitating this war has been exposed.  There was a quasi-legal justification for what the Government did at the time.  It tried to justify it within our idea of neutrality and our commitment to the United Nations and so on.  Do the witnesses think this is an area on which we can challenge the Government - in terms of its compliance with international law - given what has happened in retrospect?</p><p>  In regard to my second question, the witnesses spoke about political interference, the Garda, harassment of protesters and failure to take complaints seriously.  As events move on, things that might be said in one context gain much greater force in a new context.  The new context for what the witnesses are saying is the shock of the revelations in regard to whistleblowers, Maurice McCabe and John Wilson, and an acknowledgment by the State that there is a problem in regard to how policing was done at the top.  It is widely acknowledged there was political interference with how the Garda conducted its business in certain areas, most notably the Mick Wallace affair, where information was passed by the Commissioner to the Minister and used for political purposes.  This would seem to add strength to the witnesses contention that there is political interference with how the Garda does its business, its priorities and so on.  Does this give the witnesses cause for optimism and confidence?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.630" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Edward Horgan" time="17:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014061800009#K00500"><p>Yes, we would have cause for optimism following the recent changes in the Garda.  However, it is clearly our experience at Shannon that the problems do not just exist at the top.  The culture goes right down to the lower level and that is problematic.  In regard to the information we receive through parliamentary questions in the D&aacute;il, particularly from the Departments of foreign affairs and transport, we are continually told, by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in particular, that approval is only given for US military planes to pass through Shannon Airport if they are not carrying arms, not carrying munitions, the troops are not engaged in military exercises, not involved in military operations and a whole lot of other reasons.</p><p>  It beggars belief that any US military plane would land at Shannon Airport other than if it was carrying weapons or troops and involved in military operations.  They are not going golfing in military planes.  We have seen soldiers get out of those planes.  In one case last year, we saw a 30 mm cannon, which is normally armed with depleted uranium bullets, at the airport.  This issue was fobbed off as if it was an administrative error.  The only administrative error was that the crew forgot to pull the gun in before the plane landed.  From my military experience and from my knowledge of the US army, with whom I have worked overseas, army personnel never leave the United States in a military plane without arms and ammunition on board.  Every US soldier who leaves the United States carries his or her own personal weapon and ammunition with him or her.  Therefore, the information we are receiving, particularly from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is untrue.  It is either being misinformed by the US Embassy and authorities or it is deliberately obfuscating. </p><p>  In regard to the civilian or chartered plains carrying US troops through the airport, up to 2.5 million troops have gone through since 2001.  We know these troops are all armed.  We know Tom Clonan, the security expert, has seen the arms on board the planes at Shannon Airport, yet we are told the Minister for transport, Deputy Varadkar, gives permission for these planes to land, more or less on a daily basis.  It is his responsibility to give permission, but he does not have authority or responsibility to be in breach of international law.  It is clearly in breach of international law to allow a plane load of troops on its way to a military operation or on its way to war to pass through Shannon Airport or a neutral country.  It is his job to authorise or refuse permission for this.  It is his obligation to refuse to authorise all such planes carrying armed troops of a belligerent power.  He is not doing that.</p></speech>

There are military planes, painted dark green or in camouflage, which are clearly military planes.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has responsibility for those planes.

We are being told the military planes are not involved in war or are not carrying munitions, but the civilian planes are carrying soldiers to war and are carrying munitions.  We know from the Minister for transport that these so-called civilian planes are military planes to all intents and purposes, because they have been contracted by the US military.  Omni Air International and others are making these flights on contract for the US military.  They are going to US air bases.  Therefore, essentially they are coming from the US to what is effectively a US air base in Ireland and then on to another air base, which is closer to what they refer to as a theatre of war, so that they can be acclimatised or whatever and go in from those air bases.</p> <p>We also know there are soldiers in military attire on some of those military aircraft but they are supposedly not engaged in military exercises.  This beggars belief, as Dr. Horgan said.</p><p> I will now return to the initial question on the quasi-legal justification given when all this started in 2002 and 2003.  There was no mandate from the UN and any quasi-legal justification came retrospectively when an attempt was made to put in place some semblance of a UN mandate relating to Afghanistan.  Since then successive Governments have hidden behind vague, woolly and imprecise terminology to create justifications.  There is talk of humanitarian missions and the responsibility to protect.  We have heard the notion of military neutrality spoken of for many years - it has no legal basis but allows us to adapt what we can do while still remaining neutral.</p><p> Another matter, namely, sovereign immunity, was introduced by the Minister for Justice and Equality last year in response to parliamentary questions and it is something that can be granted to some of these aircraft.  No clear legal basis has been provided for any of these matters.  There is no clarity as to whether there is compliance with the Hague Convention, the Geneva Convention, the United Nations Conventions Against Torture, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights.  I could give a long list of such conventions.  I am speaking of very serious conventions and treaties that Ireland has signed, ratified and said it will uphold.  They are part of Irish law but Ireland is ignoring them while hiding behind vague terms like sovereign immunity and military neutrality.</p></speech>

Those policies contravened the European Convention on Human Rights and legislation has recently passed through the D&aacute;il to address the fact that the policies were in breach of our commitments under that convention.  Could we similarly prove a case in the area under discussion today alleging that Ireland is in breach of its commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights?  We must examine this because planes known to be involved in rendition are landing in this jurisdiction.  Am I correct that Ireland is in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights merely by allowing such planes to land here, regardless of whether people subject to rendition are actually on board while the planes are at Shannon Airport?</p></speech>

As activists trying to shine a light on what has been happening at Shannon Airport over the years, we have been extremely limited in our resources.  We have co-operated with other groups, such as Amnesty International, on their fine reports.  Largely due to a lack of resources we have not been able to bring a case before any of the institutions mentioned.  All of the information we have gathered over the years suggests strongly a credible case could be built.  I hope it will not come to that.  Bearing in mind the recommendations of the Seanad and others on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR, I hope this committee can ensure the Government takes this matter seriously and takes responsibility to do what should be done.</p></speech>

With the permission of the Chairman I will read a brief statement on the current performance of tourism in Ireland, highlighting the work we are undertaking on the development side.</p><p>  When I met with the committee in July of last year, I was anxious to emphasise that F&aacute;ilte Ireland believed tourism was turning a corner after a number of very difficult seasons.  After struggling to survive since the onset of the economic downturn, a growing number of tourism businesses were in recovery mode.  I am happy to confirm that the industry is improving and that growth in the tourism sector has been generally quite robust in the past year.  The mood in the industry is particularly upbeat just now.</p><p>  There are a number of aspects to the recovery taking place.  It is driven principally by a recovery in overseas markets, and my colleague Mr. Mark Henry will go into more detail on this.  Initially this applied to north America and continental Europe, but more recently the British market has improved too.  The domestic market, on which many businesses are perhaps too dependent, is flat, which not surprising given the ongoing economic adjustment.</p><p>  The Gathering also provided a much-needed boost and a valuable platform from which to promote Ireland to potential holidaymakers, as well as to family and friends, last year.  An independent economic assessment of The Gathering has now been completed and estimates the impact to be up to 250,000 additional visitors last year.  This contributed between &euro;160 million and &euro;200 million to the economy.  This is apart from the obvious social impact of the 5,000 or so gatherings organised by communities.  Members may be aware that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has entered into a commitment with local authorities and IPB Insurance to provide a &euro;1 million fund each year for three years to support local communities to build on the legacy of The Gathering by continuing to organise key events linking with the diaspora.  This was indicated by the Chairman at the outset.</p><p>  Towards the end of last year some commentators actually believed that the success of The Gathering may have pulled business from 2014 back into 2013.  This does not appear to have been the case, judging by the strong performance of most markets to date.  Looking into the near distance, tourism industry sentiment is buoyant and upbeat and many operators are anticipating further growth this year.  There are a number of factors contributing to this outlook.  It is believed that domestic and key global economies are slowly improving, with a sense that visitors are holidaying more and spending more.</p><p>  Three or four times a year we carry out a survey of members of the tourism industry to gauge sentiment and views on the health of the sector.  The latest survey is now available and will be published shortly.  I will share a few of the more relevant insights with the committee.</p><p>  According to our barometer, three quarters of tourism enterprises anticipate an increase in business in the months ahead.  To put that in perspective, in 2008 only 14% of respondents were in that position.  This level of optimism is the highest we have seen since the downturn.  Every sector surveyed is upbeat, but positive sentiment is strongest within the hotel sector.  This optimism is based on trading conditions so far this year.  For example, the majority of accommodation operators report an increase in visitors compared to the same period last year.  Again, hotels remain the strongest sector.  In addition to visitor numbers, revenue is improving and this is obviously helping the bottom line, with about half of the respondents reporting an increase in profitability so far this year.</p><p>  The survey makes other key points.  For example, there has been a decent start to the season for the self-catering sector, and hostels are performing well.  A large increase in business is expected for visitor attractions, and North America is proving strong for golf tourism.  There has been a reasonable improvement in the restaurant trade.  Concerns remain around costs, specifically fuel and energy.  However, positive factors include the retention of the 9% VAT rate, the Wild Atlantic Way, the legacy of The Gathering and the level of air access capacity.  The benefit of the growth in tourism is spreading around the country.  Performance in Dublin is strongest, as has been the case in the past, but this year most regions are experiencing a much better performance.</p><p>  This growth in tourism is also reflected in employment numbers.  According to the Central Statistics Office, CSO, last year there was a 14% increase in employment in the tourism industry in the areas of accommodation and food services.  This represents an extra 17,000 jobs since 2012.  These figures are based on a narrow definition of the tourism industry.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland believes some 200,000 people are employed in tourism, and current trends suggest this could grow by 68,000 this year.</p> <p>In short, revenue and employment numbers are going up, but the key aspect is how we maintain the momentum.</p><p> Regarding the forces driving competitiveness, there is little doubt but that our ability to recover market share at a faster rate than initially expected comes down not only to improving market conditions but also to our improving competitive position.  Our value for money rating as a tourist destination has continued to move upwards for the visitors who come here and, thankfully, that message is beginning to percolate through in our overseas markets to those who have yet to come here.  We seem to be shaking off the costly tag we acquired during the Celtic tiger era.  That is due to a number of factors: first, the sacrifices made by many in the industry in getting costs down and, second, the Government&rsquo;s decision to lower the VAT rate to 9%, which has been crucial to strengthening the competitiveness of Irish tourism.</p><p> Pressure points remain, including rising utility costs, local authority rates and debt repayments.  As the market recovers and more people come, there will be a tendency for prices to rise because it is a free market, but in that context, we must remain vigilant on the issue of value for money relative to our competitors and make sure we do not repeat the failings of the past if we are to sustain the recovery.</p><p> The second issue facing the industry is having a deeper understanding of the changing consumer and specifically whom we are targeting.  It is a dynamic marketplace which is continually responding to change.  In the past two years, in collaboration with our colleagues in Tourism Ireland, we have adopted a more strategic approach to identifying and defining customers overseas who are our best prospects, the experiences they are looking for and how we can provide them.  It is a new way of targeting growth, based on a new segmentation model, and it very much guides everything we do.  The Wild Atlantic Way is, in part, a response to that approach.  The emphasis of these new models is on customer motivations, rather than demographics; therefore, rather than presuming everybody of a certain age or social class wants the same thing from a holiday, the new model looks at the triggers.  The approach targets the groups within our overseas markets with the greatest potential to come here.  This research-based targeting of customers requires a rigorous disciplined approach and needs to be continued even as the market recovers.  In the past year we have been very active with Tourism Ireland in sharing these insights with our industry partners.</p><p> An added challenge for the industry because this is a very small destination on the international stage is achieving stand-out in a very noisy and cluttered market.  We believe this is best achieved with projects of scale and singularity such as the Wild Atlantic Way which can capture the imagination of targeted customers and resonate with their motivations.  That is something local authorities along the west coast are supporting as we roll out the Wild Atlantic Way concept.  With their help, we have managed to complete our signage programme for what is now the longest themed touring route in the world.  Next, we will put in place a large number of discovery points and associated touring facilities with a specific grant allocation announced in last year&rsquo;s budget.  Businesses and communities along the west coast are very excited by this development because it gives them a mechanism to reposition the west in a way that will resonate with our target customers.  This is a priority in marketing for our Tourism Ireland colleagues, to which Mr. Henry will probably refer.</p><p> In a similar fashion we are taking a fresh look at Dublin.  Despite the fact that it has been performing well in the corporate sector, we need to look at how it is branded and marketed because many tourists who come to Ireland spend a night or two in Dublin, either at the beginning or the end of their holiday.  It is a very important part of the product.  We are developing a network of discovery trails throughout the city and working with the local authorities in the county of Dublin and the local industry to open up the experience to what we call a city plus experience.</p><p> As with the Wild Atlantic Way, we are also scoping a new proposition for the east and south of the country based on the rich array of cultural and heritage assets from the north east, the midlands, the south east to Cork.  This comes on foot of significant investments we have made in areas such as Kilkenny, Waterford and Cork city, to name but a few.</p><p> We have played a leading role in driving significant investment in tourism in the past five years.  Approximately &euro;120 million in capital has been invested in almost 60 major projects.  This year we will be investing approximately &euro;8 million in capital on the Wild Atlantic Way.  As things improve in the sector, it might be tempting to ease up on such investment, but our competitors are very aggressive and we must continue to invest wisely to ensure our tourism product is in a position to compete and we can earn our fair share of the pie.  On the Internet and in the online era, we are living in a rapidly changing world.  Travel and tourism has been one of the areas most affected by this new technology.  Developments in digital marketing and selling continue to transform the manner in which consumers consider and choose a holiday.  Not surprisingly, our competitors in other destinations continue to invest.  This is where Ireland must invest too and an area in which we are not very well positioned in terms of our entire offering is digital channels.  This is not about tourist boards but about individual tourism businesses and how they leverage the power of the Internet and social media.</p><p> F&aacute;ilte Ireland shares the optimism pervading the tourism industry, but we are not complacent.  We are focusing on areas in which we believe visitor numbers will grow further and confident that if the sector continues to maintain the current balance of quality and value it provides, we can sustain further growth.  Tourism can provide economic growth, revenue and jobs with a regional spread, unlike most other sectors.  It provides employment in areas in which foreign direct investment cannot.  As many members will know from their constituencies, what is good for tourism is good for Ireland.  We in F&aacute;ilte Ireland will be doing our best to ensure things get even better.</p></speech>

I am the central marketing director at Tourism Ireland.  I am here to represent our chief executive, Mr. Niall Gibbons, who met the Chairman yesterday and has asked me to pass on his apologies owing to his attendance at overseas promotions in Canada.  I am joined by Ms Siobhan McManamy, our head of co-operative marketing.<br />As members will know, Tourism Ireland is responsible for marketing the island of Ireland overseas.  The organisation was established in one of the six areas in which there would be co-operation under the framework of the Good Friday Agreement.  We work closely with the two tourist boards on the island of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  The principal objectives of the company are to increase tourism revenue and numbers to the island of Ireland and support Northern Ireland to realise its tourism potential.  We carry out extensive destination marketing campaigns in key source markets for tourism to the island of Ireland.  Our major promotional effort is focused on the four key markets that together deliver the majority of overseas visitors - Great Britain, the United States, Germany and France.  In addition, we are rolling out trade marketing and publicity campaigns in a further 18 markets.<br />Overseas tourism is one of Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industries.  It accounts for almost 60% of all tourism revenue and has the capacity to deliver even more for the economies on the island.  Last year was another positive one for tourism.  Eight million overseas visitors came to the island of Ireland, an increase of 7% on the figure for 2012, contributing revenue of approximately &euro;3.9 billion, an increase of 12% for the economies on the island.  Holidaymaker numbers grew strongly by 9% and contributed more than &euro;1.7 billion in revenue.  This growth was driven by strong increases in visitor numbers from all of our market areas worldwide.  In fact, we saw the highest number of visitors ever in 2013 from North America, Germany, France, Spain and our long-haul markets, with visitors from Australia, in particular, driving that growth.  It was also particularly encouraging to see a return to growth of 7% from the British market.<br />Working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, The Gathering was a major focus of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s promotions throughout 2013.  It saw huge engagement with the Diaspora worldwide and an increased focus on the promotion of roots tourism by Tourism Ireland.  Our<b></b>international marketing of The Gathering Ireland reached an estimated 200 million people worldwide through a wide range of media and promotional activities, including television and print advertising, as well as an innovative digital strategy highlighting the many great reasons to visit Ireland during the year.  Publicity was an integral element of the promotional programme; 1,500 international journalists visited during the year and then wrote and broadcast extensively about Ireland and The Gathering, generating an estimated &euro;75 million in positive publicity specifically for The Gathering worldwide.  Our success in promoting The Gathering was recognised by the Marketing Institute of Ireland last month when Tourism Ireland received the award for the most successful international marketing campaign of the year by an Irish organisation.<br />In order to capitalise on the increasingly central role of the Internet in travel and holiday planning, as my colleague, Mr. Quinn mentioned, Tourism Ireland invests heavily in digital marketing.  Our suite of international websites attracted 13.5 million unique visitors in 2013 and <i>Ireland.com</i>has been rolled out in 30 markets around the world in ten languages.  We have grown our Facebook fan base from a couple of thousand at the beginning of 2010 to over 2.2 million today, giving us the fourth largest tourist board presence after Australia, the United States and Britain.</p> <p>In consultation with industry partners, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, we have developed a strategy and an action plan to return the British market, our largest and most important, to sustained growth.  These were rolled out during 2013, with promotions targeting new groups that were receptive to the type of experience Ireland was best placed to offer.  I refer to the culturally curious, social energiser and great escaper segments.  <br />The most recent figures for overseas travel to the Republic of Ireland show growth of 9% for the period January to April 2014 by comparison with the same period in 2013.  There was a strong increase in British visitor numbers of 14% during this period and growth from other important tourism markets, including North America and other long-haul markets.  In the first quarter alone, the number of holidaymakers specifically increased by 8%.  However, it should be said attractions and accommodation providers in urban centres and tourism hot spots are generally more buoyant than rural locations.<br />This year we undertook an extensive St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day marketing programme.  Our annual Global Greening initiative has gone from strength to strength, from its beginnings in 2010, with just the Sydney Opera House going green, to this year when more than 100 landmark buildings and iconic sites turned a shade of green for our national day, including sites such as the Great Wall of China, the Great Pyramid of Giza and the Sphinx in Egypt, the Treasury in the ancient city of Petra and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil.  At least one part of Brazil is turning green this year.<br />Another key focus in the early part of the year was on promoting the Grande Partenza of the Giro d&rsquo;Italia which took place in May.  This highly anticipated event was a tremendous success, bringing positive messages and showcasing our spectacular scenery to some 775 million viewers in 164 countries.<br />We are placing a major focus on touring holidays this year, in particular highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way.  As members know, it is Ireland&rsquo;s first long distance touring route, stretching from the Inishowen Peninsula, County Donegal all the way to Kinsale, County Cork.  Let me give some examples of the ways in which we are promoting the Wild Atlantic Way in key overseas markets.  In Britain television advertisements highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way have been airing across the UK television networks, reaching an audience of some 14 million consumers.  In the United States a national television campaign featuring the Wild Atlantic Way reached millions of potential American visitors earlier this year.  Advertisements promoting the Wild Atlantic Way are running in over 2,600 cinemas throughout France and will reach over 5 million cinemagoers.  In Germany this spring almost 700,000 commuters saw Wild Atlantic Way advertisements on large illuminated posters that were prominently displayed at bus and tram stops in the cities of Cologne and D&uuml;sseldorf.  These are just a few examples; I could give many others.  Our promotion of the Wild Atlantic Way will continue throughout 2014 and beyond.<br />The first ever designation of Limerick as the national city of culture presents Tourism Ireland with a wonderful opportunity to increase awareness of the city around the world this year as a cultural and historic destination.  We are highlighting Limerick in our promotions, taking every opportunity to leverage the tourism benefits of this year-long celebration of culture for the city.  The organisation has an extra special focus on Limerick in its promotional programmes in Great Britain, the United States, France, Germany and Canada.<br />We are working closely with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to promote overseas other regions in Ireland through, for example, initiatives such as Dublin&rsquo;s Doorstep which highlights the counties of Meath, Kildare, Laois and their environs, featuring attractions such as the Boyne Valley touring route and the Kildare-Wicklow grand tour route.  We are also highlighting the fact that Waterford is Ireland&rsquo;s oldest city, celebrating its 1,100th anniversary this year.  Attractions such as the Viking Triangle in Waterford and festivals such as the Waterford Food Festival, Wexford Festival Opera, the Cork Jazz Festival and Kilkenny Cat Laughs Comedy Festival also feature as part of our promotional activity overseas.<br />We are specifically building on the legacy of The Gathering this year, continuing to reach out to the Diaspora across the world through, for example, participation in events such as &ldquo;Who Do you Think You Are? Live&rdquo;, the family history and genealogy event in Britain; sponsorship of Irish-American events; advertorials in publications such as <i>The Irish Post </i>and <i>Irish America</i>magazine; and our own Ireland Family History Facebook page which was set up last year to connect with those with Irish heritage and which will remain a central focus of our marketing of Ireland in Britain and elsewhere around the world.<br />The high-yield business tourism sector continues to be an extremely important focus of our marketing efforts.  In Britain, for example, we will have a presence at 11 key events during 2014, including The Meetings Show in the Olympia in London in July.  Presentations, workshops and networking events, as well as familiarisation visits for influential corporate meetings and incentive buyers, are the mainstay of our activity in this area.<br />While the majority of our overseas visitors come from the core markets of Great Britain, North America and mainland Europe, we have also expanded our focus beyond these markets to look to the long-term opportunities presented by markets such as China, India and the Middle East.  Visitors from long-haul markets stay twice as long as the average holidaymaker and are more likely to travel throughout the island and make a significant economic contribution to numerous tourism sectors.  We welcome the launch on Monday last of a joint visa initiative between Ireland and the United Kingdom which will commence this autumn with China and India.  We will be working closely with our colleagues in VisitBritain to leverage the benefits of the new scheme in these markets.  Of course, since this is an island, convenient and competitive air and sea connectivity is vital if we are to continue to grow overseas tourism numbers to Ireland.<br />Last year saw a number of positive developments, including a 26% increase in the number of airline seats between the United States and Ireland for the peak season, from June to August.  Announcements of new and additional services &ndash; by both air and sea carriers &ndash; for 2014 augur well for the continuing success of overseas tourism.  Total available capacity to the Republic of Ireland for the peak summer season in 2014 is estimated to be up 6% on last summer, with double digit increases from France, Germany, North America and the Middle East.<br />We continue to invest in co-operative marketing activity with air and sea carriers in key markets to stimulate demand for services into Ireland.  A busy programme of co-operative campaigns with carriers has been under way this year, highlighting ease of access and great fares.  We are also in dialogue with airports, seaports and carriers on an ongoing basis to identify opportunities and case-make for the introduction of new services from key markets.<br />Having experienced three years of growth in the number of leisure visitors to Ireland, we are optimistic about the potential for future growth in the years ahead.  The sectoral targets we are working towards will see the island of Ireland welcome 8.9 million visitors per year by 2016, generating almost &euro;4.5 billion in revenue.  This will include almost 4.3 million holidaymakers, generating &euro;2.7 billion in revenue.<br />I hope this introductory statement has given members a flavour of the extensive marketing programmes Tourism Ireland has in place to grow overseas tourism to Ireland in the months and years ahead.  We will continue to work closely with our tourism partners, both at home and overseas, to achieve our common objectives and help to drive economic regeneration, growth and, ultimately, jobs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1073" speakername="John O'Mahony" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800006#J00200"><p>Before I hand over to members, I will make a couple of observations.  Both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland paint a very positive picture.  It appears as if the tourism figures will return very shortly to those for 2007 and 2008.  There are also challenges which both delegates have outlined.  These concern dispersing tourists to Ireland geographically and having them arrive throughout the year.  The Wild Atlantic Way and other initiatives that have been mentioned are important in this regard.</p><p>  One reason for the decline in tourists to Ireland was the economic crash throughout Europe and the rest of the world and another was that we had lost competitiveness.  The abolition of the travel tax and the reduction in the VAT rate have helped and there has been very good value in the past three or four years.  Is there a danger that we will revisit the same issues that arose in the past?  The delegates stated pressure in Dublin and other main centres was building again.  We all hear anecdotal evidence of increases in hotel accommodation costs.  Is this a danger?  Can we protect against the problems that contributed to the decline in the past?</p><p>  On the question of the shoulder season, figures suggest 100,000 people from outside the State will be arriving for the Garth Brooks concerts.  God help anyone coming for a casual holiday at that time and looking for accommodation around Dublin.  Has there been engagement with promoters or others involved in the industry with a view to holding conferences and other events in the autumn or early in the year so as to disperse tourists?  What efforts are being made in that regard?</p><p>  Mr. Quinn stated F&aacute;ilte Ireland had entered a commitment with local authorities, worth &euro;1 million, for marketing in the next three years.  Is this an additional allocation or does it represent a different way of proceeding?</p> <p>I start with those few observations and questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.665" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Henry" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800007#K00200"><p>I am happy start.  The Chairman mentioned three different issues, the regional distribution of tourism, the seasonal distribution of tourism, and competitiveness.  In terms of competitiveness, the consumer last year gave us excellent feedback to the effect that we have seen several years of price improvements.  The visitor attitude survey to which Mr. Quinn referred shows that consumers are very positive about the value they are now getting.  I welcome some of the comments last week by the chairman of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation who noted that they lost the run of themselves - I think that is the phrase he used - in the industry in terms of pricing at the peak in 2007.  That is welcome.  We are in a good place but we have to safeguard it.  In Tourism Ireland, we are picking up some anecdotal feedback, particularly from tour operators who are looking to contract forward beyond this summer, that prices are going up.  Double digit price increases are being sought for accommodation especially in the major urban centres that tourists want to visit.  We have reflected the concern to the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation and other industry members that it is important we do not get ourselves back to the position we were in.  It is one to watch.</p><p>  The Chairman referred to geographical or regional distribution.  The keys to regional and seasonal spread are in the same vein.  I mentioned the Wild Atlantic Way as one of our key focuses.  It gives people strong and wonderful reasons not just to take the day trip from Dublin, where they may choose to base themselves, to the Cliffs of Moher and back by midnight, but rather to stay in the west and explore it.  We see that as our key contribution to addressing regional distribution this year.  It is ongoing.  More regional access is also important.  People will stay near where they fly into and out of.  The growth in Shannon and Cork access is an important aspect of addressing that.  My colleague, Ms McManamy, may talk about how we work to develop business cases with airlines for additional access.</p></speech>

Festivals and events are also key, particularly to the shoulder season.  Ms McManamy may wish to touch on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.668" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobh&aacute;n McManamy" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800007#K00500"><p>We have seen that growth in and access to all regional airports this year has created opportunities to which the industry has responded.  One is looking at things like growth in festivals and events taking place from September to November.  One sees significant Limerick city of culture events every weekend in September, which allows us to spread the season.  We are also seeing initiatives in Mayo and Kerry where the industry is responding with good value offerings.  We are working with the carriers to present those to the overseas visitor.</p><p>  Given what we have done this year with the carriers, the peak is tending to look after itself.  We are therefore increasing our efforts in the shoulder season and on regional routes.  The welcome news that the Berlin and Paris routes into Shannon will continue over the winter allows us to build that momentum.  Increasingly, festivals and events provide reasons to travel which, matched with a quick, easy and competitive mode of access, allows us to extend the season.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.669" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Quinn" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800007#K00600"><p>Picking up on some of those points, I note that on the ground value for money increased about three or four years ago, but it has taken that long for the message to get out into the market.  One can lose it very quickly and it can take a long time to get it back.  I do not see a danger that we are going to go into reverse gear across the country at the moment, but there is a particular issue in Dublin between the canals around capacity at hotels.  Occupancy is over 90%, which drives it.  The knock-on concern would be that it could in some way tarnish the image of more competitive parts of the country where this is not happening - it has been multiple speed.  That is an issue that will probably be rectified by the market.  It is hard to believe that one might be looking for more hotels so soon in any part of the country, but Dublin certainly has an issue.</p><p>  Regionality and seasonality are issues that have been with us for a number of years.  Despite the total growth in numbers, we have probably not effected the change we would like to see in terms of regional spread and seasonality.  In some parts of the country, the season is only six weeks.  If one could extend that by a few weeks either way, one could sustain a number of extra jobs.  Ms McManamy mentioned festivals and events and we would like to see more of them taking place in the shoulders.  Many of them are taking place in the peak when people are coming anyway.  If we could get a greater spread, it would be good.</p><p>  Regional spread was behind our thinking when we conceived of the Wild Atlantic Way as a way to draw people and give them a reason to travel.  It has resonated very well in the market so far.  We think it will be very successful but, equally, we want to replicate it in the south and east.  There is great opportunity and the early indications are that the messages going out on the west, south and east are resonating.  We are on a rising platform.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.670" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800007#K00700"><p>I welcome the presentations from both organisations.  I thank the witnesses for providing us with an update on the work they are doing and congratulate them on the success they have achieved over the last couple of difficult trading years.</p><p>  I recognise that both bodies have dealt with the value-for-money issue the market faces.  There is still a difficulty with hotels.  Mr. Quinn referred to it when he said the solution may be to put more hotel rooms into the area.  Perhaps, that can happen and hotels can be built more cheaply than before.  My contact with the industry suggests that it is not fair to say hoteliers are coining it as they try to increase the price.  Many of them are struggling.  The private ones are struggling in competition with what they refer to as the "NAMA hotels", which is a problem that is probably resolving itself as NAMA sells on its assets to larger institutions which will want to see an immediate return on their investments.  There is a difficult situation for both private and institutional hotel owners currently.  They will have to see some level of increase to be sustainable.  The market will have to bear that to some extent.  Mr. Quinn referred to the city between the canals.  There is no doubt that if one looks at comparable city destinations internationally, Dublin continues to represent fairly good value for money by comparison even in the high season.  There are not too many other cities in Europe where one can obtain room rates at less than &euro;100.</p><p>  I was taken by Mr. Quinn's reference to the deeper understanding of the customer and his organisation's efforts in that regard.  It is particularly good.  He referred to the experience rather than to look at the demographic.  That is right.  Does F&aacute;ilte Ireland have any long-term projects in mind on the creation of attractions which might not be synonymous with Ireland to cater for the experiences that are emerging or which already exist?  I am thinking of the obvious issue that Ireland is not really seen as a family holiday destination for many reasons, principally because of the weather.  Yet, people will go camping to Brittany over the summer where they are not guaranteed weather much better than one would get in parts of the south east and mid-west.  Has work been done to develop a more major attraction that might focus on or target the family market?</p><p>  I acknowledge that there implications and issues on investment and its source.  Mr. Quinn is right to say that we must continue to invest in the product, which we do.  He referred to the investment of &euro;8 million in the capital infrastructure for the Wild Atlantic Way and a total of &euro;120 million which has been invested in almost 60 significant capital projects.  I hope that as the State agency charged with tourism development, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is knocking on the door of Government looking for more capital investment on an ongoing basis.  I acknowledge that to some extent it must cut its expectations based on what it anticipates is available.  However, an agency like F&aacute;ilte Ireland should push the boat out continuously in terms of new ideas and force Government to move somewhat there.  While the agency has been doing that very well, I ask what the next phase is and what ideas it has in that regard.</p> <p>In respect of Tourism Ireland's marketing spend, what kind of analysis is carried by Tourism Ireland that gives it a good understanding of value for money in terms of the investment it makes based on trends from the various different markets?  Does it carry out analysis on that and if so, could Mr. Henry share some of it with us?  Is it moving from the more traditional spend towards online?  What is the shift there and how does Mr. Henry see that going with all the various opportunities that seem to exist in that online world?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.672" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Quinn" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800008#L00200"><p>I agree with the Deputy's opening comment about Dublin because one must compare like with like.  In comparing capital cities, Dublin is still very good value.  There is a balance to be struck.  In order to sustain a business, it must be profitable.</p><p>  In terms of the product, both Mr. Henry and I spoke earlier about how we are targeting consumers.  It is a very interesting piece of work that is ongoing.  We have gone out to the core markets to look at the key segments.  There are three segments that seem to be resonating most with Ireland.  One is a young segment which is looking for a city break, which is typically Dublin.  It is a small enough segment called Social Energisers.  Another segment is called Great Escapers, which is composed of people in their thirties with very young children who come here looking to get away from it all.  This is typically a west of Ireland type route.  The third segment is called the Culturally Curious, which is composed of older people who do not bring children with them, are better educated, have higher incomes and are looking to understand the heritage and culture of a destination.  This plays into the south and east as well as the west coast to some extent.  </p><p>  When we carried out the analysis, we found that as a country, we do not score on family-type holidays.  As a consequence of that research, the bulk of the money we have been investing has been in playing to what we call our core strengths.  These include the natural heritage, which is the landscape and seascape.  An example would the Wild Atlantic Way.  Another core strength is the built heritage, which is synonymous with the south and east, Dublin and cultural heritage.  That is where the money has been invested in the past number of years.  When I talk about &euro;120 million, we have invested in those areas we are known for and which people are interested in experiencing.  We are not shutting our minds to other possibilities.  We are currently looking at this window from here to 2020 - possibly a new capital programme.  We would be very open to innovative ideas.  </p><p>  The key thing for us in looking at capital projects is that people can demonstrate that there is a market for it, the project will wash its face and they will not be coming back after a number of years looking for top-up State funding just to keep going because we cannot really have that.  When one sees a market recovering like it currently is, one will see investors coming back into it.  They know there is money to be made and that there may be some grant support.  We are open to that.  I do not think the weather is necessarily a limiting factor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Henry" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800008#L00300"><p>There are two questions there.  In respect of the analysis of the effectiveness of what we are doing, we spend in the order of &euro;500,000 on research every year out of our budget of around &euro;35 million for marketing.  We spend a fair amount on analysis.  Part of it is understanding the customer and the other bit is assessing our competitive positioning and our communications and how they perform.</p><p>  We are just getting the research for this year in but research we saw from last year emphasises the point that Ireland is very well positioned so a key metric for us is what the interest in holidaying in Ireland is versus other destinations.  In all of our top four markets, Ireland would be in the top ten places that people want to holiday in at some point in the future if not in the next 12 months.  In some of those countries, such as the US and France, we would be up there in fourth or fifth position of all the places they would like to holiday in.  That is a key metric for us regarding generating interest in visiting.  We then specifically address the programmes and the return on investment we get for every euro we spend.  Our most recent study last year showed us achieving in the order of a &euro;40 to &euro;1 return for every euro we are spending, which compares quite favourably to other tourist boards for which that information is available.</p><p>  We are strong believers in the shift to digital.  As has been flagged in some of the comments, we are leaders in terms of that investment compared to other tourist boards.  The reason we made that choice is because consumer research would say that aside the word of family and friends, the Internet is now the number one influencer on destination choice - not even simply the planning or booking but the actual choice of where to go.  People turn to the Internet rather than guidebooks in the first instance.  How is that mirrored in our activity?  Last year, in delivering this new strategy we developed in Great Britain, we moved off most of the TV advertising and switched a huge chunk to YouTube and advertising where we could target the Social Energisers and the Culturally Curious very clearly and directly with relevant messages that were discrete to them.  I spoke about our investment in social media building up more than 2.2 million Facebook fans.  Again, research there would show that this is a very valuable tool for us because people are asking us to communicate them daily and to give them some information on Ireland.  It is a wonderful opportunity for us to get a message to them.  Two-thirds of those people we surveyed said that since they had become a follower of Ireland on Facebook, they would be more likely to go there to holiday because they did not know there was so much going on and they found something of interest to them.  We have a specific ambition in the corporate plan we have just completed for 2014 to 2016 relating to the digital space.  Currently, we send about one million warm leads off our digital platforms to industry websites.  Our ambition is to more than double that by 2016.  Despite having a challenging resource environment, we have the ambition to drive efficiency and effectiveness and to make that money go further for industry over the next three years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.674" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800008#L00400"><p>I welcome the presentations from Mr. Quinn and Mr. Henry and congratulate both organisations on achieving very encouraging results albeit from a low base from the peak of 2008.  It is encouraging to see a recovery in what is a hugely important industry for the country.  The figures on the domestic tourism side need a bit of a boost.  I do not know what role F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland have played in attracting domestic and international corporate convention tourism.  Could we do more there?  Could Mr. Quinn and Mr. Henry identify issues where there is a real blockage in terms of attracting that type of visitor?  They are high end and would be welcome visitors.</p><p>  I am fortunate to live on the Beara peninsula in west Cork on the Wild Atlantic Way route.  Every time I come to Dublin, I am amazed by the amount of young people from different countries working in Dublin who constitute a market in a domestic sense.  I am reflecting the views of people where I live.  Would there be any value in going to a large multinational, particularly in Dublin, and saying to its workforce that even though they are working in Dublin, they are young, energetic and mobile and there is another Ireland out there?  There could be a market here.  The weekend break typically deals with Dublin but this is a cohort of people who might consider a weekend break away from Dublin.  There are tens of thousands of people who might avail of this.  We do not see them.</p><p>  I congratulate all those who work on the Wild Atlantic Way.  I live on it and believe it is going to be an iconic tourism destination.  The signage, work, effort and  investment so far have been very welcome.  I do have one criticism.  It is one I have mentioned in some meetings I have had with local authorities and the Wild Atlantic Way and concerns the app.</p> <p>Quite frankly, one could read the entire app in the time it took to make half the presentation this morning.  I suggest that the Wild Atlantic Way app directs users to local businesses and tourism initiatives such as hotels, guesthouses, restaurants or whatever.  The app is very limited but perhaps that is due to a lack of resources.  It has so much potential.  It is too one dimensional and much more work could be done with it.  As Mr. Henry has said, the people who travel to Ireland are no less engaged with their digital devices than we are.  They take them with them and will look at them whether it is in Inishowen, Malin Head, Mizen Head or the Cliffs of Moher.  As they travel around they will check their digital devices for information such as where to get a meal, places to stay, prices and menus.  They will also want to know how to get to a particular viewing point, directions for same and how long it will take walking, driving or whatever to reach that destination.  The app has more potential which should be developed.</p><p> Mr. Quinn will speak later today at the marine conference being held at Dublin Castle.  The following matter might be worth looking at.  He touched on the subject himself when he mentioned the heritage issue of the south and east, marine archaeology and the heritage link-up one could have from Wexford to Spike Island.  People will want to access such a heritage product and it is not particularly seasonal.  As he mentioned, the initiative could be expanded on the shoulders of other initiatives.  Will F&aacute;ilte Ireland develop and Tourism Ireland market the initiative?  It would bring in the type of customer he mentioned - the older client.</p><p> I also note that F&aacute;ilte Ireland's current strategy is to dispose of assets and that it has begun to get out of the property game.  I suggest it deals with that job carefully.  I know there are some places in west Cork, in my constituency, where it is looking at disposing assets.  I hope that if it is doing so, it will keep in mind the strategic nature of those assets in terms of tourism and ensure they do not fall into the wrong hands.  I hope they will be maintained, inasmuch as the agency can do so, for tourism related initiatives.  That would be very important.  The sites are established and have been branded tourism assets which I hope is what they will remain.  I will discuss some specific locations that I am concerned about with F&aacute;ilte Ireland in due course.</p><p> Either F&aacute;ilte Ireland or Tourism Ireland touched on the issue of the 9% VAT rate.  I would like to think that it was maintained because the tourism sector lobbied vigorously to maintain the rate.  Are there further initiatives planned?  I do not believe the organisations see the rate as an end in itself in terms of what the Government can do to stimulate the industry.  We are entering negotiations now and the budget will take place later on in the year.  Are there specific issues that could stimulate the sector?</p><p> My final questions are for Tourism Ireland.  Has it done any projections on the loosening up of visa requirements for the UK from China and India?  The potential to do so was touched on in the presentation.  Has anything been done to progress the matter?  Is the process only beginning?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.676" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Quinn" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800009#M00200"><p>The Deputy has raised a number of issues and his points about the marine sector were very well made.  Despite the fact we are an island, we do not tend to play up our coastline.  I may leave the issues raised about the Wild Atlantic Way and, possibly, the marine to my colleagues, Ms Monaghan and Mr. Paddy Matthews, who live and breathe the project because they are largely responsible for where it is today.</p><p>  The Deputy began by talking about the domestic market, which is incredibly important, particularly west of the Shannon where a very high proportion of bed nights are domestic.  While we really want to grow the international business, we know we cannot do it overnight.  Therefore, getting as much growth as we can into the domestic market is incredibly important and we pursued a similar approach in Ireland late last year.  As we did with Tourism Ireland previously, we segmented the market and identified three segments for growth.  Our new marketing campaign is under way and the workshops we are running with the trade focus in on the three segments because we believe that there is more growth.  The Deputy's point was very well made.  One cannot take one's foot off the pedal in terms of the domestic market.  Even the good weather can change people's minds about the domestic market and we hope it will have a very positive impact this year.</p><p>  Similarly, in the area of corporate and business tourism, which is incredibly important to the industry, not everywhere in the country, but certainly in the larger urban centres, we are very involved in bringing large conferences to Ireland.  It is a growth area which has grown in the past three or four years and is growing again.  We have the infrastructure.  For example, the National Convention Centre Dublin allows us to play in a bigger league than we have never been in before.  That does not mean the business only goes to that location, but by virtue of having the facility, it puts Ireland in a better place.</p><p>  With regard to the disposal of assets, we can talk about the specific issues another time.  In the main, we do not run tourist attractions.  We inherited a number of properties throughout the country and we are in the process of disposing of some of them.  It is a disposal of State assets so we comply with all the regulations.  I will keep the Deputy's point in mind and we can discuss specific issues later.</p><p>  With regard to the VAT rate and other measures, we could easily say the agencies should be given more money, but we support any measures that will keep down the cost of doing business, which is what the VAT rate and travel tax have done.  There are ongoing issues such as inequitable local authority rates or whatever, fuel costs and whatnot which will be raised by the industry.  We support anything that can be done, even across the public sector, to keep down the cost of doing business and assist competitiveness.  My colleagues will deal with the Wild Atlantic Way issues.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Harrington, I live along the Wild Atlantic Way and can echo his sentiments.</p><p>  With regard to the app, the current app on the market is not the official app, or is not a F&aacute;ilte Ireland developed app, but the good news is there will be one which is due to be launched early in July.  In exact response to his point, one of the key functions of the app will be a what is nearby piece which will encourage visitors to stay and have their lunch, evening meal, visit other attractions or engage in activities in the vicinity.  There will be an opportunity on the app to give people very specific messages about where they are at a particular point in time.  The app will be launched in July.</p></speech>

All tourism providers, accommodation providers and all the detail currently on the F&aacute;ilte Ireland website for those businesses in the vicinity and jurisdiction of the Wild Atlantic Way will be available on the app as well as maps and the location of the viewing points.</p><p>  Reference was made to young international people who work in Dublin for short or long periods.  Our colleagues on the Dublin project have already engaged in a very interesting exercise.  They hosted a Dublin evening at Google and shared with those people all the hidden gems and secrets and things to do and see in Dublin.  We will replicate the event with other multinationals for other big propositions such as the Wild Atlantic Way.  This week we embarked on an extensive home holiday campaign that features the Wild Atlantic Way.  The aim is to encourage Irish people to head west or migrate from the east to the west and engage with the Wild Atlantic Way.  We want them to look at the whole west coast in a different light.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked about the new visa regime with Britain.  It is very significant.  We did some consumer research with potential Chinese visitors in March when the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport visited the place.  He spoke at a few events and we set up a lot of industry events with him out there.  The issue of visas emerged solidly from the research as one of the major ones.  One can get a Schengen visa which allows access to more than 20 countries for one price and cheaper than a combined British and Irish visa.  The problem is the cost and ease of getting visas, particularly if one must go to two different embassies to get two different visas to plan the trip, etc.</p> <p>This initiative goes right to the heart of that and will make it a lot easier.  In terms of getting visitors on to the island of Ireland from China, if they have to go to Belfast and come back, one is into all sorts of situations of needing two visas and multiple re-entry.  This initiative is significant and it will very much assist us in selling Ireland through the tour operators and the trade over there.  Our ambition in China is to increase the numbers more than threefold by 2020, so this is a very significant initiative which will help us to achieve that.</p></speech>

We are hearing good things from the US and, in particular, from Canada, where there was evidence of frustrated demand because we did not have year-round access until this year.  Great Britain, Germany, France and Belgium are good examples of that international association and the kind of collective efforts whereby, working with F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the industry and the embassy network, we have managed to secure the Union of International Associations conference for Ireland this autumn.  The people who will attend that have a huge number of delegates and conferences in their gift to bring to Ireland in the years ahead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.684" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/981" speakername="Sandra McLellan" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800010#N00300"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations, which have been very positive for Ireland going forward.  They articulated the reasons quite well in their presentations.  I have a few comments to make and questions to ask.</p><p>  I agree the Wild Atlantic Way is proving very popular and, coming from the south east, I would welcome it if it was replicated there.  We have a lot to offer there but it is a matter of putting it together and a little bit of joined-up thinking.  We could have our own Wild Atlantic Way in the south east.</p><p>  We discussed Ireland's value for money rating as a tourist destination and trying to shake off that "Rip-off Ireland" tag.  The fact the domestic market is flat was mentioned.  Ireland can be very expensive for Irish holidaymakers.  The price of some hotel rooms has gone up quite a lot over the past six months.  What initiatives are we working on to ensure that it is cost-effective for families to holiday at home?</p><p>  I refer to the &euro;1 million local government fund to support local communities.  How can that fund be accessed and what is it to be spent on?  Will the delegates elaborate on that?</p><p>  I refer to the development of digital marketing, which is extremely important.  Nowadays everybody goes on the Internet to see where they are going or what they will do.  The delegates mentioned that they were driving a programme of digital insight development and that there was huge investment in social media.  Have they looked at smart cameras?  Perhaps they will tell us a little about that?</p><p>  Has the flooding we experienced around our coastline earlier this year had an impact?  I am sure some people have gone on the Internet and decided Ireland would be a lovely holiday destination because they saw a lovely boardwalk to walk on.  Is it possible that they may arrive to find the boardwalk has been washed away and that they are not getting what they thought they were getting?  Has the flooding had such an impact?</p><p>  The delegates mentioned that The Gathering was a huge success, possibly attracting 250,000 extra visitors.  However, we have some problems attracting repeat visitors to Ireland.  Do we have enough visitor attractions to attract repeat visitors?  What are we doing to address that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.685" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800010#N00400"><p>Most of the issues I wanted to raise have already been raised, so I will not go back over them.  I thank the delegates for very positive presentations.  Tourism and the revenue it produces are very important for our economy.  That is well acknowledged and I commend everybody involved in contributing to that success.  As the delegates know better than most, we need to continuously evaluate that success and see where we can make further improvements.  I will try to touch on those and make some general comments.</p><p>  I mention tourism ambassadors, their role and how they can be utilised to best effect.  Some time ago, the Minister announced that the former astronaut Chris Hadfield from Canada had been engaged to try to bring some international attention to Irish tourism and what it can offer, which I welcome.  He has a very high profile.  Recently, the Kardashians visited Ireland, which in its own way placed a spotlight on Ireland and what it can offer.  Will the delegates comment on that?</p><p>  Coming from Waterford in the south east, I must mention the Viking triangle, which has been supported and is developing into a very successful tourism product.  I thank everyone for their support in that regard.  There are many volunteer ambassadors who come from the community.  They volunteer their time and they train and educate themselves on what the city and the region has to offer.  They go out on a voluntary basis, co-ordinated by the local authority.  Their role is so important and should be encouraged.  Perhaps the delegates might comment on their respective roles within the whole tourism product and how we sell ourselves.  The VAT rates have been covered, so I will not go over that again.</p><p>  The regional benefit and the regional spread in capacity concerns me.  Along with colleagues from the regions, I spend a lot of time in Dublin and see the pressures at the various stages throughout the season, and there is no doubt Dublin has capacity issues.  There is so much potential to spread that out to the regions with the development of motorways and better access to the regions.  I agree with my colleague who mentioned people in the corporates and that we get those employees out to the regions at weekends and at other times as there is so much to offer in the regions.  </p><p>  We commend all those involved in the Wild Atlantic Way, but we have very important tourism initiatives in our regions.  In my region, we have the Deise Greenway and the Mount Congreve Gardens.  We also have the Comeragh Mountains and the coastline, and the weather is often better than in other parts of the country.  We must encapsulate all of that.  I do not expect the delegates' organisations to do the groundwork but I expect them to try to co-ordinate all that is positive about the regions and to get more tourists into them.  I would be interested to hear what other regional initiatives they might have.  The Wild Atlantic Way and the huge push there was mentioned.  This is welcome and it must happen, but I would like to see further strategies to develop other areas.</p><p>  I have a special interest in Canada and I was delighted to hear that somebody from Tourism Ireland - I think the CEO - has gone to Canada.  There are huge links between Waterford and Canada in terms of tourism opportunities, including through the Newfoundland links, which have been developed to some degree.  I understand new air links have been established from Toronto to Dublin and from St. John's to Dublin.  I would be interested to hear how we can develop them and perhaps push the people coming from those areas into the regions.  Waterford is the Canada county because of the huge cultural and heritage links that exist between the two locations.  I would like to hear whether there are any initiatives to try to develop potential in that area.  </p><p>  The mobile 35s, or people in that age group - people with young families or people who might want to get away for a short break - were mentioned.  The work done in advertising was mentioned but the UK is a huge market on our doorstep.  There are ready-made links through the regional airports.  Waterford has a link with Manchester and Birmingham and there are other opportunities with London.  Rosslare Harbour is also on our doorstep.</p> <p>Are there any new initiatives under way to get people into the regions using the doorstep access that is already there?  The value for money available in the regions and the family attractions on offer provide opportunities for further development.</p><p> Value for money was mentioned earlier and I presume the tourism organisations conduct customer satisfaction, repeat visit and exit surveys with those who visit Ireland.  I ask the witness to provide some information on that.  Niche tourism development is very important.  Food festivals were mentioned in that regard and there are some very successful food festivals in my own area, including the Waterford and Dungarvan food festivals.  Cycling tourism has grown exponentially in recent years and we have some beautiful cycling routes here.  The Sean Kelly cycling festival is held in Dungarvan every year and attracts almost 7,000 cyclists.  That success can be repeated in other areas of the country.  Orienteering, surfing, food and greenways are all niche areas that can be further developed.  Cultural heritage also offers opportunities.  I know that Mr. Matthews previously worked with the Heritage Council and has a great understanding of that whole area but I believe it is an untapped resource in Ireland, even though some great work is being done.  I come from a place called Portlaw which was a planned industrial town that had a population in excess of 5,000 a century and a half ago.  Now there are only 1,500 people living there.  Those who left are in various parts of the world and we need to try to attract them back to discover their cultural roots.  There are enormous opportunities in that regard and I am sure the witnesses are well aware of that.  We could develop this aspect of tourism further through modern technology, websites and applications.  We could also develop more tangible linkages on the ground.</p><p> There are enormous opportunities for this small country and we are ahead of the posse thanks to the great work being done by Tourism Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and others.  That said, there is a lot more to do.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  The discussion this morning has been very positive and I commend the work of the various organisations represented here.  It is excellent to see a sector on an upward trajectory given the fact that in recent years most sectors were on a downward one.  I must also acknowledge the work of our Minister in shaping policy direction.  Initiatives like the 9% VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality industry, the travel tax and The Gathering have had a very positive impact.  I see the importance of the 9% VAT rate to tourism in Kerry every day.  I meet people who are now in jobs who would not be working were it not for that initiative.  It is a measure which I fought hard to retain in the last budget and hope it will be retained into the future.  In fact, it should be extended to other sectors.  It is a beacon for the rest of the economy and shows how a proactive tax policy can actually generate benefits which outweigh any losses.</p><p>  I welcome the development of the Wild Atlantic Way.  I live on it and am very excited about it.  It is giving peripheral areas which would not have previously benefited from tourism a chance to do so.  It encourages people not just to pass through such areas but to stop and add value to local economies.  I acknowledge the co-operation of F&aacute;ilte Ireland with regard to Cloghane and Brandon on the Dingle Peninsula in west Kerry, which were not initially on the Wild Atlantic Way route but work is now under way to include them, which I appreciate.</p><p>  In terms of marketing, I have a suggestion which may sound a little off the wall.  Bearing in mind that the UK market is on our doorstep and the Wild Atlantic Way is ideal for driving holidays, I e-mailed the BBC a couple of weeks ago suggesting that it do a "Top Gear" special on the Wild Atlantic Way.  It would be a fantastic way to showcase the Wild Atlantic Way, not just to the UK market but to markets all over the world.  "Top Gear" has a huge cult following and an enormous global audience.  I know that people will respond to that and say we do not want so-called boy racers coming over here, but realistically those who could afford to come here to drive the Wild Atlantic Way would be in the higher end of the market.  It would be hoped they would have a little more sense and know better than to speed around those roads.  A "Top Gear" special would be a fantastic way to showcase our western coast.  In that context, I would ask for the support of the tourism agencies-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.690" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1051" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800011#O00500"><p>I did not get a positive response, unfortunately.  I got an acknowledgment all right but I suspect mine was one of 1 million e-mails sent to the BBC that day.  Perhaps the tourism organisations would have a bit more weight than a humble Deputy from south Kerry.  I ask that they would follow up on that because it would be an excellent opportunity for us and would constitute free advertising.</p><p>  I hold constituency clinics in places like Dingle, Killarney and Kenmare, and in the winter time there is a serious drop in visitor numbers, despite the fact that local communities do their best to organise events and activities that will attract visitors.  I have always believed that Ireland has as much, if not more, to offer in the winter months than in the peak summer season.  I note that Scotland has been aggressively marketing itself as a winter tourism destination in recent years.  Indeed, such is the success of the campaign that I went there myself to see what is on offer, and while I was impressed, I believe we have as much, if not more, to offer.  More could be done to try to boost our winter tourism performance, thus creating sustainable employment throughout the year, particularly outside Dublin.</p><p>  Deputy Coffey referred to return visitors and I remember reading recently that we are not performing as well other comparable markets, such as Scotland, in this regard.  How can we improve that?  I love talking to tourists and will do so whenever I meet them in Killarney, Killorglin or elsewhere, to get their feedback.  I have very rarely met anyone who was not happy here and who was not having a good experience, and yet we are not getting as many return visits as we could be.  How do we deal with that issue because it does not seem to be based on a satisfaction deficit?  What is the problem and how can we do better in that regard?</p><p>  I wish to acknowledge the proactive approach to developing greenways.  I travelled the Westport to Achill greenway last year and it is fantastic.  It has had an enormous impact on the local economy and is very impressive.  I am very excited about the development of the greenway from Glenbeigh to Reenard.  An investment of almost &euro;4 million over the next two years will enable the development of a world class greenway.  It will be an iconic greenway and images of its way-covers, viaducts and tunnels will be on postcards, posted on Facebook and will travel the world.  It will be something special and I acknowledge the vision in pursuing that project.  I hope many more such projects will be undertaken.  My vision for the future would be a national cycling network whereby one could get on a bike at the airport at Dublin, Knock, Cork or Kerry and cycle anywhere in the country without have to travel on a main road for very long.  We should pursue such a vision.</p><p>  There is huge potential in angling too.  While many anglers visit Kerry, most have told me that more could be done for them.  Are there any efforts being made to develop a cruise industry here?  There is no company currently offering an around Ireland cruise to the best of my knowledge, but we have the facilities in place and a coastline that could be travelled in a week to ten days.  Could that be examined as a new product and as something that would showcase our coastline?  There are many towns and villages along our coast which would fight for the opportunity to bring in cruise tourists.</p><p>  On the subject of marketing, a number of years ago the US state of California used some very high-profile people to promote tourism, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rob Lowe and others.  Could we look a doing something similar here?  We certainly have numerous figures who would be well known and, more important, well liked internationally.  Is consideration being given to an advertising campaign that might grab the attention of those who might never have paid attention to Ireland's tourism marketing message before?</p><p>  I wish to mention an idea I had in the context of 2015 or, more realistically, 2016.</p> <p>Building on the back of The Gathering which was a major success and which brought activity and a much-needed lift psychologically to nearly every community in the country, could we look at the idea of a home gathering, aimed at getting people to holiday at home in 2016?  I know there is a campaign every year for people to holiday at home but could we make a massive effort to say to people that 2016 is the year that we holiday at home and organise events that would attract people to stay in the country?  Is this an idea that could be looked at, given that we have a high level of overseas travel from Ireland each year?  If we were to get 10% of the expenditure on overseas travel, it would come close to &euro;1 billion, as I understand from research.   Is this an idea that would be considered?</p></speech>

Many communities did fantastic work in 2013 and because it was so successful it would be wrong for it to end completely.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is putting funding into the initiative but it is being run by the local authorities around the country.  The money is used for funding communities and groups who will try to continue to organise The Gathering type events over the next three years.  It is trying to build on the legacy.</p></speech>

In fact, I am sure that is what is happening.  The local authorities were very important partners on the ground with us in the events of The Gathering.  There was a feeling that it was a very useful vehicle and that we should continue to work with the local authorities.</p><p>  On the question of home holidays and price offerings, we cannot get involved in the area of pricing but we are highlighting good value.  On the F&aacute;ilte Ireland home market website, one will find an area dedicated to special offers.  We are advertising some of these offerings in newspapers so that people will know there is some fantastic value in areas of the home market in spite of what we were saying earlier.  </p><p>  Deputy Coffey referred to the south and east and I will ask my colleague, Mr. Paddy Mathews to deal with that and an alternative to the Wild Atlantic Way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-06-18a.698" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paddy Mathews" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014061800012#P00800"><p>The idea behind the Wild Atlantic Way was to aggregate all the various destinations along the west coast to an offering that had scale and singularity and would be more visible overseas.  There were approximately 35 different driving routes along the west coast, with only three of them crossing a county boundary, making them very local and not really visible.  That was the unifying idea behind the Wild Atlantic Way.  There is very clear evidence that this will be very successful, we are looking to apply the same thinking to the south and the east as well.  It will not necessarily manifest itself in a single route.  That was quite a bespoke solution for the west coast, as most of the areas were along the coast and were easily linked up with a single route.  There is a more dispersed richness within the south and the east, with the core attractions in inland towns balanced with the very strong coastal richness as well.  The solution will be slightly different and we are not sure how it will manifest itself but we are focusing very intently on the south and east with the idea that we need to group and aggregate the very rich heritage that is within the Viking triangle as the Deputy mentioned, the new medieval mile in Kilkenny, the grand tour in Kildare and Wicklow, the prehistoric riches in the Boyne Valley and Cork Harbour.  There are areas between them such as the Blackstairs Mountains and the Barrow Valley in Carlow and the Comeragh Mountains.  We are looking at the theme of culture and heritage and how we can group them together for overseas marketing so that they get the scale and singularity.  It helps Tourism Ireland to get a clearer focus and a clearer resolution on what that area has to offer.  Once people get there, the diversity that exists can be made more apparent.  There is a very clear focus on this.  We are working with international consultants on helping us shape that proposition and we hope that will be more evident in the third quarter of this year.  There is a very strong piece of work being done on this area.  There will be two very strong propositions, the Wild Atlantic Way and the other dealing with the south and east.  The detail has not emerged just yet, but I think we are on the right track.</p></speech>

We wholly agree with having volunteer ambassadors as evidenced by The Gathering.  We talk about marketing and big grants for events but the real power of The Gathering was what volunteers and communities did on the ground.  We are finding this year when we are hosting meetings up and down the country on the Wild Atlantic Way, the local communities are coming out.  The people are not necessarily in the tourist trade alone.  I do not know to what extent tourism has been successful in the past in harnessing the power of volunteer ambassadors and I think it is an area in which we need to do much better.  There are no two ways about that.</p><p>  On the question of value for money surveys, these surveys are completed for us independently by third parties.  We have a number of surveys that track value for money.  I do not have the figures in front of me today, but in relation to value for money ratings for the German and the French markets, they are at their highest rating since we joined the euro.  Even in Britain and North America, where there is a currency issue, and that can affect value for money, that has turned around and been quite positive.  I can get the Deputy some specific details on those surveys.</p><p>  Deputy Griffin raised the idea of having a home gathering campaign.  Let me give some credit to the Irish punter.  Since the downturn there has been quite a decline in the amount of money that Irish people are spending on holidays, but virtually all of that decline has been in overseas trips.  The Irish punter has supported the tourism industry and it is important that it should be said. </p><p>  As we said earlier in the discussion, we should not take our eyes off the ball.  it is a very valuable market, it is &euro;1 billion on our doorstep.  It is not seasonal.  It is a very long season.  One of the concerns is that if the domestic market were to weaken, it weakens the shoulder, which in turn can weaken the investment that is made, as one would not be getting the great utilisation of the assets through the year.  Jobs could be at risk.  This is really important.</p><p>  There were some issues around the Wild Atlantic Way or Greenway.</p></speech>

So far we have received no negative feedback.  Perhaps all the tourist have not arrived yet, but to date there has been no particular negative feedback from overseas.  Weather was an extreme event across the Continent this year.</p> <p>Therefore, they might forgive us if not everything is perfect when they arrive. </p><p> The Deputy also asked about digital marketing, specifically the use of smart cameras.  The opportunity we see in this area arises when tourists here use their cameras, thereby giving us the opportunity to take and use the pictures they post in our social media promotion.  Most of the imagery we use in social media - we post lovely photos of Ireland every day of the week - is material we do not produce ourselves.  We do not go out and take photographs but use material other people, including ordinary tourists, have posted.  Often these are the best shots.  People post lovely images and we see these as authentic.</p><p> On some of the issues raised by Deputy Coffey, our board was in Waterford last week enjoying the wonders of the Viking triangle.  The board was given a briefing on the ambassador programme that evening.  There seems to be very positive sentiment from the industry there in regard to the year to date.  I will link his question on tourism ambassadors with the question raised by Deputy Griffin.  I guess we are talking about celebrities here, such as the Kardashians and Chris Hadfield.  Very few of our Irish celebrities have international fame across all of our markets.  In other words, somebody who is famous in America might not be known in France.  There are not a huge number of Irish celebrities who have the same degree of fame as Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Therefore, we have tended to work with celebrities relevant to different markets.  For example, we have worked with Chris O'Dowd in Britain and the United States, where he is known.  Recently we worked with Andrew Maxwell in Britain as he is well known there.  We have used our well-known golfers, mainly to target golfers who would know their names internationally.  Therefore, we have used social media and publicity to work with people from time to time, where their diaries allow and where they are willing to do something for us, often for free to help out Ireland Inc.</p><p> In the context of people like Chris Hadfield or some of the international celebrities who were here, or the Kardashians, we work with them where possible.  We worked with Tom Cruise last year and highlighted his Irish heritage.  It is hard to sign up those international celebrities as regular ambassadors, but we make the most of these opportunities when celebrities are here.  We are working proactively with a range of different people, from the Irish Film Board to the national cultural institutions, who have links with or see opportunities in regard to celebrities coming to Ireland, and we try to make the most of that.  Some other film companies are in touch with us also from time to time.  These opportunistic occasions are wonderful and we have built a kind of internal commando team ready to avail of these opportunities when we see them.  For example, when it was apparent that the Kardashians were here, within 24 hours we had a social media video and press pack going international.  We set ourselves up to be being able to respond quickly when these opportunities arrive, which often tend to be social media opportunities.</p><p> Roots tourism was mentioned and it was in that context we were working with Tom Cruise last year.  We set up an Irish family history page on Facebook last year, primarily to highlight the roots gatherings that were happening last year - the clan gatherings and different events.  That page proved to be hugely popular and we sustained it beyond the year of The Gathering and have changed it into a broader roots-tourism-diaspora Facebook page.  It now has more than 230,000 followers globally, all people who are tracing their Irish ancestry.  We have worked with the national  institutions, the library and so on to highlight their collections.  Not only those; we have also worked with the Irish Family History Foundation and some of the commercial businesses such as Find My Past and other organisations with genealogy products who can help ground people's general sense.  Perhaps their great grandfather was Irish, but they are not sure from where and we can help them.  We have held expert sessions where people who are able to say that their relatives are from a particular parish, which helps ground their particular interest in the geography, are given follow-up information on what to come and see and do in, for example, County Laois, if that is where their ancestry lies.  We are also leading the charge on a national diaspora centre, which would be a positive contribution to the ancestry-roots-tourism story when this comes to fruition.</p><p> Deputy Griffin mentioned seasonality and spoke about how Scotland targeted him.  We do the same.  We target Scots, and the whole of Britain, to come to Ireland in the winter.  We have been targeting many of the social energisers to get them to come here off season, particularly for events.  We do a lot of work, for example, with TradFest every January to try to get people over from Britain and further afield in Europe where there is direct access throughout the winter.  Events are an important reason for coming in the winter season.  We also have a new focus in North America, in the USA and Canada, where there is now year-round access.  This may not be for a weekend, but we promote a five-day break in the off season.  This is a new focus for us in 2014, starting in the autumn, and will continue in 2015.</p></speech>

This summer we will see an increase of 60% or 70% in the number of flight seats available.  The WestJet service from Newfoundland launched this week.  This is its first European route.  The Dublin Airport Authority saw the opportunity based on many of the historic links mentioned, and we worked closely with it to secure this route for Ireland.  WestJet is on record as saying the service is 90% sold out already, a bit of a phenomenon in the aviation industry, and it has extended the season twice.  This is a good news story from that part of Canada to Ireland.  Aer Lingus has also launched a Toronto-Dublin Air Canada route, a new low-cost model.  Air Canada has extended its season and its transatlantic flights are continuing.  Therefore, there is good potential.  We have increased our investment to Canada this year to maximise those opportunities.  There is evidence that there was frustrated demand.  People want to come to Ireland and this is their opportunity.</p><p>  Deputy Coffey also asked about sea access.  We have extensive corporate campaigns with Irish Ferries and Stena in both the British and European markets.  Car-touring visitors are very important as they stay longer and tend to visit more of the island of Ireland.  Much of the work on the Wild Atlantic Way and the initiatives mentioned by Mr. Mathews in regard to extending the touring routes will ensure the success of this for the next few years, but sea access continues to be important.  This year, two new sea access routes were launched, which, while unusual, is welcome - routes to Europe and an extension of the services between Dublin and Great Britain.</p><p>  Deputy Griffin asked about trying to get publicity for the Wild Atlantic Way on "Top Gear".  This brings us back to the question asked earlier about return on investment.  We invested just over &euro;2 million in publicity last year and generated &euro;280 million worth of equivalent advertising value, so this is an area of focus for us.  We are knocking down doors for a number of high-profile programmes from Great Britain to come here.  I think "Top Gear" will have to give in eventually, such is the number of requests it is receiving.  An example of success in this area is Germany where ARD, the RTE equivalent in Germany, did a one-hour documentary in its prime time Sunday evening slot on the Wild Atlantic way.  This is an example of how well this is resonating in the overseas markets.  We hope to have a number of other high-profile TV programmes, because the Wild Atlantic Way lends itself completely to TV as a way of selling it.</p></speech>

Given the scale of the Wild Atlantic Way, we do not anticipate that any visitor will complete the route in one go.  Therefore, the objective is to give them reasons to return time and again and do a chunk of it at a time.  In a similar way to the Camino de Santiago, we are looking at a passport initiative and how people can get this passport stamped having completed a section of the Wild Atlantic Way.  In regard to lengthening or extending the season, some initiatives, particularly along the Wild Atlantic Way, such as whale and dolphin watching, are at their best from October until March.  That provides an opportunity to attract landscape and wildlife enthusiasts or bird watchers.  We are looking at experiences, themes and products that will attract people out of season so that we are not dependent on the core season.</p><p>  On publicity and an initiative similar to the "Top Gear" initiative, we currently have the chief executive and European director of the Adventure Travel Trade Association, the most prominent industry grouping for adventure and activity providers, in Ireland.  They arrived yesterday and are travelling the Wild Atlantic Way by Harley-Davidson.  They are leaving Kinsale this morning and heading west and up along the coast.  They have a huge social media campaign around this visit, tweeting to their members about Ireland, activity, adventure and the Wild Atlantic Way.  We will also host their annual summit in Killarney in October, for the first time ever, which will attract 600 media representatives and buyers of activity and adventure products.</p></speech>

It is called multi-tasking.  I appreciate that Deputy McLellan took over on my behalf.</p><p>  Every Deputy and Senator understands how precious tourism is to this nation.  We need to make it easy for people to come here, we need to provide good facilities for them when they are here and we need to eliminate obstacles to their getting here and enjoying themselves.  If I might be parochial, there is a perception that there is a lack of tourism investment in the place I live.  I live in north Leitrim and I am referring to Sligo and all of Leitrim.  We have the most wonderful scenery, with a beautiful landscape including hills, mountains valleys, glens and beaches.  We have culture, music and the arts.  We have everything.  We have an easygoing way of life, and perhaps that is at the nub of it all.  Perhaps we are little too easygoing.  When I travel around parts of the country I nearly burst into tears when I see the obvious investment in the tourism infrastructure in other areas.  There is no hotel in north Leitrim.  There was a hotel there up to two years ago but it is now dilapidated.  It could be restored to be a beautiful hotel.  It is in Dromahair in north Leitrim, close to the banks of Lough Gill near Parkes Castle.  It would be a huge asset.  The community wanted to take it over but we do not have a model to allow that type of community investment in our tourism industry.  We are a little laid back and easygoing.</p><p>  A number of people who are involved in the tourism industry in the county have set up a small co-operative.  They are examining different ways to promote tourism, not only in Leitrim but as part of the Wild Atlantic Way.  They have developed the Wild Atlantic butterfly route, with which the witnesses may be familiar.  They have some wonderful concepts, looking at tourism promotion in a slightly different way.  I would like the witnesses to meet representatives of that co-operative at some stage and I will follow up with them on that.  They talked about volunteer ambassadors, but the best ambassadors we can have for tourism are those who will benefit from the results of their efforts.  I will pursue with them the possibility of meeting those representatives at some stage in the near future.  I have asked those representatives to put their thoughts in writing before they meet the witnesses.  On a positive note, the Fleadh Cheoil will be held in Sligo this August, which is a great event.  We love that one.  </p><p>  People might say that I am being parochial in raising the issue of fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, but I am not.  The witnesses might say it is not their business, but it is.  There are far too many organisations and State agencies who are sitting on the fence on this matter and all because the EPA is doing some research into fracking.  Tourism organisations should be extremely concerned about even the possibility of fracking in to the north west of Ireland.  Irish Water, the agrifood industry and many other industries should be concerned about it.  Everybody is saying that it is not their call as it is not within the scope of their job description.  If the EPA says that fracking can be safe provided it is well managed and controlled, one thing is sure: we will not have any overseas tourists coming to this country to look at fracking paths, and why would they come?  If fracking comes to Ireland, we will find that tourists will not come here full stop.  I would not go over to Texas to have a look at an oil rig over there.  The short-term gain, if any, from fracking gas anywhere on the island of Ireland would forever be lost when account is taken of the damage that would be done to the landscape.  The representatives and agencies such as theirs need to influence the Government and point out the risks to the tourism industry.  Aside from the safety aspect of it, as the EPA will come up with a report on that, if our landscape is damaged, the agencies represented will not have a product to sell because tourists will not come here.  The witnesses need to say that loudly and clearly.</p></speech>

As the project develops, we are looking at having a number of spurs and loops off the route, and north Leitrim will figure very much in this.  Leitrim and Sligo will tell the whole Yeats story and there are the associations there as well.  I have also been informed in the past week about the wild salmon product and we are examining how we can exploit and capitalise on that at the confluence of two rivers on the Leitrim coastline.</p><p>  Deputy Colreavy mentioned the Fleadh Cheoil, which will be a great boost for Sligo this summer and for the next two years.  We will be showcasing traditional culture along the Wild Atlantic Way in Sligo and developing digital material that we can showcase and share with international audiences after the fact.</p></speech>

We have never shied away from making our views known on a number of high-profile cases, particularly when we feel that tourism is under threat.  The Deputy is absolutely right in saying that fracking is our business, because tourism is our business.  It is something on which we will be forming a view in the very near future.  We have had many representatives from individuals and groups both in Leitrim and Clare on this issue because those are the two areas that seem to be the focus with regard to fracking.  I am well aware of the EPA research that is under way, and it is limited in its scope, but we will be forming a view in the near future on the likely implications of fracking for tourism and we will be communicating that to Government through the appropriate channels as well.  Anything that has the potential to affect the quality, character or integrity of the raw material of tourism is something we would be very concerned about, and the raw material in Ireland is very much our landscape, culture and heritage.  It is on that that we trade.  I do not want to prejudice the conclusion of our investigations, but the Deputy can rest assured that we will look at that over the coming months and form a view on it.</p></speech>

We have done something similar with wind farms in the past, where we have undertaken visitor surveys and formed a view based on visitor perceptions of wind farms and their views on them.  Anything we state in any submission we make in the planning realm must be evidence-based.</p></speech>

It said:<blockquote><br />The Wild Atlantic Way is a fantastic initiative but there has been no focus at all on the 435 pubs that provide quality food, accommodation and entertainment along the route.  This is indicative of a new approach within F&aacute;ilte Ireland that seeks to ignore the vital role of family businesses associated with alcohol in the Irish brand that tourists from all over the world seek out when they visit Ireland.  </blockquote>The group goes on to mention some 35,000 people employed in the whisky industry in Scotland.

The Guinness Storehouse is the No. 1 tourist attraction in Ireland and such attractions form part of our planning.
