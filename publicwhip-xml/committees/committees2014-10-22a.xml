    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sin&eacute;ad Brett" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014102200004#E00200"><p>On behalf of the Catholic Primary Schools Management Association and its member schools, I thank the Chair and the committee for the opportunity to make this short presentation this afternoon.  I am accompanied by Ms Spring, who is chairperson of CPSMA.  First, I acknowledge the great working relationship that the CPSMA enjoyed with the previous Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, and that it continues to enjoy with the current Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, together with her officials, namely Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General; Mr. Martin Hanevy, assistant secretary; and Mr. Kevin McCarthy, assistant secretary, to name but a few.<br/>The Irish primary education system is dependent on local voluntary effort with regard to management.  Boards of management are a wonderful example of volunteerism through the commitment of approximately 20,000 members to the management of Catholic primary schools.  These members receive no pay, travel expenses or subsistence.  This is a very notable example of local participatory democracy.  These schools are very well managed at very little cost to the State.  This is an achievement that should be applauded and rewarded at a time when political leaders are calling on the public service to deliver more for less.<br/>The functions of the board of management are set out in section 15 of the Education Act 1998.  Section 15(1) states: &quot;It shall be the duty of a board to manage the school on behalf of the Patron and for the benefit of the students and their parents and to provide or cause to be provided an appropriate education for each student at the school for which that board has responsibility.&quot; <i></i>This is the board&rsquo;s main function.<br/>The provision for the funding of education was given statutory recognition in the 1998 Education Act.  The funding of primary schools has been based primarily on the capitation grant.  The capitation grant is paid in two moieties, 70% in January, based on enrolment on 30 September of the previous academic year, with the remaining 30% paid the following June.  The capitation grant to primary schools has been progressively cut over successive budgets.  In 2010 the capitation grant was &euro;200 per pupil, but as a result of successive cuts it currently stands at &euro;170 per pupil.  The reduction of &euro;30 per pupil has had a major negative financial impact on schools.<br/>The minor works grant, which was paid annually to schools, was to be used by boards for ongoing maintenance such as roof repairs and repainting.  The minor works grant was based on a minimum payment of &euro;5,500 per school plus &euro;18.50 per mainstream pupil and &euro;74 for each pupil with special educational needs.  The minor works grant issued to schools in November 2011 for the 2011 and 2012 school year but the grant was withdrawn in 2012.  It was reinstated in November 2013 for the 2013-2014 school year.  The Minister has indicated that the grant will only be paid in future years as funding permits.  The loss of the minor works grant has had a major impact on primary schools.  The minor works grant enabled schools to stay afloat until the next instalment of the capitation grant was made.  In effect, schools were using the minor works grant to meet the day-to-day expenses involved in the running the school.  Cuts in grants or schemes imposed by the Department have a negative impact on boards of management in the exercise of their statutory functions.  Boards of management need the Department to reinstate funding to primary schools to previous levels to enable them to carry out their statutory functions and ensure the best educational outcome for the pupils attending such schools.<br/>An announcement of an increase to the pupil-teacher ratio was made as part of the 2012 budget.  This increase is having a negative impact on school communities-----</p></speech>

Amalgamation of schools could be an option for school communities to consider.  Currently, there is no protocol for a board of management to follow where it is considering amalgamation as a possible option.  Amalgamation is only possible where it is considered an appropriate and acceptable solution for the local community.  Currently, there are no incentives for schools to amalgamate.</p><p>  With regard to the work of boards of management, boards are becoming more alarmed and frustrated at the amount of work and the level of responsibility that is being imposed by the Department on voluntary members of boards of management nationwide.  For example, boards are expected to be familiar with and comply with the onerous requirements of the relevant contracts tax regime and reverse-charge VAT.  The consequences of non-compliance are severe, with penalties and surcharges being imposed by the Revenue Commissioners.</p><p>  Boards of management have worked extremely hard on numeracy and literacy initiatives.  The results of standardised tests were forwarded to the Department in good faith on the understanding that such results would be used only for the purpose of assessing literacy and numeracy standards.  Boards were most disappointed to learn that these results may now be used to reduce resource teaching and learning support staff in their schools.  Such action does not serve to build a good relationship of confidence and trust between the Department and boards of management.</p><p>  Boards of management spend years developing good relationships with the parents of children attending the schools.  The Department recently sent the Primary School Profile Questionnaire 2014 to schools to collect data to establish the social context of each school, which it was to use in considering potential revisions to the existing system of allocating resource teaching or learning support resources to schools.  Boards of management were alarmed at the information being sought from the schools.  Examples included details of parents' employment status, local authority housing, medical cards and social welfare payments.  Such intrusion into the personal life of parents places school management in an invidious position and damages the partnership between parents and school management.  Surely such information could be sought through other channels without the necessity of involving the school?</p><p>  The Department intends to roll out the primary online database in April 2015.  Chairpersons of boards of management contacted the CPSMA to voice their concerns, alarm and outrage at the information they were expected to obtain from parents.  Chairpersons were also concerned at the increased clerical workload that the imposition of the database would impose on schools without the provision of any additional resources by the Department.</p><p>  The commitment, dedication and hard work of approximately 20,000 volunteer members of boards of management should be acknowledged, applauded and appreciated.  I take this opportunity to thank members of boards of management of primary schools for their continuing excellent work.</p></speech>

I am the secretary of the General Synod Board of Education of the Church of Ireland, which is the body within the Church of Ireland's structures that has responsibility for the Church&rsquo;s education policy.  In that capacity the board represents the interests of the Church of Ireland in education.  It provides an advisory service to boards of management in Church of Ireland primary schools and also to the ten Church of Ireland school patrons at primary level.  The joint managerial body is responsible for advising Protestant second level schools on school management issues.  I am joined here this afternoon by Ms Joyce Perdue, who is the principal of Rathfarnham national school and who is also a member of our General Synod Board of Education.</p><p>  As the Committee is aware, the current term of boards of management at primary level expires in November 2015.  We welcome today&rsquo;s meeting as a timely opportunity to reflect on the role and functions of boards of management in running our primary schools.  An important starting point from our perspective is to highlight that each of the 1,300 board of management members, with approximately 20,000 nationally, give their time entirely voluntarily.  This amounts to a significant commitment of the personal time, which is given freely by each individual to the service of their local community through being involved in their local school. This is a level of commitment and engagement that ought to be acknowledged by all of us today.  Those volunteers serve on boards which operate in an increasingly complex legislative and legal environment, with ever-increasing levels of responsibility.  It should come as no surprise to members of the committee to learn that despite the high levels of local commitment to schools, it can be a challenge at times to get people to serve on boards of management.</p><p>  As we are all aware, boards of management have come a long way from the days when the local national school was run by a single manager, usually the parish priest, appointed by the patron.  The Education Act 1998 codified the development of boards of management and placed them on a legislative footing, giving them a corporate identity.  In the context of the provision of Irish education, it is important not to underestimate the significance this structural change made to the role of the school in the local community.  Responsibility for the running of the school cannot be abrogated to some other entity, either church or State, but rests with that particular group drawn from the school itself and local community.  It is also worth noting in passing that this is in harmony with international best practice across the world in terms of school governance.</p><p>  This is not of course to suggest that schools are unaccountable or can operate in a singular fashion.  They are subject to the oversight of their patron for the general management of the school.  They are subject to inspection by the inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills through both whole-school evaluation and school self-evaluation.  In the context of compliance, boards are bound by the circulars of the Department of Education and Skills in nearly every aspect of school life and are subject to national agreements on various management policies as agreed between the teacher unions, the relevant management body and the Department of Education and Skills.</p> <p>They are also of course subject to the law and can be sued.  Should it be necessary, any board member can be removed by the patron and the board itself can be dissolved.  The primary legislation regulating the operations of Irish schools is of course the Education Act 1998 but schools are also subject to a variety of other pieces of legislation listed in my submission to the committee.  Therefore, boards of management at both primary and secondary level operate within a highly complex legal context.  The Education Act 1998 marked the first codifying of the provision of education in Ireland, putting it on a statuary footing.  Prior to this, the primary source for the provision of education in Ireland was the Stanley letter of 1831.  The regulation of the management of primary and secondary schools has developed into a complex regulatory area in a short period. </p><p> The board of management of a primary school does not work in isolation.  There are a variety of external groups and bodies who interact with the school such as visiting teachers, other principals, the HSE, the HAS, the Department of Education and Skills, the Irish National Teachers Organisation, the Irish Primary Principals Network, the National Parents Council, the relevant management body, the National Educational Welfare Board, school suppliers, and the local parish and clergy.  The composition of boards of management reflects both the internal and external nature of the relationships within the life of the school community.  The board has representatives of the patron, elected nominees from the school's teaching staff, parents of children in the school and others drawn from the local community.  The membership of boards is therefore finely balanced between all members of the school community.</p><p> The central message we try to get across to board members in our training sessions is that, once appointed, all members of the board must leave behind the individual constituencies from which they have either been nominated or elected onto the board and work together as one unit.  This can be a difficult concept to grasp as some boards might feel an obligation to either bring matters to the board on behalf of their electors or to report back to their electors on the outcome of matters raised at board meetings.  We are clear with boards that this is not an acceptable practice given that all members of the board have an equal collective responsibility for the running on the school.</p><p> Within the school community, there are key relationships that are essential to supporting the educational development of pupils.  Good staff relationships among the teaching staff, SNAs, secretarial and caretaking staff are also of vital importance in ensuring that a proper learning environment is created and maintained.  Ongoing communication with parents about the progress of their child is the priority relationship for all schools.  A large body of academic research internationally underpins this.  As any teacher will attest, there is a well-charted correlation between the support a child gets at home and educational progress.</p><p> Communications are also important where difficulties arise between parents and the teacher or the school in regard to the experience of their child.  Members of the committee will be aware that there is a procedure for dealing with complaints by parents.  The procedure was agreed between the INTO and management bodies a number of year ago.  There is a provision, section 28 of the Education Act 1998, for the Minister to make regulations in relation to the resolving of disputes and grievances in schools.  In that connection, the former Minister for Education and Skills indicated on a number of occasions that he was exploring the possibility of a parents&rsquo; charter.  Boards of management will be interested to see the proposals for this concept, especially given that two elected parents already sit on every board of management.  Boards are already accountable to the patron, Minister, inspectorate and the law.  It will be interesting to see how it interplays with existing structures.</p><p> The letter inviting us to attend this meeting mentioned the Department of Education and Skills, with which we have a good working relationship at senior level.  The feedback from schools is that the customer service from the Department is positive.</p><p> Boards of management are volunteers who give free of their time out of a sense of dedication and service to their local community and school.  The model of local boards of management running local schools for the local community is one which we, as a nation, should be proud of.  In the case of the Church of Ireland, it reflects very closely our system for the running of parishes through select vestries and it is a model with which we are comfortable.  We thank the committee for the invitation to attend and look forward to trying to answer any questions.</p></speech>

My colleague, Ms Elizabeth Kirwan, is currently in the INTO head office but is a teacher in St. Luke's national school in Tyrrelstown, Dublin.  I acknowledge the constructive relationships we had with previous Ministers, the current Minister, Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and the officials of the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>  The relationship between boards of management and the Department of Education and Skills is determined by their respective functions.  These functions are governed by the Education Acts 1998 to 2013 and various other legislative provisions, the rules for national schools, Department of Education and Skills circulars, and the constitution of boards and rules of procedure.  Boards of management of primary schools ensure that schools are managed in a spirit of partnership, on behalf of the patron of the school.  Local boards ensure that local voices and concerns are reflected in the management of the school, and that the interests of pupils and their parents, staff and the community are represented. </p></speech>

In a recent High Court decision in 2013, Ms Justice Iseult O&rsquo;Malley stated that the structure by which most schools in the country are run, with a professional staff managed by a voluntary board representative of the parents, the community, the patron and the staff, is an admirable one which gives an opportunity for all those groups to participate in this most important field but that it was a model that places burdens on those involved.  The judge stated that the voluntary members of the board will often be people without any particular experience in the range of matters, from budgeting to health and safety to management of staff, for which they must take responsibility and that it is necessary for the board to respect the expertise of its staff, while ensuring that it does not abdicate its responsibilities.<br/>It is worth noting that the most recent report by the chief inspector found that in 88% of cases, in the period 2010 to 2012, the overall work of boards was satisfactory or better.  Boards of management are bodies corporate, with statutory functions, including those under sections 15 and 24 of the Education Act.

It is the INTO's position and, for the most part, experience that boards carry out their statutory functions in consultation with principals and, where necessary, the teaching staff.<br/>Primary teachers are committed to working with parents in an open and transparent manner.  It is the case that schools facilitate and encourage best practice in the promotion of home-school links, whether it be through informal discussion with parents every day on the school premises, homework journals, scheduled parent-teacher meetings, newsletters, the involvement of parents in curricular and extra-curricular activities, liaison with the parents' association and, on request, meetings with individual parents.  The extent of opportunities and channels to dialogue with parents is indicative of teachers' high regard for the role of parents in their children's education and their openness and willingness at all times to address any matter which may arise early and effectively.  In this regard, the most recent chief inspector's report stated: <blockquote>Whole-school evaluations indicate that the overall quality of most schools' communications with parents is good.  High proportions (95%) of the parents surveyed as part of the WSE process during 2010-2012 agree that schools are welcoming of them.  Inspection reports frequently note a range of other strengths in parent-school communications such as regular parent-teacher contact, school newsletters to parents and up-to-date informative school websites.  The vast majority (94%) of parents viewed positively the schools' arrangements for parent-teacher meetings. </blockquote>Where parental complaints arise, there is an established parental complaints procedure agreed between the INTO and management bodies which is utilised, where necessary.  This procedure focuses on the early and informal resolution of complaints as far as possible, while also providing a formal procedure for deciding complaints. Boards also have a statutory role in the formal stages of the disciplinary procedures for teachers prescribed under section 24(3) of the Education Act, 1998.  As has been mentioned, section 28 of the Act has not yet been commenced.  Boards of management and teachers, in particular principal teachers, have ongoing dealings with the Department on key issues such as school staffing, funding and school accommodation.  The INTO continues to lobby for improvements in these areas on behalf of the system, pupils, parents and teachers.  <br/>We echo some of the points made in the submissions.  The Department's inspectorate carries out a number of statutory functions in schools in supporting, advising and evaluating schools.  Whole school evaluations, the reports on which are published, include questionnaires for parents and pupils.  Schools are accountable to the Department both through the inspectorate and also through other statutory functions.  For example, one of the functions of the Secretary General of the Department is to establish an appeals committee for parents who wish to challenge board of management decisions on enrolment, suspension or expulsion. <br/>Similarly, schools liaise with other agencies, for example, the National Council for Special Education and-or its agents in respect of resources for children with special needs, the Child and Family Agency in respect of school attendance and child protection and the Teaching Council in respect of the registration and vetting of teachers and various educational matters.  For its part, the Teaching Council has published a code of professional conduct for teachers which the INTO fully supports.  The code emphasises the values of respect, care, professional integrity and trust on the part of teachers.  In addition, it is expected that the fitness to teach provisions of the Teaching Council Act will be commenced in the near future and entitle any person to apply to the council for an inquiry into the fitness to teach of a registered teacher.<br/>The Office of the Ombudsman for Children is entitled to inquire into a school matter when requested to do so.  In that regard, the INTO encourages schools to fully co-operate with all such inquires and-or investigations.  It notes the recommendations contained in reports by the Office of the Ombudsman for Children on improved communication between boards and parents.  This is an area which could be improved through increased training and support for boards. <br/>Boards of management comprise lay volunteers who give of their time for the sake of their local school and their children's education.  Recent years have seen an increased level of devolution of responsibilities to boards from the Department and other agencies.  Boards must be supported with appropriate training which is accessible and relevant to board members.  While the Department has provided funding for the training of boards, concerns remain about the take-up of such training.  This issue must be addressed.  Boards also require an appropriate &quot;back office&quot; in dealing with areas such as health and safety, human resource management and the management of building projects.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hubert Loftus" time="13:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014102200006#L00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Department about the role of primary school boards of management and their relationship with the Department.  The role and responsibilities of boards of management are set out in the Education Act.  A board is responsible for the overall management of a school and accountable to the patron and the Minister.  In performing its functions the board is required to operate in accordance with policies determined by the Minister.  The school principal is responsible for the day-to-day management of the school and accountable to the board for that management.</p> <p>Boards of management operate on a voluntary basis and their membership is typically drawn from the local school and its surrounding community.  Boards of management are supported with guidance documentation, advice and training provided by the relevant management bodies and the Department, and also through the work of the school principal, who typically acts as secretary to the board.</p><p> The composition of boards of management is based on centrally agreed arrangements between the relevant stakeholders.  The composition of boards of management at primary level was last changed in 1997 following consultation and agreement.  Under the revised composition the patron no longer appoints a majority of the board and provision was made for the inclusion of community representatives.  </p><p> The number of boards that have a lay chairperson is steadily increasing.  Currently, over 57% of boards have a lay chairperson.  The term of office for boards of management in primary schools is a four-year period.  The current boards of management of primary schools were formed in December 2011 and are next due to change in December 2015.  The Department has recently commenced the consultation process with the relevant stakeholders in relation to any updating that is required to the documentation that is provided to new boards of management regarding the constitution of the new boards and their rules of procedure.  This documentation includes a useful overview of the role of the board and an outline of some key activities in which effective boards of management routinely engage, such as school planning, self-evaluation, teaching and learning, and management of resources in its role as employer. </p><p> The most effective boards are those that have a clear understanding of their governance role and are fully aware of the importance of good communications with the school community, including, in particular, parents.  Changing how schools engage with, listen to and respond to parent concerns will be an important part of a parent and student charter for which the Minister plans to make provision in law as part of an amendment to section 28 of the Education Act.  Providing parents with the rationale for any decision is important.  If schools help parents to understand the basis for a decision, parents are more likely to accept the fairness of the decision.</p><p> The Department recognises that if boards are to be fully effective in their management role and are to be a real support to school principals, they need to have access to support and training themselves.  In this regard, the funding provided by the Department to the various management bodies plays an important role in the provision of training, guidance and advice to boards of management.</p><p> In summary, the Department recognises that boards, and the volunteers that serve on them, play a key role in the successful running or our schools.  The Department's approach is to guide and support the work of boards as best as possible within the constraints of our budgetary parameters.</p></speech>

I thank them for their patience in staying the course.  We appreciate their input.  I also thank the Chairman and the secretariat for facilitating the meeting.<br/>The issue of boards of management has been a bugbear of mine for some time and I have been trying to get it onto the agenda of the committee.  I come at it from a different perspective from what all the witnesses have submitted.  I appreciate that we are dealing with voluntary bodies and that their time is their own.  We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to members who populate boards of management.  I honestly believe that boards of management are one of the last bastions of Irish society on which a light needs to be shone, and a very strong light needs to be shone on some of the activities in a limited number of cases.  There are certainly cases that I as a public representative have come across about which I am greatly concerned.  The difficulty with boards of management in primary schools in particular is that they are not accountable to anybody, so far as I can ascertain.  I accept the submission from the Department of Education and Skills that the Minister can effectively dissolve a board of management, but when has that happened?  Is there any example in which that has happened?<br/>I have followed with interest cases in which parents have had issues with boards of management.  God help us all, and the parent involved, if he or she tries to take on a board of management, because effectively they are a law onto themselves.  Boards of management are entities that are wholly, totally and completely answerable to themselves alone.  When a board of management works well it is all great and good, and we all acknowledge the volunteerism.  When it goes wrong and when a decision is made in which a parent is wronged, or something happens that is not favourable to the parent, there is no avenue for that parent to get recompense or to seek justice <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the decision of a board of management. <br/>There are examples of boards of management all over the country in which the chairperson is <i>in situ</i>for 20-plus years and in which members of the board appointed by the patron are <i>in situ</i>for 20, 30 or sometimes up to 40 years.  I come to this as a former school principal.  I was secretary of a board and a member of numerous boards at second level, particularly during my time in County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  Just to focus on primary schools, the effective role and function of a school board of management is to rubber-stamp the decisions of the principal and to provide cover for the principal.  That is how it operates on a day-to-day basis.  Everybody has a hands-off attitude because they are volunteers.  We need to look at that issue, and that is what this meeting is about.  I wish to bring a focus to it.<br/>I am aware of one case, which I brought to the attention of the former Minister, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, in which there is more than &euro;100,000 owing to a supplier of goods and services by a board of management.  The supplier cannot get these moneys despite their having been paid to the board of management.  There is an issue here when something goes wrong, and that is what I am trying to get at.  I am not trying to undermine the work, the volunteerism and the spirit with which the vast majority operate.  Recently there has been emphasis on boards such as that of Rehab.  Boards of management will have to come under a similar regime.  We have to wake up and smell the coffee and, as a society, look at the real issue.  <br/>I have been in contact with the Ombudsman and have had many dealings with him to ascertain whether the actions of boards of management can be investigated.  I have also checked with the Department, its Secretary General, the Minister and the patron, and I have exhausted all avenues trying to find out where one can go with a complaint, be it legitimate or perceived, but everybody passes one around and one finds that ultimately the board of management, in its constitution, is entitled to do what it wants.  If it demands that a child should come to school standing on its head, in reality there is very little place to go with that type of complaint afterwards.  I will give an example.  Most primary school principals will use the good offices of the INTO for advice on school boards of management.  The INTO membership took offence at the JobBridge scheme introduced by the Government a couple of years ago.  Is there any one board of management across the length and breadth of the country that stated it was responsible for the decision as to who worked in its school and taught its children?  The point was made earlier that the constituent members do not represent their constituency.  However, a principal will tell a board of management that the INTO is against JobBridge and the board will back off straight away and agree not to take on anybody under the JobBridge scheme or allow any student teacher into its school.  That is proof positive that what I am talking about is a problem, unless anybody can give me an example in which a board of management did what it was supposed to do and looked at the wider interests of the school and the greater representation, not just those of the INTO members.  That is an example of a situation, of which there are many, in which boards of management are toothless and are just providing cover where something goes wrong.  In his contribution, Mr. Fennelly referred to the old days of the parish priest as manager.  We are still in the old days of the parish priest as manager but we are also in the old days of the principal as manager.  My experience for the most part is that the principal says this is how it is and the board will rubber-stamp it.  <br/>I have a couple of questions for the Department as I seek to move the debate on.  What is the position with the enactment of section 28, under which people can appeal decisions of boards in respect of admissions and so on?  What is the position with the parents' charter?  I am not trying to undermine boards of management, decry them or tar them all with the same brush, but to give parents the real, legitimate input and rights that they should have.  From my limited experience of the education system I do not believe they have such input or rights, other than in aspirational and holier-than-thou language.  They are not there in reality, and I am going to fight for parents to ensure we get them.Where are we at on the parents' charter?  Are there any data or figures available on the number of complaints sent to the Department about the actions of boards of management?  That will prove my point that they have not been investigated by the Department in 99% of cases.  Has the Department ever disbanded a board of management or removed a member of a board of management?</p> <p>I rest my case on the answers to those points.  Thank you again, Chairman, for your indulgence.</p></speech>

The Department's experience of boards of management may not be fully consistent with the views of the Deputy.  We consider that boards manage schools in a very open and transparent way.  The inspectorate's reports on boards and schools is published.  As the representative of the INTO remarked, the chief inspector's report is clear in terms of the feedback from surveys and inspections that are carried out on the quality and the management of schools by boards of management.  That is not to say there are no issues with individual boards.  I can confirm for the Deputy that there have been a small number of cases in which the Department has taken the lead in seeking the dissolution of a board of management.  That would have been on foot of a serious school inspection report.  There have been such cases.</p><p>  In total, there are more than 3,000 primary schools.  At any given time there may be ten or 20 schools that do not have a board of management.  The reasons vary.  The school may be in a start-up situation and it may be simply impractical to appoint a board at the time in question, the patron might have determined that it is not appropriate to have a board, or the board may have been dissolved based on the views of the patron; there is an element of the Act that provides for that.</p><p>  Section 28 and the matter of enrolment was raised.  Deputy Daly may be aware that the Minister proposes to go to Government with a school admissions Bill to provide a framework for school admissions.  The Minister will propose amendments to section 29 of the Education Act.  The Minister intends to put a parent and student charter on a statutory footing.  The drafting of that legislation is well advanced at the moment and the intention is for the Minister to bring it to the Government soon, in the coming weeks.</p><p>  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Tom Deegan, to make a comment on the number of complaints to the Department relating to boards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Deegan" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014102200008#N00700"><p>The Department receives between 25 and 35 complaints on a weekly basis about schools generally.  Most of these are about bullying; some relate to the schools themselves, school management or the boards of management of schools and certain related aspects.</p><p>  The matter of investigating complaints was raised.  The Department has no role in investigating the actions of a board of management.  The Department is neither empowered nor entitled to investigate a board of management or direct a board of management to do anything in response.  All the Department can do for complainants in respect of boards of management is to advise them of the situation - that is to say, the board of management manages the school on behalf of the patron and, therefore, failing satisfaction at board of management or patron level, parents or other complainants are entitled to approach the Ombudsman for Children about concerns they have relating to anything involving their child, including in a school.</p></speech>

I do not accept that boards are rubber stamps for principal teachers.  As Mr. Loftus has said, we have over 3,000 primary schools.  A board is obliged to meet five times per year.  The principal is obliged to give a report and does give a report to every board meeting on what is happening in the school from a child protection perspective and any other issues.  In our experience, principals are open and transparent with their boards about the issues in schools.  Obviously, boards will listen to people working in the area, including the principal teachers.  However, each individual board member will make up his or her mind after that.</p><p>  There are more than 3,000 schools, with eight people on every board.  That amounts to 24,000 people, at a minimum, managing the school system, a considerable number of people.  This is where we come back to training and support for these people.  There may be cases where there are some issues, but I imagine, given the comments of the chief inspector and the general view, that the system is working well.  Improvements can be made, but it is unfair to say that they are simply a rubber stamp for principals.  There is a good dynamic between principals and boards.  There should be and there is a mutual respect between both parties.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to section 28.  We have always indicated support for the implementation of section 28.  Some years ago a committee in the Department instigated discussions on the implementation of section 28.  If that is started again we will participate and support it fully.  Section 28 provides that procedures may be proscribed for dealing with grievances and complaints in consultation with the partners.  Certainly, we are open and willing to do that.  The other issues raised are largely policy issues.  Those were the main issues relating to boards.  I would be happy to come back on any issues in particular.</p></speech>

I agree with my colleague Ms McElduff in respect of the comment made by Deputy Daly about boards simply rubber-stamping the decisions of principals.  Deputy Daly is doing approximately 20,000 volunteers a grave disservice by making such a comment.  Mr. Loftus from the Department has indicated that there is training for boards.  It is not a one-person entity; it is a corporate entity.  Members come together and make board decisions.  I cannot agree with Deputy Daly's comment about boards simply rubber-stamping the decisions of principals.</p><p>  Deputy Daly also made a comment to the effect that boards were not accountable.  Boards are accountable to their patrons.  One of the principal functions of boards is to manage the school on behalf of the patron.  They are also accountable to the Department.</p></speech>

There is an agreed procedure which has been referenced in presentations already.  That procedure, like all other procedures that schools use, is underpinned with the principles of natural justice and fair procedures.  I deal with principals and chairpersons of boards of management on a daily basis.  I advise boards in respect of dealing with parental complaints.</p> <p>Parents are perfectly entitled to raise whatever issues they have with school management and, in the vast majority of cases, those complaints are dealt with satisfactorily.  What the member is pointing to are specific circumstances and situations but the vast majority of complaints are dealt with satisfactorily by boards of management.  It is a board as a corporate entity - all eight members coming together - dealing with issues when it gets to that stage in the procedure.</p></speech>

The vast majority of boards of management are dependent on voluntary efforts.  That is crucial to their operations and dealing with the increasing pressures placed on boards in carrying out their role in recent times.  The key point Deputy Daly raised involves accountability in cases where parents are not in agreement.  That is a difficulty and I would be interested in any comments witnesses have on ways to improve matters.  They all work on a daily basis in the area and have experience of the vast majority of cases which work well.  What is their experience of cases that are difficult?  Are there proposals which could assist in that, particularly from the management bodies that are with us today?  Mr. Fennelly in particular seemed slightly sceptical about the parents' charter and what it would mean.  I am interested in the views of witnesses from outside the Department on the charter, how it could be helpful and what it might involve in order to assist.</p></speech>

I compliment boards of management.  It is great that people volunteer their time.  The boards work very hard and have a great responsibility on their shoulders in what they do on behalf of their communities.  Like Deputy Daly, I have received a number of complaints about boards of management, albeit not a large number.  The consequences of the structure or policies governing boards of management can be profound for students and parents.  I give an example.  A young lad in his first year of secondary school was accused by a school principal in front of the school population of engaging in bullying behaviour.  CCTV proved subsequently that he had no hand, act or part in it but I understand that the principal refused to apologise to the child in front of the school population.  The young lad was profoundly psychologically damaged by it.</p></speech>

The Department of Education and Skills has paid for the home education of the child.  I am not making any judgment whatsoever on the initial cause of this as I only got it second hand, but it is a matter that should have been resolved on the spot and was not.  I saw the damage it did to the young student but also to the parents and other family members.  It was raised with the board of management and the Ombudsman for Children.  I raised it with the Minister.  I kept coming back to the same answer to the effect that it was the responsibility of the board of management.  That is not the delegation of responsibility, it is its abdication by the Department.</p><p>  There is no oversight.  I read the wholeschool evaluation of that particular school with great interest.  Couched in advisory language were findings, which I would not necessarily call adverse but represented advice to the board of management as to what it should do.  The people who carried out that wholeschool inspection never spoke with the child or his parents, which is absolutely scandalous.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts as to how parents' and students' interests can be protected in the small number of cases such as this without them having to resort, as some people have, to legal action?  Is there any possibility of formal oversight and appeals procedures to govern the operation and decisions of boards of management?</p><p>  I am reluctant to raise a second issue as some people might start jumping up and down and saying that I am trying to close small rural schools.  I am certainly not trying to do that.  There can be a difficulty in small schools, however, where one has a teacher with recurring periods of illness.  Different teachers will come in as locums which interferes with the continuity of the children's education.  Is there a possibility of having a floating teacher within the redeployment panel for schools in a catchment area to try to keep that continuity?</p><p>  Boards are looking for more resources and supports, including training.  What form of training, how much will it cost and what impact would it have?</p></speech>

Given the responsibilities of boards of management, are they ever legally responsible for any act or omission within a school or is it the patron or the Department that takes the risk?  The training of boards of management was referred to by Ms McElduff.  Do boards receive training currently on risk management and corporate governance and, if so, who provides it?  Ms McElduff referred to the uptake of training.  Can she elaborate on that?  Something needs to be done with regard to training and assistance.</p><p>  On complaints procedures, many schools operate the standard INTO model to handle complaints against teachers while other schools adopt their own policies.  What are the views of the bodies represented here today on adopting a standard complaints procedure?</p><p>  Have the implications of the O'Keeffe judgment been considered with regard to the responsibilities of boards of management, the Department and patrons?  It is a very important issue.  The European Court of Human Rights judged that the State was liable, but here we are hearing that boards of management have huge responsibility in the day-to-day running of schools.  There is a significant grey area that must be dealt with.  I would be very interested to hear the witnesses' views of the implications of the judgment.</p></speech>

It is a learning encounter.  I have never heard any great emphasis on legalistic interpretions of the role a member holds when he or she sits down at the table.  It is not an easygoing but a more informal process, which does not mean the work is unimportant.  Maybe my experience has been very different.  I think it has when I listen to other members.</p> <p>I am surprised at some of the things-----</p></speech>

I believe everyone learns from each other.  There is a kind of mutual respect for where people are coming from and their role and responsibilities.  I have always found that everyone comes away enriched in terms of what that school and the young people in that school are achieving.  That is the whole purpose of it.  We have to ask what sitting around that table is doing for the child or teenager in the school.  Generally, that is uppermost in people's minds, or that is my experience.</p></speech>

I would like to thank Deputy Daly for bringing this matter forward today.  I commend him on his remarks, 99% of which I would concur with.  Having over 20 years experience of teaching, the first thing that would strike me with regard to boards of management, and it is something I would ask, is that their membership needs to be made clear on school websites.  I have searched many school websites and while I can find out who the principal is and other information, I can never find out who is on the board of management.  I have had many representations from parents who wish to approach board members but they cannot find out who they are.  It seems to be a golden secret in many schools, which is something I believe needs to be addressed.</p><p>  I have experience in both the VEC and in the secondary situation.  I would concur with Deputy Daly on this point.  In the secondary model, I have yet to hear of a case where a board of management has come out strongly against a principal and I believe they tend to support the principal 100%, no matter what the decision is.  My experience with VEC boards is that the conversations are much more honest and open in this regard.</p><p>  Will Mr. Fennelly and the other witnesses give us their views on the parents charter and how they think it will help?  The question Deputy Daly asked of the Department of Education and Skills is exactly where are we with the parents charter.  I know it is expected to come out but what is the exact position at this time?</p><p>  Another point that needs to be taken up is training for parents representatives in particular.  Much of the time parents go on boards of management without realising exactly what they are letting themselves in for.  Again, I stress that an amazing amount of work is done by boards of management, particularly from the parents' side.  However, while I not know if it happens everywhere in the country, it seems to me that many principals end up as chairpersons of the boards of management, and I do not know if that is a good idea all of the time.  We need fresh blood and fresh and different ideas rather than getting people who are retired and gone out of the system to then come back.  There is a whole conversation to be had there as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Fennelly" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014102200010#P00500"><p>I recognise what Deputy Daly is saying.  To sound a note of balance and perhaps honesty, I talk to chairpersons of boards of management and principals on a daily basis during the week.  I agree there are problems.  I recognise what the Deputy is saying, namely, it is not all rosy in the garden across the country in terms of the running of boards of management.  I recognise there is an issue with complaints procedures in terms of how parents' complaints are dealt with.  When one goes through the whole procedure, it comes to a point where the board's decision is final and, if the parent is not happy with that, where does the parent go next?  That is what the Deputy is saying and I recognise it is an issue.  However, there is a whole range of issues around that as to how one would strike a balance for the next step and whether there should be a next step in order to be fair to all parties involved.  I understand exactly where the Deputy is coming from on that.</p><p>  The issue of training was raised.  There are five modules of training for boards of management and we would do that across the country.  There is a difficulty, however, which is that these are volunteers.  I would love it to be the case that we had a situation like that for pensions, where there is compulsory training, including online training.  However, we would have to literally drag people out of their houses in the middle of the night on winter nights to come to training, and to do that is very difficult.  We cannot compel volunteers to do the training and the feedback from boards of management is that it is difficult to get people to attend.  In the Church of Ireland, we have a very good turnout for training simply because people like to come along for an evening to meet others and to chat, and then go to a training session.  That is in the culture and they like to do that.  However, getting people to come to training is an issue, although I would like it noted that we are well resourced by the Department.</p><p>  Senator Moran mentioned listing the membership of boards on websites, which is a good idea.  An annual report goes to the parents association every year and the members of boards of management are mentioned on that.</p></speech>

For example, parents newsletters should have the names of the members of the board of management across the top.</p></speech>

However, we would not want a situation where members of boards of management are approached directly on issues by parents.  There is a procedure to be followed on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.64" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1174" speakername="Mary Moran" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014102200010#P00800"><p>I still think the parents should be entitled to know.</p></speech>

Reflecting on how that might work, is the idea that the board would be accountable to the parents externally, as well as to the Department and its inspectorate and the patron?  How would the mechanics of that work and how would it work legally?  It will be challenged legally down the road if that is the case, and we have to be realistic about that.  We would not want a situation where boards are open to litigation simply due to trying to do something in a positive way which would then expose the board.  That would be a question I have, although I do not know the answer as I am just thinking aloud.</p><p>  Deputy Daly referred to the length of service of appointees and chairpersons.  That is a question for patrons to consider and answer.  There is an issue about people staying on boards of management for years as chairpersons, but the converse of that is it is very difficult to get somebody to be a chairperson of a board of management and to serve and stay on.  Usually, if somebody is there and happy to do it, that is great.  There is a converse to that and if we were to bring in a time limit for serving as a chairperson of a board of management, that might introduced a problem.  However, that is an issue for patrons to think about.</p></speech>

That is something we encourage and something teachers and principals are committed to doing.  Every single day in the school, a very worthwhile discussion takes place about that.  Our complaints procedure is standard in the sense of moving from informal to informal, encouraging informal dialogue first to resolve matters and then going more formally to the board.</p><p>  It is the case also that, no matter who makes a decision, there are many decisions taken by boards that teachers are equally not happy with.  Somebody has to make the decision and there is no right of appeal for the teacher either when the teacher is on the other side of it.</p> <p>For some of the areas mentioned today, policies on issues such as discipline or bullying would have been drawn up in consultation with the parent body.  I appreciate that there are difficulties in regard to bullying.  Nobody wants to label children, whether victims or perpetrators.  Sometimes there can be a mismatch between an expectation and what a school can do.  Often, bullying issues arise outside schools but come into them.  Teachers try to deal with these issues in a holistic manner.</p><p> In regard to children who miss school for a long period, there are provisions for statutory appeals and for the education welfare officer to become involved in those cases.</p></speech>

I understand it is a question of resources, but in the matters of child protection, bullying and such issues, taking the whole staff for training for a day would be worth considering.  This is something we do not have currently.</p><p>  On the issue of disruption caused by the absence of teachers, as a policy we would like to see more supply panels.  These would address that issue and provide a continuity of service while teachers are absent.  However, once again, this is a resource issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.70" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sine&aacute;d Brett" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014102200011#Q00400"><p>A number of members mentioned that few complaints are left unaddressed.  They have pointed out that only a small percentage of complaints are not necessarily completed to the satisfaction of parents.</p><p>  In regard to the parents' charter, we have only scant details on this from the Minister's speeches at the various conferences.  From the perspective of the CPSMA, we would welcome a parents' charter and greater involvement with parents.  I am sure boards of management across the country would say the same.  Open communication is good.  We were asked how we can improve or what suggestions we can make for improvement.  Sometimes the difficulty is a lack of communication.  In the majority of cases, procedures and policies have been adopted and put in place in the schools, and these are followed.  In most cases, these policies and procedures sort out the problem.  However, I acknowledge that there are cases in which parents may not be happy with the final outcome.  Good communication is key to sorting out issues between boards of management and parents.</p><p>  I wish to reiterate the points made by Dr. Fennelly in regard to training for boards.  Training is delivered nationally, but it is difficult to get people to come out on a winter's evening to attend training.  We always encourage members to avail of the training, which is detailed and of great benefit to those who attend it.  Feedback and comments from members commend the training.</p><p>  On the complaints procedure, members of the CPSMA follow a standard complaints procedure when a complaint is made.  Ms McElduff outlined this procedure.  It starts with an informal stage and ideally the issue should be sorted between the parent and the teacher, if the issue is with the teacher.  If not, it may then go through the various stages.  The majority of issues are resolved using this procedure, but I accept the point that there are situations where parents may not be satisfied with the outcome.</p></speech>

Each school will be required to have a charter.  Section 28 of the Education Act has been mentioned and changes will be required to that section in order to enable the framework for a parent and student charter to be put on a statutory footing.  The value of a parent and student charter is that every school will be required legally to have one.  The drawing up of the charter will need the active involvement of the parent representatives, parent associations and parent councils.  This representation has been lacking in past grievance procedures.  Previous procedures were devised some time ago by the CPSMA and the INTO and noticeably lacked parental involvement.  The major difference in the parent charter project is that it must have parental involvement.  The change in section 28 must be worked out in order for the charter to be put on a statutory footing.  The elements of the charter will be worked out and developed in consultation with all the education partners - the management bodies, teacher unions and national parent councils.  The intention is to publish and finalise this before the end of the school year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.73" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hubert Loftus" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014102200011#Q00700"><p>Developing that point, the idea and rationale for the charter is about helping to ensure there is consistency throughout 3,000 schools in terms of good and open communication, so that we get to a point whereby matters will not need to progress up the line to complaints and difficulties that cannot be resolved.  This charter will be helpful and useful.  Our view is that by providing the information to parents, they will understand better why a board makes a decision and are more likely to accept the fairness of that decision, even if they do not agree with the outcome.  This is important.</p><p>  In terms of the accountability of boards to the Minister, I would like to point out that boards are required to comply with the policies of the Minister.  Also, section 17 of the Education Act enables the dissolution of a board of management by a patron, at the request of a Minister.  This would only happen rarely, but it has been used to deal with issues where the Minister was not satisfied that the functions of a board were being effectively discharged.</p><p>  In regard to how the interests of parents and students are protected where there is a need for a civil action, we believe the parent and student charter will be an important element in that.  Under the current arrangements, where a matter has gone through the grievance procedures, a parent can go to the Ombudsman for Children.  There is a process that allows for that.  Also, there is an appeals process provided for within the Education Act to deal with higher-level issues such as enrolment, suspension and expulsion.  This allows for issues to be dealt with without the need for civil action.</p><p>  On the issue of floating teachers, I should mention that the other half of my job deals with teacher allocation and redeployment.  We operate within constraints such as limits on our teacher numbers and our payroll budget, which make it difficult to add additional teachers to the school system to create supply panels for covering for absences.  In the past, when we had a supply panel, that supply panel and the teachers on it were utilised only about 50% of the time.  They were on the payroll all the time, but might only be utilised to cover a sick leave absence on a rare occasion in the schools they covered.</p><p>  The O'Keeffe case related to a period in the early 1970s.  The key issue was that there were no child protection procedures and processes in place for such cases to be dealt with.  That case was of its time, but there are lessons to be learned from it.  The landscape in terms of how child protection is dealt with now - the procedures in place, Children First being on a statutory footing and the other legislation in place - is different.   However, this is not to say there are not implications from the case that will be considered.  I am not a legal person and cannot answer on every legal aspect of those implications.</p><p>  On training, notwithstanding the budgetary constraints, the Department provides training and support to school management bodies to help them provide the training to boards.  This is very much a demand-led process.</p> <p>Members made valid points on how we can encourage more people to avail of that training.  We will be examining this issue as part of the consultation process on the appointment of new boards of management, in respect of which we are currently engaging stakeholders, with a view to encouraging greater use of web-based training and other ways of facilitating people who otherwise would not have opportunities to attend training sessions.</p></speech>

That paints its own picture of the issue.  I do not care how small the number of complainants may be; they have a right to recourse.  I have heard nothing today to counter the view that they do not currently have recourse.  The Louise O'Keeffe judgment is very interesting because, notwithstanding the fact that it was a different time, the issue remains that boards of management are aloof and isolated from what I would call the law of the country when things go wrong.  We all appreciate that the vast majority are going fine.</p><p>  In regard to time limits for chairpersons, it is a vicious cycle, because if boards of management were given real power and decision making abilities, more talent would be encouraged to join them.  I stand over my comments about rubber-stamping for principals, because when one uses the lingo of education and all that goes with it, it is possible to drown people out on contentious issues.</p><p>  It was interesting to observe JobBridge from a distance.  I do not believe there was one board of management in the entire country that saw fit to prevent the vested interest of the union from superseding that of the school community.  Boards could have stood up as representatives of the students and expressed their belief that an additional teacher would be beneficial for the school concerned.  To my knowledge, it has not happened in any school in this country that a board went against the wishes of a principal who was a member of INTO.  That illustrates my argument very starkly.</p><p>  I understand that minutes of board of management meetings are not made available to parents.  Openness and transparency are important.  I am glad we started the debate today and I am sure we will be returning to it in future.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014102200003#H00300"><p>Good afternoon.  Yesterday, we reverted to the committee with our responses on the 37 questions submitted to us and we are happy to elaborate on those responses later.  I propose to focus now on some of the major issues that arise for NAMA at this point in its evolution.</p><p>  I am pleased to note the remarkable transformation which has taken place in the Irish property market since we last appeared before this committee, almost two years ago.  In my address to the committee at that time, I noted that we were beginning to see a positive movement in the Dublin commercial market, as evidenced by buyer inquiries and transactions.  That reflected a desire among institutional investors to spread their real estate risk over wider geographic areas and also reflected improving sentiment towards Ireland.  I also observed that we were seeing some signs at that stage that the residential market in Dublin was bottoming out. </p><p>  Since then, both of those tentative signs of recovery have gained momentum and 2014 in particular has seen investment in the Irish commercial property market on an unprecedented scale.  Current projections indicate that the volume of direct investment activity will exceed &euro;4 billion in 2014.  The previous peak was &euro;3.5 billion in 2006.  Italy, by comparison, had &euro;4 billion of commercial property transactions in 2013.  When all this activity is taken into account, including loan sales, it is estimated that the aggregate of all Irish market transactions in 2014 will be of the order of &euro;12 billion.  In addition to NAMA sales, that projection includes the loan sales activity of the special liquidator, IBRC and a number of other banks with activities in Ireland.  This is an exceptionally high level of investment activity by historical standards or even by reference to activity elsewhere in Europe. </p><p>  NAMA has not been slow to respond to the opportunities created by the much improved market conditions.  Up to last Friday, 17 October, we had generated &euro;6.6 billion from loan and asset sales to date in 2014, including close to &euro;3 billion from sales linked to assets in the Republic and &euro;800 million from sales linked to assets in Northern Ireland.  Since inception, the total amount generated from the NAMA portfolio has been over &euro;22 billion, approximately &euro;17.5 billion in asset sales and almost &euro;5 billion in recurring income. </p><p>  While we in NAMA see the improved market conditions as a strategic opportunity to de-risk our portfolio and to reduce the contingent liability exposure of Irish taxpayers, there has been some commentary to the effect that NAMA should slow down the pace of deleveraging so as to manage out its loan portfolio over a longer time period.  There has also been some commentary to the effect that we should not sell asset and loan portfolios to private equity and similar funds.  As regards this commentary, I would like to make a number of points. </p><p>  Our strategy in each of our main markets has been to release assets for sale in a phased and orderly manner, consistent with the level of demand, the availability of credit and the absorption capacity of the particular market.  In Ireland, over the period from 2010 to 2012, this meant limiting asset disposals into a market where demand was practically non-existent, where the trend in prices was still downwards and where other non-Irish banks were selling off large portfolios quickly.  Releasing too many assets for sale could have intensified and prolonged the market downturn here.  In 2013, the Irish market stabilised and the subsequent recovery has enabled NAMA to increase the flow of assets for sale and to sell loan portfolios and properties at very competitive prices.  This in turn has enabled us to accelerate our redemption of NAMA senior debt.  Today, we are redeeming another &euro;600 million in senior debt, thereby bringing to the total to &euro;7.6 billion in 2014, which brings us to our 50% target two months ahead of schedule.</p><p>  This 50% target was one that we originally thought we would only meet at the end of 2016.  Our revised target for end-2016 &ndash; which has been endorsed by the Minister for Finance - is to redeem 80% of our senior debt by then.  Achieving this 80% target will require a substantial volume of NAMA loan and asset disposals in Ireland as well as in Britain and elsewhere; for the most part, sales will involve commercial assets, including offices, retail, hotel and leisure and industrial assets, or loans secured on such commercial assets. </p><p>  I am also pleased to inform the committee that we are also redeeming today the last tranche of &euro;134 million of the senior bonds that we issued to the Central Bank to acquire the floating charge over IBRC assets at the time of its liquidation.  That means that all of the &euro;12.9 billion in senior bonds that we issued in February 2013 as part of the IBRC liquidation process has now been fully redeemed. </p><p>  While NAMA is commercially autonomous in how it goes about its business, it cannot ignore the wider ramifications of its activities.  The Minister, through his recent section 227 review, which was published in July, endorsed the view of the NAMA board that it should take advantage, to the greatest extent possible, of favourable Irish market conditions by increasing the flow of assets to the market.  Such deleveraging creates wider collateral benefits.  NAMA senior debt represents a contingent liability on taxpayers and its reduction yields benefits in terms of the creditworthiness of Ireland as a sovereign.  This was clearly demonstrated some months ago when the credit rating agencies stated that their upgraded ratings for Ireland reflected, were in some part due to NAMA&rsquo;s planned and actual accelerated disposal programme which would improve the country&rsquo;s creditworthiness. </p><p>  The main constraint on asset disposal activity is that it must be managed in line with NAMA&rsquo;s obligations under section 10 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, namely to obtain the best achievable return for the State.  This means that NAMA must be careful to ensure that the volume of assets and loans which it offers for sale does not exceed the market&rsquo;s absorption capacity and thereby adversely affect the pricing that may be realised.  In that regard, the level of investor interest in the Irish market over the past year has had the effect of expanding substantially the market&rsquo;s capacity to absorb new supply of assets and of the loans which they secure. </p><p>  NAMA also fulfils its section 10 obligations by ensuring that assets offered for sale are subject to a competitive bidding process, involving the widest possible array of bidders, with the objective of obtaining the best price available in the market at the time of sale.  We do not discriminate against certain bidders or give preferential treatment to certain other bidders based on their country of origin or on their future investment strategy.  To do so would be to place NAMA and, by extension Irish taxpayers, at a competitive disadvantage relative to other deleveraging entities.</p><p>  The strategies pursued by purchasers after they acquire NAMA loans or assets are a commercial matter for them.  The imposition of conditionality in the sale of portfolios, even if enforceable, would have the effect of reducing the pricing NAMA would achieve and would also reduce the number of bidders willing to participate in sales processes, both of which would run counter to NAMA&rsquo;s obligation to maximise the return on its assets.</p><p>  NAMA is not a developer and has no ambitions in that regard.  However, in its capacity as a secured lender, it facilitates development through funding of viable commercial and residential projects under the control of its debtors and receivers.  With emerging shortages in the Dublin residential and office sectors, it is reasonable that NAMA should seek to contribute, in so far as this is consistent with achieving the best financial return, to meeting those emerging shortages.  That position has been endorsed by the Minister for Finance recently in his section 227 review.</p><p>  In addition to the revised debt redemption objective of 80% by end-2016, there are two other main strands to current NAMA strategy.  One is to facilitate the delivery of office accommodation within the Dublin docklands SDZ area and the other is to facilitate the delivery of residential housing units in areas where supply shortages are most acute.  The North Lotts and Grand Canal docks area of the Dublin docklands were designated as a strategic development zone, SDZ, and the scheme was adopted by Dublin City Council in May this year.  NAMA has prepared a detailed business plan which includes strategies for each of the 13 individual sites in which it has an interest.  These comprise 16.74 hectares, just over 41 acres, which is equivalent to 75% of the 22 hectares of development land in the Docklands SDZ area.</p> <p> From the initial appraisal exercise conducted by NAMA, it is estimated that up to 3.4 million sq. ft. of commercial space and almost 1,900 apartments could be delivered if all the sites in which NAMA has an interest were fully developed over the next five to seven years.  NAMA is engaging actively with Dublin City Council, in the council&rsquo;s capacity as both planning authority and development agency, to ensure the earliest possible delivery of both commercial and residential space in the docklands area.</p><p> NAMA is also willing to advance funds for the early provision of necessary infrastructure to service the area.  Already, terms have been agreed with Irish Water for a loan facility to fund the cost of delivering the required drainage infrastructure in the docklands SDZ area, which is at capacity at present.  NAMA is also willing to provide up-front funding of &euro;10 million to Dublin City Council to fund costs associated with the design and construction of a new pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the River Liffey to link the north and south docks.</p><p> When preparing portfolios of assets for sale, NAMA normally excludes from the sales process those sites that may be suitable for residential development within a three- to four-year horizon.  Typically, these are sites in the greater Dublin area.  This is in line with the commitment we gave to the Minister, as part of the section 227 review, that we would protect our ability to exercise sufficient control to facilitate the delivery, over the medium term, in the areas of most need.</p><p> As part of its contribution to address emerging residential supply needs, NAMA established a dedicated residential delivery team in April 2014.  The team&rsquo;s purpose is to co-ordinate and drive the delivery of NAMA&rsquo;s commitment to facilitate the completion of 4,500 new residential units in the period to the end of 2016 and to assess the scope for delivery of additional units thereafter.  With regard to the target for the end of 2016, it is envisaged that 1,000 units will be delivered in 2014 and another 1,500 units in 2015, with the residual in 2016.  Very importantly, NAMA is engaged in preparatory work on a second group of sites in the greater Dublin area which are currently in the planning process or where additional planning work is required.  If all of these sites were to be developed, they could deliver approximately 27,000 units in the years after 2016.</p><p> NAMA has been fortunate that it has been able to assemble very professional, dedicated and expert staff.  Its success to date has been attributable to their very considerable efforts in helping the board and helping me as chief executive to deliver strategically.  From my perspective, the biggest risk to NAMA's achieving its various objectives is the very real one that it will not be able to retain the specialist staff that it needs.  In total, some 108 members of staff have left since NAMA started, including 23 in the first half of this year and 24 in the three months since then.  The fact that staff are leaving as market conditions improve is hardly surprising, but the rate of exodus is accelerating.  I am concerned not only about that but also about the fact that many of those departing have very specialist skills and experience that, in the current buoyant property and financial market conditions, cannot be replaced.  It is vital that NAMA retain key staff if it is to deliver on the various objectives that I outlined.  The business we are in depends crucially on market knowledge and specialist skills in property, banking, planning, finance and law.  These skills are generally not available in the Civil Service.  To recruit those with the necessary skills, we had to go to the private sector, and that meant hiring staff at private sector levels of remuneration to ensure NAMA&rsquo;s mandate was carried out professionally.  There was simply no alternative given the amounts that were at stake.  The point remains valid given the amounts that are still at stake.  Owing to NAMA&rsquo;s finite lifespan, we were in a position to offer staff only specified purpose contracts.  Against that background, it is understandable that staff in mid-career, many with mortgages and young children, would tend to seek employment providing them with long-term job security and career prospects.  The departure of experienced staff causes considerable disruption and loss of momentum in the management of our debtors and assets.  Given its expected lifespan, NAMA may face a diminished prospect of recruiting experienced replacements at this stage and must therefore rely on some of its less experienced, albeit fully committed, existing resources.</p><p> For a number of reasons that I will outline, it is important at this point in its evolution that NAMA retain a sufficient complement of specialist and duly experienced staff to enable it to complete its work and generate a positive return for taxpayers.  It is necessary to take full advantage of current strong market conditions to de-risk the remaining &euro;17 billion debt in the NAMA portfolio expeditiously.  Notwithstanding the very positive growth outlook for the Irish economy over the next two to three years, we are not sheltered from the impact of macroeconomic, financial, monetary or political developments in the United States, Europe or elsewhere.</p><p> There is an increased risk that investors will shift their attention elsewhere as the increased pace of deleveraging in other European markets creates more competition for investor funds.  Cushman and Wakefield estimates that &euro;584 billion of non-performing loans held by European institutions will have to be sold or worked out over the coming years, mainly due to the new single supervisory ECB mechanism which imposes tighter capital requirements on banks. From Ireland&rsquo;s perspective, we are currently ahead of many of those competitor markets in terms of the progress we are making in deleveraging our risk, and we should aim to retain that advantage for as long as possible.</p><p>  Increasingly, NAMA&rsquo;s deleveraging activity will take the form of loan and asset portfolio sales rather than the sale of individual assets.  The amount of work required to prepare a portfolio of loans or assets for sale is considerable.  Typically, up to nine months&rsquo; preparatory work is required, and it can be longer for portfolios of smaller assets.  Such lengthy preparatory phases are necessary to ensure that data disclosed to investors are of sufficient quality to enable them to lodge competitive bids.  Otherwise, their bids will be priced very conservatively, or bidders will decline to bid and the net impact will be sub-optimal pricing on asset disposals.</p><p> The retention of specialist staff is necessary not only to complete NAMA&rsquo;s asset disposal activity in a professional manner but also to enable it to bring coherence, direction and drive - and, as appropriate, funding - to the two major initiatives of the docklands and residential development.</p><p> As a follow-on from the Minister&rsquo;s recent section 227 review and his comments about the need for NAMA to retain its operational capabilities, we are currently exploring mechanisms designed to ensure that we can retain sufficient corporate knowledge and expertise to enable us to complete our work successfully.  In light of a cost-benefit analysis, the return to the taxpayer from NAMA being in a position to repay its remaining &euro;15.1 billion of senior debt and &euro;1.6 billion of subordinated debt, potentially generating a surplus, and to deliver on its docklands and residential initiatives would be a huge multiple of the costs involved.</p><p> I thank the members for the opportunity to address them.  We are happy to respond further on these or any other issues they may now wish to discuss.</p></speech>

Agreed.</p><p>  I have one question for Mr. McDonagh.  The houses NAMA is planning for are mainly for first-time buyers.  Does Mr. McDonagh believe the guidelines as published for public consultation by the Central Bank will have any impact on NAMA managing to dispose of some of the lands in question?</p></speech>

Confidence is beginning to return to the market and certainly into the economy.  We are committed to delivering 4,500 houses by the end of 2016.  Many of those would be for what we would call the first-time-buyer market.  It is very understandable that the Central Bank does not want a repeat of the previous crisis.  It is probably very helpful that it publishes its proposals for consultation and welcomes submissions on them before it makes its final decision.  The reality is that, in general, it is a big ask for someone to put a deposit of &euro;50,000 on a house worth &euro;250,000.  Ultimately, the Central Bank is the regulator.  It has an important job to do.  We will await the outcome of the consultation process and see what impact it will have on us.  However, we hope that whatever changes are made take account of the wider considerations and the needs of the economy.</p></speech>

It is hard to know where to start as NAMA is such a big and powerful animal in the country at present.  I will cover some main points, and I hope to come back in later if I can.</p><p>  I will start with the global issue of NAMA&rsquo;s performance and the expected outturn when it is eventually wound down.  I am aware of the 80% target to repay senior debt by the end of 2016.  Some &euro;30.2 billion in senior bonds was initially taken out.  There was some &euro;1.6 billion in unguaranteed subordinated notes.  Therefore, there is almost &euro;32 billion.  Mr. McDonagh said previously that he is confident that, at the end of the entire process, NAMA will at least have broken even.  Since he said that, property prices have increased significantly.  What is his current best estimate of where we are likely to be when NAMA has finally finished its work in 2018 or 2020?</p></speech>

We said when the Minister launched the section 227 review of NAMA that we hoped to generate a surplus.</p> <p>We would not be prepared to quantify the surplus because market conditions have changed so quickly and we are subject to macro-economic risks.  People thought at the start that we overpaid for the assets because of the way the EU scheme was designed.  We overpaid the banks by &euro;6 billion and we had to claw that back first.  We had a big fall in the property market in the meantime and now we are seeing a reversal of that.  If we took those two liabilities from the taxpayers' back, that would be a good outturn.  Everything after that would be a bonus but it is probably too early to speculate on what that would be.  </p></speech>

It is not really a bonus because when NAMA was established massive losses were crystalised on the balance sheets of the banks, which were then filled by recapitalisation.  Any surplus that NAMA can return will reduce the net liability to the State.  We want it to achieve a surplus in terms of its return.  As I am sure it has forecast this, I will put my question again.  Based on reasonable assumptions, which will of course change in light of market developments, where does NAMA expect to be when it has concluded its work?  Can we expect a surplus of &euro;1 billion, &euro;3 billion or &euro;5 billion?  I ask Mr. McDonagh to indicate the realm he expects based on certain assumptions.  His estimates will be taken in good faith on that basis.</p></speech>

We need to tease that out because Mr. McDonagh keeps reiterating the obligation on NAMA under section 10 to achieve the best financial return to the State.

One of the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General at the time was that there should be criteria for return on investment, a benchmark for NAMA, which the agency disputed.  The question was raised again in the list of questions.  It has been lost in some of the commentary that when NAMA was originally established, one of its purposes was to enable the banks to function by taking development loans off the balance sheet, both performing and non-performing loans, and also to get the maximum, optimum return for the taxpayer.  It was not just about NAMA itself making a profit; it was about ensuring that the 60% write down on loans that went into NAMA &ndash; it was approximately 54% on average &ndash; was recovered as well.  How can we be certain as a committee that NAMA is applying criteria to get the best possible return for the taxpayer, who had a serious investment in NAMA?  While I welcome the fact that NAMA is making a profit but for our prudential role, we must ask why the agency fought the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is an independent commentator, against putting in place some criteria in terms of a return on investment that we could then measure in a case where NAMA states it made a loss of &euro;140 million on the disposal of loans in Northern Ireland.  We have no criteria to measure that against.  I know we are going over old ground but I regard it as important.  Could Mr. McDonagh explain why he is so reticent to allow a benchmark rate to be applied?</p></speech>

It states that the National Asset Management Agency must get the best achievable price to recover what it paid for the assets, to cover any additional funding we issue in the meantime and to recover any costs we incur in order to bring the State back to a break-even situation.</p><p>  We must be mindful of the wider considerations.  We also had a recent review by the Minister under section 227 of the Act.  As part of the review, the interests of the wider system were examined, for example, the creditworthiness of the State, which had a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 120%, and to get rid of the contingent liabilities of the State of which NAMA formed a significant contingent liability.  The Minister asked us as part of the review to take full advantage of the market because there is much demand for Irish assets.  Following the successful liquidation of IBRC we could bring forward the timelines for when we could sell the assets to pay off the debt.  There are many considerations going on which are much broader than NAMA&rsquo;s original objective.</p><p>  The issue in terms of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General is that we are not an investment fund.  We had to overpay for the assets by &euro;6 billion on day one.  We had a declining property market that was down by 30% post acquisition.  We originally worked to a timeline of 2020 but the Minister&rsquo;s review suggested trying to conclude early.  We said we would try to get 80% done by 2016 and 100% by 2018.  The State wants rid of the contingent liability because it helps from the national debt perspective.  With all the competing issues we felt at the time, and because the section 227 review was not issued at the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report, that we did not think it was appropriate because we want a long-term investment fund.  That said, the whole issue of return is certainly good practice.  We totally agree with that.  Now that we have the clarity of section 227, it is something we intend to look at and subject to board agreement we will probably put it in place from 2015 onwards.</p></speech>

The question was about the level of NAMA staff that had effectively left NAMA and gone to the private sector.  It is worrying that of the 108 staff members who resigned from the agency since its inception nearly 50%, or 51 former staff, have taken up employment in property companies, finance companies, and consultancy and law firms.  From a contractual and data protection standpoint NAMA is not in a position to provide individual staff members&rsquo; details.  The question comes from a prudential perspective.  How can NAMA ensure those staff are not using their access to data in terms of providing a comparative advantage for the people with whom they took up employment following working with NAMA, who are probably competing in the same market?  How can NAMA ensure they are not involved in the purchase of assets from NAMA that gives them a comparative advantage?  What control mechanisms has NAMA put in place?  I accept it is working against the background of trying to retain staff but my concern relates to getting value for the taxpayer and protecting the public purse.  Could Mr. McDonagh deal quickly with that point?  It is worrying that nearly 50% of former NAMA staff have gone into areas that are clearly related to property.</p></speech>

In that context, section 202 of the NAMA Act is very clear on the lifelong obligation on one not disclosing information obtained while employed in NAMA.  It is a criminal offence to use the information elsewhere.</p> <p>Under the contracts of employment, the NTMA employs the staff and they are bound by the Official Secrets Act.  The issue of information is one we take very seriously.  The best defence to anybody having information is to open-market the assets so that nobody gets an advantage just because he or she worked at one time for NAMA but is now in the market bidding for assets for someone else.</p></speech>

What is the result of NAMA going to be at the end of the day?  NAMA has looked at different options in terms of disposal and had them independently assessed, which I will come to in a minute.  I was taken aback by the suggestion that at the end of this process, the profit NAMA will make will be in the region of &euro;500 million.  Can the witnesses talk me through some of the assumptions underlying that?  NAMA has relied heavily on the fact that property prices have decreased since the valuation date on which NAMA was asked to acquire the loans in November 2009 but the witnesses will doubtless testify that the property prices in Dublin where 90% of the loans are secured - Dublin, Limerick, Cork - are back at 2009 levels or just 4% below for apartments and 5% below for all other properties.  NAMA is nearly at the prices at which it was asked to buy the properties.  I assume the witnesses will mention the fact that NAMA had to pay the additional &euro;6 billion.  However, NAMA has so far received &euro;4.5 billion in rent from those properties which will be disposed of at par or above value.  What are the assumptions the witnesses are using that suggest the profit will only be &euro;500 million given that property prices have nearly reached the level at which the properties were purchased at and are expected to rise?  Are they assuming there will be no property price rises?  If so, can they provide the committee with the models they have used for a 5% rise, for example, over the next few years and what that would mean for State coffers?</p></speech>

We took a very conservative view whereby values stayed where they were at on 30 June 2014.  Account was taken of provisions to date, which was still substantial at &euro;3.6 billion down from &euro;4.1 billion at the end of 2013, and we looked at the remaining assets to sell and the timeline in which they will be sold.  We had to take account of the additional funding to be invested in certain assets to build out and recover the money and, as such, it was quite a straightforward calculation.  When one adds up all the pluses and minuses, one ends up with close to a &euro;500 million surplus.  The board would not countenance a view that I or my executive team would engage in speculation that prices will increase by 5%, 10% or 15% from where they are.  If that happens, the surplus line will increase on the remaining assets.  However, what one looks at is a point in time and the result if one had to sell everything then and achieved the current prices.  That is how the surplus is determined.</p></speech>

It is an asset management not an asset disposal agency.  While there may be political considerations around disposing early, NAMA has until 2020 to redeem these bonds.  I understand that there are benefits in terms of debt risk etc., but this year alone in Dublin where the primary focus is in terms of properties against which the loans are secured there has been an increase of 23%.  However, &euro;17.5 billion of assets were sold at a time when the market was falling or increasing gradually.  If one was to dispose of those assets today, one would receive a great deal more value for them.</p></speech>

Between 2010 and 2012, we held back intentionally on the disposal of assets in Ireland.  While we obviously had transactions in the market to try to get it moving again, we sold less than &euro;1 billion of assets in Ireland.  From the start of 2013 to date, we sold an additional &euro;3 billion of assets in Ireland because, as the Deputy says, the market was beginning to recover.  In the meantime, we took the income to which the Deputy refers on the assets.  We did not want to sell assets which were yielding 9%.  We said NAMA would take the income and would wait for yields to come back in, which they have.  Offices are down to 5% with some down to 4%.  Other assets like retail have come back from 10% towards 6%.  As such, that is exactly the strategy we followed and only &euro;4 billion of the &euro;17.5 billion related to assets in Ireland.  The other assets we sold were primarily overseas and we took advantage of a very buoyant market in London.  One must be mindful that Ireland was part of a troika programme as part of which we had to redeem &euro;17.5 billion of our debt by the end of 2013.  We achieved that.  We are at &euro;15 billion today.  We have competing objectives in that we are not a long-term fund.  If Ireland had the luxury-----</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh has said in previous responses to the committee that the review on early disposal indicated it would not be good to dispose in the next six months.  No one is genuinely suggesting that, but has NAMA considered the idea of a delayed disposal right up until 2020?  Would that be the most beneficial scenario in terms of a hard-cash return for the State or is it to wind up 80% of NAMA by 2016?</p></speech>

Currently, dependent on what data one is looking at, the percentage in that regard is 5% or 6%.  I think everybody will agree that the optimum level is around 10% or 12%.  Reference was made earlier to maximising the return on acquired assets and to this not being possible by the imposition of conditionality because that would somehow reduce the value.  As stated earlier by Deputy McGrath, the sale and stripping of assets will restrict builders being able to get back into business.  I am speaking not about developers but builders-construction work.  In terms of the need for a 10%-12% level of construction activity in the economy, the concern is that we do not have the ability to achieve this because of a lack of available finance for builders and so on.  Again, I am speaking about builders rather than developers.  If we are to obtain the optimal return for the public, it is important and in our best interests that we know what the purchaser of an asset proposes to do with it.  If an asset is put out of the reach of construction, we will be losing out in terms of a return of activity in the economy.  Currently the construction sector is running at 5%.  What can NAMA do to help increase that to 10% or 12%, which has implications for everybody throughout the country?</p><p>  On local authority housing units and the breakdown provided in terms of the number of units delivered regionally by NAMA, it was stated earlier that NAMA is confident it can deliver 1,000 social housing homes by end 2014.  How far along is that process and how many units remain outstanding?  What are the issues, if any, holding up that process?  It was stated that NAMA will deliver the remaining houses as soon as the local authority approved housing bodies contract to buy or lease them.  What is happening and why is that not progressing?  Where are the blockages in that regard?  Also, 1,000 houses is modest in the context of where we are in relation to social housing.  It has been stated by NAMA previously that some of the houses at its disposal are deemed not suitable for social housing.  Perhaps the witnesses would elaborate on whether the problem in that regard is one of geography or the manner in which the properties are constructed.  Also, could money be made available to make the housing concerned good quality housing for allocation to people on the housing waiting list?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014102200008#N02600"><p>The Deputy is correct is that normally functioning economies generally have 10%-12% of GDP in the construction sector.  NAMA would be very supportive of that.  In terms of Construction 2020, we have committed to taking action to try to restore activity to that level.  NAMA has two objectives.  First, as requested by Government and the Minister, we are to sell assets and use that money to pay off the debt to rid the State of contingent liabilities.  We are doing that.  Second, NAMA has been asked to set aside money from its internally generated resources to deliver more residential units - 4,500 by 2016 - and to obtain planning for an additional 20,000 units through the Docklands SDZ.  To date, NAMA has put more than &euro;1 billion into the construction sector in Ireland.  It has also committed to putting an additional &euro;3 billion into the sector between now and its end of life.</p> <p>A figure of &euro;4 billion is a substantial amount in the context of the Irish economy where GDP is &euro;160 billion.  We are playing our part in trying to help the construction sector.  </p><p> The reality is that there are different buyers for different types of assets.  As I said, almost 90% of the buyers of assets are US funds.  Some funds are only interested in trading assets, such as hotels or offices, and generating income from them.  Others are interested in investing additional money in assets to build houses because they see an opportunity emerging in Dublin where there is demand for residential housing.  We are aware of a number of funds which have purchased assets from NAMA and other banks and are investing in construction activity because they see that as generating the best commercial return for them.</p><p> Some 926 units of social housing have been delivered to date.  We are very confident that we will deliver over 1,000 units by the end of 2014.  We have a dedicated team working on this every day.  We are making sure they are delivered as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

If we can sign contracts, we will achieve well over 1,000 by the end of the year.  We cannot control the full picture.  We have to rely on local authorities, housing agencies and approved housing bodies to sign the contracts.  We have very good engagement with them.  We have a standardised lease which everybody now understands.  We are not wasting money trying to negotiate a separate lease for every housing body, and therefore everybody knows with what they are dealing.  Things can happen very quickly.</p><p>  We offered almost 5,500 units, but only 2,100 have been accepted.  Over 1,000 will be delivered by the end of this year and currently 500 are under consideration.  Some units were rejected because things were slow to get going as the approved housing bodies were typically used to getting capital funding to buy units.  However, given that the Government is in constrained circumstances, money cannot be given to buy capital but rather for long-term leases.  That changed everybody's circumstances and people had to adjust.  </p><p>  About 1,200 units were sold or rented in the private sector while local authorities and approved housing bodies were making up their minds about whether they wanted them.  We cannot hold things up because there is demand for housing in the market.  About 1,700 units were rejected because they were the wrong type of product or in the wrong location, or local authorities and approved housing bodies felt they had an over-exposure in a particular area.  I have been told that the rule of thumb is to have a maximum of 20% of social housing in a particular area.</p></speech>

On the 926 units we are discussing, NAMA does not hand them over to the local authorities or housing bodies unless they are in excellent condition.  We remediate any defects or health and safety issues and finish them to a very high standard.  We spent approximately &euro;20 million on those houses alone and will spend a commensurate amount on all of the other ones we deliver.</p><p>  I was in Cork recently.  We handed over 24 houses to NABCO.  I saw the houses before and after the work, and the quality and standard not just of the houses, but the manner in which we finished what was effectively a ghost estate, was very good.  It was good to see a young couple with a young baby getting the keys to their house.  It puts a human aspect on what was done with the &euro;20 million or the 926 units.</p></speech>

Did local authorities miss out on houses because the market caught up with them?  Did they not act quickly enough and therefore lost good social housing to the private market?</p></speech>

A debtor or receiver may have held houses and said he or she was obliged to get as much money as possible to pay off his or her debts.  He or she may have been able to rent a unit or had a very good offer to sell, and we had to let that activity happen if it made commercial sense.  We are constantly recycling and offering product to the housing agencies.  As new product becomes available or stock which was rented is freed up, we ask State bodies whether they are interested.</p></speech>

Is there a social clause to the effect that NAMA should offer housing to them?  We know Dublin is a pressure point in terms of social housing.  Should local authorities not have been offered that stock?  Were they too slow to react?  Mr. McDonagh said they have been.  Is he saying they refused the stock or NAMA sold it to the private sector?</p></speech>

I am somewhat disappointed by the take up of some local authorities.  We do not have time, unfortunately, to discuss that.

The most important figure for us is how much the agency paid for the assets it sold.  The gap between the purchase price and the sale price is what matters.  The other factor that matters, which brings me to Deputy O'Donnell's second point, is the total realised sale price versus a nominal optimal sale price, which is something we rely on the Comptroller and Auditor General to look into because we do not know.  I have the greatest respect for what Mr. McDonagh is doing but I am surprised he does not know that figure.  It is the most important one for us.

I would like to ask a question raised by a constituent who is seeking to build houses, which he has tried to do on a number of occasions.  He has sent me specific examples of sites he has approached NAMA to buy but the agency has said they are not for sale now, which is its prerogative.  I do not suggest there is anything wrong with NAMA's position.  However, in a scenario where we have a supply side mismatch in the housing market, when a developer or builder approaches the agency about development land that has not been put up for sale, is there a process whereby such an expression of interest can kick off a review?  How sensitive is the agency to potential buyers who would like to buy land in Dublin, north Wicklow or wherever and build 40, 50 or 100 houses on it even when the agency says it does not believe now is the best time to sell it?  What kind of back and forth goes on within the agency to review this?</p></speech>

The reality is if we receive an offer from somebody and if we think it makes an interesting commercial proposition, we will review that case to see if it makes sense to put that asset on the market or not.  We work on each individual debtor's portfolio to agree a strategy to work it out over time and the view may well be to hold the asset and seek new or revised planning permission to improve the value of the asset.  Then we might decide to give funding to that owner to build out.  That could be a scenario.</p><p>  We had a scenario last year where we had lined up a joint venture partner to buy land in south County Dublin from a receiver to form a joint venture to build residential units.  The receiver received an solicited offer higher than the amount our joint venture was prepared to pay and we told the receiver he had an obligation, which he knew himself, to maximise the return.  He put it on the open market and he got double what we were prepared to pay.  Any time there is a commercial opportunity that will maximise the return, it is looked at.</p></speech>

NAMA sold a property for &euro;7.5 million and it was sold a year later in August 2014 for almost &euro;18 million.  Inevitably, when the agency is disposing of so many assets, people will be able to buy them and flip them at a profit.  It would be unreasonable to expect that NAMA would never be caught out like that.  However, was that an isolated incident?  Did it kick off a review?  How satisfied is NAMA that the prices it is obtaining are reasonable market prices, particularly given Mr. McDonagh said 89% of the purchases from the agency are being made by US funds?  Some are here for the long haul but others have 12 to 36 month horizons and they buy assets with a view to a short-term capital gain.  How concerned is Mr. McDonagh that there is a lot of this going on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014102200010#P02500"><p>There is no way I could sit here and tell the Deputy that NAMA could get the timing of every asset sale right.  Buyers buy assets on the basis that they expect to make a commercial return and some, as he said, take a longer term view and others take a short-term view.</p><p>  With regard to the asset to which the Deputy referred, that was a receivership sale.  The receiver openly marketed the asset and it was agreed to sell it at the best price at the time in late 2012.  That was before the property market recovered.  The fact that it was sold subsequently to a special purchaser happens.  Some people may have the view that nobody else would have paid the price that was paid for it in mid-2014.  Having looked at and spoken with the receiver in terms of his legal obligations to maximise the return to pay off the debtor's debt and having looked at the fact that it was openly marketed, it is the safest mechanism to ensure one gets the best price one can for an asset at a particular point in time.  If it is not openly marketed, one always run the risk that there would be somebody who would say he or she would have paid more if he or she knew the asset was available.</p></speech>

That is our latest view, and that is in terms of paying off the debt.  There may be some residual work that will go on in terms of residential department and the strategic development zone, SDZ, but that is a much smaller operation.</p><p>  It terms of the hotels to date, we acquired 136 hotels and we have 107 hotels remaining. Of those, 28 are in Dublin, 32 in Munster, 22 in Connacht and Ulster, 19 in the greater Dublin area, which I call the commuter belt, and six are in the rest of Leinster.  They include hotels across all the categories - three, four and five star.  Some are hostels.</p><p>  Senator Coghlan mentioned that NAMA's mandate is very important.  It is crucially important.

In its central business district there are currently only about two buildings with a 100,000 square ft. floor-plate available, which is what people are looking for.  Rents are therefore rising quite quickly.  They were about &euro;55 per square foot at the peak.  They went down to &euro;27 per square foot and now they are back up towards &euro;45 per square foot. Commercially a new building could be built at an average of about &euro;35 per square foot.  It is therefore profitable to build it out.  We are certainly very anxious to get on and we welcome the SDZ.  It improves the prospects of getting through planning system quicker, and we would certainly prioritise the 13 sites.  We have four of them in joint ventures with various parties, and we have prioritised the other nine to get the planning applications through to Dublin City Council in the next six to 12 months.  We would hope to start real construction activities on some of those sites in early 2016.</p></speech>

Particular cases have been brought to my attention.  It would seem from both media commentary and information I have received myself that in many cases developers, some of whom have performing loans and were only brought under NAMA's remit through legislation, are being brought to their knees.  These are the very people who have expertise and experience.  They are the people to whom we look to grow our construction industry again.<br/>I note in particular the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Brian Cregan in the High Court in the Mr. John Flynn <i>v.</i>NAMA case.  I believe that case was a damning indictment of how NAMA deals with developers.  He ruled that NAMA had acted unfairly and unlawfully in calling in loans of &euro;22 million from Mr. Flynn and his family.  The large amount of information I have received about how NAMA deals with developers tallies with Mr. Flynn's own comment that dealing with NAMA was akin to the goings-on in North Korea and that developers could not speak.  I know the media do not have too much sympathy for developers but many of them have performing loans.  <br/>One of the biggest loan sales was of the loans of developer Michael O'Flynn.  His loan sales comprised much sought-after property and he believes that his loans were not sold to the highest bidder but to Blackstone.  Is that the case or not?  <br/>In the case of the sale of Elverys Sports, I am delighted that the management buy-out proceeded and that jobs were saved.  I would like to say fair play and give full credit to the management company there.  However, I take issue with the dealings of NAMA in this case.  On the Friday, everything was cleared, in place and financed to proceed with the management buyout.  Come Monday, everything was off the table.  The company was in freefall and by Wednesday it was in examinership.  This had implications.  The deal on Friday would have meant Revenue was paid in full as well as all creditors.  There was &euro;1.4 million due to small creditors, many of whom supply services and goods in my own county.  In the subsequent deal after examinership, those small creditors, who were to get 100% of their payments, received 5%.  Once the company went into examinership that had its own costs.  <br/>I am glad that the management buy-out proceeded successfully.  When I raised this in the D&aacute;il and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton came in to deal with my concerns, however, I believe that misinformation was given to him.  He was told that finance was not in place when it was in place.  I would like some explanations.  There are people in County Mayo, small creditors and businesses.  The money that they have lost is making a big difference in their businesses.  They are employing local people and paying for local services, paying local rates and all the rest.  I think it is a disgrace and I would like an explanation. </p></speech>

The loans, landed rapid loans, those associate loans that came into NAMA, we took the pool based on what the legislation was and what the European Commission decided and approved.  In relation to the Michael O'Flynn loan sale, NAMA accepted the best offer that it got.  It was not the highest offer, but the highest offer that was made was conditional and did not have funding.  The best offer was an all-cash offer.  That was the best decision that NAMA could make at that point.</p></speech>

Our loan sales agent - an international bank - made a recommendation to us to accept the offer, and the board of NAMA had to make a decision to accept the offer.

It raises the question of whether it was sold under value in the first instance and, if so, the reason for that.  Why are we allowing corporate raiders, essentially Gordon Gekkos, to come to this country, asset-strip and sell on property, making a huge profit at the expense of Irish taxpayers?<br/>I will give Mr. McDonagh the background to my suspicion regarding this issue.  It has arisen as a result of what has happened with CHQ building, to which I referred earlier.  I read in the <i>Financial Times</i>recently that a pension fund in the United States alleges that Blackstone, a company with which NAMA does a lot of business, entered into an agreement with another private equity company for the purpose of ensuring that they would not compete with one another for the purchase of property, thereby keeping the prices of properties down.  They had set up special purpose vehicles for that purpose.  What measures does NAMA have in place for dealing with those types of risk as they arise so that the Irish taxpayer can be assured of maximum bang for its buck when it comes to selling off property?</p></speech>

It was openly marketed.  The sale price was agreed in late 2012 and the company involved was interested in doing student accommodation.  It went for planning permission.  It got planning permission from Dublin City Council.  The planning permission was subsequently overturned by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It decided then that it was only interested in accommodation and it sold on the site.</p></speech>

The best defence in securing the price is that it is openly marketed.  At that time everybody who wanted to bid for it could bid for it.  That was the highest bid at that time.

The price was the best price that could be achieved at the time.  The receiver had a legal obligation to get the best price.  He got that after it had been openly marketed.  The fact that 18 months later the market has changed, the economy has experienced a dramatic turnaround, and there is strategic development zone, SDZ, planning in place, which did not exist in 2012, were contributing factors, and there was a special purchaser.</p></speech>

The point raised by Deputy Donnelly goes to the core of the issue of evaluating performance in the interests of the taxpayer: is NAMA achieving a profit from the asset disposals?  It may be wrong to say the representatives did not have this information at hand, and part of it may be in the answers submitted, but I refer to the bottom of page 5 of the document submitted prior to the meeting, which states that to the end of June 2014 NAMA had sold debtor loans with a nominal par value in excess of &euro;12.5 billion, and with regard to that, there was a loss of &euro;227 million.</p> <p>When NAMA uses the term "par debt value", does it refer to the purchase price into NAMA or the original amount lent by the banks?</p></speech>

In a way, the debate must move on from this demonisation of developers.  With all due respect to NAMA, receivers, liquidators, accountants, solicitors or barristers, none of them has built houses at the end of the day.  We need the skill set that developers have in building houses, and we need to accelerate the process.  From my engagement with developers, I know that very few are in a financial position to build houses without assistance from NAMA.  They are finding it very difficult to raise finance in the current banking environment.  In the Cork area there are less than a handful of developers in a position to continue building houses.  The witnesses circulated figures about funding being made available, which indicated that there was approximately &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion for developers for offices and housing.  What is the cost of the financing being made available to developers?</p></speech>

If a debtor comes to NAMA with a proposal indicating a commercial return, and if we have a good working relationship with that debtor, we will provide funding if the business case stacks up.  We are anxiously seeking debtors to make proposals to do that and we will continue that process.  With regard to debtors not in NAMA, some of my colleagues attended a conference this morning which had speakers from the two main banks.  They are outlining a number of factors.  They are not really interested in lending money to people to buy development land but if they are to lend to people in order to build houses, they would typically provide 65% or 70% and the developer would have to provide 30% equity.  That can be difficult.</p></speech>

As somebody from outside the Pale, I worry that there is an excessive concentration of scarce resources in the greater Dublin area, notwithstanding that NAMA has a broad base of assets around the country, where there are similar problems in the housing market.  There are also issues for inward and industrial investment with regard to appropriate office space in the regions, including Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  We seem to be putting all our eggs in one basket - that is, the greater Dublin area - which is a questionable approach.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, for the past 15 months I have been excluded, along with my colleague Deputy Mathews, from the membership of any Oireachtas committee.  This means we must wait until the very end, after all the other questions have been asked, to speak.  We are in a very unsatisfactory position.  I apologise for having to mention this in front of our guests, but I will make the point every time I speak at a committee from now on.  It is egregious.  I wish Deputy Paul Murphy the very best of luck as he will probably become an official member of the committee tomorrow, although he only became a Member of the Oireachtas last week.  The inconsistency and unfairness of this process is highlighted by that fact.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for their very lengthy testimony and answering all the questions so far as honestly and frankly as possible.  Most of the questions I wanted to ask have been covered but I will deal with some issues.  I am very concerned about the reduction in staff, with 50% of people leaving.  I understand the cooling-off period is only six months.  Ireland is a very small place and there has been an unfortunate overlap between public service, politics and the construction sector.  Lines have been blurred, which has caused this country to come to the biggest economic crisis in the history of the State and one of the biggest in all of history.  The issue must be reconsidered.  It is completely unacceptable that such a high proportion of individuals are leaving NAMA and entering employment for organisations that stand to gain greatly from any information, contacts or inside information that those individuals bring with them.  It is an issue for the Government and NAMA, so I would like to hear the thoughts of the delegation about it.</p><p>  I understand that freedom of information legislation kicks in this month for NAMA.  Is that correct?</p> <p>There have been many concerns about transparency, so-called secret deals and information that was misappropriated or misused by individuals in NAMA.  I do not want to drag all of those matters up again, but what preparations has NAMA made to comply with the freedom of information legislation and is it equipped for same?  I hope the legislation will help build confidence in the organisation, but it will also cause a drain on NAMA's resources at a time when it is difficult to retain staff.</p><p> I will conclude on the matter of upward-only rent reviews, as my questions on social housing and so on have been covered.  When the Government entered into office in 2011, it was the stated policy of both Government parties that upward-only rent reviews would be tackled.  The position of NAMA, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, the banks and others was that the issue should not be dealt with by the Government and the intensive lobbying to ensure that the proposals to abolish upward-only reviews were cast aside was successful.  The logic was that such legislation would hamper investment, particularly in the retail sector, and affect the price that NAMA could achieve in the disposal of its assets.  The revenues being raised from rent could also be hampered.  Given the fact that the price of commercial and residential properties in Ireland and the UK has risen dramatically in recent years, though, is NAMA's concern in this regard now gone?  Would it still object to the Government dealing with upward-only rent reviews, as they remain a significant issue for business people and a major cause of small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, going out of business?  The Government should address the matter.  Will NAMA also confirm whether it advertises the fact that this proposal was dropped by the Government in the former's investment materials?  It is a point of curiosity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014102200014#T00200"><p>I will address the first two points and Mr. McDonagh will address the question on rent abatement.  We cannot stop people from leaving NAMA to seek other employment, as they have rights, although we would like to stop them because we are losing many skill sets.  All we can do is put in place a robust regime, to which Mr. McDonagh referred, that involves the Official Secrets Act and the stipulations on the use of information.  All of that stays with the person for life.  The cooling off or guarding leave period is generally six months.  The matter has arisen at this and other committees.  Six months is probably the maximum that we can do because, if we were paying people to sit at home for one, two or more years, we would be answering other questions from the committee.  Mr. McDonagh referred to the greatest safeguard against people getting an advantage because of their time in NAMA, namely, everything is openly marketed.  As such, there is no inherent advantage to them.</p><p>  Regarding the freedom of information legislation, I take it that, when the Deputy refers to secret deals and misused information, she has in mind material that has been put out there but over which NAMA does not stand.  We have never come across evidence of secret deals, etc.  We have made advance preparations for the legislation and have a team in place under Mr. &Oacute; Faol&aacute;in.  When the provisions are commenced, we will be ready to engage with them.  There is the constant notion that NAMA is not transparent and does not report.  To repeat what we have told the committee previously, we are an extremely transparent organisation in terms of our annual and quarterly reports, annual statements, appearances before committees and engagement on a one-to-one basis with Members of the Oireachtas and members of the media.  We have only ever had a difficulty with what we regard as confidential commercial information.</p></speech>

We published a document that was announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2012.  It set out a procedure for people who had unsuccessfully sought rent reviews previously to go about getting them.  To date, we have received 386 applications and approved 335 of them, with 19 currently under assessment.  We have only refused 12 applications.  In general, they related to companies where, although individual retail units might have been in difficulty, the overall groups were profitable.  As such, there was good reason for our refusals.  Rent reductions are not free - they cost us approximately &euro;22 million per annum in lost rental income on the assets.  I am glad to report that a number of the businesses whose applications were the first to be approved and that went through difficult periods when the economy was suffering and retail activity decreased significantly have, according to their turnover figures, been able to trade through their difficulties.  We do our best to help them if they follow our guidance.  They must give us information supporting their position that they are entitled to reviews.</p><p>  Regarding Deputy Creighton's comment about advertising, I am unaware of anyone in NAMA advertising the point - nor would I stand over it - that we opposed the proposals on upward-only rent reviews.  We made a submission to the Minister.  The Department released it to the media following a freedom of information request.  We knew when we wrote it that it was likely to become public.  Our views are business views.  That said, though, we have done a good deal to try to help businesses and to show them a way of achieving rent reductions if they meet the criteria.</p></speech>

First, we are still getting requests for abatements, albeit not in the same volume as previously.  Perhaps that reflects certain changes in the commercial reality.  Second, I understand that, besides commercial considerations, the Government's decision was influenced by the constitutionality of dealing with the issue.  I presume that situation still obtains.</p></speech>

I am concerned.  Leaving aside any constitutional issue that might arise, is it feared that the Government intervening in upward-only rent reviews, which in the minds of most citizens would be a fairer way of dealing with the issue, would likely have detrimental market implications for NAMA today?</p></speech>

If something was done and it affected asset values by 20%, then, instead of expecting to get &euro;1.5 billion back for those assets, we would only get &euro;1.2 billion for them.  It is a straight-line calculation.  Whatever the calibration is set at will have a direct effect on the amount we are going to recover on the assets if we have not sold them before the change.  That would be the same for everybody else.</p></speech>

NAMA, at the beginning, was to be the way of harbouring the solvency dangers to six Irish-owned banks in order that liquidity could begin to flow by other methods.  That means loans with a par value of &euro;76 billion were parked in NAMA under this model, although Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke and Tim Geithner said it would not and could not work - that all the pragmatics would make it unworkable in the United States.  One does not buy toxic assets, for the very reasons we have discussed - the difficulties of valuation, the difficulties of what happens in subsequent years, the retrospective look to see what was fair or unfair, and so on.  Deputy O'Donnell asked why we do not have a benchmark investment return model against which to judge NAMA's performance.  </p><p>  Let us go back to the beginning.  The Irish-owned banks, which had loan books of &euro;400 billion, parked &euro;76 billion of those loans, at a price of &euro;32 billion, with NAMA.  So it is a financial problem.  But now we are discussing it with the political and social wrappings that are very distant from the core need to address solvency in the banking system.  If one adds in Danske Bank, ACC, or Rabobank, Bank of Scotland Ireland, KBC and Ulster Bank - all the other domestic banking system banks - one did not just have losses of &euro;76 billion less &euro;32 billion, which is &euro;40 billion, but &euro;85 billion of losses, which is half the GDP of Ireland in 2008.  The equivalent level of banking system losses in America, which has a GDP of $10 trillion, would have been $5 trillion.  What America did with its Troubled Asset Relief Program, which involved an investment of $700 billion, was to inject capital, to bring in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to give tailor-made guarantees for deposits and other types of obligation as a banking system.  It certainly did not involve bonds which were two- and three-year funding by professional investors.  They would have to take their bath and their medicine.  That unravelled like an inferno.  It was the financial equivalent of the Australian forest fires.  </p><p>  The same Tim Geithner that did all that was pragmatic and correct for the American system - and the world systems - decided that Ireland could be sacrificed to the extent of &euro;32-ish billion in Anglo Irish Bank losses.  That is what happened.  The witnesses from NAMA are the best people to understand all of this financial engineering for Ireland, the fallout from it and the pragmatic issues in addressing the detritus.  It has 800 client cases.  A hundred of these have been redeemed, or solved, and are out of NAMA.  There are 700 left, but NAMA is down to 50% of its initial peak staff count.  There must be an awful lot of tension and high blood pressure in trying to cope with 700 cases, which equals 87.5% of its original client count, with only 50% of its original expert staff.  The question arises, then: who is running the ledgers of all these loan accounts?  It is back at the banks, maybe.  Is that right?  I am talking about the accounting ledgers and systems.</p></speech>

I like the big-picture stuff because that is the engineering in terms of the work at hand.</p><p>  Ninety percent of the &euro;17 billion in sales - which were not at par value but at discounted prices - have gone to American funds and investors.  Think about this.  Are they the only guys with money, because of the quantitative easing that occurred in America, with cash sloshing around?  They see headlines saying that Ireland is surviving the austerity era and that there is growth.  Senator Lorraine Higgins said there had been a dramatic turnaround.  There is no dramatic turnaround.  Se&aacute;n O'Driscoll of Glen Dimplex, who has a realistic head on his shoulders, said this morning on the radio, I am told, that we should put caution with a capital "C" in front of all of this stuff about turnarounds.  If there was a turnaround, everybody would be quite happy to pay the water charges.  They are not, because they ain't got the cash.  They also have to pay property tax.  I got my local property tax form yesterday; if one is paying by cheque or debit, the deadline is 31 December or 1 January.  If one allows the Revenue Commissioners to dip into one's bank account to collect the full lump sum then the deadline is 25 March 2015.  Those are two biggies coming down the track for households.</p><p>  Let me return to discussing the Americans.  Ninety percent of &euro;17 billion is &euro;17.2 billion.  These American guys, probably six or seven of them, had to sell dollars to buy euro - they had tonnes of dollars because it was sloshing around - to invest in a euro asset which they saw as upside because everybody was saying in the headlines that Ireland had made it.  The people of Ireland still have that secret ticking time bomb in Patrick Honohan's desk - the &euro;25 billion of promissory bonds.  If he starts selling them, he will spoil the opportunity to cancel them, if the Government had the mettle, courage, balls - I might as well say it - to tear them up and tell Mr. Draghi he has got a little problem to mutualise and spread across Europe, and rightly so, because Tim Geithner caused that scar.  We were the firebreak in that eurozone forest fire that stopped the contagion when Italy was panicking and Italian banks were holding Italian bonds, the use of which had gone through the roof.</p><p>  This big-picture story needs to be told again because it is the best argument, the best objective evidence, to support the case.  When I hear the term "retrospective bank capitalisation", I think "What a mouthful of syllables that mean nothing."  It is tearing up a false liability, which was the metamorphosis of bank losses from one bank alone into a burden on the Irish people to act as a firebreak in the financial system.  Come on, guys.  I said to the Minister for Finance only last week: "Come on.  Do it, please.  Please do it."</p></speech>

The dogs in the street in the financial markets know that the dollar is due for a fall.  That is why there is an active market in the financial assets that NAMA is selling.  If there were no American funds with dollars buying euro, there would not be the high expectations of some of my colleagues on the committee.  There would be no market.  I think Mr. Daly is right in selling these things, but he should tell the story and why.  Does Mr. Daly take the point?</p></speech>

Question No. 15 concerns the number of developers retained since the establishment of NAMA and the salaries paid to them.  There are 122 developers, and with around 95 paid over &euro;50,000 and 50 paid over &euro;100,000.  Can Mr. Daly provide the justification for why working with debtors - who are basically failed developers - is a less costly option than enforcement and the employment of external asset managers?  Is that it in terms of remuneration, or are there other benefits that are not included in the salary package?  Are there car benefits, golf club memberships or other things that are not included in the salary package?  Are developers allowed to hold onto second houses, such as in the K Club?  Is there a range of things that people hold onto on top of the salary of &euro;200,000?</p></speech>

The rationale is that it makes business sense for us to use them and that it is cheaper than appointing receivers.  These people are returning value on the portfolio.  It is only a salary cost; we do not fund any part of their lifestyle.  If they get paid, they pay their taxes, and what they do with income after that is their own business.  Regarding other assets, our view is that if they are substantially indebted to NAMA, people must put their assets on the table and agree a disposal programme for selling the assets.  To date, we have collected &euro;800 million of additional security on assets that people had at the time NAMA took over the loans.  They pledged that security to us.  Typically, if there is a holiday home, part of the agreement is that they dispose of the holiday home and pay the proceeds against the debt.  We pursue every penny that we can legally get at to push the debtor to hand over whatever he has, if he does not have the ability to pay off the full debt.</p></speech>

It might sometimes appear that the developer has a second home but, after looking at the legal matter, the home might be owned by an unconnected third party rather than the developer.  The developer cannot give us security on the property.  If the debtor has additional assets, we expect the assets to be on the table.</p></speech>

If it turns out the debtor will not co-operate or resists, they become subject to litigation, where we seek a judgment and attach the judgment to unencumbered assets.

When selling assets, physical assets or loans, NAMA says it has no social requirement and does not care who gets the assets or what they do.  I refer to the 90% of assets that go to US funds, a good portion of which may be vulture funds such as Blackstone or Lone Star, which may aggressively pursue debtors.  Do the witnesses consider it the job of NAMA to think about what happens afterwards?  Is NAMA's job to maximise the return for the taxpayer and leave it at that?</p></speech>

There are different types of investor in the market - short-term and long-term investors.  Most of the people we deal with are generally long-term investors.</p></speech>

The phrase used was that we would sell regardless of the economic impact or other damage to the State.  That would not be the case if we were aware that a sale was going to be economically or socially damaging to the State.  If we were aware of a serious issue, I could not see the board agreeing to sell in those circumstances.  Other than that, we must put it on the market and go for the best price and the best commercial outcome.  It is a hackneyed phrase but, in terms of the social dividend of NAMA, the best one is to repay the senior debt and subordinated debt and generate a surplus.  That is done by selling assets and loans.</p></speech>

The market is very small and dependent on support from the UK Government.  There were signs of that support declining.  We had to take a view of the Northern Ireland economy as a microcosm.  It is not like the Republic of Ireland, which is coming out of recession.  The board had to take a strategic view when a reverse offer was made.  We marketed the portfolio with open bidding.  Eventually, out of nine original bidders two people made a bid and we took the bid from service.  The board took the view that when we considered our projected outlook for that portfolio in terms of our impairment exercise it was strategically sensible to get the money now and get out of the portfolio in one go.</p></speech>

The NTMA reviewed what was happening internationally and took the view that six months for the senior people was reasonable and three months was appropriate for the less senior people.</p></speech>

It seemed incredible that, when there is a huge problem of homelessness and NAMA offered people property, the initial rejection rate was approximately 70%.  It may have improved.  It is bizarre that a country with a problem of homelessness would reject property that NAMA can offer.</p><p>  Does Mr. McDonagh want to answer my questions in a bundle or take that one now?</p> <p>In December 2012 we offered 2,000 units.  Initially the rejection rate was very high and they were slow in making a decision.  Much of this was caused by the structural change whereby the Government wanted to give money for leasing instead of for capital.  That took a time to be resolved by the approved housing bodies and local authorities.  We have now offered 5,500 units and 2,200 have been identified as being suitable for acceptance and they are currently considering a further 500 units.  There are 2,500 out of 5,500.  NAMA is more than happy to make these available.  We do not make the decision about whether they accept them.  The main issue rests with the local authorities.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government informs us that there is an issue about concentration in an effort to keep social housing at approximately 20% for the purposes of social cohesion.  Some units might be in some locations where there is not a huge demand.  Certain approved housing bodies have a demand for one-bedroom units.  However, we do not have a significant number of one-bedroom units in the portfolio - typically we have two and three-bedroom units.  There is a range of issues.  Our job is to make them available and it is for others to decide whether to take up the offers.</p></speech>

I refer to question No. 24 on page 15.  The sales of properties in individual lots would have required the displacement of existing tenants.  The Seanad debated this matter with the former Minister, Deputy Shatter.  I am not sure that tenants have no rights in those situations.  NAMA would certainly be more popular if it were selling in individual terms.  We had correspondence with the then Minister, Deputy Shatter, about the case of a buy-to-let person who goes broke and that the right is against that person.  If the tenant can show that he or she has been paying rent the whole time the idea that the sale of a property automatically has the displacement of the existing tenants - even if they are compliant - seems to me to be strange.  However, that is how the sentence reads on page 15.</p></speech>

When the unit is sold by debtors and receivers, if a sitting tenant has a lease registered with the PRTB then the tenant maintains his or her abode.  I am aware that when some financial institutions want portfolios sold they will insist that existing tenants are put out in order to sell the property with vacant possession.  NAMA does not promote that policy.  We have sold portfolios recently and the existing tenants have remained in place because it was just a change in ownership, as the Senator said.</p></speech>

Why in your opinion is there a continuing lack of supply in the rental sector?  What constraints in the development of new units exist?  If they are bank-related, explain why or else a high yield is not sufficient to cover the cost of capital for the Irish banking sector which is borrowing at very low rates at present.  Is there a regulatory limitation, i.e., planning, that is causing the persistent supply-demand disequilibrium?</blockquote>I refer to the reply which I spoke about under &quot;Matters Arising&quot;.  I refer to the last sentence of the first paragraph which reads, &quot;Given that construction costs have been relatively stable over the last decade commercial viability is largely determined by projected sales prices.&quot;  Is that not the problem that everybody else in this State, including NAMA, has adjusted costs downward and the construction industry has not done so and it is waiting to be bailed out again?  Agriculture, industry, retail, everyone else, used this recession to restructure their operations and public service pay was reduced and that is the point made by NAMA.  I do not know whether it is in the planning laws or the fact that construction expects to be bailed out and it enjoyed its millionaire status up to 2007.  How do we get an efficient construction industry which is able to negate the NAMA statement that given that construction costs remain relatively stable for a decade when everyone else has taken quite substantial declines?  How do we get an efficient construction industry? </p></speech>

Some of the costs cannot be controlled within the State because there may be material costs which are affected by international pricing, like steel, for example.  In general, house building is driven by bricks and mortar much of which is produced domestically.  In my personal view the construction sector is no different to any other sector in that it should respond to the market.  As the Senator says, the issue of competitiveness is very important.  What we are seeing is that the cost of construction is one thing but the sales prices had gone below the cost of construction so therefore no private sector would fund the building of new housing units in that scenario.  The sales prices have now gone slightly ahead in certain parts of the market.  There are probably competitive issues to be considered.  We have had a very vibrant construction industry but many of the skills have left the industry because of the downturn.  We are trying to build back that capacity but the danger is that the scarcity of skills would drive up costs and that would not be helpful for the funding of new supply to the market.  That is an aspect which the construction industry should examine.</p></speech>

I know that is anticipated over a longer period of time.  There is a reference to the UBS study.  NAMA has a mandate to put the returns into the Exchequer.  If we were to allow all the asset prices to fall, would that not be a boost to the economy if house prices were to go down?  Would it not be a boost to industrial competitiveness?  Is there a case to just walk away after a certain number of years and let the purchasers of land, buildings and houses benefit from the so-called glutted market?  Many economists are fairly sanguine about bankruptcy; they regard it as a transfer of assets from people who have obviously failed to another generation who might fail but one keeps going in the hope that somebody else will not fail, the hope being that the assets will eventually go to people who will be efficient in their use.  Bankruptcy is one of the punishments for creating property bubbles or being generally inefficient.  Did the UBS report say that to run away quickly would cost NAMA &euro;2.9 billion and to run away slowly would cost &euro;1.4 billion?  It might be for the good of the rest of the economy if that did happen.</p></speech>

The information in the reply is that NAMA has spent almost &euro;77 million on insolvency practitioners, which I assume refers to receivers and liquidators which have been appointed at NAMA's behest, and that 53 firms in Ireland were put on a panel.  How many of those firms got work in terms of being appointed as a receiver or liquidator?  It appears that the same names are mentioned whenever liquidators or receivers are appointed.

It is also outlined in our statement for 2015, which was published yesterday or the day before by the Department of Finance.  It is quite straightforward.  It is 50% redemption of senior debt by the end of this year, which is already achieved as of today, 80% redemption by the end of 2016 and accelerating that disposal where we can to take advantage of the current strong investor interest in Irish assets.  Side by side with that, we move beyond the senior debt to the subordinate debt and to the possibility of a return on top of that, which we spoke about earlier.</p><p>  Along with that, we have two other key mandates at present.  One relates to facilitating the provision of housing in areas of most need and the other is facilitating the development of the docklands strategic development zone area, where we have 13 sites.</p><p>  That is the overall strategy.  As with any strategy, we keep it under review all of the time.  However, the view of the board is that if the property and economic recovery remains quite good and if we can retain the staff we need to do our job, which is a key risk, NAMA will have finished its work, in terms of its senior and subordinated debt repayment, by the end of 2017 or early 2018.  If we continue in the provision of housing or in respect of the docklands, obviously those are two specific objectives which could take a little longer.</p></speech>

I was watching some of the proceedings on the monitor.  Up to 90% of the assets have been bought by US funds.  On the one hand, NAMA says that what the purchaser does with the assets subsequent to buying them is a commercial matter for themselves, but on the other hand it says that if it knew they were going to make decisions that would be damaging to the Irish economy, the NAMA board would not sign off on that disposal.  It appears to be a contradiction.  Does NAMA ask a prospective purchaser what they intend to do with an asset they are buying?</p></speech>

However, we do not live in a bubble.  We know the type of entities with which we are dealing.  The point I made earlier was probably left a little up in the air, sort of a suggestion that if NAMA was aware that a purchaser was going to do damage that we would just wash our hands of that.  We certainly would not.</p></speech>

This meeting follows a visit to Colombia earlier this year by a delegation from ICTU.  A couple of weeks ago the joint committee met the recently appointed Colombian ambassador to Ireland, His Excellency Mr. N&eacute;stor Osorio, and a number of issues were discussed at that meeting.  As it is quite likely that in the near future the D&aacute;il will consider the free trade agreement between the European Union and Colombia and Peru, this meeting is timely in view of recent and ongoing events.<br/>Before we proceed, I remind committee members, delegates and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even when left in silent mode, with the recording equipment in committee rooms.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/>I welcome from ICTU Mr. Peter Bunting, Ms Aileen Morrissey and Mr. Tom Geraghty and from SIPTU Mr. Jack O'Connor.  I thank them for appearing before the committee.  We will begin with Mr. Bunting.</p></speech>

I also thank Oireachtas staff members for their assistance.  </p><p>  Let me introduce my colleagues.  Mr. Tom Geraghty is a member of the executive council of ICTU and general secretary of the Public Service Executive Union, PSEU; Ms Aileen Morrissey is also a member of the executive council of ICTU and a member of the Mandate trade union; while Mr. Jack O'Connor who needs no introduction is a former president of ICTU and the current president of SIPTU.  We were part of a joint British-Irish delegation that travelled to Colombia in July and would like to share some of what we witnessed and experienced.</p><p>  Some 2,500 trade unionists have been assassinated in the past 15 years in Colombia which holds the unenviable status of being the most dangerous country on Earth in which to be a trade union organiser, activist, official or member.  It also holds another unacceptable record - a 1% conviction rate for such murders.  However, concern about its abysmal human rights record and capacity to honour international agreements is neither new nor the sole preserve of trade unions.  In the context of these hearings, it is worth recalling that the original US-Colombia free trade agreement, the model for the current deal with the European Union, was postponed by US lawmakers because of their unease and anger at Colombia's record.</p> <p>It was only rescued when a labour action plan was drawn up and signed in 2011 to guarantee and underpin trade union and human rights in Colombia.  Under the plan, the Colombian authorities gave firm undertakings in key areas related to human and trade union rights, but, to date, they have failed to honour these commitments, according to the Colombian and US labour movements and US lawmakers.  A 2013 report by two Democratic members of a congressional monitoring group - George Miller and Jim McGovern -&ndash; concluded that: "The Government of Colombia is woefully falling short of compliance with the Labor Action Plan, and in many cases, these shortfalls have made working conditions for workers worse than before it came into effect".</p><p> For us, this gives rise to some crucial questions.  If Colombia cannot or will not honour commitments made to the US Government, what capacity does the European</p><p>Union have to hold its government to account?  Second, what is the big rush to ratify the agreement and what is the reason for the undue haste to ratify the</p><p>FTA?  The European Commission has confirmed that there is no firm deadline for this process.  Given the widespread concerns raised in all quarters, we surely owe it to the people of Colombia to take a little more time and explore how we could use this process to help them to bring about positive change in their country.  We should remember that under the proposed FTA, we would have even less capacity to call the Colombian authorities to account for human rights violations than under existing</p><p>conditions.</p><p> Trade unionists in Colombia have endured murder and arbitrary detention and forcibly disappeared.  To this day, Colombia retains its unenviable reputation as the world&rsquo;s "most dangerous country" in which to be a trade union activist.  There is an extremely high level of impunity in the assassination of trade unionists.  These murders did not occur in the distant past; between 2011 and 2014, under the rule of President Santos, some 73 trade unionists have been murdered, while a further six have forcibly disappeared and 1,000 are under death threat.  On Monday of this week an NGO worker who had been protecting trade unionists trying to organise in an oilfield was murdered by paramilitaries.  </p><p> In addition, some 75 land rights activists have been murdered in the past four years.  We travelled to Putumayo where we heard testimony from the families of four young men who had been murdered not years ago but early this year.  Following our visit, on 14 September, another person whom we had met in Putumayo was murdered.  Less than 1% of the target agreed by the government for the return of land within two years has been achieved, while the authorities routinely renege on agreements with rural communities and indiscriminate bombings by the military are used to forcibly displace campesinos from their land and sever water supplies.</p><p> There is a need for an independent commission to investigate state assassinations of trade unionists, politicians, students, land rights activists and progressives unconnected with the guerrillas and state conflict.  To date, there has been no place on the agenda of the ongoing peace talks in Havana for key issues such as state crimes and collusion with right-wing paramilitaries.  The state has attempted to portray itself as a minor actor in the conflict.  The military budget has increased, despite the peace and conflict resolution process being at the core of official government policy.  A proposed truth commission has been replaced by an historical commission.  As we all know on this island, truth recovery is an imperative for those progressive social organisations which have been stigmatised and brutalised for fighting for democratic inclusiveness.</p><p> A total of seven million workers in this very wealthy country have no social security benefits.  Eleven million of the 18 million workers operate in the informal economy.  A total of 58% of public sector workers are on temporary contracts where collective bargaining is not permitted in the public service.  If a person is one of the 11 million on temporary contracts, under the labour code, he or she is not allowed to join a trade union.  Companies force workers into a "collective pact", which ensures organised labour in some enterprises receives lower wages and terms of conditions through collective bargaining.  The practice of collective pacts is illegal under Colombian law but only three cases have ever been brought to court since 2011.  </p><p> Riot police are used to oppress trade union activists in the workplace.  On 7 July a trade union leader was so badly beaten that he lost his eye.  Trade unions are stigmatised and excluded organisations and union density is below 4% owing to years of state and paramilitary attacks on union leaders and members.  A law giving protection to workers in co-operatives who are akin to temporary agency workers in the European Union or granting compensation to such workers who have accidents at work has never been applied, although it is contained in the labour action plan signed by the US Government.  </p><p> Corruption is rife.  A former agricultural Minister under former President Uribe has been jailed for 17 years for channelling subsidies meant for peasants to land owners.  President Santos who views multinational corporations as "engines of the economy" has failed to deliver on promises to reform the criminal code in respect of collective pacts and failed to halt the arbitrary imprisonment of trade unionists.  The proposed FTA contains are no binding clauses to protect the health and safety of workers.  </p><p> I will pass over to  my colleagues, Ms Morrissey and Mr. Geraghty, for their observations.</p></speech>

Soacha is a poor suburb of Bogot&aacute;.  They were the mothers of the victims of the so-called "False Positives".  I see them as the mothers of young sons who were executed.  These murders were committed with impunity by the army which then claimed the boys were guerrillas killed in combat in order to allow the soldiers to qualify for a bonus.  Because of this bonus of a pay increase, additional holidays or promotion which results in a high body count, young men from poor areas are fair game as far as the soldiers are concerned.</p><p>  Picture us sitting in the home of one of these mothers with five other mothers present, hearing their testimonials of how their sons, some of whom had been as young as 16 years, had been lured away on the false promise of work or taken off the local bus on their way home never to be seen again.  One mother told us that her son had been missing for days and that his body had then been discovered in the hospital morgue.  Another described how her son had to retrieve his younger brother's body from a mass grave and the terrible memories he had of that experience.  A mother told me she had no more tears and pleaded with me to speak about her son who had gone to take up an offer of work to support his four young children.  However, there was no work and he was murdered by the army.  Following the return of his body, his brother went about the neighbourhood asking what had happened to him.  The army beat him and threw him off a bridge, leaving him for dead.  He did not die but had broken his back.  His mother was raising her first son's four young children and now had a son in a wheelchair.  Over time, the doctors in the hospital in Bogot&aacute; had performed a series of operations and he had learned to walk again.  However, three weeks later, soldiers shot him three times in the head.  His mother has lost so much, yet she still speaks of peace.  </p><p>  These testimonials gave witness to what had happened to the boys and men in question, but the testimonial that impacted on me the most was that of a mother, Maria Doris Tejeda, who had not had her son's body returned.  She has been waiting for years for his return, but in her heart she knows that he is dead.</p><p>  When these mothers take cases on behalf of their sons, they are frustrated within the legal system by unwarranted delays.  Cases must be addressed in a timely fashion.  How often have we heard the expression that justice delayed is justice denied?  There must be a guarantee that human rights violations will be tried in civilian courts and that the military justice reform Bill will not be used to widen the reach of the military courts in order that they can hear these cases.  The Colombian ambassador made reference to this issue on 9 October, but I ask how the military courts can be given the power to judge cases such as those of the False Positives?</p> <p>We have seen how women have been the front runners in peace processes, not only here in Ireland but in other areas of conflict.  The mothers of Soacha are no different.  They are calling for and working for peace, yet they are the victims of death threats for speaking out.  Their determination to seek justice and peace is remarkable.</p><p> These mothers remind me of people in my own neighbourhood.  I could put names to the faces and so could the members.  This issue is the members' issue and it is mine.  Our world is like a village and these people are part of that village.  Article 2 of the free trade agreement, of its nature, is not strong enough to force improvements in the human rights situation in Colombia.  The best chance of improving the situation is to use the leverage this agreement gives to call for human rights improvements before the agreement is implemented.  We ask the Government to show that we in Ireland support human rights, to oppose this agreement in the clear understanding that doing so would give an opportunity for the development of real improvements on the ground and in neighbourhoods such as Soacha.</p><p> I have told the Government the plight of the mothers of Soacha, as I promised them on 21 July 2014.  I thank the members for listening.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.482" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom Geraghty" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014102200005#D00200"><p>I want to be clear about what we are asking of the committee and the Oireachtas.  Ireland is due to ratify a free trade agreement between the EU and Colombia and we are asking that, at the very least, it be delayed.  We are here to share our experiences of Colombia and explain why we feel it should happen.  We are not na&iuml;ve and do not expect that a small group of trade unionists from Ireland alone will stop the human rights abuses in Colombia and suddenly achieve a dramatic improvement in the situation there.  A group of trade unionists appearing in this forum with a message about the oppression of trade unionists is not a message that would necessarily resonate with everybody in these Houses.  However, while it is true, as Mr. Bunting said, that Colombia is the worst country in the world in which to be a trade unionist, this is a subset of a much larger problem.  The real problem with Colombia is that it is a state whose forces murder its own citizens with impunity.</p><p>  Ms Morrissey described the situation of the women we met in Soacha.  Members of the state military forces, not paramilitaries, murdered perhaps as many as 2,000 young men in order to make it appear the state was winning the ongoing civil war against FARC.  They enticed these young men, who had nothing to do with FARC or trade unions, to a particular place where they murdered them in their thousands.  This was done by state forces who are supposed to be under the control of a Government that seeks to enter a free trade agreement with us.  That is a reason for us to delay the agreement, at the very least.</p><p>  In addition to the experience we had with these poor, unfortunate mothers, we visited a number of other parts of Colombia, including the province of Putumayo, an oil rich region close to the border with Ecuador.  One can see oil rigs at regular intervals there.  There has been an ongoing problem there in that once land is deemed to be valuable, the people who live on it are displaced without any great ceremony or effort to compensate them.  They are pushed off the land, it is taken and the resources are exploited.  Although many oil tankers travel through this area, the roads are unpaved.  The oil companies could not even be bothered to pave them, and the local government could not be bothered to make them do so.  This gives an idea of how much the state values the lives of its citizens.</p><p>  In those circumstances, it is not surprising that there is civil resistance.  When we were there, the local people had lifted some of the rudimentary wooden bridges to prevent the oil tankers from driving across them.  As Mr. Bunting said, a few months before we visited, four people were murdered by the state authorities, not by paramilitaries, including a 16 year old boy.  Since we have been there, one of the people we met has been murdered.  At the very least, the state is not in control of its own forces and, perhaps, has no intention of trying to exert any great control over them.</p><p>  We also visited the port of Buenaventura.  It was perhaps the most poverty-stricken place I have ever been.  It was comparable to the villages one would see in sub-Saharan Africa, which is extraordinary when one considers that it is the busiest port in Colombia.  There is no sign of any of the wealth one would associate with a port trickling down to the people who live in those communities.  What is particularly noteworthy about Buenaventura is that it is in the grip of right-wing paramilitaries.  These are organised gangs established by landowners and businesses to protect them in the context of the civil war and which have since developed a life of their own.  One can easily recognise them in Buenaventura because it is predominantly Afro-Colombian, and these people are white.  They openly fraternise with the security forces on the streets and no serious attempt is made to control them.</p><p>  We met the bishop of Buenaventura, an elderly, worn-out, but good and decent man making a serious effort to do something about the situation in his city and getting absolutely no help whatsoever from the authorities.  He reports horrific, almost unimaginable atrocities to the authorities.  One of the ways the paramilitaries exert control and terrorise the local population is that anybody who crosses them is chopped to pieces with machetes in what they call chop houses, which are no more than shacks, in the middle of communities.  The screams of these poor people are used to terrorise the local population and, thereby, continue the control of the paramilitaries.</p><p>  The Colombian Government&rsquo;s narrative is attractive and seductive.  On our last day, we met the Government representatives.  Their narrative is that the situation is terrible, it is a consequence of the civil war, the Government is doing its best to end the civil war and, hopefully, it will all go away.  We met various people who are representatives of different commissions on human rights within different parts of the state.  I am sure the people concerned were genuine and earnest.  They were predominantly very well educated young women and spoke perfect English with American accents.  While I do not doubt the sincerity of their conviction in trying to get to grips with the situation there, it does not matter.  All these commissions in the military, police and other state agencies are not stopping the killing.  Whatever the good intentions, the translation of those intentions into an impact on the ground is not evident, in fact it is the opposite.  Considerable brutality is directed against the citizens by state forces which are unchecked and act with absolute impunity.</p> <p>One might be cynical and take the view that much of this activity about establishing commissions on human rights is window-dressing to appease the sort of demands that came from the United States during its negotiation of the free trade agreement, as well during the one with the European Union.  One might be led to that conclusion when one visits Colombia and sees the ongoing abuses, not by paramilitaries or the FARC, but by state forces.  The Colombian Government has developed this attractive narrative that this is a thing of the past, that it is moving into a new future and that the free trade agreement will enable it to do all of this.  However, at the same time, it pays no serious attention to dealing with the abuses of human rights in the country.  For that reason, we ask the Irish Government to delay, at the very least, the ratification of this treaty and use it as an opportunity to bring some pressure to bear on the Colombian Government, as it is susceptible to pressure on this issue.  The Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, intends to visit several European countries in November.  While Ireland is not on his itinerary, we could make it of interest for him to come here if he were of the view Ireland was unlikely to ratify this particular treaty.  We want to share that message with the committee in the hope that the elected representatives of our people will take a stand beside the people of Colombia who are under the oppression of their own authorities.</p></speech>

From what I heard, the delegation painted a grim picture of the human rights and labour rights positions in Colombia.  This committee would not have dealt with the free trade agreement between the European Union and Colombia as it would have been before the enterprise and innovation committee.  I presume the delegation has spoken to our colleagues on that committee too.</p><p>  When this committee met with groups during the negotiations of the EU-US trade agreement, there was a consensus there should be no dumbing down of rights to reach an agreement.  I believe we should always start off from that particular base.  Europe is an important source of trade to Colombia, with the EU its second largest export market after the United States and a significant source of substantial foreign direct investment.  Accordingly, Europe should have much clout when forging a deal.</p><p>  Under no circumstances should Europe be party to a deal where people are denied basic human and labour rights.  The agreement was signed in 2012.  Was the European trade union movement active in lobbying the European Parliament in this regard?  How receptive was the European Parliament to the views put forward by the European trade union movement?</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il believes we should not have trade agreements with any country where basic civil and labour rights are denied to people.  The loss of life under the regime in Colombia, from what the delegation has outlined, is intolerable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014102200006#E00300"><p>First, I have to alert the committee that I was part of the delegation that went to Colombia with Mr. Peter Bunting, Mr. Tom Geraghty and Ms Aileen Morrissey.  As I saw the conditions on the ground, I support 100% the reports they have made today.  During the visit, we saw the most frightening human rights abuses.  Colombia is a highly militarised society with troops everywhere.  What is really astounding is the thousands of bodyguards present everywhere.  Every politician had three or four bodyguards.  Even the trade union and human rights activists are afforded bodyguard protection.  The areas where mineral wealth and oil is being extracted are denuded with soil erosion a significant problem on the hillsides.  These areas are given only token social benefits.  The river crossings for oil tankers, for example, are primitive structures, basically planks of wood.  There is chaos in the development of the port in Buenaventura.  There are no economic or social benefits to any of the local groups in these areas.<br/>I welcome this timely debate.  Anyone who is suspicious that what has been recounted is just the view of trade union officials who are only fighting on behalf of their own members, I would advise them to read the reports of <i>The Guardian</i>journalist, Seumas Milne, who accompanied the group.<br/>We must acknowledge the trade union movement in the main is bearing the brunt of human rights attacks.  These trade agreements were supposed to improve the human rights conditions for people living in Colombia.  As has been pointed out, the American agreement built in clauses recognising human rights elements of labour law.  It has been proved and documented that these have not been fully implemented.  Any debate about the European Union free trade agreement with Colombia slipped underneath the radar.  I had problems trying to locate it in the system.  I assume the Council of Ministers adopted the agreement which in turn now needs to be ratified by national parliaments.  I support the argument that we go slow on the ratification of this agreement.<br/>I thank the Oireachtas Library and Research Service which produced a phenomenal amount of documentation as to what is going on in Colombia.  I thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for its sophisticated briefings and its Latin American-Caribbean unit.  I do not know who is in the unit but we must ensure it is familiar with what we observed in Colombia.  Accordingly, before there are any further developments in ratifying this treaty, we should engage with the unit with the view that it should be our eyes and ears on the ground and go into the areas in Colombia in which we have been.  There are significant concerns among various non-governmental organisations working in these areas.</p> <p>The bishop is just a tragic example of a man who has almost been beaten by the criminality in his region.</p><p> We need further reassurance that there is someone within the Department who is examining what is happening on the ground.  That individual should be in regular contact with the committee in order that it would have at its disposal the information necessary to allow it to apply as much pressure as possible on the Government of Colombia.  </p><p> I compliment President Santos on engaging in the peace process.  In view of the fact that three terrorist organisations, including FARC, control between one quarter and one third of the territory of Colombia, there is no point in pretending that this does not inevitably create a conflict between the state, its forces and those involved in terrorism.  Given our history, we should make it known to President Santos, through the Colombian ambassador if necessary, that we would be happy to engage in facilitating the next important stage in the peace process, to which there are six key elements, on four of which broad agreement has been reached.  The other two remain outstanding.  The theory is that peace will not come to Colombia until those involved on all sides reach agreement on each of the six elements to which I refer.  We are in a very powerful and influential position in encouraging the ambassador to deliver a message to the President that we would be happy to engage, use the experience of civil servants here who have been involved in the globally acclaimed peace process in Northern Ireland and assist in any way possible.  </p><p> If Colombia remains in a state of constant conflict, human rights will inevitably be abused.  The President uses a very unsavoury tactic in dealing with representatives of civil society, trade unionists, the religious and academics.  If it is hinted in the Parliament of Colombia that somebody is connected to FARC, even though that person might only be explaining his or her political philosophy, he or she can be killed.  Once one's character is attacked by any of the political forces in parliament, one is certainly vulnerable to being murdered.  I ask that our civil servants, in conjunction with the committee, engage in a proactive way with President Santos on the peace process, while simultaneously pursuing the issue of human rights.</p><p> Colombia is a country with great potential, but it is in a sad state.  In the context of the trade agreement, the Colombian Government's website states, "Parties to the agreement must ensure that internationally-recognised human rights and democratic principles &ndash; including labour rules &ndash; are observed and upheld".  That is its interpretation of the agreement.  However, the delegates have just explained that human rights are not being respected and that the relevant democratic principles are not being applied.  I appeal to the committee to support the Government in despatching someone from the Latin America and Caribbean unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to operate on the ground in Colombia and report back to us in order that we might engage in dialogue with the Colombian authorities.  There is no point in international agreements being signed in Brussels if they are not going to be honoured.  As the Chairman is aware, the committee has a strong commitment to human rights.  In fact, that commitment is one of the foundations on which the committee was built.  It would be a sad day for the committee and Ireland if the Government were to ratify an agreement in the full knowledge that human rights abuses were taking place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.487" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1026" speakername="Olivia Mitchell" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014102200007#F00200"><p>I have not visited Colombia, but I have read about the sad events there.  The conflict in Colombia has been ongoing for 60 years and the country is highly militarised and unstable and guerrilla groups continue to operate.  One of our guests indicated that it was one of the most dangerous places in which to be a trade unionist.  With the possible exception of Congo, it is definitely the most dangerous place in which to be a woman.  The number of rapes carried out with absolute impunity and the level of abuse of women are unbelievable.  Colombia also has the highest number of displaced persons in the world, with some 6 million out of their homes or off their land.</p><p>  Where does one start when dealing with a country such as Colombia?  There is a peace process of sorts, while lip service is being paid to human rights and so on.  It is clear that everyone in Colombia was suddenly going to espouse democracy overnight.  On the one hand, one can accept the argument to the effect that a free trade agreement would lead to economic and social development and facilitate the growth of democracy.  One the other, however, such agreements lead to land and resources increasing in value and, as a result, they become all the more vulnerable to being seized by those who have from those who do not.  What does one do in such a situation?  The EU authorities are hell bent on proceeding with the agreement, but is there not a level of awareness among them of what is happening in Colombia.  It is difficult to believe there is such a level of awareness at government level in all EU member states.</p><p>  Our guests are probably aware that the Colombian ambassador came before us last week.  There is a charm offensive taking place.  Like Deputy Eric Byrne, I am concerned that once the agreement is ratified, the issue of human rights may fall of the agenda altogether.  The Colombian authorities have made commitments to restore people's land, but these are not being honoured by a long shot.  Therefore, we should proceed slowly on this agreement and sup with a long spoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.488" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014102200007#F00300"><p>Our guests have painted a very dismal picture.  Despite this, however, we must acknowledge how the people of Colombia keep going in the face of threats, persecution, assassination, the undermining of their rights and the fact that their lives are continually in danger.  The fact that Colombia is the seventh most unequal country in the world and the third most unequal in Latin America sums up everything we are discussing.  Part of the reason for the inequality in Colombia is the way in which workers are treated.  We are aware that people who engage in peaceful protests in Colombia can be murdered, assassinated, imprisoned, etc.  That is frightening, appalling and sometimes difficult to believe.  Our guests are trade union officials and if they were citizens of Colombia, three or four of them could be dead by now and the others might be in prison.  What we are discussing is basic human and employment rights.  I sent letters to the previous Colombian ambassador about all of the issues to which I refer and raised them again with his successor at last week's meeting.  I also wrote to the former T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in connection with them.  The reply I received from him contained a commitment to the effect that Ireland would continue to support activities in Colombia that promoted peace, truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation and progressive improvement in human rights.  I have no doubt that his successor will continue his work in that regard.</p><p>  It is difficult to believe all we can do is delay matters.  The free trade agreement is going to be signed.  It is incredible that all of the abuses to which we refer are going to continue and that the agreement is not going to provide any guarantee to the effect that the lives of workers in Colombia will improve.  How did we reach the point where all Ireland can do is delay the signing of the agreement?  What has been happening elsewhere?  When we discussed another matter with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, a couple of weeks ago, I stressed that human rights issues and decent working conditions must be up for discussion in all negotiations on trade agreements, particularly those relating to countries with a history of serious human rights abuses.</p> <p>The peace talks are a separate issue and there cannot be a trade-off in this context to allow the peace treaty to be signed.  Everyone wants peace, but it must be peace with justice.  For the peace treaty to be signed, the trade-off cannot be that the free trade agreement will be signed also.  </p><p> The companies involved all have bases in Europe and the United States.  Although perhaps not directly involved, what is happening is leading to land grabs and displacements.  Are the representatives involved in a naming and shaming exercise of these companies which seem to be acting with impunity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.490" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014102200008#G00200"><p>I welcome all of the delegates.  They have said they were struck by the levels of poverty and inequality in society in Colombia, but I was struck by the level of wealth.  Ireland would love to have Colombia's natural resources but without the conflict.</p><p>  I found the remarks made, particularly about the US-Colombia free trade agreement, illuminating.  That agreement sets the bar for what we are trying to achieve.  Reference has been made to the fact that many of the historical promises made to increase protection and improve conditions for workers and activists have yet to be realised.  We would all like to see the European Union take up that issue, if the agreement goes ahead.  The Union has strong human rights provisions in the free trade agreement with Israel, yet it has not forced it to improve its human rights record in that regard.  The same argument could be made in this context and shame on the Union for not doing so.  Do the delegates believe the free trade agreement process should be suspended until there has been a thorough investigation of human rights issues and assessment of the economic impact of a free trade agreement?  It would be a stalling mechanism.  When we met a trade unionist on Friday here, he asked if Ireland would stand up for the poor people of Colombia.  </p><p>  Deputy Olivia Mitchell mentioned the land issue and the victims and land restitution law, which has been heralded.  My understanding is that less than 1% of the land has been restituted and that even though this was part of the overall agreement, the government has not followed through on it.  </p><p>  We know that Colombia has 17 free trade agreements with other countries, particularly in South America, yet it remains the third more unequal country in Latin America and the seventh most unequal in the world.  There are these contradictions.  Do the delegates think there is anything in the agreement that would facilitate greater distribution or sustainable development or are these issues even on the table?  They are part of what we would all like to see, but we are coming from a position where we are trying to halt and have some impact on the agreement.</p><p>  The peace process was mentioned.  My party has played its part in that regard.  We went and talked to anyone who wanted to listen to our experience of the peace process in Ireland.  We made basic suggestions on how they could advance the process.  President Santos will say we need to strengthen his hand and that if he does not get this agreement, he will be undermined and outmanoeuvred by the military.  It has rightly been said the military is the controlling power in Colombia.  Families have rotated in governments and so on, but the military is the key power.  </p><p>  People have taken court cases, but offenders have not been brought in the direction of the courts, which has been a problem.  When we were there, we visited one of the jails and found a guy who was still in it ten years after his sentence had been completed.  One day we went to the shops to buy coffee and saw a man dead on the street.  There was ticker tape around the body and two cops were smoking at the scene, while kids were playing on the street.  We were shocked.  There was no mention of the incident on radio or in the newspapers the next day.  Therefore, life is cheap in Colombia.  It summed up for us the problems in society.  </p><p>  If we can stall the process in some way, it would be useful.  I am conscious that we have agreements with other countries, on which we have not followed through and that perhaps this might be a potential agreement in which we could make a difference and that it would proveful helpful in the talks in Colombia.  I would be interested in hearing the views of the delegates on that issue.  Do they believe that this agreement will be used as part of a charm offensive, particularly across Europe, and what impact will it have?</p></speech>

It is always good, however, to hear from those who have been on the ground and seen what is happening in Colombia.  I also acknowledge the contribution of Deputy Eric Byrne who accompanied the delegation.</p><p>  Obviously, there are major problems.  In this respect Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe referred to the level of wealth in Colombia.  I am beginning to wonder if its wealth of natural resources is more of a hindrance than a help.  It is certainly is contributing significantly to the human rights abuses and the atrocities to which the delegates have referred.</p><p>  We were handed a letter today from Ambassador Osoria in London who referred to the opportunity to pursue the economic and social development of countries.  The letter went on to point to Colombia's commitment to meet all of its international obligations under the treaties of which it is part.  I am not sure what the timescale is for the signing of the agreement.  Is there any possibility we could push for an independent assessment of the level of observance of these international obligations?  If the report from the two Democratic Members of Congress, Mr. Miller and Mr. McGovern, is anything to go by, Colombia is falling well short of complying with its international obligations.  While it has been accepted that the agreement will be signed at some stage, I would like us to proceed with great caution and push for an independent assessment of existing agreements to be made by the European Union before the agreement is formally signed.  Given what we all know, the signing of the agreement would be premature.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.492" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014102200008#G00400"><p>I apologise for arriving late.  I did not get to hear what the delegates had to say, but I have read some of the hand-written submissions which we received from them.  They paint an horrific picture of what is happening in Colombia.  With reference to the Mothers of Soacha, what is the timeline of the offences?  It is stated that in one particular place some of the offences occurred right up to the terms of office of the current regime and President.</p><p>  I note what the delegates said about applying the issue of human rights to the trade agreement.  We need to test if that is what is going to apply.  There has been an issue with Irish aid.  There are many poor people in Colombia as there are in places in which we provide aid.  In attaching conditions to the agreement which may not be met, people, in Africa for instance, may end up being deprived of support.</p> <p>I would have a little bit of a question mark on that.  I suggest we should send the transcript of this debate to the Colombian ambassador and not just ask him for his observations; we should have a meeting with him at which we would go through the specific points that have been raised.  From these meetings, rather than just a generality of complaint, we should try to get something specific and solid to home in on and pursue.  </p><p> There were two things that I picked up on in one of the submissions.  There is a need for an independent commission to investigate the state assassinations of trade unionists, politicians, students and so forth.  I presume some of this is being done under the cover of the conflict that is taking place.  I also presume some of it is being done as a reaction to some of the atrocities the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, FARC, was also committing.  It is probably very difficult to separate those two sometimes.  This is why I like the concept of an independent commission that would be established to bring those who perpetrated crimes to justice.  We still cannot and have not succeeded in bringing, for example, people in the British political system and in the British military and the rest of the political establishment to boot over the atrocities they committed here, like the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, in which they had a very significant role to play.  I think those are travesties and I support what the delegates are trying to do on that. </p><p> There is another thing specifically worthwhile pursuing.  In the free-trade agreement, there are no clauses protecting the health and safety of workers.  I think that would be a very reasonable thing to include in the trade agreement.  I think it is one to which most people would subscribe.  I note from a paper we got from the Oireachtas that the agreement sets out both human rights and sustainable development obligations.  I am not specifically clued in to the actual trade agreement, but I am wondering if the delegates might like to comment on that.  </p></speech>

Ratification by Ireland is therefore subject to prior approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is my intention to shortly seek the necessary approval so that Ireland is in a position to ratify the Agreement.  So far, 17 EU member states have ratified the agreement.<br />Article 1 of the agreement stipulates that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights and for the rule of law is an essential element of the agreement. During the negotiation of the agreement, Ireland strongly promoted the inclusion of provisions to reflect this essential element.<br />The inclusion of a sustainable development chapter in the agreement provides the EU with an important means to contribute to supporting positive social reforms and to the greater protection of human rights in Colombia.  Furthermore, the setting up of a special committee, with representatives from Colombian civil society, to monitor implementation of the sustainability provisions demonstrates how the EU can develop real leverage for promoting its values and expectations through this agreement.<br />The elaboration by Colombia and Peru of roadmaps on human rights, labour rights and environmental protection in October 2012 clearly demonstrates how the agreement can incentivise an agenda for change.  Against this background, I believe the Agreement with Colombia will be instrumental in encouraging economic and social progress reinforced by arrangements that strengthen the voice and role of civil society in favour of the progressive development human and labour rights.  This is also recognised by the European Parliament that last year voted to approve the agreement.</blockquote>I expect the committee will engage with the Minister who is going to be involved in this issue at the earliest possible date.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade will have a role and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has given his indication as to what is expected from the agreement.  Having regard to the views expressed by the committee members, it is incumbent on the European institutions, prior to the signing of the agreement, and during the course of its operation, which is, according to reports, inevitable, to monitor and to ensure that the issues raised here would be brought to the attention of the authorities there with a view to ensuring that the issues that the witnesses have very correctly raised are dealt with.  <br/>I want to particularly thank the delegates for the itemisation of the various incidents that they have brought to the attention of the committee which are obviously beneficial to the committee and beneficial to the Ministers in their perusal of the degree to which the agreement will operate in favour of civil society and the protection of human and civil rights. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.495" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Bunting" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014102200009#H00300"><p>Deputy Smith asked the question, "Did it slip by us?"  Not necessarily.  There was Justice for Colombia.  We are working with people from the Trades Union Congress, TUC, and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU.  When it got to the Parliament, the problem was that it was opposed mostly by the Spanish group of MEPs, even the Socialist Party, because of their relationship with Colombia.  There was a roadmap of progress and it was dumbed down to such an extent it ended up that it was not worth the paper it was written on.  So it was actually down to the Spanish MEPs and even the Socialist Party MPs in Spain who did not help.  We have a request in to meet the jobs and enterprise committee.  That is where we were on Europe.  We did attempt to do it in the European Parliament.</p><p>  For Deputy Byrne, who is quite right, we have to acknowledge Santos's role to one extent, namely, that he is the lesser of two evils.  He was better than Uribe.  When it got to the run-off of the last election, all the progressive elements in Colombia - trade unionists, human rights lawyers, civil society organisations and so forth - voted for Santos to keep Uribe out so that it would at least help to build a peace process.  In the sense of the military, he dismissed seven generals and the head of the armed forces.  There is some action here and then there are reactions over there.  </p><p>  Deputy Byrne's proposition on the expertise and intellectual capital of those engaged in the peace process in Ireland is quite valid. On a trip to Colombia, Mark Durkan, Jeffrey Donaldson, Conor Murphy and I met the FARC negotiators in Havana and we spoke about how we did the peace process in Northern Ireland and so forth.  That is a wonderful idea in the sense it would always give Ireland a name for meeting and helping with the peace process there but also utilising Ireland's intellectual capacity, particularly from the Civil Service and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, about moving on the peace process.  We must also remember at this stage that it is only a unilateral ceasefire.  There is no bilateral ceasefire.  FARC is the only element not using violence at the moment.  Bad and all as it is, and we do not hold any candle for FARC, it has declared a unilateral ceasefire, but it is not being reciprocated by the other sides.  Deputy Byrne's suggestion is very welcome and should be utilised because we all also know that there is still not an absence of violence.  Even an absence of violence by itself does not bring about peace, and real peace.  We still have not got the absence of violence in Colombia. </p><p>  There is always the argument that a free trade agreement will assist the most marginalised in countries.  That was raised by Deputy Mitchell and Senator Walsh.  The difficulty there, in many senses, is that the multinational corporations, MNCs, in Colombia are themselves a state within a state.  Some of the people involved have huge control over the areas where the MNCs are located.  There is always an army base beside it.  The managers of the MNCs give instructions to the military which then carries them out.  We have seen that down in Putumayo, near the oil exploration, where they wanted more land and put more peasants off the land because they wanted to dig for oil and so forth.  They are putting the peasants off the land, utilising the military and the riot police.</p><p>  With regard to how we can do things in the EU, let us bear in mind that the US, the greater power in America, could not really change Colombia with their free trade agreement, which resulted in what was termed the Labor Action Plan coming out, which I quote in the presentation.  I also have a handout on that.  The liberty was set on them by Obama and has been ridiculed and not fully implemented.  That is a difficulty we all have. </p> <p>With regard to Deputy O'Sullivan's point on naming and shaming companies, if I understood the Vice Chairman correctly I am not allowed to name them.</p></speech>

Not to name a company, but the ESB purchases a lot of Colombian coal and brings it in through Foynes.  We could start to do something in this regard.  It has agreements and contracts and brings it in from Buenaventura.  We might have leverage in this regard.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe asked whether we should suspend the free trade agreement.  I would hope so but I do not think we will ever get that far.  When it is held up on the premise of seeing real human rights progress and real democracy in action, we have some leverage.  Once the agreement is in operation it will be of no use to us.  I take Deputy Crowe's view on this.  He is also correct that only 1% of the land has been returned.  With regard to the peace process, Mr. Conor Murphy and I were there with parliamentarians from Westminster and they are all playing a positive role in this regard.</p><p>  Senator Mullins asked how we can influence treaties.  This year at its conference the International Labour Organization, ILO, put Colombia on its top 15 hit list for specific mentoring and monitoring of non-implementation of ILO agreements.  This will come down the line in Colombia this year.  I assume we all agree there should not only be independent assessment of the agreements but also, as Senator Walsh stated, an independent commission on who killed whom.  We know that everybody in Northern Ireland is crying out for closure on who did what to whom.  We know how this has infected the peace process to a certain extent.  It is an ongoing issue which will infect it until we deal with it in some form.  They are supposed to be talking about it at present in Stormont, but I do not hold out much hope for an agreement.</p><p>  It is easy to say there is a reaction to FARC, but there are no guerrillas in Buenaventura and the bishop informed us it is largely populated by right-wing paramilitaries.  This is all that is there.  There are no guerrilla movements there so it is not all about reactions.</p><p>  The health and safety of workers is a huge issue.  We would like to test the trade-off between human rights against trade in this context.  This is up to Europe.  From a trade union point of view, a difficulty we have is that Europe has moved away from the social dimension to purely an economic dimension and this has posed difficulties for everybody in Europe with regard to this agreement.</p></speech>

Nobody here suggests our negotiators were in any way slack with regard to including proper provisions for human rights in the treaty or that the EU was in any way remiss.  This probably answers the question Deputy Mitchell posed on what the EU was doing.  It did what it could in a discussion on a free trade agreement and tried to write in all types of guarantees about the protection of human rights.</p><p>  However, the reality is these provisions cannot be implemented in the present situation in Colombia and this is absolutely apparent when one sees what happened with regard to the Colombia-US free trade treaty.  Two Democratic representatives from the United States gave their verdict, having examined what happened to the provisions in the treaty between the US and Colombia, and their report is quite damning.  The Colombian authorities are paying lip service to the provisions on human rights.  They are doing so with the very seductive message, which needs to be clearly out in the open, that this is how to develop as social progress follows economic progress which in itself is facilitated through a free trade agreement and then and only then can one get to grips with human rights.  In the meantime thousands of people will die.  This is an inevitable fact given the nature of the society there because that is what has been happening consistently over the past 50 years.</p><p>  Mr. Bunting and Deputy Byrne made the point that President Santos is considerably better than his predecessor, and there is no denying this.  He has a vision for his country as being much more modern and open to international investment from which consequences will flow, whereas his predecessor had a much more closed view of the maintenance of a rather more traditional society.  However, he is not interested in addressing human rights because he does not have to be.  He understands his country can make trade agreements with the United States and the EU and agree to all sorts of things in respect of human rights and then not have to do anything about them.</p><p>  If he is serious about developing his society into the type of modern society about which he speaks, his position would be strengthened, to answer Deputy Crowe's point, if he is told this cannot happen unless he does X, Y and Z and it is clearly spelled out, and not in the form of roadmaps referred to in the response to the parliamentary question.  This is the type of language we heard from the earnest young women to whom I referred earlier, who spoke to us on behalf of the Government.</p><p>  There is no shortage of roadmaps or declarations about what is required in respect of human rights.  If paper could solve the problem of human rights in Colombia it could be turned into utopia.  They have reports coming out of their ears about what they can or should be doing.  The fact of the matter is it just does not happen.  State forces continue to kill people with impunity.  Until we get past this and get to a situation where state forces understand there are consequences if they murder their own citizens, that the rule of law will be applied to them rigorously and they will not be free to continue to do so, we will not address the problems of human rights in Colombia.  This is a pressure point to try to force the people in control of the country to turn away from the lip service to human rights and actually make them do something about it.  This could be a key to doing so because it is important to Colombia.  If it was not important President Santos would not be visiting a number of states in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

They have been doing so since 2008 but there are still disappeared.  We explained that even though we have a peace process in Ireland we still have issues to deal with such as the disappeared.  These people live in fear every day, even under the present government and after the changes that have been made.</p><p>  With regard to the wealth and poverty, when I was there I called it the country of contradictions and I could not believe it.  Some days after we had been in the slums, meeting people and listening to their testimony, we returned to see an opera house with red carpets, limousines, glamour and the beautiful people going inside.  I found this quite difficult because it was going from one extreme to another.</p><p>  The people we met in government buildings were all experts on human rights, although I do not know what they do for their day job because I did not see very much of it out there.  I am not being flippant when I say this, because this is too serious, but they all introduced themselves as human rights experts.  Honestly I do not know about this because I did not see evidence of it.</p> <p>In the question of the enforcement of human rights clauses in international trade agreements, it is important to understand that Colombia is a deeply dysfunctional society with, for example, quite a progressive written constitution as a result of a constitutional convention way back at the turn of the century.  That constitution and its supreme court, which mirror high standards in developed societies, are being flagrantly disregarded.  In whole swathes of the country decisions of the supreme court just do not run.  If the constitutional authority of the state is flagrantly disregarded how can one begin to think of the clauses of trade agreements being complied with?</p><p> I actually met President Santos.  I was on a human rights delegation when I was president of congress, I believe in 2010.  He had won the election but had not been inaugurated and his predecessor, President Uribe, was making all sorts of trouble for him.  He certainly would not share my world view even though there are those who would say he must have been to the left.  His view is of building a developed capitalist economy.  He is clearly a man who can see the potential to enhance his country.</p><p> However, grip is exercised, not in a coherent structured way, but as a result of dysfunction.  Different groups and powerbrokers exercise influence in different parts of the country geographically and different parts of the apparatus.  People who are in positions of authority as a result of a constitutional process are contaminated, implicated and compromised by things that have happened in the past with which they are associated or things that they failed to do.  That grip is exercised by ruthless paramilitaries.  It is not like incentivising a recalcitrant democracy or pseudo-democracy to act in a positive way.  These people, who exercise this grip, simply do not intend to go out of business.</p><p> As a consequence there is no contest for the constitutional authority - the President - if faced on the one side by these people who can dismantle the society and on the other side by two Democratic senators or MPs and a report that will be shelved somewhere.  Once this thing is signed along the dotted line all of us know as democrats that as long as we are dealing with a constitutional authority that even if it wished to comply with it cannot comply with it, then it is an exercise in pretending that we are all doing things that we know will not happen.</p></speech>

I have been to Colombia where I met the mothers of the victims of the false positives.  I accompanied a solicitor around Colombia during which for the first time in ten years he did not have 24-hour armed protection because he believed travelling with members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, as it was at the time, meant that he was bulletproof.  He proved to be correct, but I found it a very interesting test.</p><p>  I also met two sisters whose father had been chain-sawed to death because he stood up against the paramilitaries and the landowners.  As it was described to us, being chain-sawed to death was done in such a way to keep the victim alive as long as possible in order to ensure that it engendered terror in the community.  A priest suffered that fate because he was galvanising the farmers and the workers against the landlords.  He was kept alive for days in that manner.</p><p>  The establishment of a trade agreement affords an opportunity to put a working human rights clause in it.  We have seen human rights clauses in the Euro-Med agreement between the European Union and Israel.  If there was not a human rights violation in the recent attacks in Gaza, one would probably not find it anywhere.  However, Europe in its wisdom could not find anything in its clause to suspend the trade agreement.  That is an example of a dysfunctional trade agreement with a human rights clause in it.</p><p>  Ireland is one of the countries in Europe that wants a human rights clause - others simply do not want it.  While Ireland is pushing for one, there is no point in having a clause that does not work.  It needs trigger mechanisms and the ability of organisations, trade unions and NGOs throughout Europe and in Colombia to follow a pathway in the event of a human rights violation whereby it would be reported to an independent body - either a European Union body or an international body - to make a determination.  If it determines that there were human rights violations by the Colombian Government the trade agreement would be suspended for three months.  The next violation would lead to a six-month suspension.  That is the wording we would request of the witnesses because I fear it will proceed as it is and will be as dysfunctional as other trade agreements meaning there would be no consequences for governments that perpetrate human rights abuses against their own people and against others.</p></speech>

We have discussed how it is best for the Irish Government to pressurise the Colombian Government into conforming with the human rights and labour rights clauses.  I am learning as I go along.  We have an EU ambassador representing Ireland, Maria Antonia van Gool.  Her thinking about the human rights clauses is very interesting.  She stated:<blockquote>In the end, particularly our trade agreement which contains some of the highest social standards will have an influence.  People will feel supported by what is in the trade agreement and will use it as a backup, they will bring it to the attention of somebody in case it is not respected - parliamentarians, the EU or their own government.</blockquote>So she admits that putting labour rights legislation in place may take some time.  I am drawing attention to that because it would seem that the EU ambassador thinks that the clauses about labour rights and human rights are really there for the NGOs to point them out to President Santos's Government and in that way implement change.  I believe we should invite Ms Maria Antonia van Gool to address the committee.</p> <p>Technically, she is the Irish representative on the ground in Colombia.  She is charged with implementing our human rights and labour rights clauses.  As the committee will be aware, the Irish Government has been strong in insisting on that element of the agreement based on human rights.</p></speech>

It will be taken on board and brought to the attention of the relevant Ministers.  I am sure it can be brought to the attention of the European authorities by way of the relevant committee in the European Parliament which has some influence in that area.  It is acknowledged that we are in the business of influencing positively an agreement between the European Union and two countries, and to the extent that we can do so that will be done.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will also be appraised of the submissions and points made which are important in this context.

It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the draft motions which reflect the requirement set out in section 13(1)(<i>b</i>) of the Irish human rights and equality commission Act 2014 that a resolution be passed by each House of the Oireachtas recommending the appointment of members of a commission, after which the appointments will be made by the President.  The motions were approved by the Government on 14 October 2014 and recommend the appointment by the President of the following persons with effect from 1 November 2014, which is the establishment day for the commission: Emily Logan as Chief Commissioner, Siobh&aacute;n Mullally, Teresa Blake, Orlagh O'Farrell, Mary Murphy, Betty Purcell, Heydi Foster Breslin, Sunniva McDonogh, Ray Murphy, Frank Conaty, David Joyce, Fidele Muwarasibo, Mark Kelly, Kieran Rose and Liam Herrick.<br/>The joint committee had discussions and an exchange of views last year with the members designate of the commission and more recently with the chief commissioner designate, Ms Emily Logan.  Today provides me with an opportunity to speak about the appointments process, which has been - I stress - fully independent of the Government and designed to ensure compliance with the Paris Principles as well as to yield a commission membership that is broadly reflective of Irish society.  I am sure the committee will agree that we have achieved this outcome.  Ms Logan has been nominated by the Public Appointments Service following an independent selection process to serve as chief commissioner of the Irish human rights and equality commission.  Over three years, she has demonstrated a commitment to the protection and advancement of human rights during her time as Ombudsman for Children.  I had the pleasure of working with her in my previous role.  She brings a wealth of experience to this job.<br/>In April 2013, 14 people were appointed as members of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority on an interim basis.  It is relevant to note that the Government agreed in principle at the time to nominate them in due course to be appointed to the Irish human rights and equality commission.  They had been selected by an earlier selection process which was also independent of Government and in line with the Paris Principles, which are the set of UN rules relating to the operation of national human rights institutions.  I note for the information of the joint committee that the independent assessment panel was appointed in 2013 under the chairmanship of the ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  The other members of the panel were Dr. Mary Keys, Ms Sylda Langford, Professor Gerard Quinn and Professor Gerard Whyte, and they were assisted by the Public Appointments Service in running the selection process.  The Government had no role.  I take this opportunity to thank the members of the independent assessment panel for their work.<br/>I take the opportunity, as many Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad did when the legislation was being debated, to pay tribute to the staff of both the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority for the work they have done as individual organisations over the years on equal rights.  They are now embarking on a journey as a single body.  I acknowledge their dedication and patience over the last couple of years as the merger process evolved.  It is obviously a difficult time when an organisation undergoes the kind of change which has had to be undertaken in this case.  I appreciate very much the ongoing commitment to human rights and their work of the organisations in the period.  I pay tribute also to the former commissioners of the Human Rights Commission and the board members of the Equality Authority for the direction and advice they gave to both organisations over the years.  The task ahead is challenging but I reiterate the support of the Government for the new body and its ongoing support for the protection and promotion of human rights.</p> <p>I commend the motion to the committee.</p></speech>

We thank the members of the former Human Rights Commission and Equality Authority for their work in the past.  Regarding the staff of both bodies, we acknowledge that it has been a challenging time for them.</p><p>  The committee had an involvement in the endorsement of the selection panel.  There was an issue at the time, as I understand from UN sources, that perhaps the selection panel might not have been sufficiently independent of the Government; therefore, we were pleased to meet and engage with it and give it an all-party and no-party endorsement.  I wished it a fair wind in its work, which was important.  I thank the departmental staff for facilitating this and the role we were able to play, as a parliamentary committee, to ensure complete independence, both from a national and international perspective.  It was something that had not happened previously and we were very happy to be involved in it.</p><p>  I will hand over to my colleagues shortly, but there is another matter I wish to raise.  Senator Katherine Zappone and other members have been discussing the idea of the committee changing its title to include human rights in it and, possibly, being involved at that level.  It is something we are examining and perhaps the Minister might consider supporting members on that journey.  Other parliaments have parliamentary committees that have oversight functions from a human rights point of view; therefore, it is something we are examining and discussing.</p></speech>

The amalgamation of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority is a positive step forward.  It creates synergies and efficiencies that will create a strong, dynamic organisation that will ensure issues relating to human rights and equality are at the forefront of political discourse and that actions will be taken, as opposed to there being just words, in order that we will have a much more tolerant and equal society.</p><p>  An issue has arisen which I wish to bring to the Minister's attention.  I do not expect her to respond to it today because she probably is not in a position to do so, but there is a situation in Clare County Council in respect of the Equality Tribunal.  There are hundreds of what I consider to be vexatious claims to the Equality Tribunal and, unfortunately, it is costing hundreds of thousands of euro to prepare responses to all of them.  They have all been dismissed, but dozens are coming in every week.  I understand a ministerial order or regulation can be introduced to deal with vexatious claims to the Equality Tribunal.  Perhaps the Minister might take note of this issue and refer back to me at a future time with her thoughts on it.</p></speech>

I echo the Chairman's comments on the process.  The people the Minister is proposing to appoint are excellent choices and a great leader has been chosen as Chief Commissioner.  We look forward to their being able to move forward in their planning process.  I commend the fact that the Government had no role in the process of selection, which speaks strongly to the independence of the commission.  I also acknowledge the great support of the civil servants in the Department throughout this ongoing process which I realise has been difficult at different times.<br/>As the Chairman mentioned, we are investigating including human rights in the title of the committee and in the context of our terms of reference.  That would be an important symbolic move.  It would acknowledge that we were in a new era with the establishment of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  We hope to bring that particular lens to bear in our work on justice, equality and defence matters.<br/>Perhaps the Minister might clarify that the members of the commission will begin their three year or five year term from their date of appointment on 1 November.  They have already been <i>in situ</i>for almost one year, but their official term will begin then.  Second, what were the criteria whereby some commissioners were chosen for three year terms, while others were chosen for five year terms?</p></speech>

Mr. Deaglan O'Briain and Ms Mary McKenna who are accompanying me have put a great deal of work into the development of the legislation and the establishment of the commission.</p><p>  On Report Stage in the Seanad I said I would be fully supportive of the committee in respect of the change to the Title to include human rights.  I believe this should be pursued.</p><p>  Regarding the issue raised by Senator Martin Conway, as it is before the Supreme Court, I will not comment on it.  As the function of that body has been moved to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, that Department would make the decision on the regulations mentioned by the Senator.</p><p>  I can confirm that the body will begin its term from 1 November.  With regard to having three and five year terms, that decision was made by the independent panel.  It decided how to deal with who would have a term of three years or five years.  We do not have any of the details because it was done independently.  The panel obviously worked out its own rationale and agreed on who would have a three year term and who would have a five year term.</p></speech>

It is the culmination of a long process, but it is good to see the commitment shown to strengthening the mechanisms for protecting human rights and incorporating the Equality Authority.  I had been critical of the moves made by the previous Government to weaken and undermine the authority.  I described it as a quiet coup at one stage such was the level of its undermining.  It is great to see such a change in focus and, in particular, the independent appointments process fulfilled in this way.  It is welcome to hear the Minister say she does not know what mechanism was used to decide on who would have three or five year terms.  It is very positive that it was done entirely independently.  Obviously, we have already had hearings on the appointments issue and we also had a hearing with Emily Logan, who will be an excellent Chief Commissioner.</p><p>  My question is about staffing levels in the new body.  I should have checked the current level of staffing and funding for the new body before the meeting, but does the Minister believe it is sufficient to enable it to be effective?  We are conscious that this body has been treading water for some time, unable to be as proactive as the two previous bodies were.  We are hoping for added value with the combination of the two into one entity.  How many staff will there be in the body?  Is there a plan to increase that number in the future or will it stay static?</p></speech>

I met the Chief Commissioner designate and discussed the budget with her.</p> <p>I assured her of both my support and that of my Department in respect the commission's budgetary needs.  In the budget for 2015, we have included an independent Vote.  This means that the money came out of the departmental Vote.  People were of the view that the departmental Vote in respect of the equality portfolio had decreased but that is not the case.  The difference is that it now comes under a separate heading.  The current staffing level is 47 and this will be reviewed as we move forward.  The allocation is &euro;6.3 million, which is an increase of &euro;2 million on the figure for 2013.  When the commission begins its work, the budget will be kept under review.  I am anxious, however, that it will have the funding necessary to allow it to carry out the work which comes within its remit.</p><p> When the legislation was debated in the Seanad, we accepted an interesting amendment tabled by the Senator and Senator Zappone which will allow the commission to initiate investigations on a proactive basis if it is of the view that there are issues to be addressed in particular settings.  To some degree, the size of the budget will depend on the commission's work programme and how it develops.  I reiterate that it will be open to review.  I am very confident that the commission's starting position is good in the context of it getting on with its work.</p></speech>

The assessment panel that was appointed in 2013 was completely independent.  It was chaired by Ms Emily O'Reilly and the other members were Dr. Mary Keys, who is from Galway and a member of the Mental Health Commission, Ms Sylda Langford, chair of the Citizens Information Board, Professor Gerard Quinn, who is from NUI Galway, and Professor Gerard Whyte, who is from Trinity College.  The panel was assisted by the Public Appointments Service in the running of the selection process, which was fully in line with the UN Paris Principles.  Those principles outline how the members of human rights institutions across the globe should be selected.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Carole Brennan, Ms Evon Brennan and Ms Rosemary Adaser.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite our guests to make an opening statement, which will be followed by a questions and answers session with members.  Before proceeding, I apologise for any inconvenience caused to our witnesses by the unforeseen delay in commencing the meeting.  A number of issues arose in the D&aacute;il, which gave rise to unprecedented scenes in the Chamber, certainly in my time in the House.</p><p>  I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. </p><p>  I invite Ms Carole Brennan to make her opening statement. </p></speech>

Who are we?  We are a campaign group called Mixed Race Irish, MRI, which wishes to raise awareness of the experience of mixed race Irish children who were in the Irish institutional care system during the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.  In most cases, the heritage of these children was that they had an African father and an Irish mother.  We wish to highlight the racism experienced by these children while under the care of the State and the damaging impacts and legacy of this care.</p><p>  Why did we choose the name, Mixed Race Irish?  This is a very important question as it reflects the importance to us, as a group, of our Irish heritage, which was stolen from and denied to us.  We grew up in Ireland and are, to all intents and purposes, Irish, yet we were treated differently and unequally in State institutions because of one simple factor, namely, the colour of our skin.  </p><p>  Mixed Race Irish was formally established in September 2013 by Evon Brennan, Rosemary Adaser and me.  We came together at gatherings of industrial abuse groups.  We realised at these meetings that there was no understanding or support for us, nor was there any room for debate on the colour specific racial suffering imposed on us, as children, and the impact this had on our lives.  Our existence and unique experiences have been airbrushed from Irish survivor abuse history.</p><p>  We have identified more than 70 mixed race survivors of institutions.  We are also aware of seven suicides in our community.  Upwards of 100 mixed race survivors remain unidentified or are missing or deceased.  We continue to search for these individuals but it is a difficult task because it appears that no records of mixed race children are available. </p><p>  Our group has 40 members and continues to grow.  All of our members are aged over 50 years and are located in Ireland, Britain, the United States and China.  Membership is split approximately 40% male and 60% female.  Some of our members are present in the Public Gallery.</p><p>  There is strong evidence that some members of the mixed race survivor community have experienced serious mental health problems, substance abuse, for example, drug and alcoholism, social isolation and inter-generational issues relating to racial abuse and poverty.  I will address these matters in more detail later. </p><p>  What are the aims of our campaign?  We seek to raise awareness of the colour specific abuse of mixed race Irish people by reaching out to others and sharing our stories personally and, where appropriate, publicly, as we are doing today.  We also seek recognition and an acknowledgement that the State failed mixed race children in institutional care.  We seek justice through accountability and redress, arising from the requirement that the State provide for its failure to protect mixed race children in its care.  We also seek assurances that the issue of racism be prioritised, as a State initiative, to ensure these types of abuses do not occur again, particularly in State run institutions. </p><p>  I will now read a collective statement on behalf of the Mixed Race Irish group.  This may take a moment as it is an emotional task for me.</p> <p>The statement sums up what we are about:<blockquote><br />It has taken us many years to have the courage to reveal the depth of our inner pain and suffering which has been internalised.  This has only been made possible by us standing together as a collective group.  The sharing of our horrific past has given us the strength to bring forth a long and well overdue past which we feel needs to be exposed.  Many mixed race Irish carry deep scars of trauma and continue to suffer as a direct result of these past experiences which have left huge and everlasting wounds that may never heal.</blockquote>As we highlight in our submission, the Constitution states all children of the nation are to be cherished equally.  The document we have submitted to the committee shows how the State failed mixed race Irish children through inequality and discrimination.  Our suffering manifested in a range of aspects, including mental health issues, questions of identity, a lack of opportunity which has had an intergenerational impact, poverty and income issues.  Many of our members present with ongoing mental health problems which have had devastating impacts on their lives.  One person told us, &quot;I was forced to clean blocked toilets on the grounds that my colour was the same.&quot;  Others spoke about bath time &quot;as a means to inflict degrading racist sexual inspections,&quot; about being doused in talcum powder and told, &quot;Now you know what it is like to be white.&quot;<br/>Many of our members have lived with a lack of identity which has had a huge impact on their sense of self and belonging.  An unconscious hatred of our black heritage was ingrained in us by institutions, matched by exclusion, where we were made to feel unwelcome and unwanted by Irish society.  The failure to accept mixed race Irish people as part of Irish society, with neither recognition nor ethnic protection, is devastating.  How can children protect themselves from discrimination in the absence of race policies and legislation?  One of our members spoke about &quot;wanting so much to be Irish, to belong, yet this constant questioning of my identity was so traumatising - no one attempted to explain my dual heritage.&quot;  A white survivor observed that he knew his mixed race Irish friend was being treated unfairly and very badly, but he did not understand why until years later.  It is his understanding that his friend is now deceased. <br/>A study by Howard University in Washington DC points out that parents' responses to their own experiences of racial discrimination may influence their parenting and ability to teach their children to negotiate racism successfully.  One member of our group recalls being told by a psychiatrist that, despite being highly intelligent, they were using only 10% of their mental capability owing to the trauma of racism and a lack of identity.  That is a devastating realisation, particularly when one considers that in the case of many mixed race Irish children, their fathers were educated to high standards as doctors, engineers, etc.<br/>Members have told how, at secondary school, the parish priest would single out mixed race children and racially abuse them in front of their peers.  One person was told, &quot;You have two drawbacks in life - one is the colour of your skin, and the second is you are illegitimate.&quot;  Members talk about a pecking order, with coloured girls in the lower ranks.  There was no career planning or work experience given because, as one member put it, &quot;of the stereotype that we would become prostitutes.&quot;This resulted in many individuals not living up to their full potential. <br/>Poverty is another issue for many of our members.  One described how the lack of a trade was extremely damaging to one's survival post-institution.  Another individual said, &quot;Employers told me outright that they could not employ a nigger because I would scare people.&quot;  These disclosures have come privately from members.  Without protection, guidance and support regarding identity, we entered adulthood feeling inferior, which resulted in low self-confidence and affected our job prospects and educational outcomes. <br/>In our submission we refer to a report sent by a doctor to the then Department of Education in 1966.  The author observed that the future of the &quot;coloured children&quot; found in several schools presented a problem for which it would be difficult to find any satisfactory solution.  Their prospects of marriage in Ireland, the report states, were practically nil and that their future happiness and welfare could only be assured in a country with a significant multiracial population since they were accepted by neither black nor white.  The author further noted that these unfortunate children were at a disadvantage when it came to adoption.  He added that they were often hot-tempered and difficult to control.<br/>We state in our submission to the committee:<blockquote>We note with horror the language in the above statement to the Minister for Education.  We consider this language deeply offensive.  This is the language that made mixed race Irish children the &quot;Other&quot; in Irish industrial schools and institutions and encapsulates the racist labelling that ensured our childhoods in Irish industrial schools were filled with terror, misery, abuse and pain.</blockquote>It is our hope we can now commence the process of grieving for a lost identity, youth and heritage.  That can only truly begin through recognition, acknowledgement and justice for the suffering of our members while om the care of the State.  I thank members for listening.</p></speech>

I met them earlier in the summer when we had a good chat about the difficulties experienced by members of Mixed Race Irish.  As an adopted person, I am acutely aware of the problems, traumas and identity issues experienced by people who were adopted.  I have spoken to many people in my situation, as well as those who were sent to orphanages and mother and baby homes.  I have listened to a lot of stories.  The delegates and the people they represent have suffered an extra layer of discrimination on top of what others suffered in these homes.</p><p>  I was reared in Crumlin in Dublin, which was also the place where a person who went on to become famous grew up.  That person was the singer Phil Lynott who was quite vocal about the discrimination he had suffered in school and how he had never really been accepted until he became a celebrity.  Suddenly, once fame came, everybody was cool with him.  Listening to Ms Brennan's testimony, I can identify with a great deal of what she said.  However, the specific suffering of mixed race Irish children is another element of the whole issue that has not been examined heretofore and which should be included in any and all investigations into what happened in orphanages and mother and baby homes in the State.  When I spoke in the D&aacute;il in July during the debate on the establishment of a commission of investigation into mother and baby homes, I mentioned Mixed Race Irish and the plight of the people it represented.</p><p>  I know the answers to the questions I am about to ask, but I would like to put them, as well as outline the delegates' responses.  My first question is why they are bringing this issue to the attention of the committee at this time.  Second, how have they managed to overcome their tragic histories?</p></speech>

It means a lot to us.  She clearly identifies with our situation and also recognises what she referred to as the extra layer of discrimination which only people in our particular position can experience.  I ask my colleague, Ms Brennan, to respond to the Deputy's specific questions.</p></speech>

We are bringing this issue to the committee's attention because we can no longer tolerate a situation where racial suffering continues to be airbrushed from Irish history.  It has taken us five decades to talk about our colour-specific suffering.  We stand together now as a collective voice, which means that we are no longer isolated in our suffering.  We are bringing our past racial suffering into the present to be looked at and learn from it.  We want our painful histories to be documented as evidence to show how Ireland dealt with racism in the past and to encourage debate on how it is dealing with racism today.  As so many of us share identical stories of abuses endured because of our skin colour, we can say this was the reality for us.</p><p>  In the first instance, our voices were listened to by Deputy Dominic Hannigan several years ago.</p> <p>His generosity and willingness to give us time further motivated us to raise our campaign on the horrific suffering endured by mixed race children while in industrial care.  Through talking and listening, we opened a can of worms that shocked us as the number of mixed race stories echoed of detrimental racism, inlcuding neglect, starvation, poverty, sexual, physical and verbal abuse owing to the colour of our skin.</p><p> How have we overcome our tragic histories?  Overcoming one&rsquo;s history of horrendous colour-specific abuse will take years.  Many of us may never recover from these traumas.  How do we overcome the inherited belief that our fathers were savages from the jungle and of low intelligence to later discover that they had been students in medicine, law, civil engineering and contributed to Irish society?  How do we overcome the shock of this knowledge that was deliberately withheld from us, these deliberate lies, a cover-up, to discredit our innate intelligence and heritage?  How do we overcome deep feelings of inadequacy and inferiority?</p><p> Personally, I overcame them temporarily, as it takes years of difficult therapeutic work - this avenue is extremely long and painful - by becoming an expert in control, in my music, family life and social isolation to mask the deep sense of hate and worthlessness I felt inside.  Deep feelings of inadequacy and lack of belief in my own talents resulted in a loss of my capacity to contribute to society.</p><p> Will the committee go beyond what has been presented to it today?  What it sees are three individuals who appear intelligent, confident, articulate and self-assured.  That is how we have learned to behave to be accepted.  We have learned on the surface level, keeping at bay our stunted pasts, capacity for greatness and, especially and fundamentally, inability to endure lasting deep love.  These feelings of isolation are a common thread among our community, as is the wealth of physical suffering that flares up.  We are here in suffering and any new situation will throw us back into it.  Simple questions about where one comes from can invoke flashbacks, throw us into helplessness, confusion with racial identity and deep depression.  Our interiors and minds are not functioning as well as those of a cherished loved individual.  How we overcome our past will be an ongoing battle and struggle for us owing to the inflicted racism and abuses experienced in our traumatic childhoods.  Being here today is the beginning of our recovery.  I thank the committee for listening to us.</p></speech>

I know that you got upset.  I get quite upset when I listen to these stories and can empathise with you.  Believe me, you are three very strong women.</p><p>  I have my own issues about identity.  At the same time, it never holds one back but makes one stronger and more determined.  It is important to get this story out to address the injustice done.  I know that the group has carried out much research into the effects of racism.  Will they tell us a little more about the findings of this research?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.556" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rosemary Adaser" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014102200008#L00400"><p>When we came together, we needed some evidence, as much as for ourselves as to convince the wider public, that our intuitive understanding that our experiences were racially motivated was correct.  We did research, but there is nothing about us.  There is a plethora of worthy civil liberty organisations, but we do not exist.  The only documentation about us merely refers to us in denigrating and insulting terms such as the one Ms Carole Brennan outlined in the letter to the Minister.  I believe the research we carried out was the first of its type in this area.  We started off with just the three of us and now have 72 members in our community.  Out of this, 56 have proudly shared their experiences of institutionalised racism.  We have the results and they are disturbing.  While the actual racism does not surprise us, it is its scale that does.  We discovered that 11% of our group had died early, between the ages of 22 and 45 years, by suicide or killing.  Seven of our members committed suicide.  That is just not right as most of us are in our early 50s.</p><p>  When we interviewed everyone, sexual abuse was a dominant factor.  Up to 44% of our community will admit to sexual abuse.  That includes those who have reached a certain amount in their healing to be able to articulate the trauma.  Many of our members, as Ms Evon Brennan said, will not be able to articulate it.  Up to 35% of us have endured a long-term mental disability and-or substance misuse.  We all will admit to trauma in varying degrees.  Up to 9% of our young men were incarcerated.  When one is of a mixed race, one is considered to be a savage or stupid and will not be educated.  In some cases, young mixed race men were sent to farmers to work for free instead of being schooled.  Not getting any wage, they might have stolen a few apples, but they were sent before a judge who then sent them to a young offenders&rsquo; institution.  What hope do they have?  They are ex-offenders, of mixed race with a stunted education.  How are they supposed to be educated and work in society?</p><p>  For those who escaped that fate, we emerged from institutions with low self-worth.  When people talk about having low self-esteem, they are told to read a self-esteem book.  However, to have self-esteem, one has to have a concept of who one is.  That is one&rsquo;s self-worth and who one thinks one is inside.  We did not have this.  We emerged into the world completely lost, knowing that we were not wanted in this society.  It is doubly tragic because this country still refuses to ratify anti-racism laws.   Accordingly, we never feel safe.</p> <p>We are an indigenous group.  We are not migrants, we were born here.  We have members approaching their 80th birthday.  We did not arrive yesterday.  Please start including us.  Can we get the CERD sorted, please?</p></speech>

It was my pleasure to meet them during the summer and I want to acknowledge the efforts made by Deputy Hannigan and Deputy Ferris in making the rest of us aware of their organisation and their history.  While it was a pleasure to meet them, I was sorry that we were meeting in such circumstances and that they had such a tragic story to tell about their history.  I was deeply moved and shocked by the stories they told and when I mentioned it to other colleagues, I found that people really were not aware of this.  It is a story that we must talk about, on top of all the other tragic stories.  It needs to be heard, just as all the others did.  Having read the witnesses' submission and having spoken to them, I know their experiences were truly appalling.  Perhaps they might like to expand on how their experiences were different to the experiences of their peers within the institutions.</p></speech>

Our racial sufferings were compounded and we had additional burdens placed upon us.  Our report is detailed, accurate and particularly evidence-based and has taken us two years to complete.  Racial injury is different to the injuries that other children experienced in the institutions.  Old research shows the mindset of missionaries who went to Africa during the 18th century to civilise the barbarians.  Our research suggests the mindset in Ireland while we were in care was to control us hot-tempered savages, to tame and civilise our temperaments, and to get rid of our blackness by dousing talcum powder on us.  Our research shows there was no person qualified in race relations.  No programme was set up and no attempt was made to discuss our history.  This shows immediately an indifference to mixed-race Irish.  We are adamant not to devalue the sufferings of other children who were raised in institutions, but our racial sufferings are unique and specific to us.  As explained, it is not possible for us to give specific details as this is too traumatic.  Each time we bring this into the open, we open ourselves to the horrors of our past and we wish to minimise this trauma in this setting.</p></speech>

We are keen not to try to compare what we went through to what our peers went through.  We do not believe that our pain is more or less than theirs, but it is specific.  Racism in and of itself causes many psychological issues, which are far-reaching.  That is all I would like to say on that.</p></speech>

The difference is that if people are raised in an institution, they can leave if they are white and not be identified as being raised in an institution.  Being mixed-race, one leaves knowing one has come from an institution but there is always an extra burden - it is physical, one can see it.  That is a reminder.  When we are asked "Who are you, where do you come from?" it throws us back into a past injury, which one cannot get over.  It takes years of therapeutic work and some of us will never reach the point of being completely comfortable in our skins because of what happened to us.</p></speech>

In our submission paper we have outlined some of the things we want for our members.  The first thing is recognition.  If a person's dog is killed, they must grieve for it, but before grieving they must acknowledge the dog has died.  I am just using that as an analogy.  It goes back to that question of years of internalisation of racism.</p><p>  I want to share this with the committee. For me, admitting that I was targeted because of the colour of my skin is something that I refused to do for years.  I did not want to say that the reason that nun or priest did that to me, or the reason that happened to me in the street or whatever, was the colour of my skin.  It is too painful.  If one asks anybody who has been subjected to racism, they will often want to deny that it was because of their colour.  Some people will try to say everything that happens to them is because of their colour, but in our cases and particularly in my case, it was the other way around.  I did not want to acknowledge that I was different.</p><p>  One grows up thinking one is the same as everybody else and then one walks down the street with the nuns and people come up asking "Where are these children from?"  I remember that question being put to me by Americans when I was very young.  It was quite a traumatising experience.  I was very rude to them.  I told them to go away and stop annoying me because there was no reason for them to ask where I was from when it was obvious that I was Irish.  I was very proud of being Irish at that age.  I loved Irish history, I wanted to speak Gaelic and everything.  What did that nun do?  She whacked me across the head and sent me back to the dormitory to sit on my bed and think about my behaviour.  I sat there, thinking "I just stood up for my Irishness and this is what I'm getting".</p><p>  This is about acknowledgment.  If someone had explained to us the simple fact "You have two heritages, you have an Irish mother and an African father", and explained very simply some of those issues, even today in a taxi or wherever I go in Ireland if someone asked me where I am from, it would be fine, because I would have a place to put that.  If no one explains it, every time one hears that question one remembers those Americans and being smacked across the face because one stood up.  That is key.  We cannot blame anyone for asking us where we are from because we do not look Irish, to be honest.  That is not the point.  If one knows one's identity and knows who one is, it means that when the question is asked, one is able to deal with it.  Today in the hotel someone asked us the question.  We both looked at each other wondering what to say because that goes back to that original trauma when the question is asked, because that nun beat me and told me whatever.  It sounds like a superficial thing to say, but it is actually very deep, this idea of identity.  The experience of not knowing where one comes from or what one stands for or who one is, based on skin colour, because no one has explained anything, persists for the whole of one's life.  I have spoken to other mixed-race Irish who have said that when that question is asked they want to lash out and hit someone.  They think, "Why are you asking me that stupid question?"</p><p>  Coming back to the question about what we want, we want recognition.  That must be the first thing.  We need the recognition and this is part of that process.  We are here today.  We want to thank the committee.  We do not take this for granted.  We do not think we are owed anything in that sense.  We want to thank the committee for the opportunity to come and talk about this because we have not talked about it ourselves for years, we have just hid it.  Rosemary mentioned the CERD.  This is also part of it because racism is ongoing in Ireland.</p> <p>Racism is ongoing in Ireland.  We heard the story of a boy who was cyberbullied because, his mother believes, he was mixed race, and who committed suicide.  We can raise awareness of what happened to us - for example, by coming here today.  Our experience has the potential to have an impact on what is happening today in Ireland.  I ask the Government to ratify whatever treaties are outstanding and to look at those issues so that people are protected if ongoing racism is taking place.  People do not know where to go if they are experiencing racism.  There is a perception that the police may not take it seriously because there is nothing in the legislation that protects people from racism.  We were not protected.  We would like to think that even though we are talking about our experiences in the past, they will have a wider impact.</p><p> Acknowledgement and recognition are needed from the Government.  We are completely self-funding.  We have been together for over two and a half years and we have received no funding at all.  We want to continue tracing other mixed-race Irish.  There are quite a lot of people out there who we know are isolated and have not come forward.  We want to find a way of reaching out and getting access to those people who are isolated.  One of our mixed-race friends was found dead in the River Liffey.  She was 22 years of age and is now buried in an unmarked grave in Glasnevin Cemetery.  She grew up with us.  Her name was Pauline and she was a beautiful girl.  She was unloved, unwanted and made to feel unwelcome and ended up dead in the Liffey.  She is a symbol to us.  We would ask the committee to investigate how we could potentially-----</p></speech>

I remember the very first time I went to one of those meetings.  I was scared because it was a survivor network for Irish women, and I felt Irish but was scared that I would get the inevitable sidelong glances and "What are you doing here?" attitude.  On that occasion they were very nice to me, but what was exciting was that at the grand old age of 56 I met two other mixed-race Irish women, Evon and Carole.  I was born and bred in Ireland and left in my twenties, but that occasion two years ago was the first time I had ever met a mixed-race Irish woman with my history.  My history - nobody else's - mine.  We came together and thought "Well, hold on."  Evon and Carole were equally surprised.  They had not heard about me and I am actually older than they are.  Not by much, of course; let us just keep it in proportion.  They had never met me either.  We kept going to these survivors' meetings and we would have coffees, and it kept coming around to "Tell us about yourself and where you were."  I was gobsmacked when I realised that they were over in Sligo.  I mean, who goes to Sligo as far as I am concerned?  But then we found out that we had people in Mayo and Drogheda.</p><p>  On a more serious note, what was really important was that when we shared our stories, we realised there was a common thread.  We realised that it did not really matter if I was in Kilkenny or somebody else was in Drogheda because the pattern of behaviour towards and treatment of us was so consistent.  We decided then to move on to the next stage.  We used word of mouth and contacted the people we knew, who contacted the people they knew.  We held a couple of meetings in London and a couple in Dublin.  The biggest issue we identified was actually our isolation.  I alluded to the fact that I had not met anybody like me before.  It was the isolation that was so important.  </p><p>  When we came to Dublin it was so moving because it was the first time the members who are sitting in the Visitors' Gallery had come together as a community.  They too had never met each other and it was the first time we had sat around a table and looked at each other, and we felt a connection.  There was no "Where do you come from?" question.  I looked upon my sisters and brothers, they looked upon me, and we did not have to say an awful lot, actually.  We carried the same pain - that was what really struck us.  At that meeting we recounted stories - for example, of the nuns showing films of missionaries going to see the savages.  We remembered being told, "That is what you are."  It was not about raising money and the good work they were doing but, "Look at that - they are savages, and that is what you are."  This kind of insult that we grew up with from age zero to the day we left Ireland was so common for all of us.  The attitude was as if we did not exist for them.</p> <p> A couple of things that we realise, as a new community, is that we have never been accepted by Irish society.  We have never felt safe in Ireland.  That is really important.  We are not confident of the same protections in law as other Irish people.  We do not have the same rights to health, wealth and social capital as other Irish people.  The vast majority of us have not fulfilled our true potential.  There is such a commonality in our experiences.  They are all racist, and that is basically what we are talking about.  We confirmed that this racism was endemic throughout all the institutions attended by our community.  It was quite an extraordinary revelation to us that the same pattern of behaviour towards us as infants, children and adults ran right across Irish society, starting in the institutions.  There was a clear pattern which could only be explained under the internationally acknowledged concept of institutionalised racism.</p></speech>

I have not met the witnesses before.  They have given a very harrowing account of their childhood and that of people of their generation who spent their childhood in institutions.  It is a shameful chapter in Irish society which has come out in the open.  People recognise and are conscious of that fact.  The witnesses had a double difficulty because they suffered racial abuse as well as the other types of treatment that were meted out to orphan children.</p><p>  I am concerned about at the level of racism today and I wonder what their experience is.  Sometimes in my constituency I hear from parents with mixed-race children who say to me that their children have been abused in the street.  There have been, from time to time, assaults on people of mixed race.  I do not know if that is declining, but my own feeling is that it may be declining.</p><p>  As I listened to the delegation I was reminded of something.  I was a member of Dublin City Council in 1990 when the freedom of Dublin city was given to Nelson Mandela.  It was also the year when the Irish football team did very well with a star player called Paul McGrath.  People of mixed race in Ireland have excelled in sports, music, modelling and other careers.  There is that side of things as well.  I would like to know the following.  Does the delegation, from their experience, feel they have more awareness of racism and that it is a despicable form of behaviour?  Racism is mainly attributable to ignorance.  Does the delegation think enough is being done to reduce racism and ensure that mixed-race Irish people are better integrated into Irish society?</p></speech>

Combatting racism is not about highlighting a mixed-race person who is a footballer, a model or a famous musician, because that can be quite stereotyping.  As Deputy Anne Ferris said, just because somebody is in the media or is successful does not mean we accept mixed-race Irish people into society.  We do not need to be successful in the public view.  Does it mean you can only be accepted if you are someone to be looked at or someone successful?  What does success mean?  It is not about being in the public domain; it is about being accepted for who you are whether you are a celebrity or not.  Being successful and being in the media is not an acceptance of colour.  I disagree with the perception that there is acceptance and integration if a person is seen to be in the public domain and is looked at.  We have been brought up as the other - to be looked at and to be looked upon.  Integration means that we accept people for who they are, regardless of what they do for a living.</p></speech>

I was saying that people like Paul McGrath are role models, particularly for young men and boys.  They show that it is cool; it is proof that a person can be successful and that there are barriers that can be overcome.</p></speech>

Ms Brennan was highlighting from our perspective the importance of stereotyping.  We have found, all our lives, that if one happened to have a different colour, particularly in Ireland, there were certain stereotypes that one would have fitted into.  I take the Deputy's point about the importance of role models.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether there is racism in today's society.  I can only go on certain experiences that people have shared with me, because I do not live in Ireland at the moment but in London.  I have heard stories of Nigerian families who have been subjected to racism.  I suspect that because the Irish Government has not ratified the treaty of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, there is no protection in law for somebody who is attacked and called names or attacked because of the colour of their skin.  That is part of the problem that we see.  In the UK, if somebody calls me a name, incites hatred or whatever because of my race or colour, I can go to the police and the matter will be taken seriously.</p></speech>

He said he was not going to go to the police because they were not going to take it seriously as there are no laws.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny is right, and I agree with him that Irish society has become more open.  I am amazed at how cosmopolitan and wonderful Dublin city is.  It is a beautiful city and it is wonderful to see so many different races.  I am concerned and curious about how, if someone is subjected to racism, the matter would be dealt with in law.</p></speech>

Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny was right to highlight positive examples such as Paul McGrath and role models who are mixed-race.  For us, who grew up in institutional care, we were nobodies and we did not have anything to latch onto.  We were never going to be famous or whatever, but who knows.  Let us look at our colleagues seated in the gallery.  It is the largest group of mixed-race Irish people I have seen in one place and it is in the D&aacute;il.  If we were not here today, the committee would not know these people existed.  We were brought up in institutional care.  Therefore, we were at a disadvantage because of the way we were brought up and the fact that our identity was kind of trashed.  We lacked an identity.</p><p>  The Deputy's question on racism is difficult to answer because one wants to be positive and say that Ireland has moved on.  I believe it probably has, but for us, as mixed-race Irish, it probably has not, because we are still left with the legacy.  That is the only way I can answer the question.</p></speech>

The way forward is to return to a story that is horrific.  The way forward is not to highlight success and say "Look how well we are doing."  It is to go back, be open, have discussions and say, "This happened.  This is the effect of that and these are the effects of long-term racism."  That is how we move forward.</p></speech>

Some of my work involves trying to identify some of the gaps and get funding and whatever else I need to be able to provide support.  The difficulty in terms of NGOs or whatever is the lack of awareness of what it is to be mixed race Irish.  There are people who are isolated and have complex needs.  I support a number of people who are mixed race Irish, some of whom are in care homes, have severe mental health problems and may be suicidal.  I work with people in care homes in the UK who are mixed race Irish and have no support mechanisms.  It is a major issue.  I suspect in Ireland it is the same, if not worse.</p><p>  Part of the work we would like to do is examine ways in which we could identify people with complex needs who happen to be mixed race Irish and how we continue to support that community through empowerment and moving forward.  The area requires a level of specialisation.  Existing NGOs may not be suitable.  After we left Ireland we pulled ourselves up and went on to educate ourselves.  We have achieved things in our lives, through our work and grit, and we are using that experience to help others who may not have the fortune to be able to move forward.  That is one of the things we want to do.  We are starting to do it, but a lot more needs to be done.  As I said, identifying and tracing some of those who are isolated and have complex needs are key issues.  Does that answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

We are doing that work under our own steam and it is very difficult because each time we attend meetings, we find we need time to rest because they evoke the past.  The support we and our members need is not in place.  We do not know how we will feel when we leave here.

We compared and analysed all of our symptoms and conducted an impact statement.  We tried to articulate a way to describe how we felt on a day-to-day basis.  As Ms Brennan said, my master's degree is in social policy and politics.  I am always tuned into political concepts.  We have learned a lot about race from the UK and, more importantly, from America.  It is the obvious place to learn from in terms of the African-American experience.  One thinks that because we come from Ireland the experience is not that similar, but it is remarkably similar because the common denominator is racism.  </p><p>  In 2005 Dr. Joy DeGruy published a book on post-traumatic slavery syndrome.  The symptoms of that mirrored how we felt.  One symptom is low self worth.  I spoke briefly about what that means.  It concerns how we see ourselves internally.  Self esteem is how one thinks other people see one externally.  Other symptoms include helplessness, rage and the expectation one will never amount to anything.  I listened to Dr. DeGruy and thought, "My Goodness.  That is us."  It was that simple.  It is a framework which adequately explained the symptoms which we as a community endured on a daily basis.  That is why we referred to our particular trauma as post-traumatic slave syndrome, and not post-traumatic stress disorder.  Many of us have other disorders such as depression, anxiety and hyper vigilance, but there is another element which is entirely attributable to racism.</p></speech>

The Chairman mentioned the media and I do hope the media which cover the committee proceedings in Leinster House are picking up on this debate.  The delegates are the voice now for so many people. There may not be that many people in their organisation, but there are other people out there.  They are the voice for those people.  I urge them to try and bring it further.  I know how difficult and upsetting it is, but I urge them to seek the opportunity perhaps to take this to the national airwaves, on television and so forth.  It is a little bit like the Philomena Lee story.  It was seeing the human angle that changed people's hearts and got through to so many people.  However, I do know how difficult it is.</p></speech>

One issue is the nuns kept very bad records.  The names were often misspelt.  This feeds into the question about research.  It would be interesting, as part of the research, to find out how many people did go on to find their heritage fathers.  I know we are going to speak further on a one-to-one basis.  However, there is this idea that we would return to some of our fathers' countries, that most of us have completely denied.  I am incredibly uncomfortable with the idea that my father happened to be from Ghana.  Would I want to go there?  No.  However, a part of the healing process - I do want to emphasise that word -  is to realise this is not about blame.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Dr. Ciaran Byrne, Dr. Greg Forde and Dr. Cathal Gallagher of Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statement they have submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Dr. Byrne to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

Inland Fisheries Ireland was established on 1 July 2010 following the amalgamation of the central and seven regional fisheries boards.  The agency was established under the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, with many of its powers deriving from the principal Act governing the sector, that being, the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act 1959.  The main functions of Inland Fisheries Ireland, as identified in the 2010 Act, are to "promote, support, facilitate and advise the Minister on the conservation, protection, management, marketing, development and improvement of inland fisheries, including sea angling".</p><p>  It is important to note that protection and conservation of the inland fisheries resource number among the primary functions of the agency.  These were also primary functions of the central and regional fisheries boards established in 1980 and the Boards of Conservators and the Inland Fisheries Trust before them.  However, protection and conservation have comprised a topic of much interest and discussion since well before the formation of the State.  For example, in 1836 there was a royal commission of inquiry into the state of salmon in Ireland and, in 1901, the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland, SSISI, produced a report on salmon fisheries.</p><p>  It is also important that we assist the committee in considering the context of why protection and conservation are conducted.  While there are domestic, EU and international obligations, we are protecting and conserving resources generating some &euro;755 million annually for the national economy.  The impact of this socio-economic dividend is largely of benefit to peripheral and rural communities, often where alternative earning opportunities can be limited.</p><p>  In today's context, there are three fish species of particular interest, those being, salmon, bass and eel.  The abundance of all three have decreased in recent years.  Previously, commercial and recreational fisheries for all three species existed, but today only salmon is fished commercially and on a limited basis.  Following concerns in the 1990s about the decline of salmon numbers returning to the Irish coast, the then Minister with responsibility for wild fish established a salmon task force to consider this matter and advise him on how this decline might be arrested and stocks improved.</p> <p> The then Minister introduced a number of conservation measures for the 1997 commercial season.  Between 1997 and 2007, on foot of further ongoing concerns in respect of the abundance of salmon, a number of other fishery management measures such as a carcass tag and logbook scheme were implemented.  In 2006 the then Government committed to aligning with the scientific advice.  The import of this was that it was no longer permissible to target mixed-stock salmon fisheries at sea.  In 2007 the then Government introduced a hardship scheme of &euro;25 million to support fishermen to exit the fishery.  An additional &euro;5 million was also made available for community support schemes.  From that point forward the management of wild salmon was conducted on an individual river basis in order to reflect the genetically unique stock in each river.  The primary driver became - and remains - the independent scientific advice.  If there was no harvestable surplus as advised by the scientific advice, then there was no harvesting of salmon.  While there are currently more rivers opened with harvestable surpluses than in 2007, anecdotal evidence suggests there has been a decrease in the marine survival of salmon and this has led to reduced abundance in the current year, although the weather may be a significant factor in this regard.</p><p> The steep decline in bass stocks in Ireland in the mid-1970s resulted in a severe decline of the renowned Irish bass angling resource.  Ultimately, this decline led to the cessation of the commercial fishery in 1990 to conserve stocks through the Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Order 1990.  Since then bass has been regarded solely as an angling species and is restrictively managed.  Bass is a long-lived and slow-growing species and only attains maturity between four and seven years of age.  Specimens can be up to 20 years old.</p><p> IFI was anxious to establish the overall and socioeconomic value of the resource it is charged with protecting.  The most comprehensive survey of the economic value of recreational angling in Ireland identified that the total direct expenditure on recreational angling in Ireland in 2012 was estimated to be of the order of &euro;555 million, of which &euro;121 million was generated by out-of-State anglers.  When indirect and induced impacts are taken into account, the overall economic impact of recreational angling in Ireland is, therefore, estimated to be approximately &euro;755 million.  Total tourist angling expenditure was estimated at approximately &euro;280 million and recreational angling can be estimated to support approximately 10,000 jobs.</p><p> It is estimated that bass angling in Ireland could contribute in the range of &euro;116 million to &euro;146 million annually to the economy, predominantly in rural areas.  Given the importance of this species and the poor status of the stocks, IFI has prioritised its bass research programme.  This programme aims to provide scientific advice on measures for the conservation and protection of bass and their aquatic habitat, while also facilitating long-term sustainable social and economic value for stakeholders.  The programme has been developed to determine the status of bass stocks and to improve understanding of the ecology and biology of this valuable species which is vulnerable to over-exploitation.  Current activity within IFI&rsquo;s bass programme includes: stock assessment -juvenile, pre-adult and adult; ecological investigations; stock identification; and migration studies.  While in Ireland bass is managed as a recreational fishery, there are commercial fisheries for bass in other jurisdictions.  In that context, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, has advised that a management plan is urgently needed to develop and implement measures to substantially reduce fishing mortality throughout the range of the stock as a result of concerns about the overall status of the stock and a number of years poor recruitment.</p><p> The European eel is found and exploited in fresh, brackish and coastal waters in almost all of Europe and along the Mediterranean coasts of Africa and Asia.  The European eel is a single, panmictic - or genetically identical - stock distributed from northern Africa in the south to the farthermost regions of Norway in the north.  Following Europe-wide concerns regarding the status of eel stocks, EU Regulation (Council Regulation 1100/2007) was introduced.  This regulation requires member states to monitor the eel stocks, evaluate current silver eel escapement and post-evaluate implemented management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement.  The Irish eel management plan submitted to and accepted by the EU in 2009 identified four main management actions: a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market; mitigation of the impact of hydropower, including a comprehensive trap and transport plan to be funded by the ESB; ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers; and improvement of water quality.  This plan and the stock status of eels was reviewed in 2012 and the management measures to which I refer were continued for a further three-year period.  </p><p> In addition to the three species I have mentioned, IFI is very concerned about status of sea trout.  Following the collapse of the sea trout stocks off the west coast of Ireland in 1989, predominantly as a result of the impacts of sea lice from poorly-managed and poorly-situated aquaculture facilities, stocks in many areas have still not returned to former abundance levels.  Sea trout are particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of sea lice due to their foraging ecology.  Unlike salmon, which migrate out to the high seas, sea trout spend considerable time in the near-shore estuarine environment and are prone to being repeatedly infected with sea lice.</p><p> IFI expends a considerable portion of time and resources on the protection of all fish stocks but, of necessity, greater emphasis is placed on those stocks in greater difficulty.  With approximately 5,600 km of coastline extending out to 12 nautical miles, there is an immense area to protect.  However, since the cessation of the commercial drift net fishery at sea much of the illegal fishing effort for salmon and other species has moved into the estuarine areas.  Anecdotally, incidences of commercial-scale illegal fishing for salmon have decreased.  However, there has been an increased targeting of bass off the south and south-west coasts.  Notwithstanding this, IFI recorded 381 incidents in 2013 and prosecutions were initiated in respect of 112 of these - an increase of 14 on the number for 2012.  In 2013 staff seized over 455 nets totalling 24.1 km, which is comparable with the 24.5 km of illegal nets seized in 2012.  The greatest number of nets seized in 2013 were 58, 124 and 122.  These were seized in the months of June, July and August, respectively.</p><p> In terms of the protection effort, IFI staff expended 44,266 man hours on coastal, sea and estuary patrols in 2013.  In addition, IFI staff have fundamentally changed how they conduct their business.  They are using arrange of high-tech equipment to target specific "hot spot" areas and increase operational efficiency.  Kayaks are being used to conduct silent patrols along rivers and in shallow estuarine areas and to access areas which previously would have been almost impossible to enter unnoticed or using a rigid-hulled inflatable boat, RIB.  All-terrain vehicles, ATVs, are being used on some of the country's beaches in order to patrol for illegal bass fishing and personal watercraft - or jetskis - are being used to patrol shallow estuarine areas which would previously have been inaccessible to RIBs.  Larger RIBs are being used to launch dawn patrols on coastal areas.  Officers go well out to sea under the cover of darkness and then approach coastal areas at first light.  It is not only the patrol methodologies which have changed, however.  IFI has a 24-hour hotline for the reporting of any illegal activity and also the presence of invasive species.  It has also had significant success in the use of other technologies such as night vision scopes, thermal imaging equipment and long-range spotting scopes.  In addition, IFI has had some considerable success in detecting illegal nets and fishing activity using its specially-trained patrol dog in a pilot programme which is now being extended throughout the organisation.  The unfortunate reality is that while the agency can deploy its resources to best effect and utilise the most up to date technologies, there are still significant numbers of individuals who continue to engage in illegal fishing.</p></speech>

As Dr. Byrne stated, the industry is responsible for providing a huge number of jobs and ensuring the survival of rural communities.</p><p>  I regularly meet those who are concerned about fish stocks.  I refer to those who fish in the various competitions that are held, particularly the members of the Araglen Anglers Association in my locality who fish on the tributaries of the River Blackwater.  The latter continually inform me that this fisheries are an underdeveloped asset.  In the past there would have been anecdotal evidence in respect of poaching, etc., taking place at this time of year in particular.  However, such activity has, in the main, been consigned to history because the vast majority of people are concerned about conservation.  Previous generations would have stated that a flood would have to arrive in order for the salmon to come upriver.  I was discussing this matter with my father in recent days and he asked whether salmon come up rivers at all now in light of the way stocks have been affected.</p><p>  The first thing I want to do is challenge our guests with regard to the underdevelopment of what is an outstanding natural resource.</p> <p>While today&rsquo;s proceedings concern tackling poaching at estuaries and stock depletion in inland waterways, more work is needed in developing recreational and commercial fishing.  As the delegation stated, it affects predominantly rural areas and there are many fine rivers with good stock levels.</p><p> Are salmon levels returning in smaller inland rivers and tributaries to the major rivers such as the Blackwater?  Does more work need to be done on stock preservation in our inland waterways?  Is Inland Fisheries Ireland constrained by limited financial resources in continuing its work?</p></speech>

We have a good natural resource, namely, angling, which needs constant investment and upgrading.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has recognised from its socio-economic study of recreational anglers that we need a national angling development plan.  Over the summer, we looked at angling resources to see how we can maintain and improve them.  I, along with my staff and officers, have been looking at development needs from simple matters such as shrub cutting and development of bank side infrastructure right up to how we market and promote the resource.  The board of Inland Fisheries Ireland and its senior management have been seriously focused on a national angling development plan and hope to bring it forward early next year.  One consideration, however, will be that it will cost money.</p></speech>

One issue, however, is that as it is European funded, it is heavily audited so one cannot stray too far from the core remit of the project.  The kind of works we would be looking at would be relatively low level developmental works such as bush cutting and raking gravel.  Much of this work would not be covered under the LIFE programme.  It can be used as a vehicle to get larger scale works done, however.</p></speech>

Each year, we assess the salmon population entering 148 rivers.  In Ireland, we manage each of the catchments individually but not the individual tributaries.  Those above surplus are opened for commercial or rod-angling exploitation.  Other rivers that are just below the conservation limit but have a certain population are open to catch-and-release angling.  There are many rivers that are closed, unfortunately, because of the status of stock in them.</p><p>  We pay attention to tributaries.  If a river is in difficulty, we have other scientific methods of evaluating their populations.  We use catchment wide electro-fishing where we examine the juvenile salmon in a catchment to see how its population is doing.  If we find there are problems in tributaries or particular locations, we try and identify them such as an impassable barrier, pollution, problems arising from river restoration or gravels.  The salmon conservation fund, supported by the salmon anglers and commercial fishermen, is available to do these types of rehabilitation works.</p><p>  There has been a focus on better understanding the salmon runs in the Blackwater.  On that river over the past several years, extensions to the salmon season have been given to facilitate angling because it was believed they were entering the catchments later.  Salmon management is difficult.  Each individual catchment has genetically distinct fish populations from the Ice Age.  While we can talk in general terms about the populations going up and down, they seem to fluctuate inside the catchments over years.  Salmon runs also depend on the weather and water levels, a point understood by those who live in the catchment area.  We are conscious that the tributaries are the main spawning areas for salmon.  We try to focus on ensuring we pay attention to these areas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Greg Forde" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014102200005#D00600"><p>This year has been particularly intriguing for inland waterways because we have such low water levels.  We have had three months of drought, except in Dublin which has had more normal rainfall levels, particularly in the coastal parts of Galway, Connemara and the south.  As a consequence, salmon have been focused in estuarine areas.  From our perspective, this is good as the majority of the stock was stuck in the lower parts of the river.  Keeping an eye on it from poaching was easier, therefore.  It has allowed us to focus on what we know are the hotspots.  We would get local tip-offs from the robust relationships we have with individuals across the country, as well as through our hotline.  We have moved away from the traditional approach of selecting one river to patrol on one day and another the following day.  Now, it is more intelligence-based patrolling.</p><p>  As Dr. Ciaran Byrne said earlier, we have moved into using new technologies in combating poaching.  Some of these are associated more with armies such as night-vision.  The nets we take in the larger estuaries such as those on the Barrow and the Suir are taken in complete darkness as a result.  It is difficult to catch an actual poacher.  A poacher will set a net when the tide is out, wading across mud to do so.  These nets are impossible to see as they are covered by mud.  The tide comes in, lifts the net, the net catches the fish.  When the tide goes out, the poacher then retrieves the net.  No boat is involved and these areas tend to be very exposed.  This makes it difficult for staff to lie in wait for individual poachers.</p> <p>However, much of our work is now done using the methods I described and other technologies that we utilise to help us identify who is coming or going or perhaps to intercept a vehicle rather than race across mud flats, which is no mean feat.  These types of incidents have taken place. </p><p> Our targeting of poaching is primarily aimed at specific hotspots.  This year, 89 cases have come before the courts nationwide and almost 60 further cases are in the pipeline.  A large number of individuals are being prosecuted for poaching and pollution cases.  After local authority prosecutions related to the payment of rates and so forth, Inland Fisheries Ireland is one of main agencies involved in prosecutions for illegal activities.  We also use fixed charge penalty notices, similar to those used by many other bodies, for minor infringements which we do not want to bring to court.  We want cases that come to court to be for serious matters that require appropriate redress. </p><p> In 2013, we seized 24 km of nets.  The trouble is that we will seize perhaps 12 m or 18 m of net at one time and it takes a large number of such seizures to reach a total of 24 km.  The reason the figure is so high is that we seize a small number of large nets off the coast.  This year, the number of large nets detected off the coast has been significantly lower than last year.  This can be attributed to a number of factors, including low water levels which reduced the number of fish running into rivers.  As a result, people were not able to see the fish running and we did not get the big pulse of illegal fishing at sea that we normally get.</p><p> Most of the nets being seized are estuarine or used in rivers.  We also seize a small number of illegal fishing nets on lakes and so forth.  Thus far this year, we have seized 13 km of net but the year still has a couple of months to run.  The lower figure is indicative of the substantial decline in the yardage of net seized this year compared with the significant seizure in yardage terms made last year.</p><p> The best intelligence is the poacher because he has his finger on the pulse.  He will know when there is a reasonable run of fish and where he has a chance of catching some of them.  The risk he runs is that he must be lucky every time, whereas the opportunity we have is that we must only catch him once.  Catching a poacher takes him out of the equation and he is unlikely to be caught again.  </p></speech>

I will have to review my arrangements.  I hope the witnesses will forgive me if the questions I ask were answered in advance of my arrival.</p><p>  I will explore a number of issues.  The goals of Inland Fisheries Ireland are to improve the protection and conservation of the resource, develop and improve wild fish populations, increase the number of anglers and generate a better return for the economy from the resource.  If we take these objectives as key performance indicators, how is Inland Fisheries Ireland performing?</p><p>  My next question is more specific and relates to eels fisheries.  I am informed by those who used to be involved in eel fishing that Ireland is probably the only country in Europe that has imposed a ban on eel fishing.  A number of families made a fair proportion of their income from this activity.  They have been prevented from continuing to fish for eels and have not been offered compensation.  They question the scientific evidence on what contribution the cessation of eel fishing is making to the overall eel population.  I ask the witnesses to comment. </p><p>  Inland Fisheries Ireland focuses strongly on poachers.  Is pollution not at least as great a problem as poaching?  The River Tolka was poisoned recently and the anecdotal evidence suggests that one industry is causing this pollution.  It appears, however, that no action is being taken to address the issue. </p><p>  On value for money, if expenditure from the public purse on Inland Fisheries Ireland and other organisations involved in the preservation of the water base, fish stocks and the amenity value of our rivers were matched against the income generated from the enjoyment of these resources, would one conclude that we are delivering value for money?</p><p>  What working arrangements does Inland Fisheries Ireland have with other organisations involved in the preservation and promotion of our inland waters, for example, Waterways Ireland?  I should point out that many years ago, when I fished the rivers and lakes of south Leitrim, I was blissfully unaware of Inland Fisheries Ireland or any similar organisation.</p></speech>

Perhaps the best way to respond is to outline from where we have come.  Eight State agencies were amalgamated in 2010 when eight companies were managing the fisheries resource in eight separate regions.  Since then, the organisation has focused on rebuilding and rebranding our structures to become more efficient.  I will be honest in stating that we have done very well in certain areas and not so well in other areas.</p><p>  As with many State agencies, we started off at the worst possible time in terms of the economic cycle because the trajectory in terms of resources and finances since the establishment of Inland Fisheries Ireland has been downward only.  While this is a challenge on one side of the equation, it also presents an opportunity on the other side because it forces us to act in a more innovative manner and think in a different ways.  For example, if we take the protection effort, when one has five men where one once had ten men one can no longer continue to do the work of ten men.  What we have done is embrace different methodologies in our approach to our work.  We have introduced different technologies to try to increase and drive up efficiency.  We are seeking to underpin this legislatively through a review of the legislation to try to move away from the practice of taking large numbers of people to court.  It is a matter of targeting resources to achieve the best return.  That is one example of an area where we have developed and pushed on but there are various other measures.</p><p>  I would love to say we are brilliant and, on balance, I believe we are good, although there is definitely room for improvement.  We must continue what we are doing.  It is interesting that 2015 will be the end of the first strategic cycle for the agency.  This will provide us with a chance to review in a critical and economic way what we said we would do, what we did and what has been the outcome in terms of whether we did what we said we would do.  We will implement this process in 2015 as part of the development of the next strategic plan.</p></speech>

I referred to taking the objectives the agency has set itself as key performance indicators.  He should be able to provide figures on what was the starting position compared to the current position.  This would allow us to decide whether the agency is hitting its targets.  Inland Fisheries Ireland could be working very efficiently without hitting the targets it has set as the targets could have been unrealistic.  This data must be available to demonstrate whether these key performance indicators are being met.</p></speech>

For example, if one wants to engage in coarse fishing, Ireland is a place to come.  While some stocks are certainly depleted, others have increased significantly and in a point to which Deputy Moynihan alluded previously, there has been a change in the behaviour of anglers.  As the Deputy mentioned himself, back in the day there was a time when anglers killed and kept every single fish they caught.  In their mindset, they have now more or less moved completely to a catch-and-release type philosophy.  In respect of specific metrics and numbers, I have them all.  We operate them through the service level agreement, SLA, with our Department and report them in our annual report.  The one about which I have concerns is increasing the number of anglers.  It is a very difficult number to get.  In 2012, we conducted our survey of recreational anglers.  Prior to that, we only had bits of surveys from the regional fisheries boards regarding different types of fisheries and this was the first national survey.  It is an omnibus-type survey and of course, the real metric will be to repeat that in three years' time and compare the number we had in 2012 with the number we have in 2015.  That is how we will proceed.</p></speech>

We are in the process of tendering a commission for an economist and somebody to repeat those omnibus surveys.  It is a bit like some of the economic surveys pertaining to household income and all that.  The only way one can get those data on an ongoing basis is to keep on resurveying people and asking that question.  In terms of the other metrics, we have clear metrics in respect of protection, seizures and prosecutions and I am pretty confident that we are hitting those targets.</p></speech>

Members may be aware that eels migrate out to the Sargasso Sea as silver eels and make that big long journey of 1,500 km.  International science still has not found exactly where they are spawning out there.  However, as Dr. Ciaran Byrne described earlier, they return later <i>en masse</i>to the European shores as glass eels.  When they arrive to fresh water, they change pigment and become what are called elvers.  They then travel into our freshwater systems, both rivers and lakes, and some stay in estuaries.  However, their life cycle is long in fresh water.  On average in places, it is 18 years long and then they make their return path, turn silver again and the cycle continues.  In other words, we are talking about a species that has a long life cycle and it is important in this context to understand that.  It is also important that in poorer catchments, for example, in which there is not a lot of food available, sometimes they can be in the catchment for up to 30 years and longer.  One is dealing with a species that has this length of a life cycle.<br/>As for the status of the species, the latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, which offers international advice on this species right across Europe, is that the status of eels remains critical and urgent action is needed.  ICES advises that anthropogenic mortality, which is man-made mortality from recreational and commercial fishing, as well as hydroelectric power - we have problems with hydroelectric power stations blocking access to waters - &quot;affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to as close to zero as possible, until there is clear evidence of sustained increase in both recruitment and the adult stock&quot;.  To give members an idea of stock levels across Europe, one could refer to a case in which the stock was pristine, that is, back in the 1980s.  I am talking about when this problem started to occur and it took so long for it to be understood that this was happening.  One is talking about populations that are somewhere between 1% and 5% of what they should be in some areas and between 5% and 10% in others.  Were these other sea stocks or salmon stocks, we would be taking really severe action in respect of them.  That is what the status of these stocks is like at present.  There has been some improvement over the past couple of years in respect of the return of elvers.  It is being suggested that there may be some improvement as to what is the level of those stocks at the moment.  However, the best advice at present is that the stocks are only approximately 10% of what they should be in pristine status.  That is the general picture in respect of the stocks.<br/>As for the second part, which is how are we doing when compared to others, the actions for other countries are not something we are able to control and are outside our gift.  A working group was set up in 2009 at the time when this issue was being discussed and recommendations were made then regarding the management of eels in the future.  At that stage, a decision was made to take a number of management action regarding eels, one of which was the closure of both the commercial and recreational fishery in eels in Ireland.  Another was to have mitigation in respect of the hydroelectric power aspect of this issue and to that degree, there has been a large trap and transport programme in which eels are being transferred physically across the hydroelectric stations in Ireland on the rivers Erne and Shannon, for example.  Work has been done on examining water quality and improvement.  There must be a nationwide eel monitoring programme and we also have been looking at what impassable barriers there are to eels.  Other countries have reported back and there is an information group sitting in Europe to consider how the other eel management plans are performing.  I can tell members that only 21% of 81 eel management units have reached their targets, while 42% are not reaching their targets and a further 22% of those eel management units did not report at all.  Consequently, the situation is being monitored.  From the commercial fishery perspective, I note we are on a three-year reporting cycle.  This was reviewed in 2012, when there was a lot of public consultation and a lot of meeting with eel fishermen and all the stakeholders involved in this issue.  This process is due to commence again for 2015.  As part of that process, the latest scientific information will be reviewed and there will be an engagement with the stakeholders.  It is not the case that anyone has stated these fisheries are closed forever or anything like that but the status of the stocks is very poor on the current scientific information.</p></speech>

There must be a role for our European Union representatives in this regard because it is clear that Ireland probably is the only country in the European Union that is taking really seriously eel conservation, which I support 100%.  I do not believe that Ireland is in a position to solve this problem on its own.  I believe that those who are involved in eel fisheries are entitled to some compensation for the fact that a large part of their income is now gone.  I also believe the reluctance of other European countries to get seriously involved in this matter is because of this factor, namely, the question of compensation.  This is an issue that should be addressed openly and honestly at European level but at present, we appear to be the only ones who are seriously concerned with it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.685" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Greg Forde" time="10:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014102200007#F00900"><p>I will deal briefly with the matter of water pollution.  This is one of the staff's top priorities in respect of the protection of our waters and fish stocks.  The Deputy made reference to one particular instance and as that matter is before our legal department at present, we are not really in a position to give the joint committee further details on that.  However, we are involved in pollution cases through the courts in three or four different areas.  One is at a municipal level and in that respect, we are somewhat at loggerheads with local authorities and perhaps with Irish Water in the future, as we push repeatedly for the upgrading of water treatment works.  I acknowledge there now is in place an enormous programme for upgrading sewage treatment plants, which hopefully will take some of the pressure off in this regard.</p><p>  Other matters are agriculture-related, such as silage and slurry effluent and again, there is a huge push within the farming community to improve practices there.  We are also doing a lot of joint work with Teagasc on best farm practices and things like that to try to help to improve matters.  We still have problems and we take a serious line in this regard to ensure the standard is maintained.  There is much ongoing activity like that.  In some years, it is really down to how the rainfall comes because slurry can be spread at certain times of the year but this can also be done inappropriately.  For example, if one spreads the slurry just before a big heavy shower of rain, the next thing is all the nutrients will go into the rivers and problems will arise.  We are getting away from the position that used to obtain years ago whereby putting the slurry out on the land was a disposal mechanism, rather than an enrichment mechanism to enable crops to grow and we are working on that.</p><p>  This year, we have had 27 fish kills, which means there have been 27 occasions when, as a consequence of some activity, fish have died.</p> <p>Some have been related to simple little things such as rivers drying out.  We have probably had more little streams drying out this year than in the past 25 years.  Some of them are caused by small amounts of pollution but in a river that is at a very low level.  There is a cohort of staff who are specifically briefed on water pollution and they work on that.</p><p> The second element to the Deputy's question was working with other agencies.  In the last one I mentioned Teagasc.  We have many ongoing river restoration programmes with the Office of Public Works where we are trying to integrate with its legal remit, which is maintaining certain drainage programmes around the country.  We have it doing so in a much more fish-friendly and habitat-friendly way.  It is similar with Waterways Ireland with regard to weed clearance.  We dovetail with it regarding fish stocks in the waterways it manages and controls, such as the canals and the Barrow.</p><p> We work closely with the EPA regarding issues we believe have an EPA element to them, and it contacts us if it believes there is a fisheries matter.  We do a lot of work with it and we also bring EPA personnel out in our RIBs when they need to get samples in estuaries or offshore.  Dr. Byrne mentioned bass, which falls under the remit of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  We are the warranted officers who control the bass now.  That is an arrangement between the two organisations.  All our staff are warranted for the next two years by the SFPA and we carry out work on the protection of bass because it is an angling-only species.  There is no commercial TAC - no quota - for commercial boats to land bass.  As a consequence our fishery officers - I have my warrant in my bag - can protect bass.</p></speech>

I will outline some quick figures.  Our budget is &euro;24.9 million of which about &euro;19 million is pay.  We knock out about &euro;3 million to &euro;5 million a year on other projects depending on what we are involved in.  Bearing in mind the size of the agency and what we do, we are actually relatively light on budget.  The big thing we spend our money on is vehicles.  When we have our guys tooled up with a good vehicle, good PP equipment and some of the technology we mentioned such as spotting scopes, which are expensive, and so forth, we can do a fair chunk of our protection as well as our education and various other jobs.</p><p>  Based on a socio-economic survey, every &euro;1 spent on angling generates approximately &euro;22, which is incredibly high.  The reason for that is that when a guy goes fishing, he tends to go and stay.  He needs petrol, lunch, bait and all the rest of it.  In overall value for money terms I believe the agency is generating a pretty good return.  It is a difficult concept.  I will give a very quick example.  Dr. Forde mentioned that this year we are looking to take about 13 km a net.  In the last two years we took about 24 km each.  Does that mean we are half as efficient this year as we were last year?  The answer is "No".  It means we may be even more efficient in terms of stopping more incidents or we may be a bit more efficient, but combined with environmental factors that change things.  That is why it is a difficult concept to pin down.  Overall for the budget of the agency and the size of it, I think we are delivering a reasonable amount.</p></speech>

I am thinking in particular of the River Dee in Ardee.  The sewage treatment plant in Ardee is quite close to the River Dee and discharges into the River Dee.  I was not too pleased with what I saw going into the Dee six or seven years ago.  I hope that has changed.  How often do we monitor discharges from sewage treatment works into rivers?  Do we have annual inspections or ones every two months?  Do we have standards to maintain with discharges required to be within certain guidelines?  How often do we check them out?</p></speech>

The fisheries service has a department of environmental officers and I ask Dr. Forde to outline what our environmental officers do in that particular job.</p></speech>

We would be looking for abnormal occurrences and we would carry out spot checks on all of the wastewater treatment plants, but especially the ones about which we might have a concern.  I refer to ones that are close to their production capacity and ones that may have a bit of a chequered history.  Where we have concerns, we would ensure we would visit them fairly often.  Even in the current month I am looking at a discharge pipe from a particular wastewater treatment plant where stuff called sewage fungus grows below it.  It shows very poor quality of effluent.  When we see that, we will take our own samples and talk to the people in the wastewater treatment plant.</p><p>  There may be occasions when we put up the yellow flag and say things are not right there and we advise EPA.  Both agencies have a role because it will come and check that the plant is discharging as per its licence, but even within that we are watching the quality of the river downstream.  I cannot say that we are going into every place on a rigid basis because some of them are being visited far more frequently than others.  Some are performing incredibly well because they are much more modern facilities.  There must be 20 treatment plants being constructed at the moment throughout the country.  There is a big investment programme at the moment which one hopes will lead to improved discharges.</p><p>  On the specific issue of the River Dee, I do not have any details.  It has not been banging my door down recently, so to speak.  That might be a good sign.</p></speech>

I welcome the CEO and the officials from Inland Fisheries Ireland.  I read the opening statement and I am very encouraged by what they have said, particularly in promoting both angling and sea angling.  Obviously angling is of tremendous benefit to the State; that is not disputed.  Sea angling is probably underperforming.  I live in a constituency in west County Cork that has huge resources in terms of infrastructure that could support sea angling.  Significant investment has taken place over the past 15 years.  I believe we have identified almost 200 piers and quays along the west County Cork coastline that would support sea angling and support communities that desperately need that kind of economic investment.</p><p>  For sea anglers from the UK, Europe or North America looking for a location, does the IFI have a resource to identify locations that are ideally suited for sea angling and the types of species that are predominant in that area?  When the witnesses talk about promoting sea angling, is it underpinned by a document, a plan or some effort pointing out areas where anglers would get very good results?  That is what would bring foreign anglers back.  They might be less inclined to come back if they go to an area and are disappointed by it.  Is there a resource that allows for this?</p><p>  Angling is a significant tourist industry in west County Cork, as is the potential for sea angling.  Commercial sea fishing and aquaculture are also significant industries there.  A balance needs to be struck and there are sensitivities around each of those areas.</p> <p>I would also see sustainable aquaculture as one of the only potential job creating vehicles in the area where I live.  It is difficult to get IDA Ireland type enterprises to come as far as where I live.  Aquaculture has been identified as an area that is required.  If it is done sustainably and well, has Dr. Byrne confidence in the aquaculture licensing process within either the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or the appeals?  Is he conscious of the sensitivities between the demands of the angling community, the aquaculture community, the commercial sea fisheries community and, to a lesser extent, the sea angling community?  Has he confidence in the institutions that would act as referee in balancing the sensitivities of those competing interests?  Has he a conflict with the science the Marine Institute publishes in terms of sea lice, for example?  Is Dr. Byrne conscious that if any one of the stakeholders involved in that mix - where I live, it is a volatile and sensitive environment between the competing sectors - overplays his or her hand, it becomes contentious and difficult to deal with?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.697" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ciaran Byrne" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014102200009#H00200"><p>I thank Deputy Harrington for those interesting questions.  I will deal with the sea angling side of it and touch on some of the other issues he mentioned.  I might ask Dr. Gallagher to talk about some of the latest research on sea lice and some of the international experience on the aquaculture side of matters.</p><p>  On sea angling, Deputy Harrington is correct that is it most beneficial to rural economies.  There is a lot of it.  When we looked at our socio-economic survey, the largest grouping is sea anglers.  The person most likely to pick up a fishing rod and go fishing is a sea angler.  If we put our hand on our heart and question whether we are doing enough for sea anglers, we have identified that we are probably not doing enough for sea anglers and we need to do more.  In terms of our next round of the strategic plan, we will focus more on the sea angling community.</p><p>  We have a marketing promotion department, including qualified angling guides who have all the various angling qualifications.  We produce sea angling guides for a number of locations around the coast, which are freely available as downloads.  A person can find out where there are good fishing marks, the kind of tackle and lure one should use, and the types of species one is likely to encounter.  If a tourist in west Cork sees the little brown sign which reads "sea angling", we have sea angling guides in many such areas.  These guides are not specific to individual locations.  For example, it might be a sea angling guide to west Cork or a sea angling guide to the Shannon Estuary.  The guides give an understanding of what species are available in the area concerned.</p></speech>

We have the number one angling information website.  When one looks at fishing in Ireland, one comes to our website.  We have a comprehensive website.  The United Kingdom is our primary market - let us not get away from that.  Sea angling in the United Kingdom, according to the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, Cefas, study in 2012, is worth &pound;884 million.  Our next two markets are France and the Netherlands, and we provide the website in Dutch, French and English.  It is a multilingual website.</p><p>  For fishing and angling in Ireland, that is the best angling website going.  It gives our information.  It gives links to charter boat providers and local guides.  Where, for example, an individual in Birmingham is thinking of coming to west Cork to fish, he should be able to get onto our website to get in contact with all involved and get the main information he needs.  That informs a visitor to come.</p><p>  In terms of promoting the area, we would hold a significant number of journalist trips every year.  What would happen typically in the case of one of the large sea angling magazines is that a journalist would come over and we would accompany him, sort him out on a sea angling trip and put him in the right locations.  These journalists are typically good anglers.  They will write the headline piece on how wonderful fishing in west Cork is and point out the enormous cod or whatever they caught.  That turns up in an English angling magazine with all the details associated with coming to west Cork.  That is a significant way of promoting the location because if we tell anglers on our website how good it is, they may believe us, but it really drives promotion when the angling journalist, who has nothing to gain or lose, states he came here, had a wonderful time, what he caught and how he did it.</p><p>  As a metric every year in this regard, we look at the number of editorials and articles we get versus what it would have cost us to pay to put those in.  We normally work up between &euro;350,000 and &euro;400,000 worth of articles in various angling magazines throughout Europe and America from these journalists' visits.  We also ensure placement of articles in various magazines.</p><p>  We approach it from two ends of the spectrum - providing the information for the individual to come and also promoting and developing the resource.  We attend some of the big angling trade shows and bring our information.  The big one, at the NEC in Birmingham, was a sea angling show and, while it was going, we attended that.</p><p>  When we attend the shows, we bring angling experts.  When one goes to an angling show, they do not want someone to tell them how beautiful Ireland is, the green fields and so on.  They want a guide to tell them exactly what lure to bring and exactly how one does it.  Many of our staff are angling experts.  They would have fished in the Irish international team.  I have a chap up in Donegal, Mr. Michael John Patton, who fished for the Irish sea angling team which won recently.  He is the guy.  He is the front face of angling when one talks to Inland Fisheries Ireland at an international show.</p><p>  We are pushing, but we need to do more.  There is an area to be looked at - the charter boat area.  We need to do more with that.  We are working closely with the North West Charter Skippers Association, but there are other groups.  We have strong links with the charter skippers in Cobh.  Deputy Harrington will be aware of Mr. Murphy running the bass initiative in Cobh Harbour.  He is a hotelier ostensibly and he runs a phenomenal fishing operation.  There are good skippers on the Clare coast as well with whom we are working.  We need to be a little more cohesive, however, and do a bit more in terms of that sector.</p><p>  Deputy Harrington quite correctly identified three finely balanced competing interests and they are important to a rural community.  Angling is only one of them.  We have a strong belief that they can all exist in harmony.  The Deputy asked whether aquaculture is sustainable.  Inland Fisheries Ireland has stated repeatedly in the media that it supports aquaculture.  We recognise that aquaculture is an important part of the mix of rural communities, if it is sustainable.  What we mean by that is where one sector does not potentially negatively impact on another sector.  We all aspire to having that.  We all want that and that can be achieved.</p><p>  In terms of the science of sea lice, I might ask Dr. Gallagher to address two aspects: the large international report done on sea lice by our Norwegian colleagues, which was funded by the Norwegian seafood sector, and the international experience.</p></speech>

From our perspective, it is the sustainable part we are trying to help.  We are not against aquaculture.  The scientific community I work with works in rural areas.  We recognise the difficulties.  We spoke about the species.  There are a diminished number of species we can use and there are many difficulties in rural areas.  Dr. Byrne outlined that there must be a mix.  We also have the habitats directive under which salmon are protected.  We are the competent authority on wild salmon and sea trout.  Our onus is to look at that and see whether it is sustainable.</p><p>  We have evidence.  There is international evidence, from Norway, Scotland and all the other big aquaculture countries of potential damage that can be accrued from aquaculture facilities, whether via escaped fish or parasite transfer, such as sea lice.  We have our own scientific analysis and evidence.  We are happy to work with anyone, to talk about that or to give advice.  If we could be included to give that advice on protection, that is what we are trying to do.</p><p>  On the science, the two can work together.  There are opportunities in Ireland for that to work together.  It would be remiss of us not to look at the experience in other countries where the sector has developed to understand what we can learn from there.</p> <p>Actions are being taken in other countries to help the sustainability of aquaculture development.</p><p> With regard to the international perspective, a definitive literature review of more than 300 papers has been done by colleagues in the nature institute in Norway and while they have also concluded there are potential impacts in respect of sea trout and salmon, that does not mean that occurs everywhere or that it occurs all the time.  It has been an ongoing issue for a number of years.  There have been discussions and two schools of thought have emerged from a scientific perspective.  We are happy to discuss this with anyone, to put the evidence we have on the table to support our position and to work with anyone to see if sustainable aquaculture can be developed.</p></speech>

I have documents from the Marine Institute and I have documents from the IFI which outline different positions.  It is difficult for a lay person and a public representative to sail on an even keel through what I understand is required in a rural peripheral area in respect of sustainability.  I am not a referee and this is difficult to manage.  Is there any way, for example, that the Marine Institute and the IFI could bring the research together? In an inflamed scenario, anyone can cite scripture for his or her own purpose.  A published fact sheet can be one person's bible and the Marine Institute's research could be someone else's, but they give me two entirely different views.  That is difficult to deal with.  With regard to the scientific advice, which feeds into the licensing of aquaculture projects and the protection of angling interests, who calls the shots?  It seems we have two referees enunciating different positions and that is difficult to navigate.</p></speech>

The aquaculture debate is not new.  It started first in 1989-90 following the sea trout stock collapse, and we have not moved off first base in the debate.  We went through the 1990s with a range of task forces and working groups but we have not moved.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to its credit, has implemented a pest control strategy.  Significant improvements have been made at national level, which we acknowledge.  We have not moved away, however, from the description we have provided.  The IFI, the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, and his former Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, had suggested a three person group to assess everything independently of all the science and so on and to make adjudications to chart a way forward once and for all.  The IFI board signed up and thought it was a good way forward.  We looked for support for this because we recognise the dichotomy that Deputies from coastal areas face with these two sectors.  They are not mutually exclusive.  People have painted us into box.  When one sector is well managed and policed, it does well and this equally applies to the other sector.  They can co-exist but we believe some form of grouping such as the three person group recommended by Deputies Rabbitte and O'Dowd would be a good way to negotiate this issue.</p></speech>

I do not know whether the IFI has full confidence in the licensing system.  Licensing has moved on.  I am not a scientist and, again, I do not know whether it is where it should be.  I recognise there is great frustration within the industry with licensing and there is visible and audible annoyance among the angling community.  Communities that are desperately looking to exploit resources and to survive are in the middle.  There is stasis on the issue.  Dr. Byrne said the debate began in 1989 and has not moved off first base.  The IFI is a stakeholder, as are the industry and the Department.  Can someone make the leap?</p></speech>

We have many important inland fisheries in my county, including the River Moy and Lough Mask.  Ballina is the salmon capital of Ireland, if not Europe.  Fisheries protection was referred to.  I understand that in 2010, because of the moratorium on public service recruitment, all the fisheries officers on short-term contracts were let go.  Tourist numbers for the Ballina region have increased by 13% over the past year and fishing is a significant reason for that.  Public representatives are told anecdotally that because there are fewer protection officers, they would pay for themselves if they were reinstated.  The Budget Statement referred to lifting the moratorium.  What is the IFI's view on that?  It was obvious walking around that region during the summer meeting fishermen from France and elsewhere on the Continent that fishing is a significant attraction.  Does the organisation need more people on the ground?  Dr. Byrne suggested in his presentation that technology is substituting for people.  What is his view on the need for additional fisheries officers?</p><p>  Members referred to pollution.  There is industrial pollution, farming pollution and pollution by local authorities.  What are the percentages for each category?  Dr. Byrne said there have been 27 fish kills this year.  He also referred to prosecutions.  Does he have a nationwide breakdown for them in recent years?</p><p>  Dr. Byrne suggested the termination of drift netting drove illegal fishing into the estuaries.  What happened to the people who earned a livelihood from drift netting?  I acknowledge compensation was paid.  People in Erris, however, dispute the figures in the log book relating to tributaries of the River Moy.  I am not a fisheries buff but is there an issue for people in coastal areas who in effect had their livelihoods wiped out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-22a.710" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Greg Forde" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014102200011#K00100"><p>I will respond as quickly as possible.  With regard to the protection officers, the benefits of the technological era have been twofold.  One is that we have brought our staff around to a new way of thinking and being cuter about what they do.  We did that for two reasons: first, to be more efficient and, second, to cover for the fact that where there used to be a team of five there is now three and in terms of walking or whatever, the same amount of ground simply cannot be covered.  Instead of walking one bank of the river, the personnel come down the river in a kayak, which allows them check anglers on both sides of the river.  The anglers did not see that coming because they are looking down river trying to catch a fish and the next thing they are being tapped on the shoulder.  Not only are we now able to patrol the river with one person, but we are covering both banks.</p><p>  We have a complement of seasonal staff who come on for our critical period.  Thankfully, we have managed to hold on to them throughout this period.  We have 34 additional staff who join our ranks for a six month contract each year.  They are vital.  They are also younger blood.  As the members can see, I have more grey hairs than brown ones.  There are many members of staff who are older and they are not able to chase poachers as quickly as they could in the past.  These young men come along in the summer bubbling with enthusiasm.  They lift the morale and the capacity in terms of what we can do, so we are getting a good deal of additional benefit.  However, I would benefit from more staff.  We welcome the measure in the budget which will allow us to recruit within our budget.  We will be examining key problem areas where staff have fallen below a safe level in which to operate.</p><p>  Regarding pollution, it normally breaks down around 50-50 between industrial-municipal pollution and deliberate and accidental pollution events.  We have to be very clear about when we prosecute for pollution.  If significant numbers of fish are killed in a fish kill and we have what we believe is a strong case, we take it to court.  It may be that a wall failed on a silage effluent or whatever.  That is unfortunate but the policy is that we will prosecute where a fish kill has occurred.  We take fish kill cases to court where we identify the source of the fish kill.  </p><p>  There would be the deliberate cases also, which are highlighted clearly in a court.  Thankfully, the judges are incredibly robust in dealing with matters where they believe someone has deliberately killed fish.  Some people think it is very simple to go out and stock the river but in the river is a stock of wild fish.  They have grown there throughout their lives.  They are genetically unique in the area, and they have adapted to whatever is in the area.  One cannot go in and throw fish out of a fish pond on a fish farm.  They are totally different, and they will not adapt to the area.  They will be available for anglers.  They will take them out but nature must be allowed to take its course.  In terms of a fish kill that wipes out a river, it might be six or seven years before that river establishes a proper population of fish throughout it.  We need to be very aware of that.</p><p>  On drift netting, a compensatory measure was brought in.  The members will appreciate that at the time quite a number of the fishermen were prepared to retire.  They were at an appropriate age.  Another measure was introduced to allow them go into a different area but there were not enough different areas available for people in a rural area off Porturlin or somewhere like that where there is not much else to do.  There was not a lot else made available to them, and I concur with the Chairman that there was not much else for them.  There was a gun put to the head of fisheries regarding the protection of salmon and on the idea of indiscriminate drift-net fisheries, Ireland was about to be blown out of the water, so to speak, in Europe.  We are now setting the standard and other countries not too far from Ireland are coming under scrutiny from Europe in terms of how they are managing these mixed stocks in the sea.  Unfortunately, there was not an option here.  Opportunities were given to some people but not everybody was in a position to diversify.  In terms of the opportunities in rural areas in Connemara, I am from Connemara and I live in Connemara so I would be aware of some of the people in a similar boat.</p><p>  In regard to the River Moy, it is the salmon capital.  It has a lot of fish.  In years like this one when the people upstream have not been catching fish, they believe everything is going on downstream from them, and they blame everybody else for taking too many fish.  There was a bit of a reality check in the Moy this year.  I do not believe it has performed as well as other years.  We have been working on the counters at the cribs in Ballina.  We have put a counter into another of the gaps so that we might get a better handle on the number of fish going upstream, but this year was disappointing.</p></speech>
