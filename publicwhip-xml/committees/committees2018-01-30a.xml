    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Carroll" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#C00200"><p>I thank the Chair and committee members.  I am accompanied by Mr. Martin Finucane, head of strategic energy policy at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Ms Laura Behan from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mr. John Muldowney, responsible for climate change and bioenergy policy at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Mr. Frank Maughan, head of climate mitigation and awareness at the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p> <p>  I have prepared a presentation, copies of which have been provided to members, and I propose to make a brief opening statement on the Paris Agreement, the EU and Ireland's emissions targets, Ireland's national mitigation plan, the national dialogue on climate action and community aspects of the renewable electricity support scheme, as requested.  </p> <p>  The Paris Agreement aims to hold the increase in global average temperature from pre-industrial levels to well below 2&deg; Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 &deg; Celsius.  Country pledges made by the 195 parties for 2050 exceed the warming limit of the Paris Agreement, pointing to the need for enhanced global commitment.  On behalf of its member states, the EU has committed under the Paris Agreement to a reduction of at least 40% in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, to be achieved by a reduction of 43% in the emission trading scheme, ETS, sector, and a reduction of 30% in the non-ETS sector.</p> <p>  It is in the non-ETS sector that each member state of the EU has legally binding targets.  It should be noted that Ireland's non-ETS sector is large relative to the EU as a whole, and that within Ireland's non-ETS sector, agriculture accounts for 46% of emissions, compared with 18% for the EU 28.  </p> <p>  The latest Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, projections indicate that Ireland's emissions are to be between 4% and 6% below 2005 levels by 2020, against a 20% reduction target.  There are a number of reasons for this, including our limited post-crash public investment capacity.  For 2030, Ireland will have a 30% emissions reduction target in the non-ETS sector.  This represents a significant challenge.  To begin addressing this challenge, the Government published its first statutory national mitigation plan last July.  It represents an initial step to set us on a pathway to achieve the level of decarbonisation required.  The plan contains 61 measures that are in place and 17 that are under consideration, as well as 106 actions.  The Government recognises that this first plan does not provide a complete roadmap to decarbonising by 2050, but begins the process of development of medium to long-term mitigation choices for the next and future decades.</p><p>This will be an ongoing process and will include the preparation of the ten-year national development plan and successive national mitigation plans at least every five years, as provided for in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015.  Decarbonisation will involve fundamental societal transformation, as well as ongoing engagement with society through the national dialogue on climate action.  The central objective of the dialogue is to create awareness, engagement and the motivation to act across society.</p><p> The green schools national climate change action and awareness programme is already under way and an advisory group has been established by the Minister to input into the organisation of regional and local events that will be piloted in the first half of this year.  This recognition of the centrality of communities to changing our societies is fully recognised in the design of new policy measures such as the renewable electricity support scheme.  Community participation and community ownership are at its core, and the recent consultation set out a number of policy options to support community involvement.</p><p> I look forward to engaging with members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#D00300"><p>I am delighted to have this opportunity to talk to the committee.  I will not go through the comments in my written statement concerning the urgency of taking action, but we are heading in the wrong direction on climate change.  While taking action can be expensive, there can be co-benefits in respect of health and the environment.  The job of the council I chair is to advise on how we can decarbonise Irish society at least cost.  There have been wins in respect of renewable electricity whereby the cost of electricity for consumers until 2012 was lower because of the deployment of renewable electricity.  Win-wins are available.</p> <p>  Regarding the urgent need to take action, I was asked to say something about the emissions targets.  We will miss our target for 2020 by a significant amount.  We will miss the 2030 and 2050 targets because we are heading rapidly in the wrong direction.  Without major new policy initiatives, and based on business as usual and policy as usual, we are heading in the wrong direction.  The nature of the initiatives will require broad support in the Oireachtas if they are to happen.  It is not just Government that decides; it is the Oireachtas that decides.  That is why I particularly welcome this opportunity to give the committee our advice.</p> <p>  Looking to the future, we need to consider a range of different scenarios because we are uncertain what will happen.  The forecasts are based on work I did in 2013 and 2014 on growth over the next decade.  In the work I did in 2013 and 2014, we may have been too pessimistic about the economy, and the problems may be greater than we think they are, so we need, and the Department needs, to go back and look at the scenarios.  The cost of technologies has fallen more rapidly than expected, so that is an area in respect of which we need to map out a route to the future which will be internally consistent.  If we electrify transport but do not deal with the problem of electricity itself, we could lock matters into a bad place.</p> <p>  The council is strongly of the view that we need to reflect the damage emitting carbon does to climate and the world in the price of carbon.  We need first of all a carbon tax, and there are three reasons for this.  It discourages us from burning fossil fuels and encourages us to switch to alternatives such as renewable electricity.  It also results in revenue for the Government, which can be used to cut taxes elsewhere and can be used in investment in climate change.  The ESRI published between 1991 and 2014, when I retired, on average one and a half reports a year on why carbon taxes are the right solution.  There is nothing new to be said on this issue.  One of the key reasons is that Ireland could be better off with a carbon tax because it may reduce the need for taxes elsewhere, so there is a benefit.  The third, and probably most important, reason is that business in Ireland and worldwide knows it will make money out of investing in technologies that will be clean if the price of carbon is high.  This is what is driving the research in electric cars worldwide: the prospect that carbon will be expensive.  This is why we need to reflect the damage done to climate in the price of carbon.</p> <p>  One area we are concerned about is the EU emissions trading scheme.  In our first statement, in June 2016, we recommended the Government support the French initiative to put in a carbon price floor, which would have guaranteed a rising and substantial price of carbon and electricity.  It would have sent the right signal and obviated the need for subsidies for renewable power because the price would have made it profitable to invest in renewables.  This is a much better solution.  One thing we need to explore is whether Ireland, along with a range of other countries, should introduce a carbon price floor even if the EU does not do so.  The Dutch Government in its most recent programme for Government proposes to do so.  These are areas in respect of which we must deal not just with the non-ETS sector, but with the ETS sector as well, electricity in particular.</p> <p>  The council has strongly recommended we stop subsidising peat-fired power generation.  The subsidy is &euro;100 million a year to keep a few hundred jobs in place.  One could produce real, sustainable jobs which are not damaging society by spending just one year's subsidy.  It is right that people who lose out from our tackling climate change should be compensated, and we need to do so.  The money is there.  To spend &euro;100 million a year on subsidising the emission of 2.75 million tonnes of carbon dioxide does not seem wise or sensible.  That is important.</p> <p>  Finally, we need to define what neutrality is in agriculture.  We need to take the win-wins.  Agriculture will have to change significantly, particularly in the context of land use.  Changes to land use could make a big difference, taking carbon out of the atmosphere rather than pumping it into it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Healy" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#D00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting the IFA to address the committee.  The agrifood sector is Ireland's largest indigenous productive sector, exporting food, drink and forest products worth over &euro;13.5 billion in 2017 and providing employment to more than 300,000 people directly and indirectly.  It has been a key driver in Ireland's economic recovery and is the backbone of economic activity across the rural economy.</p> <p>  Regarding climate, there are a number of facts that are often unheard in the climate and climate response debate.  Since the established base year of 1990, agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 3.5%, while Ireland's national emissions have increased by 10.4%, driven mainly by the transport sector, where emissions have increased by 139%.  Emissions from energy industries have increased by 10%.  European and international leaders speak with one voice about agriculture's climate response.  Agriculture's role must be considered in the context of the additional demands on food, fuel and energy production in addition to environmental enhancement.  That said, Ireland has a responsibility to act, and within this context agriculture has an important role to play, while respecting the need to safeguard food production.</p> <p>  Ireland is taking a leading position by targeting European funding through the Common Agricultural Policy to areas that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the sector.  Almost 90% of the measures in Ireland's rural development programme involve climate-reducing elements.  These measures include the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, which promotes the retention of soil carbon stocks through the encouragement of climate-friendly agricultural practices such as minimum tillage, green-cover establishment and low-emission manure spreading techniques.  GLAS is oversubscribed, with a high level of farmer interest in participating.  I strongly encourage the Government to reopen the scheme and allow maximum participation.  Other programmes include the beef data and genomics programme and the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, better known as TAMS, which assist farmers to reduce emissions and increase productive efficiency.</p> <p>  Emissions intensity as a proportion of output is the most appropriate climate measure of agriculture, particularly if we accept the position of the EU heads of Government and the international Paris Agreement of December 2015.</p><p>Research completed by the European Commission's science and knowledge service, the Joint Research Centre, demonstrates that Ireland has an emission-efficient model of food production.  Ireland's dairy farmers have the lowest carbon footprint in the EU for milk production and our beef farmers are in the top five.  This is not surprising given our natural grass-based model of food production and our temperate climate, with 90% of our agricultural lands being carbon sequestering grasslands.  These facts around Irish farmers' emission-efficient model of food production are welcomed but they still provide no room for complacency.</p><p> Ireland is the only country in the world that monitors, measures and manages carbon from farm to fork.  For example, 90% of beef exports are now in an audit and carbon foot printing programme and 100% of milk production is entering into a carbon auditing cycle.  In addition, over 137,000 carbon assessments have been completed on farms to date as part of Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green sustainability programme.  In the IFA, we are leading a voluntary initiative called Smart Farming with the Environmental Protection Agency.  This aims to address the dual challenges of improving farm incomes while reducing environmental impact.  In 2017, the average cost savings identified by participating farmers was &euro;8,700, with average emissions reductions of 10%.</p><p> Under the renewable energy directive, Ireland has a mandatory target to produce at least 16% of all energy consumed by 2020 from renewable sources.  This is to be met by 40% from renewable electricity, 12% from renewable heat and 10% from the renewable transport sector.  Agencies such as the Institute of International and European Affairs estimate that Ireland is likely to be hit with a bill of &euro;610 million by 2020 for breaching the targets.  The IFA believes this money should instead be diverted into a climate activation programme, focused on policy measures including the re-opening of the green low carbon agri-environment scheme; the announcement of a farm-based and community electricity tariff for renewable projects; the scaling up of on-farm emission reduction programmes; and the development of a national network of producer organisations to support the mobilisation of the private forestry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Sweeney" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#E00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to appear before it.  I recall being here or hereabouts almost 30 years ago, in 1990, for the first national climate change strategy, which is still the best.  Like all the others, it has failed miserably to deliver.</p> <p>  The first point to make is that Ireland is already encountering climate change.  Everywhere in the country today is 0.5&deg; Celsius warmer than it was 30 years ago.  We are on target for the kinds of changes in climate that the rest of the world is experiencing and will continue to experience.  We know from our modelling work that over the next 20 years or so we will warm by a further 0.5&deg; and perhaps even by as much as 1&deg; over the next 30 years.  That will not be crucial for Ireland.  It will extend our growing season and cause complications for our biodiversity but the real climate change impacts in Ireland will come from rainfall changes and increased winter rainfall in the west of Ireland in particular.  There will be decreased summer rainfall in the east, where our people are located and public water supply will become a growing concern.</p> <p>  One of the consequences of change of this nature is that the extremes will change much more quickly and radically than the mean.  It is part of the consequence when we examine the distribution of climate variables.  In many respects we have seen in Ireland over the past few years some of those extremes beginning to manifest themselves.  We cannot label individual extremes confidently yet to climate change but, increasingly, the science is enabling us to assess the contribution made by anthropogenic climate change to them.  We know from work done in Maynooth that the winter of 2013 to 2014 was the stormiest winter both in Ireland and the UK for at least the past 143 years.  That is an extreme event.  We know the winter of 2015 to 2016 was the wettest winter on record over large parts or even much of Ireland.</p> <p>  We saw extremes more recently in Donegal in August, where it had approximately half the amount of rain that Dublin had in the entire winter of December, January and February in six hours.  More recently, we saw floods in Mountmellick and members are aware of the more recent floods in Galway.  All of those are extreme events.  The once in a century event is, to some extent, a concept that has really passed its sell-by date.</p> <p>  The Paris obligations have been mentioned and the key phrase as far as I am concerned is that countries must act with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, with developed countries taking the lead.  The responsibility for doing most comes to those countries that are better off than other countries and which have historically contributed most to the problem.  We know the pathway means the world will have to decarbonise by 50% within the next 20 years, which is quite a tall order.  It means there is no time and space for promises or what we might do; there must be urgency in doing what we can now.</p> <p>  There are a number of studies indicating where we should be going.  The Stockholm climate equity calculator demonstrates that in the middle of the 2020s we will have crossed the line of equity and be in debt to the developing world with our large amounts of carbon emissions.  We are therefore part of the problem rather than the solution.  There is a certain revisionism going on with respect to the 2020 obligations, which were accepted by all parties.  Members can see in the documentation the extent to which they were endorsed by all parties at the time they were made.  Ireland, as we now know, is a laggard, as the Taoiseach said last month.  It is the worst performing country in Europe when it comes to climate performance.  The national policy position is over and above the climate change Act.  In Ireland and without any pressure, we have already endorsed where we should be going.  There should be an aggregate reduction of at least 80% compared with 1990 levels across the three key sectors.</p> <p>  We must change the culture of negotiation away from the pattern of returning from Brussels and getting a pat on the back for having got every concession and flexibility possible.  We see this very clearly in some of the examples I have given.  The 2030 example is best of all, as I have listed a variety of ways in which the Commission's proposals were watered down not solely by Ireland, but by countries, in some cases with Ireland supporting them.  It is important we tackle that problem.</p></speech>

Stop Climate Chaos has a set of policy recommendations submitted to the Department during the public consultation on the national mitigation plan and the Citizens' Assembly.  We believe, if implemented, these will go a significant way to getting Ireland on track to meeting its own climate action targets, as well as its increasing EU and global climate action mitigation.  Today, we will focus our contribution on governance and the crucial role this committee can play in the establishment of an effective policy and accountability cycle for climate action in Ireland.</p> <p>  Weather events across the globe and at home in recent years have seen an increased awareness within Ireland of the reality of climate change and the need for action.  We are starting to witness the more visible impacts but in other parts of the world, already increasingly frequent and intense weather events are devastating lives and livelihoods in the poorest countries that have contributed least to the problem and have the fewest resources to cope.</p><p>In east Africa today, more than 20 million people are continuing to struggle with persistent drought, and that is with today's level of warming.</p><p> Ireland has a proud, long-standing track record for its overseas aid programme.  This is a critical contributor to our global reputation.  However, it is significantly undermined by our continued poor performance on climate action.</p><p> It is important also to recognise that climate change poses more than environmental risks but systemic risks in the context of the failure to curb it in time to deliver on the Paris Agreement.  Beyond direct impacts in Ireland, we must be cognisant of spill-over effects of impacts elsewhere in the world, and on European countries, in regard to trade and infrastructure, transport, security and finance, as highlighted by the European Environmental Agency.  The risks posed by climate change to the financial system are twofold; the economic and financial implications of the direct physical impacts of climate change, such as the clean-up costs of more frequent and intense disasters, and the risks of failing to curb emissions in a timely manner leading to the prospect of a late, abrupt transition with significant systemic, financial, economic, social and political impacts.  That is not some kind of case analysis; these are risks highlighted by an advisory committee to the European Systemic Risk Board, and it has been highlighted publically and repeatedly by the Governor of the Bank of England, Dr. Mark Carney.</p><p> The Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 was a major milestone.  However, we must be clear that it is not a solution but a call to action.  In Paris in 2015, all states recognised the need to increase their action prior to 2020.  Furthermore, at its centre, the Paris Agreement contains a ratchet mechanism under which states must submit and report on their ever-increasing emission reductions commitments and actions, beginning in 2020.  This is not an externally imposed agenda.  The Paris Agreement ratchet mechanism is a recognition at the highest levels of Government, based on the Government-endorsed science, of the fact that there is only one feasible direction of travel, and we must speed up significantly and consistently in our collective interests.  Ireland&rsquo;s support for the weakest or least stringent provisions in EU legislation serves not only to hinder Irish action but EU action as a whole, undermining the progress of all 28 member states to the key goals of the Paris Agreement.</p></speech>

It will not deliver the changes we need.</p> <p>  One piece of analysis that has not been mentioned, as recently reported in the press, is that a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform memorandum from last September has been released under freedom of information.  It states:  "It would appear that almost no progress has been made on an appraisal-based, prioritised and integrated view of how to meet 2020 and 2030 climate targets".  That is a statement made after the mitigation plan was adopted by Government.  The advisory council said there is an urgent requirement for new policies, measures and action beyond what is committed to in the national mitigation plan.  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, said that we need a transformation of our energy, agriculture and transport systems if we are to deliver on our targets.  The official view of our mitigation plan, therefore, is that not enough action is being taken.</p> <p>  We take heart from what the Taoiseach said in the European Parliament some weeks ago, that is, that he was not proud of Ireland's record and that we are a laggard.  If that admission is the first step towards action, as is so often the case in these kinds of recovery programmes, we welcome it.</p> <p>  We want to outline today what we believe should happen next and we have broken that down into two sections in the presentation: what needs to happen every year and what needs to happen this year in particular.  Every year, we need a policy cycle of both planning and accountability that is transparent and effective.  The Climate Change Act 2015 establishes an annual policy cycle but there are too many loopholes in the way it is rolled out.  We believe this committee has a central role in ensuring parliamentary oversight and accountability.  For example, it is good to see representatives from the Climate Change Advisory Council here today and an independent climate scientist.  We believe representatives from the EPA should be here.  Representatives from the three organisations should come before the committee every January to lay out the state of the climate, so to speak, following which the committee can invite the Ministers who deliver their transition statements to come before it to allow members cross-examine them as necessary on their performance.  Representatives from the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, are here but where are the representatives from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?  The Minister, Deputy Ross, has said hardly anything on transport since his elevation to that Ministry.  I believe it is the committee's role, in the absence of anyone else, to be like the Committee of Public Accounts for carbon emissions and to bring before it representatives from all the Departments which have a responsibility to act.</p> <p>  In terms of what should happen this year in particular, I will mention two things.  This committee should immediately recommend to the Minister that he formally begins a process to revise the national mitigation plan.  He has called it a living document and it is time now to put that into practice.</p> <p>  The Oireachtas must treat the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on climate change as seriously as it took its recommendations on the eighth amendment.  Given the workload of the committee, we believe it is worth considering whether a new all-party committee with broader representation should be tasked, as happened previously, to come back to the Oireachtas with a consideration of those 18 recommendations from the Citizens' Assembly by the summer.</p></speech>

On transport, the committee has done work on the decarbonisation of transport and we will publish a report on that shortly.</p> <p>  I will take a number of questions, which I ask the witnesses to bank and if there is a particular question a witness wants to speak on, even if the question is not directed to them, please feel free to indicate.  I will start with the Department.  Regarding its comprehensive presentation, the committee would be interested to hear about major initiatives the Department is considering.  For example, the retrofitting of public buildings would not only reduce our emissions but would be a major initiative to lead the way in that regard.  What are the Department's plans regarding targets, dates and actions on reducing emissions?  Also, are there are plans for increased multi-annual budgets to help households in terms of retrofitting?  Last week, the committee heard that if one wants to have a complete retrofit of one's household, it would cost up to &euro;40,000.  Is the Department considering measures that would encourage households in terms of such retrofitting?</p> <p>  My next question is for Professor FitzGerald.  I do not disagree about having to increase our carbon tax but if we move away from dirty energy, we need to encourage people to use alternative clean energy and I am not sure we are there yet.  Professor FitzGerald might expand on that and how we need to proceed in that area.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Joe Healy of the IFA.  Can he explain why the green, low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments are so popular with the farming community?  He said it is over-subscribed.  He might expand on that issue.  I ask the witnesses to bank those questions.  I will call Deputy Stanley and then Deputy Dooley, who indicated.</p></speech>

It is good to have a broad range of organisations represented, many of whose members we have met in the past.  As for the Department, it is clear that not alone is there slippage but we are not even keeping apace.  If it were not for the crash of the economy between 2008 and 2013 and 2014, we would be galloping further ahead in terms of missing our targets.  Do the witnesses believe now that the issue of binding sectoral targets should be inserted in legislation?  Some of us sought that when the climate action legislation was before the D&aacute;il and in the forerunner of this committee of which I was a member.  While some areas have made a good deal of progress, others have not.  I refer to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in particular.</p> <p>  I welcome Professor John FitzGerald's contribution.  His comment that not alone have we missed the 2020 target but that he projects we will overshoot the 2030 and 2050 targets was interesting.  I recall discussing in this very room the fact that we will hit carbon cliffs, although I did not believe in 2013 that it would come as quickly as it has come.</p> <p>  I refer to the economics of converting to biomass as we hear different views to the effect that it is not possible to do it on a large scale.  Obviously, we do not want land that is being used for producing food to produce biomass crops.  A balance must be achieved in that regard.  My party, Sinn F&eacute;in, has produced a paper on biogas, a copy of which I am happy to give the representatives of the groups.  We would welcome their views on that.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Joe Healy from the IFA for his presentation, which I read with great interest.  In his statement he said farmers are reducing emissions but the Climate Change Advisory Council referred to increases in respect of agriculture.  Mr. Healy might address that and deal with the biomass question in terms of land use.</p> <p>  Also, regarding sugar beet, Mr. Healy will be aware that a meeting was held the other night in Bunclody on restarting the sugar beet industry.  Some experts reckon that has a role to play both in biodiversity and as a carbon sink because as Mr. Healy and I know, beet is a covering crop; in other words, it covers the ground with green leaves for about four or five months of the year.</p><p>What are the views of the witnesses on restarting it to address our greenhouse gas emissions and to reduce our huge dependency on beef and dairy?</p><p> As for the Stop Climate Chaos presentation, it was mentioned that we have the third highest level per person in the European Union.  This is alarming.</p><p> What is the single most important thing we can do with regard to electric vehicles?  We have fewer than 2,000 electric vehicles according to figures I was given recently.  There is uncertainty at present with regard to the charging system and its infrastructure because of the decision of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, that it should not stay with the ESB.  What should happen here?  What should we do to change this quickly?</p></speech>

The witnesses have all made very important presentations.  It is clear from everybody around the table that there is a crisis in terms of our lack of ability as an Oireachtas and a Government to address this issue.  Things are getting worse and worse.  It is very clear when we look at the graph provided by the Department, which sets out how Ireland compares within the EU, just how far we are behind everybody else.  My first question to the Department is does it think this issue has reached a crisis point?  Does the Department identify and does the Minister indicate that this is a crisis that needs to be addressed?  All that flows from this can be helpful.</p> <p>  It is always good to get a perspective of where we are at, where we are not at, how we are doing and how we are not doing and it is very clear it is not working.  What we then need is concrete advice and things we can do.  Professor FitzGerald spoke about a carbon tax.  This is obviously an item we must look at.  The carbon price floor has been examined.  This is an action item we can look at.  We can stop the subsidy to peat fire stations.  These are three concrete things we have to take on board but there must be more.  Mention was made of transport and heat.  We need to get direction from the witnesses, as experts, as to what will have a meaningful impact on our emissions and what we can do.  There are things we cannot do.  There is an issue with agriculture, no doubt about it, but if we were to halve the national herd overnight we would have a crisis in terms of being able to feed people, so this is not an option.  There are other measures that can be supported and I thank Mr. Healy for outlining them.</p> <p>  With regard to electric vehicles, people in my constituency tell me they bought into the idea of climate change and got an electric vehicle but while there are three charging points in Ennis none of them are working, and this goes on for weeks.  I think I am answering my previous question for Mr. Carroll because if it was a crisis for the Department, these issues would be to the fore and action would be taken.  We showed as a country and a Legislature the capacity to deal with a financial crisis.  We took really tough decisions that impacted massively on the lifestyle and lives of people.  Some people suffered electorally for that but it really was the right thing to do regardless of the political consequences that some suffered.  We are heading in the same direction.  There is a crisis of equal proportion but nobody is addressing it because it is not real and substantial in terms of the impact on a daily basis.</p></speech>

The one factor everybody has mentioned is the extent and magnitude of the problem and the urgent necessity to find short-term, interim and long-term solutions.  It is easy to identify the problem but it is much more difficult to identify alternatives and how they would be operated.</p> <p>  Professor FitzGerald mentioned land use change.  Will he elaborate on what suggestions he has, what changes he is speaking about and what changes he would recommend?  With regard to peat power generation and stopping the subsidy, our difficulty in Tipperary and the midlands is that communities have been built around it and there are jobs at stake.  It would be important that somebody would identify what are the alternatives for usage of our bogland.  People will accept change if there is an alternative that creates employment.  This is the difficulty.  One cannot just stop without doing some research and development work on alternatives.</p> <p>  Mr. Healy recommends reopening the GLAS programme.  What is the number of participants in GLAS?  How efficient and cost-effective is it?  What is the return for the economy?  I am a supporter of GLAS and it should be reopened but it is important to elaborate and state the case for it.</p></speech>

I will begin with the issue of sectoral targets, and then call on my colleague, Mr. Finucane, to deal with energy efficiency.  I will start by addressing the 2020 targets.  When setting targets for climate mitigation, it is very important that any target signed up to is technically achievable, considerations of cost efficiency have been factored in and there is fairness in how the burden is shared among all countries.  We are one of three countries that had the highest mitigation target for 2020 in the EU set-up, which was a 20% reduction.  It is true that at best, we will have a 4% to 6% reduction against that 20% reduction target.  There are some reasons for this.  Some of it is due to our limited post-crash public investment capacity.  Emissions growth has been coupled with economic growth from 2015, so our emissions have worsened.  There are certain structural constraints in terms of a very large agricultural sector, with 46% of our non-emissions trading system, ETS, emissions coming from agriculture.  This compares with 18% in the EU 28, and there is limited mitigation potential.</p> <p>  In terms of transport, the bulk of our emissions come from private car journeys and freight and we have a dispersed settlement pattern.  In terms of 2030, it has been suggested that Ireland sought every concession and every flexibility.  In fact, when the Commission published its effort-sharing regulation proposal, Ireland largely supported the proposal as published.  That is factual.  In terms of how we now address the 2030 target of a 30% reduction and the best way to deal with it, we will have to consider further policies, actions and measures.  It will involve Exchequer investment, private sector investment, regulation, tax measures, information provision and changes in the behaviour of individuals.  Many of these have been mentioned already.  Deputy Dooley asked whether the Department and the Minister recognise the scale of the problem and the answer is "yes".  The answer to whether we recognise the urgency of action is also "yes".</p> <p>  A comment was made on a Department of Public Expenditure and Reform memorandum from September, which highlighted the inadequacy of the appraisal system.  That agreed with the diagnosis made in July in the national mitigation plan that the appraisal system was not fit for purpose.</p><p>There is an action in the national mitigation plan, which is to be completed in 2018, to address that and that work is under way.  The September memorandum referred to, therefore, is simply confirming something that is explicitly recognised in the national mitigation plan, with an action to address it in 2018, and that will be done.</p><p> The last comment was about the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, seeing the need for further actions.  Further action is absolutely needed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Finucane" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#H00300"><p>Yes, just to address some of the questions on the energy perspective.  The Chairman asked about energy efficiency.  The Department operates its energy efficiency schemes through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.  Currently, on average, 20,000 to 25,000 houses per annum are grant aided to increase energy efficiency.  During the period 2009 to 2017, 210,000 homes received energy efficiency grants.  The challenge we have in the future is that many of those homes have been retrofitted with certain measures, but we need to retrofit at a much deeper level which will require additional funding.  The Department, and the Minister, have made significant cases to the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of the upcoming capital plan, and we expect to see significant funding made available in this area in the future.</p> <p>  We might also point out that regarding this year's budget, the overall capital budget for the SEAI was increased by approximately 50%, from about &euro;100 million capital to &euro;150 million capital, the significant portion of that being grant aids, not just for energy efficiency on homes but also in respect of commercial activity as well.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked specifically about public buildings.  The SEAI works very closely with the public sector and with the Office of Public Works, OPW, in terms of both retrofitting the existing building stock across the public sector and also working with the OPW to ensure that the new fleet coming in, either built by the OPW or hired by the OPW for use by the public sector, meet significantly higher standards from an energy perspective than they would have previously.  There is a good deal of action going on in respect of those two areas.</p> <p>  Several comments were made regarding subsidies for peat.  There are three peat stations in Ireland, one of which no longer receives a subsidy from the public service obligation, PSO.  The two remaining peat stations that do receive a subsidy are due to come out of support from the public service obligation in 2019.  Therefore, they will not be receiving support for burning peat beyond that period.  The likelihood is that they will increase.  Currently, increasing amounts of biomass are being burned in one of the plants and the likelihood is that from a strategic perspective that will increase and probably extend to the other two, but that is a commercial issue for the companies themselves.</p></speech>

If he wants to comment on anything else, he may do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John FitzGerald" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#H00500"><p>I will try to group them logically.  The Chairman asked about alternative clean energy.  One option is that we electrify heating but we do not know whether that is the right answer until we know about electricity, and that is one of the areas we need to explore.  Also, we are failing in our renewable heating obligation, more in rural areas than urban areas, and biomass may be an option, but as I indicated, much depends on the relative prices.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley asked about converting to biomass.  I agree with him.  On a large scale that does not makes sense.  However, in rural areas, a wood chip burner rather than oil may well make sense.  There are different ways of using biomass but I disagree with the Department on converting the peat stations to burning biomass.  Even if they burn 30% biomass, they will still be emitting more carbon dioxide per unit of electricity than anything else in Ireland.</p> <p>  I did a study on large-scale biomass with ESB International, Teagasc and another company 20 years ago.  In terms of the issue of biomass, it did not look as if burning it on a large scale made sense.  It is in the smaller scale usage.  It comes back to the point raised by Deputy Lowry about land use change, and here things fit together.  Farmers were making very little out of beef, and they are still making very little out of beef.  However, the study showed that if farmers switched from beef production, particularly on drumlin soils, to growing pollarded willow or whatever as biomass, less methane would be emitted from the cattle, the farmers would potentially make more money out of the biomass if there was a market, and the timber would suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  It would be a potential win-win.  There are possibilities here in terms of changing land use where agriculture can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.</p> <p>  Another policy which is very bad in a different context is draining the swamp.  Draining the swamp is also very bad in terms of peatlands because peatlands absorb carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  They suck it out and make the climate better.  In terms of providing incentives to make better use of lands, I do not have the answers.  Land use change can make a big difference.</p> <p>  In terms of electric vehicles and transport, investing in public transport makes huge sense, in particular combined with the national planning framework.  We need to live much more densely.  A study done by the University of Limerick showed that people living in Limerick emitted much less carbon dioxide per head than people in surrounding villages because the people from the surrounding villages were commuting into Limerick.  We need to reduce commuting, which will be a win-win for everybody.</p> <p>  The Chairman and another member raised the issue of heating and supporting vulnerable households in that she talked about the cost of retrofit.  The State cannot subsidise that.  It should be profitable for people to retrofit their homes.  There is the problem of the divorce index.  Myself and my wife decided that we had to make changes.  She wanted to go ahead immediately and we did.  She won.  We had to re-plumb the entire house to put in a really efficient boiler and at the same time we insulated the house.  It was chaos.  We did not divorce, but it is about the behavioural problems of households.  Our heating bills are 70% of what they were previously so it made eminent economic sense but with households, we are dealing with much more complex issues.  There are rural households where the people are elderly, poor and using solid fuels.  It would make sense for the State to go in but if someone knocks on the door of a house up a valley in Kerry and says, "We are here to turn your house upside down and make you comfortable", will that work?  In the area of households, we need, first, to target the very vulnerable households if we are going to spend State money and then, second, work out how to do that.  It is not just about price or subsidies.  It is how we get people to change who are scared and will be disrupted.  It is a more complex issue.  It is not just about price.  There are other issues.</p> <p>  Regarding peat, Deputy Lowry said that jobs are at stake but it would have been better if the &euro;100 million being spent this year had been spent on creating a lot of jobs.  We need to make a change in that regard and, as I said, I do not believe biomass is part of the solution.  I have not answered all the questions but I have tried to do so.</p></speech>

I will answer the one on the green, low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and Tom Short and Thomas Ryan might take the ones on emissions and the beet aspect.</p> <p>  I will deal with the two questions on the GLAS payments.  A value for money review was done on the reason the scheme is so popular.  It is oversubscribed.  Many more farmers have come into the scheme.  On the previous occasion, as soon as it was opened it was again oversubscribed.  There are two issues in this regard.  It is a rural development scheme.  There is money out of it for farmers to do the right thing, and it covers their costs.</p> <p>  Regarding carbon sequestration, over the five years of GLAS the target will be 90,000 ha of crop cover delivering 50,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide savings per year.</p><p>Minimum tillage is being used across 30,000 ha with the potential to sequester 10,000 tonnes of carbon per year, and 1.4 million m of new hedgerows has the potential to sequester 5,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.</p><p> To respond to Deputy Lowry's point on value, first, it helps to maintain that money in rural areas.  It is a long way short of the rural environment protection, REP, scheme what was in place in terms of the money accruing from it, but it helps to maintain rural areas.  It is probably difficult enough to quantify the value in it but it helps to maintain schools and businesses.  Agriculture has a turnover of &euro;26 billion per year but &euro;24 billion of that is retained within the economy and three quarters of all inputs into agriculture are sourced locally.  That highlights the importance of agriculture in rural areas to keep businesses and rural areas alive.  We can talk about willow and there is a place for it but we must remember that willow will not keep schools open in rural areas.  A willow branch will not play full back on the Ballyragget hurling team.  It will not keep teams alive.  There is a follow-on.</p><p> With the work farmers do through GLAS there is such a huge knock-on effect that is very often missed in terms of tourism in the most vulnerable rural areas.  The committee members did not need me to come into this room this evening to tell them that either.  That is the value to it.  When we talk about production, and I mentioned it in my presentation, what frustrates farmers is the fact that we are four times more efficient from a carbon point of view at beef production than the likes of Brazil.  In Brazil 80 kg of CO2 is produced to produce a kilo of beef.  Across Europe the average is 19 kg, yet the Commissioner for Trade, Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m, as recently as today said she is very anxious to do a trade deal with Brazil that will allow Brazil access to export a lot more beef into Europe.  On the one hand we have politicians in Europe telling us to do what we should do to improve the environment, which we want to do, yet they are willing to do a trade deal with countries  that are not nearly as efficient as us.  Projections indicate that the world population will grow by 2 billion to 9 billion over the next 25 years.  All those people will have to be fed.  If the food is not produced in Ireland or Europe, it will be produced in countries that are not nearly as carbon efficient as we are.  We are the most carbon efficient producers of dairy product in Europe and we are in the top five most carbon efficient producers of beef in Europe.</p></speech>

The discussion on the amount - how much - clouds the real need for action in terms of how to.  The data are the data and the figures are the figures.  The president referred in his presentation to the need for the reopening of GLAS.  Farmers are actors in the rural community.</p> <p>  There is a need for farm-scale, community and rooftop renewables, be they solar, micro or wind.  The energy White Paper published in 2015 by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment speaks to an energy citizen, but to be honest, as rural communities we have yet to see the policy measures put in place to empower rural communities to take on renewable energy production in a sustainable way to ensure we do not have a similar bad experience as happened in 2008 where the policy support measures were not in place.  There is a need for a tariff premium outside of the auction system proposed by the Department for farm-scale, community projects and for roof-mounted renewable projects such as solar.  In addition, there is a need to scale up programmes such as the carbon navigator and smart farming which are addressing the challenge.  They are speaking to the dual challenges of improving farm incomes while enhancing the environment.</p> <p>  Reference was also made to biomass.  I hope we are about to have a second start at a biomass programme.  The lack of development of a supply chain and of supply centres meant that we had a false start a number of years ago.  If we are serious about moving from focusing on "how to" rather than "how much" in terms of the figures, we must focus on biomass, farm-scale, community renewables and scaling up existing mitigation programmes such as carbon navigator and smart farming in addition to the reopening of GLAS.  That is where the discussion needs to go in terms of putting in place the necessary policy measures.</p></speech>

Farmers will not be found wanting in terms of willingness to engage and to renew some of the crops that we have, but as my colleague has just said, we have to be very careful.  We put our toe in the water eight or ten years ago and farmers got particularly badly burnt.  That cannot be repeated.</p> <p>  Deputy Stanley made a point about the renewal of the sugar industry.  We had a very successful sugar beet industry and it was talked down.  Our concern is that if farmers have to put their hands in their pockets to the tune of approximately &euro;220 million, they will be able to get a long-term return on it.  Sugar is not what it used to be given that it is often viewed now as the new tobacco.  We must be very careful what type of industry we get.  There would not be too many farmers with in excess of &euro;100,000 in capital to invest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.39" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John Sweeney" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#J00400"><p>I think there is a risk here that we are mixing up efficiency with emissions.  There is a great deal of emphasis on efficiency in agriculture, and while I welcome that and think it is a very important thing to progress, the atmosphere does not recognise efficiency in any way.  What matters is the absolute emissions.  Yes, we can tinker around with 50,000 tonnes a year here and there, but agricultural emissions are 19 million tonnes per year, so something more radical is required than some of the schemes we have been hearing about.  It is the disruption of the existing agricultural model that is required ultimately.  That is where I think we have to face facts here.  We are not going to solve this problem by tinkering with it.  We have 1 million extra cattle on the land in the past three years.  That is 1 million extra mouths to feed.  No wonder we have a fodder crisis.</p> <p>  To go back to Deputy Dooley's comments, no one is talking about culling the herd by half.  We are talking about a sustainable agricultural system where emissions are brought down.  At the moment, Teagasc is estimating that agricultural emissions will rise to at least 2025 and beyond.  That will put the burden on the taxpayer.  That will put the burden not just on the rural community but on the general taxpayer.  We should not mix up the agricultural community with the whole community because the Citizens' Assembly was representative of the whole community and its outcome was 89% in favour of there being a tax on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture.  There is no way that we should allow a sector to have a free pass.  We should reward those farmers who take the initiative and try to prepare themselves for the future in terms of land use change.  I am very supportive of farmers.  We have the best farmers in Europe but we cannot allow one sector simply to derail the whole national economy for the future in terms of this vital strategic interest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.40" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ois&iacute;n Coghlan" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22018013000002#J00500"><p>Deputy Dooley asked the Department whether we have reached a crisis point and asked us all what concrete things could be done to address the situation.  Deputy Stanley specifically asked Friends of the Earth about electric vehicles.</p><p>As to what we should do about the crisis, my advice is that Ireland, its politicians and media should start to treat climate change the way we treat Brexit, namely, as an external threat that is only beginning and will unfold over decades, one which poses risks to all parts of society, requires immediate and sustained action from all sectors of the economy and needs co-ordination across all Departments as well as political leadership from the Taoiseach and all parties in the D&aacute;il.  We have seen such a response to Brexit but we have not seen a similar systematic response on climate.  </p><p> As to what we do in terms of concrete recommendations, Friends of the Earth and Stop Planet Chaos have many recommendations, of which I will mention one or two.  As I noted at the end of my opening statement, a significant deliberative process was undertaken by 99 citizens at the Citizens' Assembly under the chair of Ms Justice Laffoy.  It was fascinating to listen to the discussions over four days.  When citizens were given time, space and information and had experts only speaking to them, rather than organisations such as Friends of the Earth or the Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, they produced a highly progressive and radical set of recommendations across all sectors that challenge all of us.  The first step we should take is give these recommendations due consideration.  The recommendations have been published and the report of the Citizens' Assembly will be formally presented to the Oireachtas shortly.  Members will then have to decide how to respond to the report.  There is plenty to work with in it and it will offer a good departure point for a revision of the national mitigation plan.</p><p> To address some of the issues raised, the IFA has stolen most of my lines on community energy and solar.  Friends of the Earth and the IFA are very much at one that while the Government's proposal on an official renewable electricity scheme is relatively good in terms of providing some supports for community ownership and community led developments and placing an obligation on developers to share equity in developer led projects, it is bad on solar power.  The reason this is important is that solar is the area in which many people could become involved.  This could become a societal project rather than one involving only highly organised commercial or community organisations.  For example, I would like every green school to become a solar school.  Currently, they cannot sell electricity back to the grid.  This is not just about the megawatts involved, which would be limited in number, but hearts and minds and a sense of ownership of this project.  Although the official renewable energy scheme, RES, did not feature solar power at micro or rooftop level, officials and the Minister have since stated they are committed to introducing a scheme for rooftop solar at the same pace as they introduced the official larger scheme for renewable electricity.  I hope this scheme will be delivered this year in order that we can all begin to take part in it.</p><p> On the issue of transport, electric vehicles and recharging infrastructure are important.  The market is moving at a faster pace than politicians and bureaucracy are ready for.  In other countries, take-up of electric vehicles is speeding up and people are looking for this option.  The issue must be resolved.  However, Friends of the Earth's view, which is shared by Professor Fitzgerald, is that electric vehicles are only one part of the solution.  The Citizens' Assembly, for example, recommended that we reverse the proportion of investment allocated to roads and public transport, respectively.  This would mean spending two thirds of transport investment in public transport and one third in roads.  Real gains can also be made in cycling and walking, two areas which also deliver co-benefits in terms of health and human connectivity. </p><p> We must clarify an issue on peat.  If I understand the views expressed by Professor Fitzgerald and the Citizens' Assembly correctly, we should not only end subsidies for peat but also stop burning peat within perhaps five years.  It is not acceptable, therefore, for the Department to state that once peat subsidies have been removed, the decision as to whether to burn peat will be a commercial one.  The ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na, two semi-State companies, are agreeing to continue to burn peat until 2030, which is just not good enough.  Moreover, it is not good enough to cross-subsidise peat burning through subsidies for the co-firing of biomass.  Until recently, the biomass used here was palm kernels from palm oils, the production of which is devastating habitats and livelihoods in the global south.</p><p> We must start the firing gun on withdrawing from peat burning.  In this regard, I will make a quick analogy.  When a US multinational company pulls out of Ireland, the Minister brings the relevant agencies, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, together overnight, appoints a task force and promises to use the factory to be vacated and seek as many supports as possible to assist the affected workers and communities to come out the other side.  It is easier, if not easy, when someone else starts the firing gun and the decision is taken by faceless people in a boardroom in Silicon Valley.  In this case, however, we must start the firing gun and eliminate peat production in five years.  This will mean establishing a transition task force and using current expenditure on peat from the public service obligation levy to help communities to determine what their community will be like in ten years, help workers retrain and so on.  We cannot allow the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na to decide they will not stop burning peat until 2030 because at that stage, we will have bust all the carbon budgets for agriculture and everything else and given them all to the peat sector.  That makes no sense for anybody.</p></speech>

I will make a number of points on agriculture and land use.  Professor Fitzgerald stated the agriculture sector needed to define carbon neutrality.  This is acknowledged in the national mitigation plan in which we set this out as a priority action.  Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency put a research call out to tender but no applications were received.  We hope the research call will be relaunched this year in order that we can try to address how we define carbon neutrality.</p> <p>  We pitched the discussion on the approach to carbon neutrality in the national mitigation plan on the basis of a three-legged stool.  The three areas are: abatement of non-CO2 emissions, namely, methane and nitrous oxide; trying to increase sequestration in terms of forests and soils; and trying to contribute to the energy discussion in terms of contributing to renewable energy supply and improving energy efficiency at farm level.  We fully acknowledge the role agriculture has to play in contributing to the national targets.  We acknowledge it is a significant component of the national emissions profile and we have put significant funding around abatement options in the rural development programme, which the IFA mentioned.  We are doing considerable work on this issue. </p> <p>  We also have a significant research programme examining the research needs of agriculture and what are the options around methane and nitrous oxide.  The most recent projects, AGRI-I and SUDEN, which were completed last year, contributed to an updating of the national inventory of nitrous oxide emission factors from the soil.  AGRI-I also identified a very successful new fertiliser formulation with stabilised urea that reduces ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions.  We will see how well the new fertiliser is adopted by farmers.  We also have significant animal breeding programmes which seek to ensure the emissions intensity of livestock is reduced.</p> <p>  On livestock numbers, I do not know from where Professor Sweeney obtained the growth figure of 1 million head.  The figures I have for the dairy sector are for a 22% growth in dairy cow numbers, which would suggest an increase in numbers of approximately 200,000 rather than 1 million.</p></speech>

Last year's state of the environment report by the EPA indicated that livestock numbers had declined by 1 million while the human population had increased by 1 million.  We have to take this in the context of where we can contribute to these targets.</p> <p>  On alternative land uses, the Department funded a biomass support scheme.  This must be considered in terms of the demand side for renewable energies.  We cannot have one side without the other in terms of working together and collaborating.  The Department is trying to work with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment on how we look at renewable energy technologies.</p> <p>  The most significant abatement option is our afforestation policy.  Since 1990, we have afforested in excess of 300,000 ha., contributing significantly to increasing the carbon pool available to Ireland.</p></speech>

I am interested in the electric car initiatives such as the one in Cork a few years ago called Drive4Zero, which promoted electric car use particularly in the city centre.  Is the roll-out of electric cars moving ahead of the infrastructure?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses think there is a rural-urban divide in respect of climate action?  This has been a unique debate.  We have spoken about a carbon tax.  Who will be most affected by that, young or old people?  What would its effect be on them?  We have spoken of moving from beef to wood.  How would the rural economy survive by forestry?  Would rural Ireland become a walking way or playground instead of active farmland?  Will our society become more urban off the back of such policies?</p> <p>  We have heard people say that the ratio of investment should be two thirds in public transport and one third in roads.  The biggest issue in rural Ireland is the lack of roads.  Will that be our new approach?  Climate action is a unique challenge but how do we bring the people, rural and urban, with us?  That is the biggest issue I have seen in this debate.  There have been many proposals but there is great fear in the farming community that the targets in Food Wise 2025 will impinge on the environment and they will be pulled back.  There has been a real change in dairy numbers, more so than in beef numbers because it has been profitable and rural communities have survived on it.  When this debate is over will the rural-urban divide be wider?  Will the changes affect rural people more than urban?</p></speech>

I can see how many hedgerows have gone from the fields around my home.  It is the same in every part of the country.  I asked one person why they were taking it out and they told me they were cleaning it up.  I said it did not look dirty.  A hedgerow is not dirty.  I never figured out what the person was talking about.  The concern is that while that scheme exists, hedgerows are being bulldozed at the moment.  I am not sure why because it is not good from a farmer's point of view because not alone are they removing the sequestering value, as a carbon sink, but also a barrier for shelter and drainage because a good strong ditch soaks up the water.  Why are farmers persisting in cutting them down to the scut?  We are not as bad in this part of the world as up the road in the Bible belt.</p> <p>  I welcome the progress made with GLAS and that the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, has rowed in behind it.  I can see its value but damage is being done while we improve things.  Cuttings from hedgerows around the country are lying in drains.  Can we not between us figure out some way of gathering that up and, instead of setting fire to it in the corner of a field when it is dry, use it for some type of biomass to fire something or other?  Does the IFA have any views on that? </p></speech>

Planning permission or some sort of permission is necessary to remove them and they have to be replaced.  The target is 1.4 million m to be planted over the next few years.</p> <p>  We are opposed to another carbon tax because history shows that the carbon tax introduced in 2011 made no impact and carbon emissions increased.  In those arguments, it is very important that we do not pluck figures out of the air.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures show that the cattle numbers in the past three years went from 6.9 million in 2015 to 7.2 million in 2016 and 7.3 million in 2017.  That increase is a long way short of 1 million head.</p></speech>

People's ability to access food is complex, and it is mainly an economic and poverty issue rather than the presence of food in the world.  This is particularly the case in the developing world where the population is set to grow the most and the areas where food insecurity is a chronic issue and affected significantly by climate change.</p> <p>  The food and agricultural organisation of the United Nations produces reports on a regular basis on the issue of climate change and food security.  The recommendations are there for all to see, on the need to transform production practices, consumption and to tackle access.</p></speech>

Carbon taxes did make a difference and the research shows that.  They would have made even more difference if they had been higher.  That is our recommendation.</p> <p>  In respect of who is affected, the divide is not rural-urban.  Research done as long ago as 1992 by Sue Scott in the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and more recent research by the ESRI shows that people on low incomes are most affected.  The Government needs the revenue to compensate.  It needs approximately 30% of the revenue from the carbon tax to compensate those on low incomes who would be worse off because they spend a higher share of their incomes on electricity.  Commuters would also be affected. </p> <p>  The point of electric vehicles is that the owners will not pay carbon tax.  The Government gets &euro;5 billion in revenue from motor vehicles.  The Department of Finance is considering this and may have to move to charging for road use in which case people in rural areas driving electric cars could end up spending much less than they do at present whereas people in congested urban areas could end up paying much more because they are causing congestion.  This is not a rural-urban issue.  It is people on a low income and the rest of the population.  </p> <p>  On electric cars and infrastructure, the point to consider is not just whether there are two charging points in Glenties village, rather it is that people will charge their cars at home.  The problem is if three neighbours think it is a great idea to have an electric car, they will blow the local system if they all try to charge together.  These are complex issues.  It is coming down the track quite rapidly, as Mr. Coghlan said.  That is part of its success.  </p> <p>  To respond to Senator Lombard's point that forestry would result in fewer jobs in rural areas, research done 20 years ago by Brendan Kearney and Bob O'Connor showed that more people would be employed in rural areas if there was forestry rather than beef.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. John O&rsquo;Beirne, head of products and Mr. Stephen Mason, head of customer operations.  I took up the role of chief executive of the Bank of Ireland Group on 2 October 2017.  Before this, I spent over 20 years in a variety of senior banking roles in the UK and internationally. <br/><br/>Bank of Ireland is the largest lender to the Irish economy and has the largest community footprint of any bank in Ireland.  I believe the bank does many things well, however, the issue we are here to discuss today does not fall into that category.  I believe Bank of Ireland took too long to get to the right position on the tracker mortgage issue and did not go far enough in putting our customers first.  This has undoubtedly caused many of our customers financial pain and personal distress.  Therefore, before continuing with my comments this evening, I restate my unreserved apology to all customers affected by this issue for the financial loss and anxiety this has caused them and their families.  Since joining Bank of Ireland, I have reviewed the bank&rsquo;s approach to the tracker issue.  I have concluded that the bank placed a clear emphasis on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements but did not go far enough to fully ensure we were delivering the right outcomes for our customers.  I will return to this later, but at this point wish to restate my personal commitment to dealing with this issue as quickly and comprehensively as possible. <br/><br/>When I took up the position of CEO at Bank of Ireland just under four months ago I set about immersing myself in all aspects of the business.  Very quickly, the tracker mortgage issue became my key focus.  From my first week as CEO, the issue featured prominently in my interactions with the board and with our regulators.  This included communication between Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank regarding the potential inclusion of additional customers into our redress and compensation scheme.  It became abundantly clear that understanding and resolving the tracker issue was a matter I needed to put at the top of my priority list.  In agreement with the board, which wished to comprehensively resolve the issue, I made this matter my top priority so that I could understand it as best I could.  Armed with this understanding, when the Bank of Ireland chairman and I met the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in late October, we agreed to fix this issue as quickly as possible, and I gave the Minister a strong personal commitment that we would do the right thing for our customers. <br/><br/>I will focus on four key points in my presentation this evening.  First, our progress in addressing this issue since last November; second, our understanding that we cannot ever fully reverse the negative impact the tracker issue has had on our customers; third, the announcement we made in November to include additional customers and why; and, finally, our determination to rebuild trust in Bank of Ireland. <br/><br/>On the first point, we have made significant progress in addressing this issue as a top priority.  In total, as a result of this examination Bank of Ireland has identified approximately 9,400 customers affected by this issue.  These customers fall into two groups, namely those who were denied a tracker rate, and those who were on a tracker but on an incorrect rate.  Of the total 9,400, approximately 6,000 customers were denied a tracker rate and approximately 3,400 customers were on a tracker but on an incorrect rate.  All of these customers with open, live mortgage accounts have now been returned to their correct tracker rate.  All of these customers are also entitled to redress and compensation.  As of today, we have contacted almost nine out of ten of them with an offer.  Up to the end of December 2017, more than one third of these customers, almost 3,300, had received redress and compensation with more than &euro;38 million having been paid to these customers by the end of last year.  Since then we have continued to make strong progress.  As of 24 January, the number of customers receiving redress and compensation has increased to more than 5,000, and more than &euro;68 million has been paid.  The total amount of redress and compensation offered to affected customers is &euro;108 million to date. <br/><br/>I trust these points underscore how seriously the bank views this issue, and the steps we are taking to make things right for our customers.  However, behind these numbers are people whose lives have been affected by the way the tracker issue was handled.  This leads me to my second point.  While we are now resolving the financial aspects of the tracker issue with compensation and redress, we know we can never fully reverse the negative effect the tracker issue has had on our customers.  A mortgage is more than a financial transaction or product.  It represents a home, the place where we build our lives, the place where we raise our families and where we sleep at night. <br/><br/>In my efforts to ensure we comprehensively addressed this issue, I went through a number of individual, difficult, cases in some detail.  I wanted to do this to fully understand the effect of the tracker issue on our customers.  One case involved a customer who had been in extreme financial distress, another was a customer who was at risk of losing their home and I also looked at the detail of a customer who was dealing with a life-threatening illness.  Whilst dealing with these challenging personal issues, each of these customers was also affected by the tracker issue.  I am very sorry the bank has added to their difficulties at what was already a very challenging time for them personally. <br/><br/>We are working hard to manage a small number of complex cases where the impact on customers has been extreme.  This includes cases where customers have lost their home as a direct result of the tracker issue.  Extended and appropriate support, tailored to their circumstances, is available to each of these customers.  Since starting our redress and compensation process, we are also keeping in close contact with our customers, listening to their feedback and the feedback of other stakeholders, and improving our approach where appropriate.  For example, in December we reviewed, and increased, the amount we are offering to all customers for independent legal or financial advice.  This is in recognition of the fact that some customers will have more complex legal and financial requirements at this time.  Our appeals panel is also now fully in place.  This independent panel will hear the concerns of any customers who do not feel they have been treated fairly in our offer of redress or compensation. <br/><br/><b></b>I now turn to my third point, our decision last November to increase the number of customers who should receive compensation and redress, and to outline the context for that decision.  From my first week as CEO, the tracker issue featured prominently in my interactions with the board and with our regulators.  At that time, the Central Bank challenged Bank of Ireland on whether all customers negatively affected by the tracker issue had been identified correctly, in particular a group of approximately 6,000 customers.  With the aim of achieving a comprehensive resolution, Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s board gave me a strong mandate to take a fresh look at the tracker issue. <br/><br/>The terms of the tracker examination, as set out by the Central Bank, required banks to conduct a complete review of their mortgage loan books.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s framework required banks to determine whether contractual rights and consumer protection obligations were complied with.  The examination also required banks to show that in assessing regulatory requirements, they had protected customers&rsquo; interests, treated them fairly, and had considered customers&rsquo; reasonable expectations regarding their tracker mortgage in the context of the information provided by the bank.  I undertook a thorough review of the tracker issue on my arrival.  Work was already in progress but I wanted to ensure we were getting to the right outcome.  This included listening to and reviewing the experience of affected customers to understand, at first-hand, the impact the tracker issue had on individuals and their homes.  I concluded that a clear emphasis had been placed on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements.  However, while the bank had considered the voice of the customer when reviewing cases, my view was that we had not always gone far enough to fully ensure we were delivering the right outcomes for our customers.  Therefore, in November 2017, I recommended to the board that we go further and include the additional 6,000 customers in our compensation and redress scheme<i>.</i></p><p>The board strongly supported my recommendation.  There has been a concerted effort at all levels of Bank of Ireland to address this for the benefit of our customers and in a decisive, efficient and effective way for all of our stakeholders.  My primary focus right now is on resolving this issue.  However, in addition to putting things right when things go wrong, we must also learn from this experience.  Banking, at its very core, is based on trust.  Trust has been damaged, both in Bank of Ireland and in the industry as a whole.  Right now, we will be judged on our actions and not on what we say, but on what we do.  We have taken immediate steps to prioritise the return of tracker rates and the payment of compensation and redress for all customers affected by this issue.  This will remain a top priority until it is fixed for every customer.</p><p> Looking ahead, Ireland needs a stable and trusted banking sector, one which demonstrably acts responsibly and fairly towards customers.  I have been reflecting on what we must do to restore that trust.  My view is that the way in which we address the tracker issue will define the customer-focused culture we aspire to at Bank of Ireland.  At the end of 2017, we defined Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s purpose as one of enabling customers, colleagues and communities to thrive.  To help the bank achieve this purpose, we have defined key values that will act as a behavioural guide for all of our people.  These values aim to embed behaviour that is customer-focused, accountable, agile and which fosters teamwork.  Changing our culture in these ways will lead to the right outcomes for our customers and will enhance our reputation as a fair and customer-focused bank.  It will also, as a direct result, support sustainable growth for our shareholders.  As well as defining our own culture, Bank of Ireland is fully committed to the establishment of an Irish banking standards board to drive positive change and rebuild trust across the wider banking industry in Ireland.  </p><p> In conclusion, I will restate the importance that the Bank of Ireland board, my senior management team and I have placed on addressing the tracker issue and resolving it fully for every affected customer.  As CEO, my role is to lead Bank of Ireland during the next stage of its development.  I recognise we can grow our business only if we have the trust of our customers, the respect of our stakeholders, and the pride of our colleagues in their organisation.  Making things right when things go wrong is very important and learning from this issue is absolutely critical.  It is my firm commitment that lessons will be learned by Bank of Ireland, ensuring we become a more customer-focused bank, rebuilding trust with our customers and the wider society we serve.</p></speech>

I had a brief conversation with her outside.  I welcome her appointment to her position in the bank.  I want to go over some ground with her.

The offers so far in terms of returning their money and the compensation above which amounts to &euro;108 million.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Taking a flat-line run rate to get to a projected cost may not be representative of what we expect to happen over the coming weeks between now and 31 March.

Appendix 2 refers to someone who was currently or previously in legal proceedings as a result of going into arrears, including the issuance of a demand letter.  That could have been the person Ms McDonagh was talking about who was going through a life threatening illness.  Such a person would get &euro;2,000 as a result of that action.  If the courts determine that the award for that should be &euro;20,000, will the bank revisit the entire schedule of compensation being awarded to the victims of the bank?</p></speech>

We have an established compensation and redress framework and we are operating within it.  For cases where there are more extreme circumstances such as distress, vulnerability or ultimately the loss of ownership, which is a very extreme outcome of the tracker issue, where there is a clear causality between the tracker issue and the loss of a home, we are looking at those case-by-case, whether through the appeals panel or, ideally, our own assessment.  When we look at individual cases and come to a conclusion that reflects the individual circumstances of the case so customers do not have to go to the appeals panel and do not feel the need to take their cases to court, although it is perfectly within their legal right to do so, we look at them case-by-case.  At the moment, we believe the compensation and redress framework is an appropriate one but we look at case-by-case individual scenarios as-----</p></speech>

It answered that the offer of redress and compensation is the offer and customers should go to the independent appeals panel so unless a customer informed the bank that he or she contemplated taking his or her own life, the bank would not be aware of it.  If such a person was performing and not in arrears, the bank would have given him or her &euro;650.  If the person had to go into a restructuring arrangement, it would be &euro;1,000.  It is a very simple.  The bank has disrupted these individuals' lives, in some cases in a dramatic way, and the bank has stripped emotion from all of it.  It has done what bankers do.  It has put a price on the pain and suffering people have gone through.  It is a one-size-fits-all approach and it is left up to the customers.  We know it is human nature that often people who have been ground down will not appeal and not everybody will go to the courts.</p></speech>

I can only express my personal commitment to addressing it.  It is not just about the numbers.  I have looked at the cases.  I have listened to cases where we have called customers and told them they have been included in the amounts and I have heard their reactions.</p><p>I have listened to cases where customers have called us with an inquiry and I have spoken to the person regarding one of the more complex cases and looked at the individual's case.  I am not stripping and there is no intention on the part of the bank to strip the emotion and human impact of this from our approach.  We have a readjusted compensation framework in place for clarity and our intention is to be fair, clear, transparent and quick in our resolution for the benefit of customers.  We want to close out these issues for all the individuals involved.  There is a framework to cover cases where there are particular circumstances involving distress, vulnerability or loss of ownership.  We will look at those on a case-by-case basis.  I would be very pleased if no customer felt the need to go to an appeals panel because he or she agreed he or she had been treated fairly, but we absolutely have an independent appeals panel for customers who feel they have not been treated fairly.  We give them all the information they need.</p></speech>

Has Ms McDonagh asked how it felt to the customer, their family and loved ones so that she as chief executive officer of the bank can make an informed decision as to the level of compensation to be awarded instead of giving blanket compensation with advice to consult a financial adviser or legal professional, which in some cases people are not familiar with doing, and then having to do a formal appeal?  If she has not written to anyone, why has she not taken that approach of being people-centred?  I am sure the PR guys in the bank advised the need for customer focus after this massive scandal.  I am sure they talked about fluffy language around a change of culture but when it comes down to the detail of it, why did the bank not write to these individuals and ask how the bank had hurt and wronged them so that it could make an informed decision on the pain and suffering it caused and note to customers that they can go on and appeal if they are not happy with the result?</p></speech>

I started in the role on 2 October 2017.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, it was evident that this was a major issue.  That is from my interaction with the board, the Minister for Finance and the Central Bank and from reading the newspapers and hearing the feedback as to the impact it was having on people.  It was very apparent that I needed to understand the detail of this within the first fortnight of arriving.  I looked at the requirements of the Central Bank's examination which required banks to look at the legal obligations and regulations around customer protection as well as at what reasonable outcome a typical customer could expect.  I looked at the legal aspect and the detail of the numbers, but I also looked at the reasonable expectations of customers.  I put myself in their shoes with my team and we looked at specific cases.  While I cannot, obviously, disclose names in a public forum, we looked at names, the circumstances and what was going on in people's lives where we had the available information and we looked at the offers we were making and the correspondence they had received.  We went through that customer journey.</p> <p>  I have spoken to customers and I have listened to their descriptions of the impact it has had on them.  There has been a concerted effort since we included the additional 6,000 to give the benefit of the doubt to customers to do our best to get this to a resolution to their satisfaction.  The redress and compensation framework is for clarity and for many customers it will be in line with their expectations.  For those who feel it is not fair, we have an appeals panel in place.  That has started recently and customers are entitled - we encourage and give them information - to pursue an appeal where they feel they have not been treated fairly.</p></speech>

I am not talking about the people who wrote to the bank begging it to give them back their money and explaining the circumstances.  What proactive approach did Ms McDonagh take personally?</p></speech>

We have called them to explain they were getting a letter and verbally explained the details of redress and compensation.  They can call us if they have inquiries and, if they do not feel they have been treated fairly, an appeals panel is in place.  In particular for the most complex cases, we have agreed a level of empowerment and ownership in the team to be accountable for resolving this.  We are not trying to prolong this or do it in a way that saves some money.  We are committed to resolving this fairly for every last customer who is impacted and have put a provision in place in that regard.</p></speech>

When I refer to her as CEO, I am talking about the entire bank, in particular those at senior level.  However, she said in her opening statement that the bank placed a clear emphasis on the legal interpretation of its mortgage agreements but did not go far enough to ensure fully that it was delivering the right outcomes for customers.  Is Ms McDonagh of the view that what the bank did to those customers was legal in all cases?</p></speech>

When we looked at the correspondence with customers, there was insufficient clarity in our communication and terms and conditions that would have given them the absolute clarity they needed to understand if they were going to get a tracker or not.  We had accepted that there were approximately 600 cases where it was very black and white and there was no dispute.  Legally, those customers had not been given the access to a tracker to which they were entitled.  There were other cases where there was a more of a discussion.  Those were the approximately 6,000 customers in respect of whom there was some discussion with the Central Bank over whether legally or from a customer-centric perspective those customers should receive redress and compensation.</p> <p>  When I arrived, the board was very keen to come to a conclusion and wanted us to resolve this and to do the right thing by the customers.  They asked me to take a fresh perspective and gave me a very clear mandate not only to look at the legal aspects, but also to ensure we had done the right thing for our customers.  My conclusion was that we had included the voice of the customer in some of the analysis that had been done, but we had not gone far enough.  That is why I recommended the additional 6,000 and the board was very supportive of that.</p></speech>

Obviously, the bank was on the wrong side of the law in those cases.  She said it was black and white.  Why did this happen and why was it resisted until 2016?  If it was so black and white that the bank was in breach of the law and was denying the customers their rights, has Ms McDonagh come to a conclusion or been told formally or informally how this happened within the bank?  Not only were 9,400 customers impacted in the latest tranche, but we see that in 2010 there were an additional 5,100 customers, which takes the total to 14,500.  Who was responsible for this?  Was a decision taken?  We asked Ms McDonagh a specific question as to whether targets were set within the bank to reduce the number of tracker mortgages and if bonuses were awarded for reaching them.  She says there is a review ongoing and all the rest but I want to hear if anyone at this table is aware of any targets or remuneration packages for reaching them.</p></speech>

How did this happen?  Who is responsible?  Was anyone targeted to do anything that was not in the best interests of customers?  To answer the first question, it is important to look at the context in 2008.  It was October 2008 when the tracker mortgage product was discontinued for new customers.  There is a deep root-cause review ongoing which will look objectively at the root causes and learnings from this.</p><p>It is important that we learn from it.  However, when I look at 2008, and I was not working in Ireland at that stage, I am cognisant that the product at the time was not profitable.  It was lossmaking and not a sustainable product in 2008.  The stability of the whole banking sector in Ireland was at risk.  There was a prudential survival requirement to discontinue products that were unsustainable and losing money every day.  </p><p> The bank took a decision in October 2008 to discontinue tracker mortgages for new customers.  Looking at it from my perspective, coming in, it was the right decision to stop a product that was not profitable.  Consideration was given at the time to customers who were on a fixed rate mortgage but had the legal right to a tracker.  From 2008 onwards, there were 20,000 customers who had previously been on a fixed rate and had a contractual right to a tracker.  We discontinued trackers, but appropriately, seamlessly and correctly they still rolled over into a tracker mortgage.</p><p> We discontinued the product for new customers.  However, 20,000 customers appropriately exercised their contractual right to roll into a tracker in the future.  That is an indication those customers had been considered.  When I looked at documentation I see that was understood.  However, that application was not consistent.  There are 3,400 in respect of which at some stage, when they were on tracker, the rate was slightly off by 0.15%.  We have put 100% of those customers, of those who are alive today, back on the correct rate and compensated and redressed them for those differentials.  We can talk about the average, but the differential is not very large relative to some of the other numbers in the industry.  </p><p> However, 6,000 customers did not get their contractual entitlement to a tracker.  I see no indication of intent or desire to do that.  Whether it was lack of clarity in some of our terminology or not taking a sufficiently customer-focused approach, those 6,000 customers did not get the tracker they were entitled to.  That has been identified and accepted.  Our focus and energy is on giving them their money back via compensation and redress by 31 March or as soon as they respond to us.</p></speech>

We have heard similar stuff from AIB.  It is beyond belief.  The issue here relates to Bank of Ireland's staff.  The witness gave us the number of impacted persons who have been restored in tracker mortgages.  There are currently large numbers of Bank of Ireland staff still being denied the tracker mortgage and the bank is still in breach of the law in relation to them.  I will give one example of many concerning individuals on a two-year fixed rate of 3.59%.  This was around 2009.</p><p>The bank promised them they would roll over onto a staff tracker mortgage of ECB plus 0.75%.  I will read out some internal documentation that may be of interest to Ms McDonagh.  It was circulated to all the members of staff.  It says:</p><blockquote>Existing staff mortgage accounts will appoint staff to a two-year fixed rate, currently 3.59%.  Staff who are currently on staff two-year fixed rates, currently 3.59%, will roll to ECB plus 0.75% with no benefit in kind, BIK, implications, as per their original signed mortgage agreement, at the end of the two-year fixed period.  Staff will receive notification 30 days prior to the end of their fixed-rate term.  This notification will offer a range of fixed and variable rate products.  If you do not respond to this notification your account will automatically default to the staff tracker ECB plus 0.75%. </blockquote> <p>Ms McDonagh spoke in her opening statement about the examination. She said the reasonable expectations of customers regarding their tracker mortgage had to be considered in the context of information provided by the bank.  Those are her words.  Given this internal document and given individuals who were on the two-year fixed rate are not deemed impacted after being looked at by the witness's bank, does Ms McDonagh believe she is in breach of that comment?  Beyond doubt those people had a reasonable expectation they would be rolling on to the tracker mortgages.  The same document states: &quot;if you do not respond to this notification your account will automatically default to the staff tracker ECB plus 0.75%&quot;.</p></speech>

Within the additional 6,000 customers we agreed to compensate and redress last November is a group of current and former staff members.  We have treated our staff as we would treat any customer.  We are not giving special treatment because they are staff.  Our staff are incredibly important to us but in the context of this tracker examination we have treated them as we would any customer.</p> <p>  When we looked at the group of staff, there was a potential issue around the clarity of the information provided at the time.  We have agreed to include 1,850 current or former staff within the compensation and redress.  </p></speech>

When we went through the documentation we saw that memo referenced by Deputy Doherty.  It was issued in October 2008.  It did refer to the original contract.  However, it also had the original language read out by the Deputy, which stated that it would roll back to a tracker.  That was one of the groups we were in discussions with through the last period of time in the examination.  The majority of those customers who went to a two-year fixed rate did roll back and have been put back on a tracker mortgage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018013000002#F00700"><p>The only people the bank put back on the tracker rate in relation to the two-year fixed rate are those who had a tracker mortgage prior to fixing.  These are a cohort of individuals who were on a two-year fixed rate and who may have had a variable mortgage beforehand.  However, this communication said very clearly, in respect of existing staff mortgage accounts, staff who are currently on the two-year fixed will roll automatically onto the tracker.  Bank of Ireland has made a decision at a corporate level that they are excluded.  There is a reasonable expectation, if not a legal expectation, that they should be deemed appropriate.  I know what is going on here.  I know that Bank of Ireland did put some people on, but it was those who were on tracker first and then fixed.  Then it was decided that they should be offered the tracker.  However, I refer to those who were on a variable first and then on a two-year fixed.  This communication told them they were automatically going to roll in to a tracker.</p> <p>  These people should be included.  They are Bank of Ireland's own staff.  They are the people who have to face people like me who are giving out because Bank of Ireland is closing branches and reducing staff.  These are Bank of Ireland's own front-line workers.  Will the bank re-examine this issue?  It is not fair what is being done.  If the witnesses were genuine about changing the culture of Bank of Ireland, being people-centric and trying to right the wrongs, and all of the language that we have heard here, then they need to put their money where their mouth is.  This is wrong. </p> <p>  This speaks to me about a bank that has been dragged kicking and screaming into compensating and redressing 6,000 customers.  The Central Bank forced Bank of Ireland to do that.  No harm to Ms McDonagh, perhaps she would have done it.  However, the Central Bank had Bank of Ireland's arm twisted up behind its back.  They did the same with AIB.  They were forced into that because of the work of this committee and the victims and the public outcry.  There is no doubt that half of these people would not be back on the tracker mortgages if it was not for the shame that the Irish people have put bankers through.  That includes what Bank of Ireland has done, and is still doing.  That is the problem.  Can the witnesses confirm that staff who did not have a tracker rate but went on to the two-year fixed rate, that Bank of Ireland said would automatically roll on to a tracker, are not deemed impacted today?</p></speech>

We have been robust in our inclusion of any customer where we think we did not do the right thing, whether from a contractual, consumer or a reasonable outcome perspective.  We believe and are committed to addressing this for all customers, including that group of staff.  I have not seen any of the particular cases the Deputy is referring to and I am happy to look at any individual case after this committee.  Any customer who believes he or she is entitled to compensation and redress, who has not received it, should contact us.  We can provide those details.  Our commitment is to address and resolve this until the last customer feels they have been treated fairly.  We believe we have identified all customers who are within the examination and redress and compensation.  We have contacted nine out of ten of them.  We have 1,100 customers we are committed to contacting by the end of March.</p><p>That is our commitment.  We will not finish this work until the last customer is contacted.

I wish her well in her role.  I am sure that she did not want this issue to welcome her to the organisation.</p> <p>  I will wrap up the line of questioning pursued by Deputy Pearse Doherty.  Is the Ms McDonagh saying that there is no cohort of staff customers who were never on a tracker but who had an entitlement, at least according to bank documentation that was provided to them, to move on to a tracker following their period on a fixed rate?  Is she saying that there is no such group?  </p></speech>

If the staff member never had a tracker and he or she moved into the staff product and then on to the two-year fixed, then he or she will not roll back on to a tracker.  At the beginning of the memo dated October 2008, referred to by the previous Deputy, it is stated that one would roll back to original contractual rate.  There is language that caused confusion later in the memo.  The bank issued a subsequent memo later that month and then wrote to all staff clarifying that position.  We recognise, through the course of the examination, particularly for those staff who started on a tracker, that the level of communication was unclear.  As Ms McDonagh has outlined, that is why we have included them in the documentation to try to manage that.</p></speech>

Clearly, the memo states at point No. 2 that staff who are currently on staff two-year fixed rate, currently 3.95%, "will roll to ECB plus 0.75%".  Mr. O'Beirne said there was another member that clarified and cleared up the matter, and the people concerned were written to.</p></speech>

Our commitment has been to observe the legal and consumer protection requirements, but also to consider reasonable expectations.

It would be helpful if the CEO included her reasons for concluding that the cohort are not included or impacted.</p> <p>  I wish to reconcile the numbers given by the CEO.  Earlier today she said that overall 9,400 customers have been impacted.  In her statement last November she said, "Approximately 4,300 customers will shortly be written to by the Bank with an offer of compensation", and further on she mentioned an additional 6,000 accounts.  I understand the ballpark figure was 4,300 customers before the 6,000 customers were added.  The CEO's colleague, Mr. Liam McLoughlin, told us last September that 602 customers, at that stage, were entitled to a tracker mortgage who were not on one.  They are the clearcut cases that Mr. McLoughlin mentioned.  He also said that between 3,000 and 3,500 customers were affected by the margin issue of 0.15%.  Can the CEO clarify why the bank has calculated the overall figure as 9,400 after adding an additional 6,000 customers?</p></speech>

Mr. Liam McLoughlin represented the bank before this committee in September.  He was very accurate in his representation of the situation at the time.  He articulated the position that, at the time, the bank had approximately 4,200 affected customers which included the loss of tracker - the people who had not been given the entitlement to a tracker - which comprised 602 cases, and those who had been impacted by the margin error, some 3,654 cases.  He was explicit and correct in stating that the examination at that time was incomplete, there was an ongoing review, that matters still had to be addressed and that the number of accounts affected may change, which they have.  We have given updates to this committee and to the public in terms of clarifying the numbers.  There have been small changes in some of these numbers, where we had duplicated or identified perhaps two customers with the same mortgage, to get to the final total of 9,400 customers identified in the examination.  We can reconcile some of the smaller numbers.  There is no new cohort or new reveal that we did not already articulate last November and December, nor has the number reduced significantly.  We have removed duplication and clarified some of the numbers.  The total number is 9,400 based on the examination to date.</p></speech>

Maybe it is distinction between customers and accounts because one customer could have a number of accounts.  As the CEO said in the statement she issued on 9 November: "Approximately 4,300 customers will shortly be written to by the Bank with an offer of compensation.  Please note that those are separate from the 6,000 additional customers."  Further on in her statement she confirmed: "the Group has therefore agreed to include an additional c. 6,000 accounts within the scope of the compensation scheme."  Can the CEO clarify how the bank reached the final figure 9,400 customers?</p></speech>

We were trying to make sure that we captured each one of the accounts and to be as conservative as possible.  As Ms McDonagh highlighted, when we worked through the redress and compensation we found that in a number of instances there were fewer accounts for a number of specific reasons.  First, a number of the operational or margin errors had effectively been resolved close to the time that they had occurred.</p><p>While the original error may have occurred at the point of drawdown, the error itself had been rectified within the next 30 days.  It would work through the redress and compensation scheme and it would already have been remediated.  There was no redress or compensation, which is the figure of 9,400 to which we referred earlier.</p><p> The second area to bring it down slightly further was where we had some accounts which effectively were struck by two issues, our staff accounts and the customers who had switched from a tracker rate.  When we worked through the issue, we took the most conservative worst outcome for that group and brought that through.</p></speech>

It is because when we look at the situation we do not see accounts, rather we see the individuals who have been impacted.  That is why much of our language around this, and this is not a PR perspective, is how we look at these cases; we look at our customers and not account numbers.  That is behind the use of that language.</p></speech>

During the period 2016 to 2017, there was a discussion around the figure of 6,000 customers.  There were three main groupings, including the first we have already touched on, those who were current or former staff where the communication was not considered to have been sufficiently clear and could have led to some confusion about the ability for them to switch to or switch out of fixed or tracker rates; and the second group, the single largest group, customers who were switchers.  Again, confusion was caused by a lack of transparency and clarity in some of the documentation.  To contextualise this, the average customer, and we looked at the customer journeys, will switch six times during their mortgage.  There is quite a lot of switching.</p></speech>

They will be actively switching the features of their products.  Just to give the Deputy an indication of the complexity, when we were looking at some of these cases, we saw one case where the customer had switched 17 times.  Every time they switched, they got new terms and conditions.  There were some quite complex customer journeys that we had to map and that added to the complexity in terms of the time it took to identify these customers.</p> <p>  Confusion about some of the terminology around the interest rate that was used was identified.  A reference to tracker and non-tracker variable rates was not as clear as what one would think was ideal.  That is the reason we included them for redress and compensation because the terminology had led to some confusion.</p></speech>

In this group, these are customers who drew down their mortgage perhaps on a standard variable rate, at some point switched to a tracker rate, then fixed their mortgage and the documentation referred them back to the original contract.  When the review was conducted late last year, the bank felt that the movement between the original offer letter and the switching documentation, when looked at from a customer perspective could be seen as confusing over time and that is why we have included them in the examination.</p></speech>

Just to be clear about how documentation occurs with a mortgage, when one gets a mortgage, typically there will be two documents.  One is the offer letter, which is typically the original and primary document for a mortgage and it has information on pricing and relevant terms and conditions.  For a customer who changes, switches or takes on a new feature in their mortgage, they would then get a second document called a mortgage form of authorisation, MFA.  That MFA will refer to pricing but states that save the details set out in this form, all terms and conditions applicable to the loan remain unchanged.  If one is the customer who switched 17 times, one would have 17 MFAs and one offer document.  That reference over a period of time, involving multiple MFA documents to the offer and even though it may be contractually accurate, from a customer-centric perspective and how a reasonable customer would understand that, we believe there was scope for confusion.  That is why we included them and gave them the benefit of the doubt and we included them in the remediation.</p></speech>

The 2006 consumer protection code required there to be clarity for customers when moving to an alternate rate of interest and that a tracker may not be available again in the future.  We had agreed to redress customers who had taken out a mortgage after 2006.  There was a group of customers who had taken out a mortgage prior to the 2006 consumer protection code and there was a view about whether to redress or compensate or not, based on the date of the code.  While technically correct, we felt that it should not be the sole determinant of whether they were included or not.  Even though the consumer protection code had not existed at that stage, in terms of being fair and reasonable to this group of customers, we included them in the redress and compensation scheme as well.</p></speech>

It sets out a table showing the interest that they were charged and what they should have been charged.  It is very difficult for anyone to work it out themselves, even for a financial adviser.  I would have thought it would be easier to issue revised annual mortgage statements along the normal lines with the correct interest rate and the actual payments made, so that somebody could see the difference very clearly.  Is Ms McDonagh satisfied with the format set out in the correspondence and has it been cleared with the Central Bank?

Our intention in creating those letters - I looked at their format before they went out - is to give as much information and clarity as possible.  It is quite a detailed letter.  It goes into a level of detail that I think our customers want to understand, on the basis that a mortgage is typically the largest part of people's disposable incomes, their largest asset and something they will have for many years.  That clarity was intended to be for the benefit of the customer and not to confuse.  We believe the letters are appropriate.</p> <p>  During the process of the remediation since we accepted the 6,000 customers, we have looked at ways to improve documentation and improve the process to make it easier for customers.  There is a constant ongoing feedback process to see what can improve.  Right now, we feel the letters we are sending and will continue to send between now and 31 March are appropriate.  They are accompanied by a call to the customer and also include contact details for a customer to call us for clarity or guidance if needed.  The Deputy will also be aware that, based on feedback from customers and other stakeholders, we actually increased the amount of money that was made available for independent financial and legal advice to support customers during this process.  </p> <p>  In term of the calculation, we believe it is correct and accurate.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the fact that she only joined Bank of Ireland in recent months, she has a key role to play in answering as to why money was removed from the accounts of over 10,000 customers.  That is the key point.  People will find it astounding that, from what I am hearing, the bank got legal advice on its contractual obligations, which instructed it to do something illegal, namely, to remove the money from those people's accounts.  Can Ms McDonagh just explain that to me?  Was it external legal advice or legal advice from within the bank?  Does the bank still have the same legal advisers?  It cost Bank of Ireland some &euro;200 million.</p></speech>

The tracker mortgage was removed in 2008 because it was not a sustainable and profitable product.  Many customers were able to continue to roll from a fixed to a tracker rate as was their contractual right.  For 20,000 customers during this period, that process worked well.  There were customers for whom there was a marginal error, a relatively small operational mistake of 0.15%, which has been redressed and fixed, plus there were 6,000 customers who did not get that contractual right.  I am new in role but from all the work I have seen there was no intent to charge incorrectly.  No money was taken from a customer's accounts.</p></speech>

If somebody is looking at a contract and customers were contacting the bank at the time, I cannot understand how the legal team was not aware of it.  We seek legal opinion all the time on different matters here.  Why is it that none of the legal advisers said there was illegality and that the bank was going to do something illegal if it continued taking this money from people or not giving them their contractual rights?  As an ordinary layperson, I cannot understand it.</p></speech>

My energy and focus has been on redressing this quickly.  Since we included the 6,000 in November, we have worked very hard to try to put this right for customers.</p> <p>  In terms of understanding a root cause as to how were there legal or operational errors in the implementation of our mortgages, that is a deep-dive investigation that is ongoing.  I have talked about what I understand to be the context, the reason tracker mortgages were discontinued, the fact that many customers would have continued to have a contractual right to their tracker, but there were cases where we got it wrong and for that reason we have apologised and are making it right.

Looking at it with a fresh pair of eyes, as the board asked me to do, I have deduced that we could go further in our customer focus having dealt with this issue, and that our terms and conditions and transparency of contract could be clearer in terms of some of the wording in the documentation we use.  There is an opportunity for us to be clearer and simpler in our approach with customers.</p></speech>

Something is either legal or it is illegal.  At the end of the day, the bank is going to be able to write this off against tax over the 20-year period in that it will not have profits there, so the citizen is going to end up paying for it.  It is totally unacceptable.</p> <p>  I hope none of the legal people who were involved then would be involved in the independent review panel.  How could people know that?</p></speech>

Where there was a clear legal right, and we talked about 20,000 customers who moved from fixed to tracker from 2008 onwards, that was absolutely compliant, legally appropriate and right.  We had identified 590 customers in whose cases we got it wrong.  They were identified back in December 2016.  We have had the discussion around the 6,000 and in some cases there were errors.  In some there was a lack of clarity.  In some, when we put our feet into the shoes of the customer, it was not reasonable, hence their inclusion within this additional group of redress.</p> <p>  I have not seen from my review and from understanding this, and working with colleagues, that there was any legal intent not to do the right thing.  The opposite is the case.  We are trying to do the right thing here.  The energy and focus of myself, the board and the team is on making this right.</p></speech>

We need to ensure they have the products, policies and processes that enable them to do a fantastic job for Bank of Ireland's customers.  I want to see the conclusion of the report.

The average will be reduced by the 0.15% small margin issue where the average redress was relatively small.</p> <p>  The average does not represent the focus we are putting into working out those more complex cases where there has been loss of ownership.

One is a mortgage-to-rent case, where the family still resides in the property but it is in the mortgage-to-rent scheme, and six were sold via a consensual sale with the customer.  I return to the compensation question asked previously.  On top of the compensation structure we set out in the questionnaire returned to the committee, it is important to highlight that where it has been deemed there is direct causation for the loss of any customer's home, and while we know that money alone will not be an answer for the suffering of those families, what we have also done within that compensation structure is to ensure that any residual debt that would have been left from the sale of the home is written off in full.  Any payments towards that residual debt made by the customer after the sale of the property will be returned.  There will be a minimum of &euro;50,000 in compensation.  If there has been any gain in value of the property since the date it was sold, given the rising property market at the moment, the differential will also be given back to the customer.  Similarly, we will also look to calculate a future value they would have had from the tracker mortgage that was removed from them versus the value of the standard variable rate.  That is an additional payment to the customer.  If possible, and if that the customer wishes to, we will return him or her to a tracker rate in purchasing a new home.  In the case of the mortgage-to-rent scheme, if they wish, we will see if we can re-purchase it from the housing body.</p></speech>

I refer to people getting paid multitudes of pensions.  The mind boggles.  It is criminal.  There is no other word for it.</p> <p>  On the buy-to-let mortgages that were in arrears and the 1% surcharge, does Ms McDonagh admit that, as a matter routine, Bank of Ireland applied a 1% surcharge to buy-to-let mortgages in arrears?  I remind Ms McDonagh what different bodies said about that.  The Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Ger Deering, told the committee that the policy "sounds wrong on the face of it".  The Minister for Finance told my colleague, Deputy Doherty, "the practice to which the Deputy was referring on which he has had information made available to him, should not have occurred.  It is another example of the appalling way in which this matter developed and has since been handled."  The Central Bank said this can only be done if the alternative repayment arrangement "is affordable for the borrower; and is a long-term sustainable solution which is consistent with Central Bank of Ireland policy on sustainability."  </p> <p>  However, based on Bank of Ireland's reply to the questionnaire, it seems to stand over the policy.  Is it Ms McDonagh's contention that it was okay because they were not family homes but buy-to-lets?  Has the Central Bank been in contact with the witness on the issue?</p></speech>

Typically it arises because the rent was too low versus the cost of the mortgage or it was moving from interest-only to capital and interest payments.  Typically it would be requested that the mortgage be extended out over a longer period of time.  As part of that restructuring, to ensure there is long-term sustainability, the process and product applied by the bank was to move it onto a buy-to-let plus 1% rate, which is a tracker variable rate plus 1%.  We found there are a number of customers who have that.  We have engaged with different parties on it over the years and anything we brought through in that way would have been in keeping with the regulation.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify some points.  I realise Ms McDonagh is new to her role but she certainly is not new to the banking world.  She was head of retail banking in HSBC in the UK for a number of years.  She said earlier that the tracker product was not a viable product for the bank in 2008.  That is not the issue at hand.  Nobody is questioning whether the product was viable.  Our questions are about the contracts that were entered into prior to that date by the banks and were not honoured by the banks.  Does she accept that to be the position?</p></speech>

I have referred to the 20,000 customers who were on a fixed rate mortgage during that period who, even after 2008, still exercise their contractual right to a tracker.  However, there were cases where the wrong rate was applied inappropriately and was not what was on the contract, that is, the 0.15% differential, where we had 3,400 cases and there were the 6,000 cases where, whether it was contractually or just in terms of the reasonable clarity of the agreement with the customer or the correspondence or the journey they went through, the view is that we had not done the right thing and they have been included.  The examination, as requested and arranged by the Central Bank, is to look at both the contractual and consumer protection requirements and also reasonable customer expectations.  When I arrived in my role the board asked me to take a fresh look.  The board felt that customer focus had been included and that there was a voice of customer involved as part of the bank's review and work around the examination prior to my arrival.  My view is that the customer focus was there, but had not gone far enough.  My recommendation was to include the additional 6,000 for a combination of reasons, in some cases contracts but also where there was not the clarity or the reasonable expectations that we would expect.</p></speech>

Both banks discontinued the trackers at the same time.  Ms McDonagh was head of retail banking in HSBC in the UK and Europe.  Was she surprised when she arrived at how the tracker issue had been dealt with?  She might elaborate on that in the context of her comment that the bank should have dealt with it quicker.  I am paraphrasing, but that is the general intent of what she said.  What did she mean in saying it should have been dealt with quicker?  Finally, I do not wish to appear rude but the Central Bank was insisting on those 6,000 customers being included.  As to saying the banks were doing this out of the goodness of their hearts, I have no doubt that the Central Bank would probably have insisted on them being included.  We are reaching the end of the tracker issue.  What often happens with these big investigations of schemes that go on for so long is that customers get fatigued and, effectively, it is steamrolled at the end.</p><p>In view of Ms McDonagh's breadth of experience as head of retail banking with a bank in the UK, was she surprised by what she saw and why did she state that it should have been dealt with more quickly?

I started in my role in Bank of Ireland on 2 October 2017.  I had begun to read and understand key issues and key risks prior to arriving but it was not until I started in my role on 2 October that I could get to grips with the issue.</p> <p>  I have been disappointed with how customers have been treated.  I think we could have come to a conclusion to include the 6,000 customers potentially sooner.  I feel the board believed and understood that both the legal and consumer protection perspective had been taken and that the voice of customer had been incorporated.  It had but my view is that we could have gone further and we should have and we did.  I recommended that we go further and give customers more of the benefit of the doubt to close this.</p> <p>  Coming in as a new chief executive of a very large bank, which had a history and heritage in Ireland, and which I think has an unique position in the Irish banking market and an unique opportunity to be the bank of Ireland and a national champion for banking in this country.  My focus was on transforming the bank, improving our reputation among our customers, driving engagement among our people and in developing the team.  I was keen to come to a resolution quickly to get the right outcome for our customers as part of that path or step towards improving and restoring the trust that we know is quite fragile in the banking sector.</p> <p>  In response to the Senator's question on whether the Central Bank of Ireland or the Bank of Ireland came to a conclusion on how to deal with the 6,000 customers, we engaged with the Central Bank of Ireland and it is on public record that it challenged robustly Bank of Ireland and the banks in general.  I, together with the chairman of the board of Bank of Ireland had a meeting with the Minister for Finance.  We were given very clear feedback about the need to address this issue.  We do not operate in a vacuum.  I was reading and looking at the media coverage.  I watched the evidence of individuals who outlined their own experiences when they came before this joint committee.  They were not customers of Bank of Ireland but I think the common themes about the impact that trackers had on individuals were very well felt.</p> <p>  As well as working on the detail, going through the customer journeys, looking at documentation and viewing it from a customer perspective, I made the recommendation with the full support of the board to increase the redress and compensation to include the 6,000 customers.</p></speech>

They are the people who drive the relationships with our clients and they are at the forefront of dealing with complex issues and delivering service day in day out.  I will do everything I can to increase the pride and engagement of our people.  I talked about our purpose at Bank of Ireland, which is about enabling our customers, our colleagues and our communities to thrive.  That is incredibly important to the success of Bank of Ireland for all our stakeholders.  I have said also that we have treated staff in the same way as we would treat customers in the context of this examination.  I do not think it appropriate to have given preferential treatment to staff in the context of mortgages because I think our other stakeholders would object to that.  We treated our staff as fairly as we would endeavour always to treat our customers.  The fact our staff are people who we are asking to be ambassadors for Bank of Ireland is an additional factor, though I think it is the right thing to have included them in the 6,000 for additional compensation and redress in November 2017.  I communicated that very clearly to all our employees at Bank of Ireland as soon as we communicated that message externally because they are such an important part of what we do in Bank of Ireland every day.</p></speech>

Of the 9, 400 people, 5,066 customers had received payment as of last Wednesday, 24 January 2018.  Obviously that number is rising every single day.

That is our intention.  Within the customers who have not yet been contacted, these are the difficult cases and we are tracing them.  Some customers have moved away from Ireland; they have moved to the UK.  I know from individual cases I have looked at that they were nationals of India or China and they have moved back.  We are tracing in Ireland, in Europe and globally and we are tracing approximately 250 customers.  We are using a third party professional tracing agency to contact them in order that we can send them the letter with the offer of redress and compensation.  It is possible that in some cases, such is the tracing that we may go beyond 31 March but we are endeavouring to have contacted and made an offer of redress and compensation by that date, notwithstanding some extreme circumstances when we have not been able to find the individual customer.</p></speech>

This was not a new reveal in November 2017, but there was ongoing debate, discussion and challenge between Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank on whether they should be included.  There was a balance to be struck in the bank's view.  The bank had endeavoured, and the intention was, to balance the legal and consumer protection requirements and examinations with fair outcomes.  When I arrived, the board was very keen to resolve this and asked me to take another look with a fresh pair of eyes.</p></speech>

This is the problem.  The Irish public put billions into Bank of Ireland.  If an individual owed money to Bank of Ireland for a mortgage, and I was in practice for years, the bank took on those customers.  It was there to collect the money.  I find it incredible with regard to these 6,000 customers.  The bank was clearly fighting with the Central Bank before Ms McDonagh's arrival with regard to a technicality.</p> <p>  We are on a committee discussing this, but the devil is always in the detail.  That is the bank's business but we have to probe the question.  How can Ms McDonagh stand over a situation based on a technicality?  Someone could have taken out a mortgage on 31 December 2006 and another customer could have taken out a mortgage on 1 January 2007.  Both are identical, but one person is covered and the other is not.  This is totally against the spirit of why the Irish public put money into the banks.  The money held for people who took out mortgages before 2006 was their money, it was not the bank's money.  If the roles were reversed and a customer owed money to the bank, whether the mortgage was taken out pre-2006 or post-2006, the bank would have gone after that customer in the same fashion.  There has to be fairness.</p> <p>  Can Ms McDonagh stand over this?  I hope Ms McDonagh was horrified when she went in and that she just turned around to the board and stated the bank had to stand over these tracker mortgages.  Can Ms McDonagh see the exasperation?  I find it incredible.  I am actually shocked.  The bank has 3,400 affected customers and another 6,000 on top, which is not quite double, but who make up at this stage two thirds of the affected trackers.  The bank was basically trying to keep them out on a technicality and continue - for want of a term where I want to be direct because I very rarely am - to rob their money.  Was Ms McDonagh horrified when she went in there?</p></speech>

There was ongoing debate about the 1,500 who were part of the pre-2006 consumer protection code.  It had not been decided.  When I came in, the board said it needed me to take a look at this with a fresh pair of eyes and a very clear customer centric mandate.  That was a very easy decision for me to make and get full support of the board to include those 1,500 customers.  I have apologised for the delay it has taken.  We have put a lot of resources and time, effort and dedication into making this right.  Those customers should have been included in the redress earlier.  It took us longer and we are now making that right.</p></speech>

Before I took up the role at Bank of Ireland I worked for 20 years at HSBC in a variety of roles.  I worked in the UK laterally, where I ran our UK and European retail banking business.

Sometimes I arrived after that was identified in an industry, not necessarily in the bank where I worked.  I have learned from 20 years of experience the importance of being customer-focused to drive the right outcomes, and that is the best way to grow a business, because there is a trust-based proposition for the customers, and staff feel proud and enabled and engaged in what they are doing.  This worked for all of the stakeholders and it is very purposeful.</p></speech>

In my appointment I come with experience from previous markets, but also I am spending my time really understanding the market in Ireland.  For me, whether it is an Irish customer or a customer from my previous experience in other parts of the world, customers want to have fairly priced and structured products which are clear, and when there is a problem the bank should address it quickly.  My intent with the team is to be very purposeful in the way we serve our customers.  This is why we have defined Bank of Ireland's purpose and, to be fair, the cultural work on what our purpose should be predates my arrival.  Before I arrived in the role, the board was already looking at what should the culture be at Bank of Ireland.  The one thing I asked the Chairman was to wait for my arrival so that as the new CEO I could work with the team to define a purpose that is meaningful for us individually and as a collective.  This is enabling our customers, colleagues and communities to thrive.</p></speech>

Senator Kieran O'Donnell said we are reaching the end.  I do not think we are reaching the end.  I think we have quite a way to go because a significant number of issues still remain.  I am taking Ms McDonagh at face value, based on her experience and on what she has said about the purpose of the bank now.  She has said that it is customer-centred and so on.  I want to get an understanding.  She spoke about compensation in her opening remarks.  We get letters and emails all the time.  Why does Ms McDonagh believe her staff - the employees of her bank - are writing to us on an ongoing basis to highlight the fact that they feel they are not being treated properly?  Given what she has said about how the bank treats its staff the same as its customers, is it not odd that they are writing to us to say they are not getting fair play?</p> <p>  The second point I want to make relates to compensation.  Ms McDonagh has said she deals with particular cases.  A lady wrote to us in December to say she had been overcharged by &euro;1,355 a month.  She said that if Bank of Ireland had come clean at any point over the years between 2008 and 2012, she and her family would have kept their home, their tracker and their lives.  She said she would have had enough money to pay for a consultant in the course of the birth of her child, who was born with a disability.  She mentioned that a second child is receiving the services of a psychologist.  She says her life has been destroyed and broken and her relationship and family are destroyed.  It was in December of last year that this lady wrote to us to that effect.  What method is available within the bank to reach out to that family?  How does it construct a compensation package around an extreme case like that?  What flexibility is there?  Is there humanity and compassion within the bank to touch that person's life again and to assist her?</p></speech>

Staff have the right to write directly to the committee.  Obviously, I would always want our staff to feel they can escalate their concerns to their line managers or to me as part of an open and engaging culture in our organisation.  We are encouraging a speak-up culture in which the more traditional hierarchical layers are broken down and people feel they can speak up and have their concerns addressed.  Such a culture is engaging and successful.  Staff members may have escalated the cases that have been mentioned to their line managers or to me.  I do not know.  If there are cases involving employees of Bank of Ireland, I would be very keen to look at them, as I would with any customers.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned a specific case in which someone wrote to him in December 2017 to set out the impact the tracker issue has caused in her life.  I would be very keen to look at this individual case.  I hope it is one we are dealing with as what we consider to be a "complex" case.  It is clear that in this case, there are extenuating circumstances, there is vulnerability and distress has been caused.  No financial framework can compensate for the human impact of what has happened to that individual's family.  I recognised that in my opening statement and I have apologised for it.  The only thing we can do right now is look at complex individual cases on a case-by-case basis.  The people who are managing this are not contractors or new staff members.  They have a great deal of experience of managing and resolving complex cases.  If we do not resolve a case to the satisfaction of the customer, he or she can go to the independent appeals panel that is in place to have his or her case heard.  I would like to think we would manage each case in a proactive and empathetic manner so that this is not necessary.  If people feel they have not been treated fairly, we encourage them to exercise their absolute entitlement to go to the panel.</p></speech>

I am saying all of this here at this committee not because I want someone to be treated differently, but because I want the weakest in the group to feel that they are as good as the strongest within the group and that their cases will be heard as quickly and as efficiently as the cases of others.  That is why I am raising these cases.  It is a test, just as it is in the cases of the other banks.  I really do not believe half of what they are telling this committee.  I think the Irish public feels exactly the same way.  The people just do not believe the banks.  From the correspondence I have received, I have enough grounds not to believe all of what the banks are saying.  The jury is still out.  We will see how they perform.  The point that has been made about tracker mortgages in a residential sense can also be made in a commercial sense.  Would it be correct to say that the bank is continuing to ignore the cases that have been made to it regarding tracker-type mortgages in a commercial sense?</p></speech>

Before I ask my colleague, Mr. Mason, to speak about commercial or SME cases, I would like to go back to the Chairman's previous point.  As the Chairman knows, any cases that are sent to me by him or by his office are investigated.  I seek to respond personally to them in a timely manner.  I always look at individual cases, whether they are staff or non-staff.  The manner in which Bank of Ireland manages these cases and the overall issue will define the banking culture of the future.  It is my intention and that of the board and the senior management team to get this right.  The only way for us to prove that is through action.  I hope the fact that we have taken rapid steps to compensate and redress 6,000 customers within a matter of weeks is an indication of our commitment here.  It is not just words.  I ask Mr. Mason to speak about the SME considerations.</p></speech>

The terms of those loans clearly specified that rates could change in circumstances where the bank's cost of funding changed considerably.  That is what happened.  When that condition happened, and there was a considerable change in the bank's cost of funding, the terms of those arrangements changed.  In the cases of bigger commercial loans, each affected customer had a dedicated relationship manager.  All such customers were spoken to and written to.  They were given the option of having their terms extended so their monthly repayments would stay the same.  I think that happened some time in 2011 or 2012.</p></speech>

In 2011, the method of applying the interest to his loan was changed from EURIBOR to bank cost of funds.  He believed he was on a tracker-type product, but just like that it was changed in the way I have described.  Bearing in mind the principle of putting the customer first and giving the customer the benefit of the doubt, why should someone like that end up in court?  His bank would not listen to him.</p></speech>

When it found itself unable to fund itself at the rates in question, it changed the terms and conditions.  It would have told the customer what it was doing and why it was doing it.  The bank would have tried to make alternative arrangements with the customer at the time.</p></speech>

Obviously, it ended up in court.  I have read the correspondence on it and I am going to refer to it.  Ms McDonagh has it anyway.  This individual has been writing to her.  When someone who has been a customer of the bank since 2004 without going into arrears questions the amount of interest that was charged because of a change in the specific methodology used when applying the interest, I would have thought the bank would take him in and talk to him.  That is what I would consider to be a customer-friendly bank.  I will refer it to the bank again.</p></speech>

A case has been made about it and I do not see that case being answered.</p><p>It is amazing that the customers and staff of huge banks are writing to members of this committee in order to get some sort of justice.  If everything Ms McDonagh said in her opening remarks is going to work - or was beginning to work prior to her appointment - surely the volume of correspondence would have dropped.  It has not done so.</p><p> As much as I must listen to Ms McDonagh and hope for the best, she must listen to us.  Individual cases come to the committee.  I am not making this up.  Language has been used here that makes the situation appear fine and dandy but I must tell the Bank of Ireland that it is not.  The public perception of banks and the rebuilding of trust based on that perception will cost the bank and take it considerable time.  While it does so, I see no reason why the bank cannot address some of the big-ticket issues relating to it at the same time as it deals with the matter of tracker mortgages and to try to prevent the type of correspondence that we in the committee are being sent.  I am sure there are customers who will listen carefully to what Ms McDonagh has said and the exchanges between members and bank officials and tomorrow they will contact us in disbelief.  Ms McDonagh is correct that the bank will be judged by its actions.  I hope those actions favour the customers, particularly those who have had a bad deal.  This situation is far from over.</p></speech>

I would never want to rely on complaints to improve our service, but we will investigate every one whether or not it relates to tracker mortgages.  Even if the individual case is not one of the 9,400 cases, we will review it in detail.  Being customer-centric means that we need to be fair and consistent.  It does not mean that every single complaint will be found in favour of the customer but we will investigate and be fair and appropriate in addressing any cases which the committee may share with us.</p></speech>

I thank Ms McDonagh for her opening statement.  She made one particular remark, to which Senator Kieran O'Donnell referred.  On page 1 of her statement she says:</p><blockquote>Since joining Bank of Ireland, I have reviewed the bank&rsquo;s approach to the tracker issue.  I have concluded that the bank placed a clear emphasis on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements but did not go far enough to fully ensure we were delivering the right outcomes for our customers.</blockquote> <p>On page 4, almost identical wording is used, namely:</p><blockquote>I concluded that a clear emphasis had been placed on the legal interpretation of our mortgage agreements.  However, while the bank had considered the voice of the customer when reviewing cases, my view was that we had not always gone far enough to fully ensure we were delivering the right outcomes for our customers.</blockquote> <p>It is a point that Ms McDonagh was clearly trying to make to the committee.  Senator Kieran O'Donnell touched on this and suggested that maybe it is the pre-2006 and post-2006 consumer protection code being invoked.</p><p>Perhaps Ms McDonagh might expand further on this statement, since she made it twice.  Is it fair to say that the bank looked at the agreements, said that within the law it could continue doing what it was doing and it would do so, then Ms McDonagh came along and made recommendations to the board, for which Ms McDonagh received the board's support?  Can she discuss with us the extent to which the Central Bank's involvement was relevant and how much arm-twisting, if any, was involved?  If it was not relevant, then so be it.  For the figure to go from 3,400 to 9,400 - nearly 10,000 - in a very short time - effectively in one go on 9 November - is notable.  I recall the day it happened; all of us wondered when this was going to end.  This happened only in recent months.  Can Ms McDonagh tease out why she made these remarks twice in her statement?</p></speech>

Work was ongoing before I arrived.  There was an ongoing discussion and challenge between the Central Bank and the Bank of Ireland regarding which customers should be included.  There was a lot of work and discussion between senior management and the board.  Nobody was trying to take an exclusively legalistic approach.  There was a clear intent and endeavour to include customers' perspective.  I will give two examples.  The benefit of the doubt was given to customers where we had undercharged.  I spoke of the 3,400 marginal errors where we had slightly overcharged customers and which we have corrected and redressed.  There were 2,000 cases where we undercharged.  That was an operational error - our error - and we did not return to the customers and tell them they owed us money as a consequence of our operational error.  That is a simple example of where the bank did the right thing.  During much of the discussion around contractual or consumer protection, the voice of the customer was in the room.  The bank had a senior, very accomplished executive to be the voice of the customer and to give the customer perspective, which I think is good.</p> <p>  On reflection, and coming in with a fresh perspective and in agreement with the board, with a very clear mandate, I think that it could have gone further.  My view is that in order to be more customer-centric, the voice of the customer could have been an external voice rather than an internal employee.  It could have been more of a consumer advocate, to be a critical friend and constructive voice to challenge some of the thinking.</p> <p>  I do not want to pre-empt the review and have already mentioned this, but the opportunity to improve the clarity and consistency of wording is something that we should do and to go further on it.  That is something I would like to do.</p> <p>  When I arrived, working with a team, we looked at the journey purely from a customer perspective.  We did not have technical or legal counsel in the room for this exercise.  We imagined a customer, it could be a member of staff or someone who is in the pre-2006 group or a regular switcher, and what they would have experienced at every step of the life of their mortgage?  That provided a different prism through which to view the issue and it allowed us to see matters from their perspective.  Those are examples of where we could have - and now have - gone further.</p></speech>

There was correspondence between the bank and the Central Bank which predated my arrival, there was challenge and ongoing work and discussion on the 6,000 cases over which there was question or a difference of perspectives.  During my first couple of days after arriving at the bank, I made a point of calling some of our customers and introducing myself.  I met as many colleagues as possible and also called to introduce myself, though I had met many of them during my regulatory approval process with the regulators, and this was mentioned to me very early on as something on which I would have to focus.  In agreement with the board, that is what I did.  There was ongoing discussion and debate.  The challenge from the Central Bank, feedback from the Minister of Finance, the context of the external environment at the time, and then my own objective review, arrived at working with the team, looking at the different facets and prisms of the discussion is what resulted in the recommendation to include the 6,000, which the board fully supported.</p></speech>

Is there a further pool of mortgage accounts which the Central Bank was also looking at, of which the bank only accepted three quarters, that being 6,000 cases out of 8,000, for example?  Alternatively, is it the case that the 6,000 cases which represent the jump from 3,400 to 9,400 were all the disputed cases which the Central Bank was robustly challenging and in respect of which Bank of Ireland finally put its hands up - I am not saying it surrendered or rolled over - and agreed to accept the Central Bank's point?  Did the Bank of Ireland take 100% of the cases that were under robust challenge by the Central Bank and move them into the redress and compensation scheme or are there some, where Bank of Ireland said that it would not do so , that it did not have to do so and that was standing by its original point of view?</p></speech>

There have been offers in nine out of ten cases and so much has been paid out and so on.  Are the one in ten cases the more complicated and complex cases which will ultimately be more costly for the bank to redress and compensate people?  I asked the question of AIB last week and will probably ask it of other banks.  What is the highest amount of redress and compensation identified so far?  I do not know if any of the team looked at the AIB interaction last week.  During the meeting we saw that, by and large, its compensation was approximately 15% but there were higher figures of 22% and 24% as well as lower figures.  It depended on the impact.  I tried to understand some of the information in Appendix 2 although it is perhaps not the easiest thing in the world to understand because it refers to upfront payments and 5% of refund value etc.  We might come back to that.  However, in terms of those who lost and those who did not lose their homes, what were the highest amounts of redress?</p> <p>  Although they are not necessarily with Bank of Ireland, people have contacted me to say they will receive approximately &euro;200,000 or &euro;300,000.  Do the witnesses have the top-end figures?  The figures in the questionnaire on the amounts for those with trackers who are on the wrong rate are fairly small amounts of redress and also relatively small amounts of compensation.  There must be people at the other end of the spectrum, however, and the average is distorted by the number of people at the low rate.  I would like to get a feel for the high end of the compensation and redress.  I do not think anyone else has covered it.</p></speech>

We did not send all letters at the same time but letters will go out on Friday to less than half of that group.  The other half is made up broadly of the two large groups.  There are those who we are tracing, that is, those who have moved away, and there are also the more complex ones, to which the Senator referred.  Those are complex ones because they often involve a loss of ownership or extenuating circumstances or vulnerability.  Personal cases take longer for us to ensure we have all the information to come to a resolution with the customer.  We would expect the average redress and compensation amounts of those to be higher.  I mentioned that the highest case so far is for a sum of &euro;363,000.  The Senator is right that the average is distorted somewhat by the high volume of lower value customers because of the margin issue.  If we look at the range, there is a small number of cases, the top 1%, that are in the &euro;75,000 to &euro;100,000 range.  The highest case so far is for &euro;363,000.</p></speech>

We heard from AIB that in the really appalling cases where people lost homes the compensation could be multiples of the redress, as opposed to less than 100% of the compensation.  I do not know if that is the case in Bank of Ireland.  Perhaps it is but perhaps it is not.  It would be useful for us to see a range of all of the 9,400, that is, how many cases were involved in various bands of redress.  It would outline for us the worst of the worst.  People have contacted me with figures in the hundreds of thousands and it is important that we realise some of these people, as Deputy McGuinness and others have outlined, had appalling cases.  These people could not live normal daily lives or function properly.  They could not provide clothes for their children, change a car, have a holiday, get medical treatment and so on.  It is important and it would have been helpful to have it here today.</p></speech>

For the more complex cases, there is a discretion and a discussion about the individual circumstances and a case-by-case basis may mean that the ratio between redress and compensation may vary significantly.  For owner-occupier cases, which are typically the ones with higher redress and compensation, we have the breakdown by quartile and range but I do not have the split between redress and compensation.  I do not know if Mr. O'Beirne wants to add any more.  We can commit to revert further after the meeting, however.</p></speech>

As per the conversation to which the Senator referred and as I outlined earlier, as we look at the more complex cases, the compensation can be a multiple of the redress.  This is particularly the situation in the most complex cases where we have had direct cause of loss of ownership.  I went through the mechanism earlier and am happy to do so again.</p></speech>

I do not know if the witnesses had a chance to examine the transcript of the meeting.  I will be asking for it.  I just want to identify it.  It is all very well if there is a margin error of less than 1% and a person gets a couple of thousand euro and a bit of compensation.  There is a phrase on Appendix 2: "Fair value compensation interest and fair value interest calculated per the group refund standard, subject to a minimum of 5% of the refund value."  Will the witnesses explain that to the average person who is trying to read it?  What does it really mean?</p></speech>

Over the period that they did not have the tracker, as well as providing the redress and paying back the money that belonged to the customer, that is, the interest that they overpaid, we also try to give back the deposit cost of that money.  Over some of the period, there were negative interest rates, so the bank would have floored that at 0%.  As those amounts were quite low, we put in a minimum amount of 5% of the interest overpaid in all cases.</p></speech>

It is the 5% plus the 10% subject to the minimum amounts we have laid out coming up to 21%.  As we move to customers who had moved into default, where we define default as 90 days of not making payments, if the bank had issued a demand letter we try to move customers to the worst ever position that they had been impacted to try to ensure that the compensation payment back out to them is at the highest level.  As it moves to loss of ownership and the most extreme cases of direct causation of loss of ownership, we apply the additional compensation about which we spoke earlier.</p></speech>

It has a huge job in terms of restoring trust.  This is not just in Bank of Ireland and Bank of Ireland cannot do it for the whole banking sector but it can do its best within its bank.  I know we are dealing with tracker mortgages but this is central to everything that happens in a bank.  In terms of behaviour that is agile, accountable, fosters teamwork and is customer-focused, what is the bank doing to get that over the line?  We have previously spoken about branches that are moving towards automated transactions.  They are not cashless and I accept that they are not cashless but there is less customer interaction with staff for ordinary transactions.  I accept that many customers are happy with it and they carry out their banking on their mobiles and so on.  It is very difficult, however, to be customer focused when a person wants to talk to someone but is faced with lots of machines in the branch.  How does the bank respond to that kind of thing?  People are now opening post office accounts to deal with coin because they cannot go to the bank and deal with it except on Friday mornings for two hours etc.  Many people are unhappy with parts of the change of culture, which is happening in all of the banks, including Bank of Ireland.</p></speech>

It is an incredibly important moment for us, as to how we redress this in the coming weeks until we come to conclusion.  </p><p> Many things had happened to start to improve the culture before my arrival.  For example, complaints management has been consolidated.  As opposed to having complaints on different products or different channels in different parts of the banks, for accountability, agility and being customer-focused, it involved having a consolidated and centralised understanding of where complaints are happening.  It means that even if one sees a relatively small number of increase, one can investigate or there would be an escalation. </p><p> We have also changed how we launch, alter or discontinue a product in order that there is a better consideration of all aspects of the customer impact.  That is a particular angle and point learned from the issue that we have at hand.  The committee will be aware that the Bank of Ireland has been public in its commitment and investment in transforming its core banking system.  That is an ongoing programme.  It is one that seeks to improve both the efficiency and the speed, simplicity and digital propositions that we offer our customers over time.  These are some of the examples.  As I get into my role, and I am four months in, there will be more examples of how we are demonstrating the culture that we want our people and our customers to be proud of at Bank of Ireland.</p><p> Specific to the branch network, I will ask Mr. Mason to comment.  I am happy to add more comments about how I feel the branch network is an incredibly important part of what Bank of Ireland is today and in the future.    </p></speech>

While we have seen customers change the way they are banking, with our traditional banking methods we have not closed branches.  As members will know, we have keep our branches open.  We have 250 branches across the country, which has been the case for ten years.  We are trying to do both.  As many as 79% of our customers are digitally active.  We have seen a consistent change with more people becoming digitally active.  On 21 December, we had 900,000 individual log-ons to our sites via the mobile app, the Bank of Ireland 365 online site or our business online site.  Our customers are changing the way they bank.  Last December, our customers wrote 16% fewer cheques than they wrote the previous December and our customers used contactless technology 66% more than they did the previous December.  We have seen significant changes.</p> <p>  I was disappointed to hear the Senator say that when a person goes into a branch there is no-one there to meet him or her.  We have tried to move people from behind the counter to front of house.  We are trying to make our branches business development hubs.  It is disappointing to hear him say that people did not see a staff member when they went into a branch.  That is not our objective.  We have kept our branches open for a very specific purpose.  We want them to be business development hubs and communities and to help local communities to thrive.  </p></speech>

There may be people in the branches.  Customers cannot do what they want to because there is nobody behind the counter who can accept a foreign cheque or give a bank draft in sterling.  Certain things cannot be done in branches that no longer provide counter services.  My bank branch is located at Montrose.  It is a great branch that has a great innovative hub.  I am more than happy with the service and there are other branches relatively close by but there are people who find bank transactions a bit more difficult.</p> <p>  In terms of mobile technology, Apple Pay and all these kinds of things, people have asked me whether such technology will be introduced.  I am sure there is more technology on the way.  Younger people want to embrace new technology.  Is the bank up to speed or on the way to where it wants to be in terms of technology?  </p></speech>

On my first day one of the first things I did was visit the oldest and newest branches in the network located at College Green and Grand Canal Square, which has a different format.  I did so because I recognise that both formats are equally applicable to different types of customers and some customers will use both for different things.  The role of the branch is incredibly important.</p> <p>  As Mr. Mason has said, the behaviour and needs of our customers are evolving and we need to evolve and match them.  Last week, I spoke to customers in Galway and learned of their frustrations.  They want to have more personal time and do not want to queue to use a machine.  Customer feedback is very important to us and we incorporate it into our schemes.  We will always have people in every single branch in our network.  We have the largest footprint of any bank in Ireland.  Every single branch has cash but some are more focused towards a self-service model because that is where we have seen the footprint.  We do not underestimate the importance of a relationship and personal service, whether it is in our branches or contact centres.  Increasingly, whether it is the SME or agricultural sector, some customers want to have an out-of-hours conversation with a specialist adviser.  We have found that model to be highly relevant for the modern age.</p> <p>  We are opening new branches.  I joined the team at a new work space located on Camden Street.  We have also recently opened a new branch in Cherrywood.  </p> <p>  In response to the question on Apple Pay, as part of the ongoing technological transformation, we are always developing new alternatives in order for our customers to make payment.  It is a priority.  It is something we are working on. </p></speech>

I wish her well in her new position.  It is important that we have a strong banking sector in this country.</p> <p>  I will follow on from what Senator Horkan said about banks having fewer staff but more machines.  How long does it take to be granted a mortgage, on average?  There are many obstacles as people now have short-term contracts and no longer have a job for life.  How long does it take, on average, to be approved for a mortgage?  Is a quick decision made?  </p></speech>

I shall ask Mr. O'Beirne to talk about the mortgage application process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.316" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Beirne" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018013000002#R01000"><p>The Senator has asked two questions.  First, how long does it take to be approved for a mortgage.  Second, how is the changing nature of work, in terms of contracts etc., taken into account.</p> <p>  As for the speed in getting a mortgage, typically, the time it takes from applying to drawing down a mortgage depends on how quickly the property sells.  Applying for a mortgage and getting approval tends to be a relatively quick process once the bank has sight of all of the documentation that is required to make a decision.  Typically, if there is an urgency on the part of the customer or if there is a specific reason that he or she has a time constraint, we will seek to turn the decision around within 24 hours.  If approval is not time-sensitive, then normally it takes three to five days.  In some cases, it can take a little bit longer but that depends on the circumstances such as a requirement to provide follow-up information. </p> <p>  On the Senator's second question on the changing nature of work and contracts, the bank is mindful of the situation.  We try to look past whether somebody is in traditional long-term employment or whether they are on a 12-month or 24-month work contract.  Typically, we look through the individual or person's sphere of expertise - let us say he or she is an engineer or teacher - and we think this person is very likely to be able to continue to find employment in that space and the salary looks like it is within the normal parameters that we would expect.  That will not count against the individual in terms of the bank arriving at an approval for the mortgage application.    </p></speech>

At that stage, the bank said that its mortgage rate was about 3%.  Does Ms McDonagh agree that a fixed rate mortgage is the way to go?  What is the current rate?</p></speech>

Our focus continues to be on fixed rate offerings for our customers.</p><p>We found that nine out of ten new mortgages that customers take out with Bank of Ireland are fixed rate.  We have recently simplified our fixed rate pricing.  Today, it is 3% for one-year, two-year, three-year and five-year mortgages, regardless of loan-to-value.  We simplified it to make ourselves more competitive.  Our view is that people want certainty and to plan ahead.  In an interest rate environment that today is very low, but when it is probable that over the life of a loan interest rates will go up, that certainty is treasured by our customers.  We see that customers have voted with their feet.  Our market share of the total market has increased from 26% over a year ago to 27% because customers favour and prefer fixed rate mortgages.  We have seen a very clear focus from customers in that regard.</p></speech>

The bank used its position to change the rates.  How do we guarantee it will not happen again and that we will not get into the same position we were in where the bank may not be able to fund itself going forward and might have to change the rates again?</p></speech>

It related to a period of financial crisis.  We are in a very different place now in terms of the stability of the economy of Ireland and the bank.  We are able to continue to fund and grow a very strong mortgage book which is predominantly fixed rate mortgages.  Our view is one of value and working for what the customer prefers.  We are very clearly of the view that for every variable rate customer out there, there is a fixed rate that can save them money.</p></speech>

Is there a section within the bank that develops those products?  It is not just a matter of going into a bank, the interest rate is set and one gets a deposit rate.  There are all different types of products and all the banks have different products.  I presume that is how they compete with each other.  Is there a unit in the bank to develop those products?  Is there a legal framework put around them at that stage?  Where do all the products come from?  Are they patented?  Is there somebody that has a patent out on some of them?  Does the bank own them?  Does the bank liaise with other banks on the products?  The products can closely follow each other.  There might be a similar product in a competing bank.</p></speech>

In terms of looking back over the past, we are trying to apply lessons learned and make sure that when we bring a new product to the market, it is grounded and we have gone through good, strong customer research, that we have thought about the risks around the product, including the risk of introducing or withdrawing it, and very importantly its benefit to individual customers.  Whether they are patented or not very much depends on the type of product.  For the most part, the core banking products we use in Ireland are not patented.  What is important is that the regulatory framework and customer requirements have developed very substantially in recent years.  In that centralised process, the bank tries to make sure it meets and surpasses those requirements because the interest of the bank is very much aligned to the interest of our customers.  As Ms McDonagh said earlier, we will continually look to lessons learned to inform and develop that.</p></speech>

I suppose it is not a nice process for the customer and perhaps it is not a nice process for the bank to go through either.  The only other option is repossession.  It is either one or the other, voluntary surrender or repossession, when one goes down that route.  Neither is a nice route.  How does the bank go through the voluntary surrender process?</p></speech>

It is about the bank's role in supporting local towns, economies, businesses and people.  It is an example of Bank of Ireland at its best.  We receive consistently positive feedback from our people.  We should be very ambitious about what more we can do with enterprise towns to help build the trust and relationships we have across the country.</p></speech>

It was down to the same thing.  It was the cost that drove Bank of Ireland to change its mind on the trackers and on the commercial mortgages.  It is reasonable for a customer to offer that as an argument for being overcharged.  That was my point.  I will leave it at that because I will give the witnesses the correspondence.</p> <p>  Ms McDonagh answered an earlier question about the payments.

We were not trying to save money or do something that was seen to be inadequate and responded in a very agile way to that feedback and increased the amount in December, a matter of days or weeks after we got the feedback, from &euro;250 to &euro;500 for buy-to-let and to &euro;750 for owner-occupied.  We were very quick to respond.  We are giving this to customers who had got the independent financial and legal advice amount when it was lower in January.</p> <p>  It is an example of where there was not one single framework agreed across the industry that everyone was going to do the same thing and debate whether that would have been a good idea.  I cannot speak for other banks but we did what we thought was appropriate.  We got feedback that one element was lower and quickly responded to that and increased it. </p></speech>

As part of the restructuring for buy-to-let mortgages on investment properties customers were moved to a tracker rate plus 1%, which has been the same and has stayed constant over that period and they have not been deemed to have been impacted under the examination because the movement of the customer was based on the need to restructure the mortgage, either for an extended term or other reasons, depending on the circumstances of those customers.</p></speech>

The Chairman questioned Mr. McLoughlin, the chief executive of retail Ireland, and Mr. Mason.  The question put to Mr. McLoughlin was: &quot;Did the bank at any time make a promise to those 1,800 that they would be put back on trackers?&quot;  This was part of a line of questioning about staff.</p><blockquote><b>Mr. Liam McLoughlin:</b>No, not that I am aware of.<br /><br /><b>Chairman:</b>Never.<br /><br /><b>Mr. Liam McLoughlin:</b>Not that I am aware of.<br /><br /><b>Chairman:</b>Would anyone else be aware of it?  Mr. Mason?<br /><br /><b>Mr. Stephen Mason: </b>No.<br /><br /><b>Mr. Liam McLoughlin:</b>There was no such promise. </blockquote> <p>Do we now accept that the document we have would amount to a promise?  I know Mr. O'Beirne said a communication was sent out over a month later which withdrew this commitment but can we now accept that this was, in the words of the Chairman's question, a promise to those 1,800.  Is point No. 2 not that promise?  Would Ms McKenna accept that?</p></speech>

This document was issued to all members of staff - if I am correct, there were in excess of 2,000 staff at the time - on 9 November 2008.  That would be the day before Bank of Ireland withdrew its tracker mortgages.  Is it correct that the letter withdrawing this commitment was not issued three weeks later?</p></speech>

There are 1,850 who have now been restored onto their trackers and who will get compensation and redress.  Then there are a couple of hundred others.  This is the cohort I talked about who were not on trackers, who went onto a two-year fixed rate and who were issued with this also.  Is it correct that they were issued with the exact same communication as the 1,850?</p></speech>

The correspondence was published on the bank's internal website and was available to all staff.  The group of customers and staff to whom the Deputy refers were staff who had never been on trackers and who would have seen that correspondence.  Within the correspondence, there are two statements.  One was that all mortgages would role to their original contract and that was what was clarified in the subsequent correspondence that issued in the following weeks.  Certainly, we are happy to provide that documentation to the committee after this session.</p></speech>

The same correspondence was issued to them when they originally moved to the two-year fixed rate - the same information provided on 9 November 2008, on 4 November 2008 and on 20 November 2008 - and yet Bank of Ireland has deemed that 1,850 of them can get compensation redress and that the other couple of hundred others will not.</p></speech>

Within the correspondence, it was not clear.  That is what the bank is accepting.  In terms of the first notification, it stated that customers would return to their original rate.  The customers who have not been returned to a tracker are those who never had tracker mortgages at all.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="19:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2018013000002#U01100"><p>They would have been communicated with.  On existing staff mortgage accounts - the staff two-year fixed rate - it states that they would revert to tracker mortgages.  The bank's staff are watching these hearings.  I received an email from one staff of member who is in this cohort that the bank has deemed non-impacted, which means that it will not give them back the money that they are entitled to plus compensation.  This is an internal email from the following day.  I refer to the original communication which indicates that the bank's staff member is entitled to roll on to an ECB tracker plus 0.75%, which, by the way, the staff member always believed because, when the staff member took out the fixed rate, that was the understanding.  The following day, the staff member emailed the bank to query the position regarding the tracker rate mortgage.  The reply states that it is in reply to an email the staff member sent to a more senior person in the bank, that the staff member is on a fixed rate mortgage until a certain date in 2009, that the staff member's mortgage will then automatically revert to the staff tracker currently at 4.5%, and that they can let the staff member know at that time what the staff member's repayments will be at that time.  That issued from personal lending.</p> <p>  These are the guys in respect of whom the bank is still closing down the hatches and stating that they are not entitled to it.  The bank can provide us all this stuff about how it told them it was but it was a wee bit vague and then the bank clarified it a couple of weeks later, but there are internal documents here.  This individual reached out to the bank just to be sure.  The individual did so because there were options at that time for that individual to break the fixed rate and go on to a tracker, which was still available in the market but which would quickly be shut down.  The bank denied that individual and the other hundreds of bank staff members those opportunities.</p> <p>  I say this to Ms McDonagh.  We need to get to a point when we are talking about other issues in banking, such as the business towns initiative.  I am sure she would like to be talking about that.  In terms of support for the community, there are good staff in my local area.  We need to talk about issues such as how we look at the pillar banks but we will not get to that point because for four years with other bankers have told us blatant lies - their version of the truth.  We are only getting to this point.  For God's sake, Bank of Ireland came in here at one stage and told us there were 602 impacted customers.</p> <p>  I ask Ms McDonagh how long must we fight Bank of Ireland to get these extra two hundred customers their right, what they are entitled to.  I ask her to look at that.  She talks about being customer-centric.  No doubt this communication is vague in the extreme.  I would say it is clear that they were entitled to it.  This email is clear.  This email from the bank tells that individual the day after it sent out the original communication, when he clarified this, that his mortgage was moving to a tracker.  How can Ms McDonagh sit there and tell me that she will stand over that person not being deemed impacted upon, which means the person will not get his or her money back?</p></speech>

We have looked robustly at all of the staff who were impacted upon.  We believe we have done absolutely the right thing for our staff, past and present.  I do not know whether Mr. O'Beirne wants to comment further.  Without seeing the email the staff member sent internally, which I would be keen to have a look at, it is difficult for me to comment further.</p> <p>  We have set up clear communication for any customer or member of staff who feels that he or she is entitled to compensation redress but who has not been included, and we will look at those case by case.  I can only comment on individual cases if I see those details.</p></speech>

I am sure that this individual is not the only one and I am sure they have gone through all the processes within the bank.</p> <p>  Let me tell Ms McDonagh how I am 100% convinced.  Before Ms McDonagh's time, but only four months ago, bankers from her bank sat there when the chairperson questioned them.  At that stage, they were telling us that none of the 1,850 customers would be deemed impacted.  The chairperson went through line by line, with Mr. McLoughlin, how the bank could verify that, how the committee that was set up scrutinised all the work, and how that committee was independent, etc.  The reality is we just must keep on pushing and the bank will finally accept what should have been accepted a long time ago.</p> <p>  We are coming to the end of this process but there is much still to be done until we get there.  The bank has a responsibility.  If Ms McDonagh wants to talk about the culture of the bank, she should not be tarred with the culture of the bank that she joined.  This one, whatever about the rest of it, hangs on Ms McDonagh.  I plead with Ms McDonagh to do right by her staff, current and past, to deal with this issue compassionately, as she talked about in her opening statement.  This is where the proof of the pudding lies.</p></speech>

I have given my personal commitment to resolving this.  We have gone through the detail with the team with a clear customer focus.  I believe that we included every customer we need to include.  If there are individual cases where the borrower feels that is not the case, we will look at them.</p> <p>  In reference to a previous representation from the bank at this committee, the Deputy referred to transcripts.  I refer to the transcripts of that meeting in September 2017.  Mr. Liam McLoughlin was explicit, stating that the examination at that time was "It is not complete.  It is an ongoing review.  There are some [matters] still be addressed."  Those matters were the cohorts that were in debate.  That was an absolutely correct statement.  He also stated that the number of accounts affected may change, which, indeed, they have.  According to the transcript, what he stated accurately represented the position of the bank at the time.  That position, following more work, review and a mandate from the board to take a more customer-centric position, has changed, which, I think, is good and right.</p><p>We are working hard to close out all remaining issues.  We have looked very robustly at all cohorts.  If there are individual cases, I would be delighted to have a look at them.</p></speech>

I will ask the individual whether he will present the information to the bank.  However, there is an onus and responsibility on the bank to look at those couple of hundred staff members and ask the question again of itself.</p> <p>  My last question-----</p></speech>

Because Deputy Doherty has covered the ground comprehensively, I am not going to repeat the points but I want to support what he has said.  A commitment was given at that meeting of 21 September that the emails we referred to would be given to the committee.  In the reply on 22 November, Mr. Liam McLoughlin made no reference to that.  I think it is fair to indicate that the committee would support Deputy Doherty's position.  I think we should have a look at those emails.</p></speech>

For those who had an entitlement to a tracker mortgage and who would have fixed for a period, by the time the fixed period had expired, the tracker mortgage was no longer available on the market so they would have been offered a variable rate or to fix again.  If they chose to fix again, would they be deemed as impacted?  AIB told us they would be deemed as impacted because it had failed to offer them the tracker mortgage, even though it was not in the market, because it had a contractual arrangement.  Again, we have plenty of communication on this but a sample case is a customer of Bank of Ireland who took out a tracker mortgage with the bank in 2007.  It was clearly stated on the contract that it was the ECB rate plus 1.1%.  He fixed for three years and, when the three years was up, he was offered other options and he fixed again.  Others in the exact same scenario have spoken about this on <i>www.askaboutmoney.com</i>and all of this is publicly available.  When they got the letter of offer, they actually approached Bank of Ireland and said they were entitled to a tracker and then got a letter back from the bank saying it was sorry for the error and it put them back on the tracker.  These are probably some of the 20,000 Ms McDonagh talks about.  The bank was aware there was an error there but this individual, and many others like him who fixed for a second period, are now not being deemed to be impacted by the bank.  How could that be?</p></speech>

To the best of my knowledge, customers who followed that pattern are deemed as impacted.  It may be that I have misunderstood some of it but if we could get a copy of that individual case, I would be very happy to respond to the committee.  I want to make sure I have not misunderstood the circumstances of it.</p></speech>

Any customer who had a tracker mortgage who fixed for a three-year period and who was not offered a tracker mortgage at the expiry of the fixed period - whether that period was two years or three years is immaterial - is deemed impacted.</p></speech>

More than likely, however, at the second MFA, because trackers were withdrawn at the time, when they fixed for the second time, they would not have had that obligation.  That is what we are talking about here.  The reason they fixed the second time is because the bank did not offer them the option of a tracker.  Mr. O'Beirne is saying to me clearly that this type of cohort is deemed as impacted by the bank.</p></speech>

I want to add again to Mr. Mason that question on commercial trackers.  I ask that he would look at that again and give a comprehensive response, particularly in regard to the one case which is an example.  He might come back to us.</p> <p>  When the various rates were changed from one to the other - from a tracker rate and then back to a variable rate, or whatever it might have been - would it have been an individual decision to apply it, or is this something that happened randomly in different sections of the bank?</p></speech>

I refer to the deep dive review that is going on.  I would put that under the remit of the deep dive review in order to look at pricing decisions and where that could have been better and what we could learn from it.  That is something that is being incorporated and considered by the deep dive review.

I regret that there was confusion over the October meetings when we were first scheduled to appear.  There was a miscommunication and misunderstanding on our part.  I hope my presentation will provide a helpful picture of the broad SME environment and set the context for the question and answers session to follow.  The committee have seen the slides which I propose to go through and I will make some key points.</p> <p>  The first slide is from a publication we produce with DKM Economic Consultants.  It is designed to give the broad canvas picture for the SME sector, including how it is doing and what are the positives and negatives.  It covers 15 economic indicators.  We carry out this examination twice a year.  It gives a good backdrop which we share with all the business organisations.  The key points in this slide are that the majority of the indicators are positive for the SME sector.  Those are the green arrows indicating upwards.  Some of the arrows are red and are tracking downwards but that may have as much to do with seasonal factors as anything else.</p><p>I note a summary comment on the last report produced by Annette Hughes who said that with Brexit negotiations ongoing amid corporate tax proposals and developments in the USA, the Irish economy faces uncertain times.  Nonetheless, the report stated, the economy continues to perform well in terms of domestic demand, positive SME lending and production levels.</p><p> I will move to the next slide, which seeks to present the picture regarding access to finance, an area on which the committee has a particular focus.  This is a Europe-wide survey.  Interestingly, it shows that while access to finance is on the list of challenges for SMEs, it is not by any means top of the priority list for them.  As the slide shows, finding customers, the availability of skilled staff and competition in the market for the products and services they provide are the priority areas.  It is not that access to finance is not on the list but it is notably and considerably down the list of challenges and priorities.  It is also notable that the picture for the EU as a whole is broadly similar to what the survey shows for Irish SMEs.</p><p> The next slide shows the sources of finance for SMEs and the key message is that there is, again, a similarity between SMEs in Ireland and their counterparts across the EU area.  There is a focus on short-term finance, including overdrafts and credit cards, as distinct from longer-term bank loans.  This is something that it is important to note, as is the similarity in broad terms between SMEs here and elsewhere in Europe.  With the next slide, I seek to show the range of choice and service providers servicing the SME finance market.  At the top, one has the two quartiles which fully represent the banking sector.  All of the names there are members of our federation and household names in banking terms.  There are domestic and some international banks.  The lower quartiles are representative of the non-banking sector, but these finance-providing businesses and organisations play an increasingly important role in a competitive market.  The point to be drawn from this slide is that when we talk about competition and choice, we have to view things in terms of the part banks play and the role non-banks play.  Often, their roles are complementary and supplementary.  There is also some State funding, including the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Microfinance Ireland.  I will say a bit about that when we come to a later slide.</p><p> The next slide comes from another EU-wide survey that asked lenders about their expectations of where the demand for credit was going.  Over the recent quarters from 2016 into 2017, they have been saying they have the sense that over that period, there was an increased appetite for borrowing on the part of SMEs.  That would certainly have taken us up to the middle of 2017.  Expectations were that the demand for credit would rise and perhaps steady off somewhat.</p><p> The next slide shows what credit has actually gone into the marketplace using figures from the Central Bank.  The picture that emerges is that there was a significant increase in bank lending to the SME sector through 2016 and into 2017.  However, at the top of the tail, members will see a plateau and even a slight reduction.  These figures emerged from the Central Bank only a few weeks ago and they led analyst Conall Mac Coille at Davy to say this was not too surprising with business credit demand and sentiment surveys softening since the Brexit referendum in the UK.  As such, there is no getting away from consideration of the impact of the Brexit referendum.  The slide shows that the stock of credit outstanding is actually falling.  It is falling, not because more lending is not going on, but because of the rate at which businesses have been repaying debt.  This is the second, smaller graph on the right which shows a continuous increase because businesses are deleveraging.  They are getting debt off their balance sheets as much as possible because they want to get back to an even keel and a healthier state of affairs.  In fact, the latest figures show that the level of debt has fallen by 42% between December 2011 and June 2017.</p><p>The Central Bank also noted that the percentage of highly indebted SMEs, which used to be as much as 7.7% of the total SME population, has now gone down to 2.9%.  The picture of reducing debt levels is a healthy one.</p><p> At industry level, there are several factors which need to be considered when looking at the demand for credit.  There is uncertainty around Brexit and it appears to be impacting on business confidence.  I would not overstate it but it is a consideration.  In the years after the financial crisis, SMEs needed to borrow for just about everything, even for paying wages and day-to-day ongoing costs.  They have come through this part of the cycle, meaning that their demand for credit is not as pronounced as it would have been immediately after the crisis.  There is a nervousness about debt, a legacy of the financial crisis, even among those SME proprietors who were not exposed to debt.  Businesses have the cashflow and reserves on which they will draw.  While there is an uplift in the demand for and supply of credit, there are other factors at play which explain why there is a slight constraint coming into the market of which we need to be conscious.</p><p> Indirectly, the banking sector provides significant support through two organisations.  The Social Finance Foundation, entirely funded by the banking sector through a donation of &euro;25 million in 2007, supports community enterprises, community halls, sports clubs, cr&egrave;che facilities and so forth.  A subsidiary of this, Microfinance Ireland, gave &euro;18 million to 1,300 micro-enterprises between 2012 and 2017.  These are the sort of micro-enterprises that, for whatever reason, do not readily qualify for loans from mainstream banks.  While the banks might not always be in a position to support micro-enterprises directly, they can finance them through Microfinance Ireland.</p><p> As a representative body, it is not appropriate for me to talk about product pricing or interest rates, which are competitive issues.  Access to credit is a challenge to SMEs but it is not on top of the list.  The range of bank and non-bank supports is extensive.  When we look at competition and choice, we need to look at the broader canvas.  The demand for credit has been strong and significant until recently.  It seems to have plateaued.  We are all looking at trying to establish the reasons for this.  We have been talking to business representative bodies, along with the Credit Review Office and Mr. John Trethowan.  If there is a rationale for joint messaging to go out from all of us about the benefits of sensible and productive borrowing, we would be happy to subscribe to it.</p></speech>

In addition to this, it has a team of mobile business relationship managers who look after the more complex financial needs of business customers, largely around their lending needs and who visit customers at their places of business.  In addition to that, our branches are supported by two direct lending units, based in Kilkenny and in Dublin.</p><p>That facilitates customers in applying either over the phone or online at a time and a place that suits them, rather than having to make appointments to come into the branch.  </p><p> Bank of Ireland is the largest lender to the Irish economy, but in addition to lending, which is obviously an important part of funding businesses, it is important to make sure a range of funding supports is available.  Bank of Ireland is one of the largest investors in seed and early stage equity funds in Ireland.</p><p> In terms of changing how we approach our SME sector, we are responding to the changing needs of our customers.  Over the past few years, we have invested significantly in our external lodgement ATM network throughout the country.  That allows customers and businesses to lodge at a time and place that suits them, rather than having to come into the branch during their busy work day when they are meeting their own customers.  For customers with larger lodgements and larger cash requirements, we continue to provide an over the counter cash service in the majority of our branches.  </p><p> Customer behaviours are changing.  At this point, less than 3% of transactions are actually conducted over the counter in branches.  While much of that is consumer-led, from a business perspective, the percentage of transactions that are staff-assisted has reduced from 46% in 2014 to 28% now.  That continues to reduce on an ongoing basis.  </p><p> Contactless payments are a key development attributed to new technology.  The use of contactless payments has increased exponentially.  For Bank of Ireland last year, it increased by 89% year on year.  That has facilitated the removal of much of the cash and coin requirements from the market, especially for low value purchases and retail operations.  </p><p> In addition to the day to day branch services and physical lodgements, we are also investing in our online services.  Customers are dealing with their day to day transaction requirements very differently.  Our 365 online platform, which was originally developed for our consumer customers, has been made available to all business customers over the last few years.  For the vast majority of business customers, the payment functionality on 365 online facilitates all of their payment requirements.  For business customers with more complex payment transaction requirements, we have business online.  We reduced the cost of that service in 2016 to a flat fee of &euro;10 per month.  We continue to invest in different ways in terms of facilitating customers in their day to day transaction requirements.</p><p> Bank of Ireland recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of the economy and that the future of the economy is dependent on a successful SME sector.  In order to make sure we are providing the appropriate support to those businesses, over the past number of years we have recruited a team of sector experts from across industries.  These are people we have recruited from the sectors they work in and they are people who live and breathe their respective sectors.  They understand the performance of the sector from the operator's point of view as opposed to from a financial perspective.  That has given us a real insight in terms of what their business requirements are at the various stages of their development and how we can support them.  In addition to one to one meetings with customers, the sectors team also organises a series of seminars and workshops throughout the country, bringing other key stakeholders from the industry together and supporting them in terms of new opportunities developing in their sectors, helping them to advance their own businesses.  </p><p> In the fourth quarter of 2017, we hosted 26 Brexit-related events throughout the country which over 1,500 SMEs attended.  This was focused on advising SMEs in terms of the supports that are available for businesses which have to make contingency plans for whatever scenario Brexit presents.</p><p> Another key part of our overall strategy, and where we see the branch network as being very important to us, is our overall activity in the community.  Our enterprise programme and enterprise town activities have been very important in that respect.  I know that a number of members have been to some of those events, which are very much focused on bringing local communities together, allowing local businesses to demonstrate what they have available for their own community, and increasing commercial activity in those locations.  This will continue to be a core part of our strategy going forward.</p><p> We have also invested in a number of digital supports.  As an example, we have entered into an exclusive partnership with WebPort Global, a business which is focused on developing contacts for businesses which are seeking to expand into new countries.  Through its association with the World Trade Centre, it can provide Irish SMEs with the appropriate people to talk to in a new market.  At this point in time, that partnership has delivered over 1,500 new business opportunities across 78 countries looking to expand their markets, especially with Brexit on the way.</p><p>In addition to two incubation units in Dublin and Galway, we partner with a number of other startup initiatives throughout the country where we provide a Bank of Ireland community manager who works with those other units in developing plans and campaigns of activity for startups and supports.  We have dedicated spaces or work benches in a number of our branches.  This space is free of charge and businesses can base themselves there and network.  We run seminars, clinics and events to encourage innovation and new ideas among the start-up community in those locations.</p><p> Mr. O'Regan referred to access to finance.  In addition to a number of initiatives that we run ourselves to increase our own customer base, we actively support Government-backed schemes to increase the flow of funding to the SME market.  In terms of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, we have fully allocated our lending in the original on-lending scheme and last year's agricashflow scheme and we are working constructively with SBCI to ensure that the roll-out of the Brexit working capital loan is deployed as effectively as possible.  Microfinance Ireland, which Mr. O'Regan also mentioned, is an important supporter of microbusinesses in Ireland.  We refer business to it weekly where they are not suitable for bank debt at this point in time. </p><p> The credit guarantee scheme has been an important initiative in supporting businesses which perhaps did not have sufficient collateral or security to get bank funding.  We have actively supported this scheme and see it as an important support for the SME community.  We have worked closely with the SBCI in developing the new phase of the scheme, which is now ready for launch.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.425" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Moroney" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#S00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss AIB's support for SMEs in Ireland.  I am the head of business banking with AIB and I am joined by my colleague, Ms Margaret Brennan, head of SME sector strategy and specialists.</p> <p>  SMEs have played a vital role in Ireland&rsquo;s ongoing economic recovery, with small and medium-sized businesses now employing more than 900,000 people across Ireland.  As Mr. O'Regan stated, while there are still challenges ahead, Ireland is expected to remain one of Europe&rsquo;s fastest growing economies this year.   We are very aware that AIB&rsquo;s primary role in the economy is to support and facilitate our customers in dealing with both the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for them. </p> <p>  AIB has 2.3 million customers and we serve their needs through a combination of our people and our physical and digital infrastructures.  We consider both equally vital to our customers.  We have 275 AIB and EBS branches, 20 business centres throughout the country and a 24-hour phone and online banking service, as well as innovation centres and connectivity with the colleges - there are more than 19 of them - to bring the depth and breadth of that to our customers.  We also provide daily banking facilities to our customers through 1,100 An Post locations nationally.  This partnership infills our distribution capability.</p> <p>  I will briefly outline AIB&rsquo;s lending activity to SMEs.  We have approved a total of &euro;5.5 billion in new lending in Ireland in 2016, of which &euro;1.2 billion was to SMEs.  In the first six months of 2017, that lending increased a further 13% on the same period in the prior year.  These figures exclude all renewed loan facilities and renewed working capital facilities, so they are a benchmark of new term lending in support of Irish business growth.  I cannot discuss the full year figures to December 2017 because we are in a closed period.  Those are the figures up to as far as I can go, however.</p> <p>  Business lending, and business generally, is still largely relationship-driven in Ireland and we have recently appointed new heads of new business banking in each of our 19 local markets.  These are supported by dedicated teams of business advisers and relationship managers.  The idea is that we would stay close to our customers at their place of business.  To support our business customers and assist them with a detailed understanding of those businesses, we have many years of sectoral expertise and have recruited sectoral experts from industry.  They support the teams and our customers directly.</p> <p>  As a result of Brexit, last year we appointed 21 specialist SME Brexit advisers in the communities that we serve and we encourage our customers to be proactive about planning.  That is a big challenge for us.</p><p>In this period when we are not sure what will happen, we are trying to encourage them to take action where they can, particularly to protect themselves against currency movements.  We have a range of product types, time periods and price points to cater for their needs and risks, both fixed and variable.  Our business credit line is one of the most flexible and competitively priced working capital facilities available in the Irish market.</p><p> There has been a lot of talk about access to credit.  We have a 48-hour decision period commitment for all SME loans up to &euro;60,000.  This covers the vast majority of SMEs.  They can be guaranteed if they come to us with all of their information we will have an answer for them in 48 hours.  This is the commitment we give.  They can also access this online or over the phone as we have a full service suite.  We have also strongly supported Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland initiatives, those that have happened and the one that will be announced.  It is the privilege of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to announce it and it is working on the conditions.</p><p> It is important to mention our customers who are experiencing difficulty in their business.  Our absolute priority is restructuring their facilities so they can sustain viable businesses.  Our absolute commitment and number one priority where our customers engage with us is to support them back to viability and keep jobs in those businesses throughout the structure process.</p><p> In terms of the diversity of funding available in Ireland, which is receiving considerable attention, we invest in seed venture growth and capital investment funds, and we have &euro;161 million across 13 funds.  With those partners our play into those markets is a total of &euro;1.1 billion.  We have invested in 200 companies creating more than 3,000 jobs.</p><p> We published in-depth customer research at the start of 2017.  Originally we did this for ourselves to understand the blockages in terms of customers accessing equity as opposed to just senior debt on which the Irish market relies quite heavily.  We had some interesting findings, which I can discuss in the questions and answers.  One was a fear of losing control in the business.  In addition to providing equity we also provide tailored mezzanine finance.  This can often be the difference between making a project viable.  If the equity and senior debt is not sufficient, the mezzanine finance can often plug this gap.</p><p> We provide full in-branch cash and coin service throughout our entire network.  We do not restrict transaction types to specific days or times.  We offer highly competitive rates for cash handling, including the lowest price in the market for processing euro note cash.  Our customers tell us in our research that convenience is key and we work to help them to move towards digital payment methods, but this is a choice they make.  We do this through our online, self-service and paperless options, but they retain the choice and the cash option is still there for them.  In 2015 we launched a free business Internet banking platform to help encourage digital mobility.  Smaller businesses can manage their finances very effectively on line.</p><p> In support of start-ups, we offer maintenance and transaction free banking and zero cash handling fees to a maximum discount of &euro;100 per quarter.  We define start-up as the first two years of business.</p><p> Through this combination of people, accessibility, distribution and connectivity, and supported and enabled by our technological and online capabilities, we provide customers with a comprehensive choice of access and supports.  We look to bring decision-making and sectoral expertise close to the customers at their place of business.  Our commitment to our customers remains, genuinely, our top priority.  On behalf of the bank I thank the committee for inviting us before it.</p></speech>

As representatives of the banks, do they have any plans to increase the footprint or infrastructure of their branch networks, particularly in smaller rural towns and villages?  Following the financial collapse we have had the closure of lots of branches, of the main two banks in particular.  This has impacted many communities and businesses.  It was a source of much concern to us as public representatives, the banks' customers and people and businesses in communities.  Will the witnesses give us an overview of where the banks are with this?</p><p>On the mobile bank, as far as I am aware nobody uses it.  Perhaps the witnesses have figures to disprove the impression that I have that nobody, or very few people, use it.</p></speech>

We had to do that to ensure we retained our branch footprint and could continue to provide a service.  We continually review our branch footprint to see if we have appropriate representation.  On the question regarding rural branches, we have not opened any new branches in rural locations recently but we have opened branches in Grand Canal Square, Cherrywood and Ardkeen in Waterford and, as I said, we continually monitor our branch footprint.  We do not have any plans at this point to close any branches but we do monitor our footprint on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

In terms of our current footprint, our focus is on ensuring we are accessible everywhere.  In every town, we either have an AIB branch or an An Post presence, which also takes in cash and coin for our SMEs.  We have branches in 275 locations in Ireland and 1,100 An Post services.  We do not restrict any services.  Cash, coin and cheque services are available in all cases.  We have opened some new branches.  We have been focusing more on accessibility rather than new physical infrastructure but we have opened a branch in Little Island in Cork and several others in Dublin.  We have changed availability by installing lobbies and extending opening hours.  We also have mobile advisers and our direct services are available until late in the evening.  Interestingly, one of the most avid users of that service is farmers because they prefer to do their banking at home, which surprised us when we made that facility available to customers.  We monitor our services carefully.  We do not have any top trending complaints from customers in regard to accessibility.  We provide a full service offering.</p></speech>

Behind that, we have a contract with An Post which is very sensitive.  Unfortunately, I am not able to disclose the split in relation to that contract.  We have agreed contractually with An Post that we would not discuss matters relating to the contact.  All AIB services are available through An Post.</p></speech>

We have not left any town.  We have only closed branches in large urban areas.  For example, in Limerick we had a branch located at 1-5 O'Connell Street and another branch at 94 O'Connell Street and we amalgamated them into one branch.  Other branch closures would have been in similar situations.  We have not left any location.  We have undertaken branch amalgamations rather than closures.</p></speech>

Where we have closed those branches, we applied "close proximity" in a lot of cases.  For example, we have a branch which is less than 1 km from Crumlin while in Dun Laoghaire we had two branches which were less than a couple of hundred yards apart.  For the most part, it was because AIB was created by the amalgamation of two banks, the Munster and the Leinster, and we had a lot of duplication in towns.  In advance of the process, we put in place our contractual relationship with An Post.  While we closed 70 branches, we opened 1,100 locations for our clients.</p></speech>

I do not wish to pick on Ms Moloney; it just happens that these are the statistics.  I ask her not to take this personally.  I see in the statement that Ms Moloney says business lending and business generally is largely relationship driven.  That is not my experience from talking to people in small businesses.  In my experience, the banks have withdrawn from their relationships significantly.  When one hears that 70 branches have closed, it does not suggest the business is relationship-driven.  I suspect that it is a lot less relationship driven, in particular in rural locations and often at the expense of rural customers.</p></speech>

The net promoter score of AIB has risen significantly recently.  We have put our relationship heads of business banking and heads of home out into the community.  Last year, alone we appointed 19 in every area and we have relationship teams in place there which are dedicated to our customers.  We have standards around that in terms of their accessibility.  There are two sides to that.  One is what I will call a "transactional relationship" in terms of being able to step into an AIB environment and transact, which can be done in person and online.  There is then the piece involving advice which creates a requirement for business advisers.  We track that and the feedback we get from our clients.  One of the things they talk about is the speed of decision-making but they do not tend to talk about not being able to get our people.  They are present and available.  We are coming through a journey where, speaking very frankly, we have had a number of years in which some of those conversations have been very challenging for customers.  Customers in difficulty have 1,500 people behind them.  It is a whole resource specialist expert area.  That is very much all around engaging and bringing them back to viability.  At the front end, our business is fully resourced from a relationship perspective.  We watch the complaints from our SMEs very carefully and it is not trending as a key issue for us.</p></speech>

I will move quickly to questions.  These are the things small businesses have raised with me.  It is probably the smaller businesses that have raised issues with me, for example corner shops and pubs which are still finding it challenging to do business.  One of the issues raised seems like a simple one in many ways but it points to how precariously some businesses are operating.  I refer to access to the lodgment of coins and the cost of that.  There are only specific days on which the bank will accept coins.  Some small businesses have pointed out to me that they can make lodgments on only two days a week in some branches.  That in itself has an impact.  A more recent issue pointed out to me relates to overnight lodgments or the "night safe".  There is a longer delay with an overnight lodgment compared to a lodgment which is made in the bank in person the following day.  Pubs in particular have pointed that out.  It has led to them keeping cash overnight rather than using the night safe as they have to meet wages as they come up and so on.  It may be a very specific and small area.  I am not sure how widely the issue affects businesses.</p> <p>  Has anything been done to analyse interest rates for small and medium businesses compared to our European partners?  Do we pay lower or higher interest rates in Ireland?</p><p>There seems to be a gap between deposit interest rates in Ireland and the interest rate charged to businesses.  That gap appears to be larger in Ireland than it is in the rest of Europe.  Why is that?  Are we paying for the sins and mistakes of the banking sector?  Is the bank trying to right its books by charging higher interest rates to small and medium businesses as well as larger ones?</p><p> I turn finally to risk analysis on loans.  Is there grading in relation to risk analysis on the interest rates charged by the banks?  If there is a higher risk, is there a higher interest rate and, if the risk is lower is the rate lower?  What is the grading in the context of that risk analysis and what are the interest rates?  I can see that there is not much of a gap between the products the banks offer.  There are more lead-in products, but over a period of time, things very much even out.  I may have the wrong sense, but is there a lack of competition between the banks in front of us today?  Their interest rates seem to be a little on the higher side compared to mainland Europe.</p></speech>

Who would like to start?</p></speech>

I start with access.  I can state categorically that we do not restrict cash or coins to times of the day.  When we are open, we accept notes, coins and cheques.  That is our principle and that is what the branches are for.  That is a fact.   I will say that we also have night safes.  There is a payment services directive and we have a point in the day after which the same-day services payments do not happen.  It makes no difference whether one puts it into a night safe or comes into a branch, one gets the value.  We have night safe drops available for our customers in designated locations.  They are aware of those.  There is no restriction on days of the week.  When we are open, we are open.</p> <p>  We are experimenting with and have developed coin machines ourselves.  There is one in Naas and one in Blanchardstown.  These are experimenting with taking coins at other hours and in other ways from our customers.  That is in addition to and not instead of the availability of over the counter services.  I think I have answered all of the questions in that regard.</p> <p>  I think the Senator wanted a comment on the price of daily banking.  To make an overall statement, it is a very cost-heavy business.  We seek, overall, to break even in that business but we provide the most competitive price for cash and coin in the Irish market in AIB.  I will take any other questions the Senator has on that, but that is the overarching principle.</p> <p>  I move to interest rates.  I might start with deposits because the Senator asked about both sides of the book, deposits and-----</p></speech>

I might be out by a basis point or two, but in the past day or two it has been approximately -44 basis points.  As a principle, we have decided not to charge our customers for that.  We absorb the cost.  We have very low 0.0 percentage rates on demand deposits, which go up slightly.  They are not very high-earning accounts, but equally we do not charge customers for the privilege of leaving that money in a deposit account safely.  The exception is in circumstances where someone comes to us outside of relationship banking.  If a very large corporate came to us to put &euro;20 million on deposit, it would be a one-to-one discussion.  Clearly, it would be very expensive for us to hold that on our books.</p><p>We do not charge for all small and medium enterprises and businesses in Ireland.  That addresses that side of the balance sheet. </p><p> On the loan side of the balance sheet, I will start with the comparison with Europe and then move to Ireland.  It is difficult to get international comparisons for this.  I will use Germany as an example and then move to our own specific price points.  I will speak about Germany's general lending rate.  I say "general" since the Senator mentioned credit risk himself and there are different credit risks in time, length of working capital and whether it is committed-----</p></speech>

The current German bank lending rate to customers, in Deutsche Bank, is 2.5% for one to five years, and 2.8% for one to three years.  It is just under 3%.  I will say at the outset that European banks, in their bank lending rates, do not include all of their charges.  European banks have a tendency to charge arrangement fees and administration fees on top of the margin.  That is certainly not a practice in AIB, except for very large numbers, for example if somebody was financing a bridge and &euro;200 million was involved.  We do not charge arrangement fees for the general customer.  That is quite a significant difference when APRs are compared as opposed to interest rates, which is the all-in cost.  Taking it from there and taking it that German rates for customers are just under 3%, we have a series of published rates and negotiated rates for bigger ticket loans.  That will reintegrate in a moment.  This is a sensitive area because it is competitive and, therefore, I will stick to the average banded rate.  The average banded rate on our book - the factually correct one, checked by our finance unit - is 4.75%.  It is more expensive than the European market.  I will come back to the reasons for that in a moment.  That is the average.  There are higher rates.  The negotiated rate is lower than that.  By negotiated, I mean that when numbers move from &euro;30,000 to &euro;50,000 and to over &euro;300,000, there will be a higher rate.</p> <p>  Before I move on from Germany and to our own book, German businesses tend to be larger than ours.  Europe defines a small to medium-sized enterprise and we use this in some of our reports.  A company with a turnover of less than &euro;50 million and an asset base of &euro;43 million would be considered very large here.  A good parameter in the SME code in 2015 went as low as &euro;10 million.  That was done to ensure that as many businesses as possible had the protection of the code.  That net was, understandably, cast wide.  That moves to the issue that the cost of doing business in countries such as Germany, in reality, can be spread over bigger ticket deals and they get the negotiated blended price more often than we do.  I am trying to ensure that I cover all the Senator's questions.  I have covered deposits and lending, and I think that grading and risk analysis was his other question.  I should say, on the costs, before I finish, that other European countries are bigger so their operational costs are spread out.  Those margins are from before the cost of credit risk is taken, which is unfortunately higher here, and the cost of running the business.</p> <p>  We grade our book and it is an obligation with regard to capital rules to make sure that we grade our book.  That leaves both the regulator here and elsewhere on the prudential side in a position to be able to see the quality of the book.  That was a big lesson from the crisis.  While this is competitively sensitive, each bank would grade their books within set parameters.  There are scorecards which are constantly monitored in order to do that.</p><p>InnovFin recently looked at that for us across our book and benchmarked it against Standard &amp;amp; Poor's.  It is quite a robust grading.  That is used for a number of purposes, including the good management and functioning of the bank.  Secondly, it is used in pricing.  We try to use it in a way that is as fair as possible to the overall book.  For example, in that guaranteed position I mentioned of 48 hours for under &euro;60,000, we have both variable rates and a fixed rate of 6.95% because it is for very small loans.  The smaller the ticket, the more expensive the loans since they are higher risk.  We try to blend the grading and give a simplified price point.  If businesses are looking for funds for 12 months or longer for that same size and moving up the size curve, we have a variable rate of 5.5%.  The customer can have a fixed rate if he or she wants certainty of payment or can stay on a variable rate.  Customers can come out of the fixed rate without experiencing great costs.  I hope that answers all the questions.</p></speech>

On the coin and the days of service, as I said at the outset, Bank of Ireland has the largest bank branch network in the country.  We have not left the towns that we were based in.  To do that, we have had to look at how we provide that service.  We focus on making sure that we can provide the day-to-day transaction requirements as efficiently as possible and free up the time of people who work in the branches to spend it talking to customers about more complex financial needs such as lending requirements and so on.  That has been the focus of our strategy.  That means we have changed how we provide some services in branches.  At one point, we had a trial of having the full cash offering on certain days.  That has been changed in those branches so that it is now an all-morning service.  Customers said they would prefer to have it every day rather than on specific days but with limited hours.  That is generally working well in those branches.  We also have branches which provide full day-to-day transactional banking throughout the day.</p> <p>  I am not aware of specific issues with delays in lodgments to night safes being processed.  If there are specific cases, I would be happy to look into it afterwards.</p> <p>  A number of points about interest rates have been covered already.  Deposit rates are very low in the Irish market.  When we look at our cost of funding to fund lending, all sorts of finance is brought into that.  Deposits and credit balance sitting in people's current accounts is part of that source.</p> <p>  The point about fees being the European norm is also relevant.  Arrangement fees and administration fees are more standard in Europe than in Ireland.  Loan tenors are very different.  In Ireland, a commercial mortgage debt could have a term of seven to 15 years, while the average in Europe is far shorter.  When fees are paid at renegotiation, that adds to the overall cost but when one looks at the banner headline interest rate, it is quite a bit lower.  A key point for the Irish market is that the financial crisis in Ireland was far more severe than in most parts of Europe.  That has impacted on the credit history on the books.  From a regulatory and ECB perspective, the capital requirements relating to what we have to hold as a bank against our lending is substantially higher than it would be in most parts of Europe.  That adds to the cost of providing credit and has an impact on those interest rates.  In summary, on the interest rate side, we looked at Europe to see what the key differences are and what we can do, but it is born of a number of features of the Irish market that are different to Europe.</p> <p>  On the risk analysis of rates, aspects of this are commercially sensitive but for larger facilities, every case would be assessed on its own merits and the risk rating attached to it would determine what rate would be available to that borrower.  It is done on a case-by-case basis.  There are more set interest rates for smaller businesses which depend on the nature of the facility being requested, whether tangible security was provided against it or it was an insecure facility.  All those features are taken into account when considering overall pricing of lending.</p><p>I have covered most of the questions; much of it was addressed in the original presentation.  </p></speech>

When we talk about smaller loans, especially in Ireland where we are particularly focused on smaller businesses, with fixed rates of 6.9%, 7% or 5.5%, it is accepted there is not a lot of difference between the banks.  AIB answered that question specifically so I am asking Bank of Ireland.  That is generally the percentage rate.</p></speech>

The access to Central Bank funds is an issue.  I accept the bank is penalised for lodging money to the Central Bank.  The cost of doing business is quite high for small businesses at the 6.9% and 5.5% rates.  I would like to see more analysis of what is deemed to be a small loan.  A small loan is probably penalised at the higher rate.  The fixed rate is 5.5%.  Will the witnesses provide more analysis in this regard to the committee, not today but at a later stage?  For shops, pubs and small enterprises trying to get off the ground, paying interest rates of around 7% is quite difficult.</p></speech>

What exactly do they do?  What was the idea behind employing them?  I was talking to InterTradeIreland this week.  It has surveyed all the businesses, which it does on a regular basis.  In the last survey, it found that 98% of businesses were not prepared for Brexit.  What do the 21 advisers the bank has employed do?  Are they new appointments to the bank or are they people who have been transferred internally?</p></speech>

They were people who were keen to do it and had an interest in it.  By way of backdrop, we fully trained them.  It is not that businesses are unaware of Brexit.  It is that they are not sure what they have to do yet.  We have a Brexit sentiment tracker to track the sentiment of our customers.  We have done two of them now.  They have told us that in some cases businesses are saying they cannot get ready for tariffs because they do not know if they will apply or not.  They do not want to waste time and money on it.  They have not prepared for anything that has not happened yet.  A more immediate issue is that where they have currency exposures they are covering them.  Not doing something is the same as doing something in terms of taking a risk.  The Brexit advisers are doing a number of things.  Having been trained and appointed to the role, they are working with our relationship managers and customers to advise and encourage them to speak to us about covering their hedging exposures.  We have regular two-way briefs and updates with them.  They listen to our updates on impacts on particular sectors.  They give us feedback from the customer which means we stay close to the voice of the customer.  That feedback goes to our Brexit board to ensure we are aware of what is happening right at the coalface.</p><p>Their role will continue into this year.  We will have a number of events - we have had a number already - attended by several hundred customers around the country.  They will continue to support bringing these events out into the community to our customers.  The key thing is to be ready when we are aware of outcomes to know what the implications of these are for the different sectors and to be able to act with customers.  They are there in readiness for what is coming and to encourage customers to do what they can, in terms of their currency exposure.</p></speech>

First, welcome to you all and thank you for your presentations.  I am sorry I missed the beginning of Mr. O' Regan's presentation but I have his document here.  Banking is critical to our economy, critical to SMEs and critical to many of us in many walks of life.  However there are concerns about the cost of doing business in this country, and banking and the cost of finance is one of the major ones for most people in business.  I hope, with the Chair's agreement, that the witnesses would be open to coming back again to give us their view on what they see as the cost of doing business outside of their own direct remit.  I would like to hear what they have learned from their customers and the tremendous resource they have in that regard.  On the second page of Mr. O' Regan's document he states that access to finance is not a significant challenge for most Irish SMEs.  I wonder if we put the words &quot;affordable finance&quot; in there, how that would then read.  The document also states that Irish SMEs face a number of important challenges and access to finance is not prominent among them but I will come back to that.  </p><p>The Central Bank issued a report earlier today and some things jump out.  One is that SME loan rejection rates in Ireland have increased to 13.9% in September 2017 from 8.2% in March 2017.  Clearly those looking for loans are still having huge difficultly in getting them.  Interest rates - and this has been touched on by Senator Humphreys - for non-financial corporate loans, below  &euro;0.25 million stood at 5% in July 2017, that is higher than in comparator countries, while the interest rate gap between loans below &euro;0.25 million and loans above &euro;1 million stood at 2.9% in Ireland, which is also above comparator countries.  Issuance of new loans up to &euro;1 million expressed as a proportion of domestic demand was 2.1% in Ireland, as of quarter 2, 2017.  This ratio is considerably lower than EA2 comparator countries.  This would seem to indicate that access to credit for many SMEs in this country is a problem and that its affordability is yet another problem.</p><p>I wanted to make a few comments on some of the presentations.  AIB has already outlined how many branches have been closed.  I am very interested in its move to join forces with An Post to deliver services locally.  How will this work in terms of lodgments, loans, charges for services etc.?  I welcome the 21 Brexit advisers, but again I would like to raise one other issue.  We talked about Germany, in particular, and we spoke about European rates.  We can talk about Germany being a huge economy but there are many other smaller economies than ours in Europe.</p><p>Their rates are not as high as ours.  The explanations given do not necessarily stand up to scrutiny but we can return to that, and I would be glad of the witnesses' comments on it.  I do not have the figures for the smaller economies such as Luxembourg and Malta.  An issue that concerns me is the cost of overdrafts.  Many business loans run as overdrafts rather than loans and the charges here can be up to 15%.  These loans would be charged at around 3% in Germany.  That is a hell of a differential.  I will not go into the other areas because I am the last speaker and other people are waiting outside.  We are ten minutes over our time, but I would like a response to that.  There is a long way to go to further explain why our rates are higher than in other countries and why the increase in rejection rate to SMEs went up in the six-month period between March and September of last year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.479" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Felix O'Regan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#BB00200"><p>I do not doubt the figures from the Central Bank report today.  I have not seen those figures.  The ones I have brought along with me are from the SME credit demand survey which is undertaken for the Department of Finance.  There is one due out in about two months' time but the last one covers the period up to around the middle of 2017.  The rate of loan application decline was 11%, which is up marginally from 10% in the previous period.  We will wait to see if the Central Bank figure is reflected in this very specific survey which is designed to establish acceptance and decline rates.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Felix O'Regan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#BB00400"><p>Yes.  I can check and come back to the committee with information on the comparator for other European countries.  My sense is that a decline rate of 10%, 11% or 12% is not out of line with the European average but I am happy to come back to the committee on that.  I do not have the figures with me but I am happy to come back to the committee to see how they actually stack up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.482" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Lauhoff" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#BB00500"><p>The Senator covered a number of issues.  We did not see any material increase in decline rates over that period.  Not all businesses are credit ready.  We do not approve everything, for example if a business is pre-revenue or dealing with other challenges, but we certainly have not seen any material change in approval rates over that period.  With regard to the cost of finance and whether it is a prohibitive factor, the ECB carries out a survey of SMEs and in its most recent survey the cost of credit, or interest rates being too high, was a reason for less than 5% of businesses not approaching banks for credit.  The predominant reason for not approaching banks for credit was that businesses did not need that type of financing.  While I appreciate the point about Ireland's interest rates relative to Europe's, for which there are core reasons, it does not appear from the surveys we have seen to be a reason to stop businesses from borrowing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.483" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#BB00600"><p>According to a different section of the report that was given to me, the share of SMEs in Ireland reporting they did not apply for bank loans because of sufficient internal funding was 50.4%, which is about the same as in the rest of Europe.  That means that more than 48% do not have sufficient internal funding and have other reasons.  I find it difficult to believe that cost is a reason in only 5% of cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Lauhoff" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#BB00700"><p>I took that figure from the ECB survey.  There are other reasons.  That is why we are trying to work with customers to understand exactly what their requirements are and how we can provide the funding.</p><p>Rates of up to 15% were mentioned.  In general, our highest overdraft rate for businesses is just over 8% and it then depends on the size and scale of the business.  Overdraft usage has continually declined in recent years.  At this point, the percentage of overall overdraft usage is in the low twenties.  Among our SME customers as a general base, we see the cash generating ability of the businesses as very high.  When we look at credit balances, cash reserves and overdraft utilisation, they all point to significant reserves being built up by businesses and the use of some of these reserves for future investment.  We do not think this is the best way to fund future investment and it should be a mix of reserves and bank debt to ensure the long-term sustainability of the business, but overdraft utilisation has continually decreased since the financial crisis.</p></speech>

It has been stated it is not a significant challenge for most Irish SMEs and that it sits at approximately 8%.  We have had a series of meetings and many organisations have come before the committee, and that is not the reading we are getting.  My colleagues will agree with me that access to finance is an issue.  Do the witnesses have any figures on the percentage of SME loan applications accepted?  What are the main reasons, apart from the obvious, that loan applications from SMEs are rejected?  These are very valid points.</p> <p>  My next question is for Mr. Lauhoff.  He mentioned Brexit working capital loans, and Bank of Ireland has been allocated &euro;128 million.  I presume other organisations have been also allocated money.  Is it only SMEs exposed specifically to Brexit that can access this finance?  It is something the Government announced last year.  Are there very strict criteria for SMEs to try to avail of this working capital if they are specifically exposed to Brexit?</p></speech>

The aim of this facility is to support businesses in the context of Brexit, and it is available where businesses are looking to expand their markets or are negatively impacted.  From our engagement at this point, I believe it is about how to support openly rather than trying to be restrictive.</p></speech>

We register them all.  On seeing the report this morning, I checked what our figures were up to that period, which is September.  I cannot go beyond December because we are in our closed period.  We still approve 96%.</p></speech>

Of loans granted, 92% are very small and micro.  Most of our ticket sizes are below &euro;30,000.  When one talks about the volume of ticket sizes, the value will skew that, but the figure I am giving the committee - approval in 96 of every 100 cases - is across the whole SME book, if that helps.</p></speech>

I think he was talking about the approval rate, which we have just discussed.  One thing I will add to that, if I may, is that the credit demand survey to which Mr. O'Regan referred has a comment in it, as I recall, to the effect that the portion of credit from the pillar banks was down from 88% to 75%.  This would indicate that there are more players in there, and that might be changing the dynamics and the statistics.  That second comment is an extrapolation on my part, but that mix is changing slightly.  Going back to the pie chart shown at the beginning showing the other players coming in, the other thing the credit demand survey told us is that in that six months to March 2017 the demand was still there but it was at 20%, whereas it had been at 26%.  That is what that demand is telling us, and when that is combined with everything else - I am now addressing the demand, as opposed to the access question - it appears certain things have impacted it.</p> <p>  I wish to add to the Brexit question the comment to which Senator Reilly referred earlier.  The percentage surveyed that had experienced an increase in their turnover was 42%.  This indicated that increase in turnover was flowing into their cashflow, so their use of working capital was not as acute.  They were coming back into a healthy position in their cashflow.  The question of a market dynamic should be added to that conversation.</p> <p>  The Senator's next question concerned overdraft rates.  Our overdraft rate for businesses is 7.85%.</p></speech>

One thing I will say to the Senator about those overdraft facilities, and I would like to say this about Europe as this is really important from a European and an Irish perspective, is that in Ireland - we are part of this as well, so I am not saying this only concerns SMEs - we have a huge appetite for the use of overdraft facilities, much more so than the rest of Europe.  It is very flexible, it is understandable, it is there and one does not pay for it when one does not use it, even though we have to keep the capital so we must assume it will be used at some stage.  However, one only pays for it when one uses it.  The committee displayed a chart earlier that showed the use of trade credit in European and other countries.  They have a much stronger propensity to use revolver-type and trade-type facilities.  We have a farm credit facility to help with stocking and IPF facilities.  I quoted an average blended rate of 4.75% earlier.  Some of those rates are competitively sensitive and to the benefit of the customer.  They are all below that average blended rate.  We are trying to encourage our customers to use those working capital facilities to manage both the cost and their cashflow and to be less reliant on the overdraft.  The overdraft is an option that is there if they need to use it.</p> <p>  It would not be the best advice to tell someone to use his or her personal account instead of his or her business account.  That just would not be good advice, but I think-----</p></speech>

It should be remembered that we accept cash and cheques in all our facilities at all times of the day, and then the post offices accept cash from us everywhere and cheques in 115 of their locations.  I think the Senator asked a question about the price as well.  It is the same price to the customer.  If our customer lodges in An Post or AIB, it is the same price and it comes through us.

It is an issue that obviously causes the borrower a lot of grief.

Can the witnesses tell the committee the number of loans to SMEs that have been sold to vulture funds to date?  What is their present policy?  Are they still engaged in selling some of their loan books which are SME-related to vulture funds?  Do they engage with the borrower in advance of the sale?

It is not something we have used as a method for reducing non-performing exposures, so the answer is "none".  We have worked extensively with businesses that have had their debts sold by other institutions to try to help refinance them into more sustainable debt positions and to fund those businesses into the future.  However, we have not sold any loans to any other providers.</p> <p>  Regarding businesses with legacy debt, our primary focus with any business is on trying to bring that debt back down to a sustainable position.  This means working with customers to understand assets that may not be core to the business and agreeing milestones with them for the disposal of some of those assets, lengthening the terms on facilities but working with them on a case-by-case basis to understand what is that sustainable level of debt that the business can carry into the future and putting a structure in place that they can deliver on to get there.</p></speech>

As both banks have said, they are accepting the vast majority of loan applications, but it is important to note that even where loans are declined by mainstream lenders, there is a system whereby that customer can be referred to Microfinance Ireland.  Microfinance Ireland provides loans of up to &euro;25,000 and, as one of my charts showed earlier, &euro;18 million has been lent over the past five years.  It is often the case that some of that lending is supplementary to the banks.  In other words, the bank may tell the borrower it is not prepared to give him or her 100% of what he or she wants but it will co-fund and co-finance the borrower in conjunction with MFI.  That is just a point in support of the bigger picture of banks and non-banks frequently working together in support of the SME borrower.</p><p>We have not sold any SME loan to any equity fund.  We had one sale of a buy-to-let portfolio, and that comprised debts that were not engaging.  To come back to the question on legacy debt, our primary priority for our SME customers, and for all our customers, is viability.  We have full documentation on the Internet to help customers understand the journey.  Our first request of them is to engage with us and give us full disclosure, and our first priority is to see them back to viability if it is a business.  I am speaking specifically about SMEs, and it is the same for personal loans.  Our first priority is to get back to viability.  We have not had any sale to any equity fund on the SME side.  We do everything we can and it is never too late.  Even if customers are getting to a point where they have not been engaging and other action has to be taken, at any stage in the process they can come back and re-engage and we will work with them.  We have restructured 20,000 SMEs at this point.</p></speech>

The Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, represents 260 credit unions in the Republic of Ireland which have more than 3 million members.  For the ILCU this engagement today is timely and important.  Under existing legislation and regulations credit unions can lend to SMEs and many credit unions already provide such credit.  Increased levels of business lending, together with more lending for home loans and investing in social housing was the essential new direction we determined to embark upon in 2015.  They were among the very short list of key specifics we spelled out in our Six Strategic Steps policy document before the last election.  That document was and is our platform for policy and regulatory change.</p> <p>  On lending to SMEs, and because of the priority the league attaches to the sector, we developed a detailed SME Lending Proposal, published in 2016.  We are here today with that thought-out plan, and with the ambition to deliver on it.  Our policy proposal is based on the fact that credit unions have a footprint across the country.  We have members&rsquo; funds on deposit available for new forms of lending.  Our vision for credit unions, as banks retreat from a physical presence in communities and as key decision makers become ever harder to access in person, is for a democratic, volunteer-led, community-based, highly professional and financially prudent credit union movement.  It is one where you can meet face to face with the person you need to see.  It is a dynamic resource for development in local communities.  Credit unions are there for people and provide the very smallest loans for the neediest, home loans for the house one's family will live in and business loans for the enterprise people make their living from.</p><p> Credit unions are not a separate enterprise that has an office in the community.  We are a community who save and borrow together.  Our money does not come from the markets but it is loaned on trust from one to another.  That common bond, which defines each credit union community, is our essential characteristic and our underlying discipline.  It is also our essential legal framework.  Our proposal on small and medium enterprise, SME, lending reflects that.  We are very encouraged that the committee members' colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach in their report on the review of the credit union sector last October strongly supported the common bond.  As credit unions we are determined to change our business model but we are also determined to keep our credit union values.</p><p> Our proposition is that credit unions, regardless of size, would participate in a State-backed vehicle that would enable a national network of credit unions to act as an efficient distribution network to originate SME loan applications.  It would enable credit unions to invest in a funding facility that will lend to SMEs across Ireland.  This would marry the local network and the local knowledge of credit unions with the expertise needed for business lending on any scale.  It would ensure access locally and it would ensure prudential lending.  It would ensure that this expertise would be available through a State-backed investment vehicle to all credit unions, regardless of their size.  Our submission to the recent Central Bank consultation paper on credit union investments included this proposed model.  Credit unions are community-based and this model is pro-community and pro-business.  To ensure that a start is made, we also propose that this scheme could be piloted with a small pool of well-capitalised and large credit unions at the outset.  We are principled about what we want to do and we are practical about how we go about delivering it.  Our vision for SME lending also includes agri-lending.</p><p> Given the economic importance of SMEs to the overall well-being of the economy, credit unions have a strategic interest in supporting the sector.  Commercial lending is by nature more risky than personal lending so the formation of a centralised vehicle to lend to the SME sector would enable a stronger centralised risk management capability.  It would be the means whereby dedicated and skilled resources to identify, access, measure and manage credit and operational risks could be brought to bear in a cost-effective way.  It would facilitate credit unions supporting the commercial loans market and it would do so in a manner that provides robust mitigation against risk and, above all, protects members' funds effectively.  This proposal would enhance competition in the market and deliver on this committee&rsquo;s objective of addressing "the cost of doing business".  It was sent to all Oireachtas Members and relevant Departments; the challenge now, and it is a political challenge, is to move on from support in principle to concerted action.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.549" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#JJ00200"><p>We are grateful to the committee for inviting us to discuss our perspective on the scope of credit unions to take an enhanced role on lending to SMEs.  We will discuss our views on the extension of their role in the area and give proposals on how credit unions can engage to a greater degree with small businesses.</p> <p>  The Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, was incorporated in 2002 and currently has 48 of the most professional progressive credit unions in its membership, which in turn manage approximately a third of the total Irish credit union assets of &euro;16.8 billion.  It is clear Ireland's credit unions are putting the recession behind them and continue to grow.  Our sector has undergone a period of massive consolidation, with more than 80 mergers completed during the lifetime of ReBo, addressing some of the larger scale issues that have been hindering progress.  That said, most credit unions are still too small in scale to develop their own unique products and marketing campaigns.  Hence, there is a need to collaborate to remain viable.</p> <p>  The years 2016 and 2017 saw a rapid increase in the level of co-operation between credit unions.  Co-operation initially focused on shared management service arrangements, such as regulatory compliance and risk management, but this has since expanded to the undertaking of significant projects supported by a full risk analysis that are enabling a more expedient regulatory approval process.</p><p>The establishment of the Solution Centre has come on the back of this work.  The Solution Centre is a not-for-profit hot house unit tasked with developing specialist products, supports and solutions for credit unions.  With 48 credit unions coming together under the Solution Centre umbrella, we now have a structure to enable credit unions to achieve their goal of continuing as consumer-owned co-operatives while delivering much-needed new products and services to members.</p><p> CUDA has two core ambitions for 2018.  The first is to increase collaboration between credit unions and the second is to help bring about some much-needed regulatory and legislative modernisation and enhancement.  The Solution Centre's first offering was its Facebook digital loan service, which saw participating credit unions experience a ten-fold increase in their interaction with younger adult members.  Loan applications through social media now account for up to 20% of all loan inquiries for some credit unions.  Since the Solution Centre launched its mortgage solution in the middle of 2017, almost &euro;20 million in mortgage lending has already been processed, with &euro;9 million drawn down and a further &euro;11 million in the pipeline.  Volumes are expected to grow significantly in 2018 as an increasing number of credit unions sign up to the service.  Recent research indicates that over 59% of credit union members and 38% of non-credit union members would consider switching their mortgage to a credit union if a better deal was offered.  Another example of what can be achieved through collaboration is the excellent Cultivate initiative, which was commenced by four Galway credit unions and provides short to medium-term loan opportunities built specifically around the growing needs of their farming members.  The Solution Centre was delighted to be able to contribute to its development.</p><p> A report compiled by the Commission on Credit Unions in March 2012 recommended that credit unions with the correct business model could deliver lending to the business sector.  The introduction of proportionate regulations in 2018 as set out by the commission allows for credit unions to develop and offer a greater range of services to include SME loans and mortgages, with only those credit unions with the necessary expertise to manage the additional inherent risks being permitted to engage.  Many credit unions have a significant appetite for alternative lending and investment products and under the right conditions they would welcome the opportunity to lend to small and medium enterprises.  Credit unions are financially strong and have excessive liquidity holdings.  They also have an in-depth knowledge of their communities and local businesses, as well as a strong understanding of the risk profile of members.  In tandem with the accompanying management and advisory support structures that the Solution Centre has to offer, there are numerous credit unions throughout the country that could provide viable business loans to SMEs in the region of &euro;10,000 to &euro;50,000.</p><p> Support such as underwriters with specialist training in SME lending, staff with detailed knowledge of business planning and financial risk analysis, as well as a variety of other dedicated resources and expertise, could serve to protect credit union loan risk.  A small number of credit unions already have this expertise in-house and the Solution Centre is positioned to provide support to those that do not.  We firmly believe the provision of direct SME loans should only be considered by credit unions that have access to appropriately skilled resources and risk assessment procedures.</p><p> There are several factors that prevent SME lending by the wider credit union sector in this country.  Some credit unions have had negative experiences in business lending, especially with start-up enterprises, which are regarded as highly specialised and a high-risk area.  The Solution Centre is planning to develop an SME framework of policies, borrower documentation and various other requirements to ensure credit unions conduct this business in a compliant manner.  This will be complimented with a range of training supports to enable credit unions with the financial and operational abilities to do so more SME business for themselves.</p><p> We were pleased to gain some amendments for credit unions during the consultation on the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013, with section 48 relating to lending to small and medium enterprises, as we work our way through developing the SME lending framework we are encountering potential legislative and regulatory challenges.  For example, section 17 of the Credit Union Act imposes certain membership eligibility requirements.  The 2016 regulations impose concentration limits and section 6 of the Credit Union Act renders it impossible for credit unions to introduce business to each other.</p><p> Availability of locally based funding to SME and agri sectors is essential and credit unions are ideally placed to extend these lending facilities.</p><p>The Credit Union Development Association, CUDA, is very open to collaborating with any organisations that can assist with the upskilling and delivery of an extension of the role of credit unions in the area of providing credit to SMEs.</p><p> Once again, I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to put forward our perspective and we look forward to answering any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Demand for our loans is growing.  The same report of the Central Bank of Ireland shows that we have retained our 34% share of the personal lending market.</p> <p>  Commercial lending is a small part of our overall business, accounting for 1.3% of national credit union loans, that is approximately 0.4% of our assets.  It is worthwhile bearing that figure in mind in terms of the capacity of the credit unions.  Thus, there is significant capacity for expansion of this portfolio, given the right circumstances and conditions.  A number of credit unions are currently engaged in micro-lending and small-business lending on a local basis.  Some have engaged with local enterprise boards in the past in terms of advancing that objective.</p> <p>  In a credit union context, commercial lending is not as simplified as personal lending.  Funds are usually advanced as a personal loan, not as a loan to a limited company.  SI 1 of 2016 limits the overall total of commercial loans to 50% of a credit unions regulatory reserve.  This would amount to approximately 5% to 6% of a credit union&rsquo;s assets.  Given that at present we have commercial loans to the extent of 0.4%, there is capacity for lending with the current constraints.  The statutory instrument specifies that a credit union shall only grant a commercial loan ... where a comprehensive business plan and detailed financial projections (supported by evidence based assumptions), appropriate for the scale and complexity of the loan, are provided and in place before granting the relevant loan.  This is a sensible perspective.</p> <p>  Commercial lending is possible, within a very clearly defined framework.</p> <p>  All credit unions acknowledge the complexity of lending to start-ups and SMEs.  We acknowledge that a very specialist skills set is required for commercial lending.  We, as ethical lenders, have a responsibility to lend responsibly, to ensure that our lending will deliver benefit rather than load an unsustainable burden on the borrower.  Many credit unions acknowledge that expertise in this specialist field is expensive, scarce and needs to be developed within our sector.  Whereas this expertise might be unaffordable individually, a combined approach to underwriting might be a solution, such as has been suggested by my colleagues.  The evolution of the Credit Union Service Organisations, CUSOs in the Republic of Ireland give cause for optimism in this area.  Co-operative collaborations between credit unions, where specialist skills are required, such as in mortgage underwriting, have evolved and are evolving.</p><p>Another example of a collective approach is provided by the Cultivate initiative that involves credit unions in Ballinasloe, Gort, Tuam and Loughrea.  The initiative offers farming loans, as referenced by my colleagues.</p><p> Some credit unions have advanced the opinion that SME lenders want more than just credit and seek current account, overdraft and other facilities that are now beginning to emerge in credit unions.  Aside from the considerations that have been outlined already, it should be noted that credit unions have been excluded from State and European initiatives such as the European Progress Microfinance Facility, which is called progress microfinance and was launched in 2010.  Credit unions did engage but were denied access to the scheme.    </p><p> In conclusion, credit unions are engaged in relatively small scale commercial lending at present.  If the considerable funds of credit unions are to be made more readily available for commercial borrowing purposes, lending to limited companies would have to be addressed, credit unions would have to evolve more sophisticated underwriting systems, which I believe they are up for, and possibly on a collaborative basis, and incentive and facilitation schemes hitherto restricted to banks would have to be extended to credit unions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Boland" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#MM00200"><p>I thank the committee for inviting Irish Rural Link and Sparkassen to address it on the cost of doing business in Ireland.</p> <p>  Irish Rural Link is a national network of rural community groups.  It represents over 600 community groups and over 25,000 individuals who are committed to creating socially, environmentally and economically sustainable rural communities.  As such we are well aware that SMEs and micro enterprises are the back bone of rural economies and a valuable employer.  We can also attest to the fact that the impact of the recession is still being felt in many rural areas, which have not seen the same level of economic growth or employment as urban areas have enjoyed over the past couple of years. </p> <p>  Recently, we submitted a submission to the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, which is attached to the documentation that we have supplied to the committee for today's meeting.  In our submission we highlighted some areas that we have identified as contributing to the difficulties of business and thus the cost of doing business in rural Ireland.  We are cognisant of the broader issues related to costs such as rates, planning permission, utilities and a lack of broadband and we are active in many of these areas. </p> <p>  Irish Rural Link has also focused on the area of access to finance.  We have come to the realisation that Ireland should examine the feasibility of providing a regionally based public banking model.  In that sense, we have invited the Sparkassen Foundation to work with us to design a model which is based on the hugely successful Sparkasse model of public banking in Germany. </p> <p>  As the committee may be aware, last year we actively participated in the investigation into this model that was jointly carried out by the Department of Finance and the Department of Rural and Community Development, a report on which is due to be published soon.  We believe this model of regionally based banks will help to address the direct costs incurred by SMEs when doing business such as interest rates and other charges.  Furthermore, we also see the reintroduction of a more customer focused relationship banking model that would reduce indirect costs for businesses.  For example, the time and effort that many small businesses expend in their efforts to access finance.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Harald Felzen, who will outline the Sparkasse model in greater detail.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.556" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Harald Felzen" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#MM00300"><p>I thank the Chair and members of the committee for their invitation to attend.</p> <p>  As European project manager of the Sparkassen Foundation, I am very happy, together with Irish Rural Link, to outline how Sparkassen in Germany interacts with businesses, the range of services it provides to business clients and the distinctive elements of Sparkassen and commercial banks in Germany in comparison with Ireland. </p> <p>  Today, we will also discuss to what extent a common good oriented and local banking model could shift the dysfunctional Irish banking market, which would mean interest rates being between 2% and 3% higher than in the rest of Europe, towards a higher level of competition, and better services and prices for Irish customers.</p><p> Please let me emphasise that, based on our public service mission, a possible Irish Sparkassen model would not only have a banking role but a role to play in society.  In accordance with this mission, the success of a Sparkassen model in Ireland must be measured by its local social, cultural and common good impact, which goes far beyond the basic expectation of sound business management.</p><p> To avoid repetition, I will not go into too much detail about the general Sparkassen principle and will highlight the core elements of the Sparkassen lending principles, as requested.  Due to the time restriction I will focus on the salient points of our proposal that will contribute to the economic development of regions.</p><p> As one can see from looking at the chart shown on page 2 of my presentation, Sparkassen has a long-term commitment to the real economy and prevents credit crunches, which has proved particularly true in times of crisis.  The graph shows that Sparkassen increased its volume of new loans to enterprise every year from 2009 to 2015, inclusive, thus enabling the German economy to recover quickly.</p><p> The chart on page 3 is an excellent example of the counter cyclical impact of Sparkassen on the indigenous German economy.  The Sparkassen Finance Group has held a leading position in the German market for key business segments for many years.  For instance, the group is further expanding and strengthening its position as the leading provider of finance to German SMEs.   As many as three out of four enterprises in Germany are customers of the Sparkassen group.  This important role in the German economy is particularly striking when one looks at the segment of loans extended to craftsmen and tradesmen, as shown on the chart.</p><p> Decisions on business loans and risk assessments are taken locally rather than at distant corporate headquarters.  As their business area is limited to a clearly defined local territory, Sparkassen are encouraged to foster prosperity in that same region.  Let me clarify this in an exemplary way.  Normally, Sparkassen divide their business clients based on criteria such as turnover or liabilities.  Other segments also exist such as farmers, doctors or special trained staff in Germany.  The Sparkassen model represents a relationship-based banking model.  Our advisers are the main point of contact for commercial and private banking needs.  Our expert advisers provide professional support in both areas.  As members can see on page 5 of my presentation, it states:  "With the Sparkassen financing concepts, we systematically cover all levels of the financial hierarchy of needs."  We discuss the ideas of our customers in depth and examine each of their needs separately because we want to offer them a wide range of customised conventional financing solutions that fulfil their needs.  </p><p> Sparkassen in Germany accompany their corporate customers throughout the entire life cycle of their business and through the stages of set-up, growth, maturity, consolidation and succession.  Unforeseen developments, if any, must be identified as early as possible in order to allow greater options to take action.  The Sparkassen has a vital interest in keeping their business customers alive.  One can see on the next graph that once a problem is identified Sparkassen can pursue various courses of action.  Supporting our customers is always our first choice, which is quite evident because normally 50% of a company's staff are retail clients of Sparkassen with their mortgages, etc.</p><p> We have specially trained advisers, according to the Sparkassen Finance Group's concepts.  We have the capacity to deliver even more intensive customer support.  We also provide venture capital in the region because a person or group who wants to  start a business can present a detailed plan to the Sparkassen.  As a result of our commitment to the regional economy the Sparkassen are the real financers of venture capital projects in our region.  </p><p> The Sparkassen lending activities feature certain principles that limit risks.  Sometimes we are between the conflicting priorities of prudent loan policy and common good orientation.  Holding as much as 75% of the market share is clear evidence of our commitment to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>Working with the initial data, Sparkassen calculates customer interest over several stages, adjusting the risk accordingly.  For example, it is 1% with regard to a business loan of &euro;200,000 with maturity at five years and very good creditworthiness while good creditworthiness is about 1.5% and medium creditworthiness is about 2%.  Our rating procedures are influenced by four factors that are weighted differently.  They are quantitative factors, qualitative factors, warning signs and a joint liabilities scheme.  What is important for the committee's understanding is that every loan decision is made by a bank adviser, not by a rating system.  That is part of our relationship banking model.  Very important in terms of reducing operational costs is the fact that ongoing workflow support by OSP-Kredit ensures that essentially all stages involved in a loan transaction are processed without any redundancy or media breaks.  </p><p> To conclude, members of the committee can see that customer segmentation, graduated levels of support, decentralised business locations, our holistic approach and the risk-mitigating lending principles are some successful elements of the Sparkassen model.  Distinctive elements relating to the Irish market are the focus on the regional economy, balancing growth with common good orientation, the added value for regional development, the fact that we are the pillar of the indigenous economy in Germany and the fact that the legal form of Sparkassen prevents privatisation, which is a crucial point in discussions about the Sparkassen model in this country.  In fact, access to finance for SMEs in Germany would be inconceivable without Sparkassen.  Sparkassen has been the most important source of finance for SMEs for many years.  </p><p> Nevertheless, Sparkassen is fully exposed to market forces.  It operates according to commercial principles and its survival depends on its intrinsic capacity to generate adequate profits to fund its business operations.  However, in order to maintain consistent services for its clients, Sparkassen does not strive for short-term profit maximisation as this may produce high risks in the long term.  Sparkassen is a local player with an in-depth knowledge of its customers based on its relationship-orientated, personalised advisory approach.  Sparkassen shows a long-term commitment to the real economy preventing credit crunches.  This is the reason we are deeply convinced that a Sparkassen model for Ireland could improve the banking landscape in terms of costs, services and, fundamentally, social responsibility.  I extend an invitation to the committee to visit Germany to get an insight into the real Sparkassen world.  </p></speech>

I thank Mr. Felzen for his presentation.  I apologise for the over-run earlier.  I thank the credit union movement for the assistance it gave me when I was a Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection.  Certainly a lot of initiatives we got off the ground would not have happened without the support of the credit union movement.</p> <p>  I will move to the euro and cent element of it.  The banks appeared before the committee earlier.  We spoke about loans to small and medium-sized businesses.  We were looking at variable loan rates of 6.95% and fixed loan rates of 5.5%.  They gave the German example, which involved a commercial bank with rates of between 2.5% to 2.8% for SMEs.  Mr. Felzen has given examples of between 1% and 2%.  I know the Sparkassen model differs from that of the commercial banks in Germany but can Mr. Felzen tell me whether there are any hidden costs relating to interest rates because we often need to compare like with like?  Are there any fees relating to arrangement loans or charges for borrowing other than the interest rate percentages because it is always a comparison?  When we talk about AIB and Bank of Ireland and compare interest rates on loans, they say there are many hidden costs relating to the European banks who charge arrangement loans and have hidden costs whereas Irish banks charge only interest rates on small loans.</p><p>Obviously, there are hidden charges on much higher loans.

There are very individual contracts which one must negotiate for business clients with a turnover of up to &euro;1 million or &euro;2 million but we have no hidden costs for SMEs.  The interest rates should give an indication.  It varies every day but it indicates where the differences lie between the Irish market and the German market.</p></speech>

It was pointed out by Senator Reilly with regard to the affordability of borrowing.  There is certainly a significant difference in affordability with regard to borrowing not just in rural Ireland but in urban Ireland.  With regard to access to borrowing for SMEs, affordability is very important.</p> <p>  My next question is general.  Only about 32% of the deposits held by the credit union of which I am a member are available for lending.  The sister credit union on the north side has a similar figure.  I think it has about &euro;273 million in an investment portfolio but only about &euro;186 million out on loan.  This is because of restrictions.  For the sustainability of the credit union movement, I believe there needs to be an expansion.  Sparkassen does not intend to go directly into the market but to support the credit union movement behind the scenes.  Could Mr. Felzen expand on how he sees that developing not just in a rural sense but also in an urban sense?  The two major credit unions in Dublin would be comparable in size to the old Trustee Savings Bank.  This is local, but is the credit union movement an area into which Sparkassen is thinking of moving?  </p></speech>

I suppose the average is that one third of the &euro;16 billion in credit unions is loaned out while &euro;10 billion or &euro;11 billion is not loaned out but is largely put into investments.  However, these are investments in a very narrow sense of the word.  They are really bank deposit accounts and Government bonds so they are very low-risk investments, hence the desire across the credit union movement to increase the amount of loans and the type of loans whether they be loans for SMEs, about which we are largely talking today, or home loans.  There are a number of new types of loans the credit union movement and individual credit unions would like to get involved in offering.</p> <p>  The last question concerned Sparkassen and how it intended complementing the credit union movement.  In respect of there being more banks and local banks, all of the problems with Trustee Savings Bank were probably related to Dublin and Leinster.  A similar situation occurred in Munster.  Building societies were another factor.  Unfortunately, all of those entities disappeared during the financial crisis.  </p></speech>

To be clear on that, all savings are available for lending.  It is just that, unfortunately, only 27% is out on loans so there is significant capacity to lend more.  As Mr. Farrell said, there is a huge appetite across credit unions to get more involved in broadening the offering, namely, building on the solid base of the personal consumer lending and prudently moving into home loans and more of the small business loans.</p><p> It was very interesting to hear Mr. Felzen's description of a Sparkasse.  To be honest, if the name was removed, he could have been describing the credit union movement here in Ireland.  He talked about having an economic role  in preventing credit crunches as well as a social role.  We should remember that throughout the domestic and global crisis we experienced, credit unions never stopped lending.  Their doors were always open.  We did not see the failure we witnessed in other parts of the financial services sector.  As the committee members know, credit unions are at the heart of their communities, and there is definitely an appetite to do more.  It is probably fair to say that only a small number currently have the expertise to immediately grow in this way.  This is why we feel we could start to develop those skills collaboratively, and move further into that area. </p></speech>

That equates to 1.3% of the current total loan book.  Without any change, that can be increased to between 5% and 6%.  That is more than a tenfold increase.  We have to develop the skill sets, and as my two colleagues have mentioned, we have ideas and there is movement towards that area.</p> <p>  There are other areas we need to look at.  All of the economy has not lifted at the same pace.  We need to look at the area of microlending.  That is pertinent to smaller industries and to credit unions' capacity to get into that area.  There is a lot that can be done.  I would ask the Government, the Department of Finance and our European partners to have more regard for credit unions where social lending schemes are concerned.  A lot of good was done by the enterprise boards.  We should consider the issue of the sustainability of new enterprises.  If one looks at the top reasons for new enterprises to fail within their first five years, one sees that they run out of cash, they do not have the right team or they lack mentoring.  My colleague from the Sparkassen foundation notes that it is about more than just money.  A bit more imagination is needed, not only in arranging how the money is given out, but in ensuring that the relationship with the borrower becomes more meaningful as time goes on.  </p></speech>

The distinctive element is that a Sparkasse is a common good-oriented bank, which is committed to the wider public, to all the people in the council.  Credit unions are member-oriented.  That is point important to understanding the roles of the Sparkassen and the credit unions.</p></speech>

For the first pilot Sparkasse, we need approximately &euro;15 million to &euro;20 million.  We have a comprehensive approach for Ireland in our proposal to Government.  This consists of eight to ten Sparkassen, and the initial cost is about &euro;200 million.</p></speech>

We need special legislation for a public banking model in Ireland.  If was  done, we estimate that we would need a minimum of 18 months to open the first branch.</p></speech>

Can the witnesses give us a general overview?</p></speech>

We really have been talking to a lot of people.  We are very pleased with that engagement so far.  We know there is a decision pending.  We believe there is a certain expectation for that decision to be positive.</p> <p>  We have always made this point.  Historically, the Irish banking system featured the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, and the Industrial Credit Company, ICC.  There was always room for that kind of banking in Ireland, even before the crash.  There is still room, because the current banking system is very homogenous.  In other words, if an applicant is denied a loan in one of the main banks, they will more than likely be refused in another.  In Germany during the recession, as the chart in the presentation clearly showed, when people received letters demanding payment they had the choice of going to Sparkassen.  Sparkassen took on many customers as a result.  Here, mortgage holders had no choice.  In fact, the first letter they received was from the vulture capitalist who suddenly had control of their loans.  We believe there is very good engagement.  There is a positive view from the Government on this, but we await its decision.</p></speech>

Can they give an indication, similar to that given by Sparkassen, of the differential on the rates a credit union could charge for a typical &euro;200,000 loan over five years?  We know the rates that the main pillar banks are charging.  What has to be done to unlock the money which could potentially be made available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.579" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#RR00500"><p>I will answer the query on the amount of money available.   Under the relevant regulations, the limit is set at a maximum of 50% of the regulatory reserve ratio, which is 10% of assets.  As such, the maximum amount available for lending is 5% of the total assets of the credit union movement, which is &euro;16.8 billion.  Interest rates are determined by each individual credit union.  They depend on the nature of the loans and the risks inherent in them.  At the moment, the nearest comparator is probably the product offering of the Cultivate scheme, which features a standard variable rate of 5.5%.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.581" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1421" speakername="James Reilly" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#RR00700"><p>After that introduction, I must welcome the witnesses warmly.  I attended the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach to hear from Sparkassen.  I also had the honour of addressing the Irish League of Credit Unions at their AGM a few years ago when I was a Minister.  I am a great fan of both, and I will lay that on the table at the very outset.</p> <p>  I will address the credit unions first.  Clearly, the witnesses see an opportunity here.  I know they are frustrated to have &euro;9 billion stuck in a low-return investment, and that they would much prefer to invest it in our communities where it can do social good.  I have a couple of direct questions.</p><p>I have read the plan, which shows how it would be progressed.  What do the credit unions see as the blockages and how do the representatives suggest that we as legislators address it?  What needs to change in order for the credit union movement to achieve what it wants to achieve?  Mr. Johnson spoke about the amount of funding available and 50% of lending that could be commercial, with 10% or 5% of assets of &euro;16.5 billion.  Perhaps he could give us the figure that he believes is still available to the credit unions under the current situation.  If he was able to release the &euro;9 billion, what it would mean for local economies?</p><p> On Mr. Felzen's comments, I wish to highlight that three quarters of enterprises in Germany are borrowing from an individual Sparkasse.  I am very impressed that this banking system came about even though Germany has come through 100 years of all sorts of ups and downs.  Ireland has had its troubles also, but in the overall scheme of things Germany has come through a lot more than we have in the last century.</p><p> What rate does the bank charge for overdrafts?  We all realise how competitive the Sparkassen rates are for loans.  They place in stark and poor contrast what the pillar banks are doing in Ireland currently by way of available rates.</p><p> My colleague asked about arrangement fees and Mr. Felzen said there were no such fees for SMEs for smaller loans.  Will Mr. Felzen tell the committee what the cut-off point is for that? Is it &euro;100,000, &euro;200,000, &euro;500,000 or &euro;1 million before an arrangement fee might be charged to a prospective borrower?</p><p> I am very impressed by the fact that Sparkassen branches in a region only service, lend and reinvest in that region.  This is really powerful.</p><p> I understand that Mr. Felzen had an excellent meeting this morning with Fingal County Council and Councillor Tom O'Leary.  The possibility of branches opening in Fingal to service two constituencies, Dublin-Fingal and Dublin-West, was explored.  Mr. Felzen also visited Blanchardstown.  There are 800 farmers in the Fingal area and many successful food enterprises, such as Country Crest, Keelings, Keogh's Crisps and so on.  The Sparkassen model would offer a huge opportunity for many of those who sometimes find the affordability of loans a challenge.</p><p> Mr. Felzen outlined how much it would cost to set up.  For approximately &euro;200 million, one could set up in the eight regions.  Is it true to say this could result in a &euro;2 billion financial injection into the local economies of the eight regions that are in scope?  Will Mr. Felzen explain the key services that Sparkassen would provide?  Reference was made to the central services provider and I presume the bank would have its own IT system also.</p><p> There was a lot of smoke and mirrors going on earlier.  I wish to return to an issue to which I previous alluded, namely, the Central Bank's SME report and other reports that are to hand.  The statistics are obvious.  SME loan rejection rates in Ireland increased to 13.9% in the six months from March to September 2017.  We have a problem even if others do not believe we do.  The interest rates in Ireland for non-financial corporation loans are at 5%, which is higher than in comparative countries.  We have already heard how the credit union would have to charge certain variable rates but I believe it is not inconsequential that these representatives are sitting beside each other as a group and that they are here together at the committee as a group.  I am aware that while they have their separate agendas they are similar, but just with a different way of doing business.  Perhaps there is room for exploration there.  Notwithstanding this, I believe that if the answer is affirmative and that if Sparkassen - which has 100 years of experience in assessing loans - operated in Ireland, in two years there could be &euro;2 billion extra in circulation for SMEs.</p><p> I especially like the fact that there is a lot of mentoring and supervision going on, and not in an intrusive way, so the bank can see the red flags if people are getting into trouble.</p><p>That was a lot of our problem during the financial crisis.  We are not here to beat up our pillar banks by any means but there certainly was a commission-based performance culture.  The more the banker lent, the more commission he or she got.  I do not know that the same level of detailed supervision was in place that would be in place at Sparkassen banks or the credit unions.  I would welcome that aspect.</p><p> Our local SMEs who are the driving force in Ireland's economy could really benefit by the presence of the Sparkassen model in this State.  It would loosen up the arrangements without jeopardising financial stability for the credit unions.  It would allow the credit unions to use money that has been gathered from the local community, which would be delighted to see reinvested in the community.  When I was the Minister for Health this funding was on offer for building primary care centres.  For one reason or another we had trouble with the Department of Finance and with Central Bank regulations and we were not able to avail of the funding.  Mr. Seamus Boland referred to the ACC and the ICC banks years ago.  Many businesses today would not be in business were it not for the presence of those two banks at that time.  I know there will be problems, issues and difficulties, but I am hugely supportive of what both groups are trying to do.  If they can see a symbiotic, cohesive and productive engagement between them it would be all to the better.  The Government, however, is considering this report.  I believe it may be in the Department of Rural and Community Development.  I am not sure.  We strongly look forward to the report coming out.  I certainly lay my cards on the table when I say that I want to see a positive response to the report and for the opportunity to be grasped to give society and our own communities back a little bit of control over their own destiny.  I thank the representatives for coming to the committee.  I hope they will be able to answer the questions I put to them.  I am sorry for speaking for so long but it is because I am very enthusiastic about the matter.  I hope the witnesses have not lost track of my questions.</p></speech>

They are independent so I could only give an indication of the range of overdraft interest rates.  I am aware that it varies between 7.5% and 12%.  It depends on the individual Sparkasse.  The Senator asked about the arrangement fees.  This is a special fee that is only reckoned when companies have turnover of &euro;25 million to &euro;30 million.  This is a very individual approach.  Arrangement fees are not reckoned in any SME loan business activities of a Sparkasse.  Above &euro;1 million and up to other sums there would be possible arrangement fees but not in the SME sector for business loans.  We have a four-year business plan in the proposal to Government for the Sparkassen model in Ireland.  For the midland region, for example, we reckon we could sum up the business loans to 2022 to around &euro;230 million.  It depends on the economic strengths of the region so it could be more or less. We believe that after five years we can estimate &euro;1.52 billion in business loans with eight to ten Sparkassen in Ireland.  These are the correct numbers we have reckoned in the business plan in our proposal for the Irish Sparkassen model.</p> <p>  The Senator asked about key services.  The Sparkassen model has a comprehensive approach.  This means the banks offer all the financial services of a bank.  There are no services we do not offer.  We do mortgages, SME loans, transaction banking etc.</p></speech>

It is within the remit of the Central Bank to do this.  We would need Government support, specifically from the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, both of which we met between 2015 and 2017.  There was a lot of initial interest but it waned and there seemed to be different priorities, such as the agri-loans provided for in budget 2017 for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Resources and expertise are needed for SME lending so pooling is required.  Pooling would give us a better bang for our buck and make lending cheaper, as would be the case were risk assessment to be done centrally.  Better decisions and cheaper finance would be good for SMEs.</p></speech>

If credit unions were to max out on the current permitted limits it would be approximately &euro;800 million.  It would be worth exploring how Sparkasse Bank can provide credit at between 1% and 2%.  There are various costs in providing credit and all the funding in credit unions comes from savers.  One of the main areas of focus for credit unions is to provide a return for hard-pressed savers, whom nobody else looks after at the moment, and it would be interesting to know how we could get a return for savers while meeting statutory levies and, at the same time, provide loans at between 1% and 2%.</p></speech>

My colleague said there were 286 credit unions left in the Republic of Ireland but there are well over 400 branches in communities so there is a ready-made infrastructure.  They are the last financial institutions standing for many in our communities.  We have been criticised for lending only 20% or 25% of what we could lend, but that is because we provide a savings a facility to members in all the communities to which I referred.</p></speech>

Bigger countries have regions with large populations so there will be more commercial advantage in the model for such countries.  What way does he propose to look at the regions of Ireland and how will he determine a region?  A region of Dublin would be very different from a region in rural County Limerick.

I compliment the three credit union organisations.  My family has had a long association with credit unions.  As members know, I am from Waterford.  My dad is no longer with us but he was one of the founding members and chairman of the Portlaw Ballyduff credit union.  Recently, we have seen a lot of amalgamations.  For example, Portlaw Ballyduff amalgamated with St. Dominic's in Waterford and the amalgamation has been very successful.  The transition has been extremely good.  There were worries that there would be a negative impact on the smaller credit union but that has not been the case.  In fact, there have been benefits especially in terms of being able to use an ATM card.  I congratulate the credit union movement on surviving through very difficult times.</p> <p>  The credit union movement came before the Committee on Housing and Homelessness which sat in 2016.  I was a member of the committee.  The Government was not even formed then.  We have huge issues in relation to housing and homelessness.  At the time the credit union movement offered approximately &euro;13 billion on deposit at the time and it was open to putting approximately &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion forward for the development of housing.  The witnesses can correct me if my figures are wrong.  I know nothing has happened but is there any update on the position?</p> <p>  I compliment Irish Rural Link on all the work it has done with the Sparkassen bank because there is no doubt it has been to the fore in regard to it.  It is ploughing the way forward for the bank.  Everything we have heard today is very complimentary about the bank and what the members are trying to achieve.  Mr. Kinahan, whom I met last week, is present with Ms Dooley.  There is significant development in the greater Dublin area and there is an appetite in the regions for credit unions, banking and funding for small and medium enterprises.  It would be very welcome if we could make progress on both fronts.  I am not sure whether it was Mr. Farrell who came before the housing committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.615" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Farrell" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#WW00700"><p>We launched a proposal we had at that time following on from the initial social housing strategy proposed by the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, at the end of 2014.  The Minister who succeeded him, Deputy Coveney, updated it in July 2016.  Our proposal came on foot of those two requests from Government about credit unions and other private or non-typical funding sources being required for social housing.  Following the launch of the proposal, we presented to the committee at the time.  We outlined where we needed help from two arms of the State, one being the Central Bank, to change the rules on the investments credit unions could hold and then when the rules were changed we would need the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government to push forward with the fund it had been talking about.  We have made good progress on the rules laid down for credit unions by the Central Bank.  They were opened to a public consultation last May and that closed in June.  In the run-up to Christmas and early in the new year, we have been over and back to the Central Bank and it looks like it is going to relax the rules.</p><p>It is opening the door very little but it is progress and it will allow an initial project for a tranche of money from credit unions to be made available to approved housing bodies for the first time.  It looks life half of it is starting and the other half is for the Government to push on and create the vehicle into which those approved housing bodies can borrow from the State fund, as it were, which was outlined in the reports by the previous Ministers, Deputy Kelly, and Deputy Coveney.  We are actively engaged with the Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government and the Irish Council for Social Housing, which is the apex body for the approved housing bodies, to try to complete that part of the equation in order to allow the investment of a modest amount of funding.  It would act as a template or trial project.  A lot has been done but there is just a little bit more to do to get the fund up and running.</p></speech>

Would credit unions be able to compete with the Sparkassen interest rates of 1% and 2%?  In terms of credit unions expanding their portfolios to lend to SMEs, could they be competitive with interest rates if they got the go-ahead to do it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-30a.618" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2018013000002#XX00300"><p>I acknowledge the Chairman's kind words.  They are very much appreciated.  I am delighted that she had first-hand experience of seeing the benefit of some of the transfers of engagement.  I am trying to understand how someone in our market could provide credit for 1% to 2%.  It is not that we do not want to compete with it.  We want to match it and beat it, if that is possible.  It is fantastic what that could do.  There definitely is an appetite for credit.  Given that only &euro;27 in every &euro;100 of savings are out in a productive or prominent way, of course there is an appetite to do a lot more, in particular for small businesses.  It is interesting that there are a lot of small businesses in Ireland today that would not be in existence were it not for the support of a credit union.</p> <p>  On housing, as my colleague said, the Central Bank has listed the publication of the investment regulations for Thursday, and we are looking forward to that.  It is a step in the right direction but we believe there is much more we can do.  Our preference is to see a legislative change that would allow credit unions to lend directly - individually and collectively - not just to the tier three housing bodies, but also to local authorities.  We are appalled by the fact that essential workers, namely, garda&iacute;, teachers and nurses, cannot afford to buy or rent houses.  We have funds that could be productively used to develop schemes to address that.  We ask the committee to consider that and we would be happy to provide assistance in terms of the legislative changes we request.</p></speech>

It is heartening that the committee recognises the credit unions and Irish Rural Link, IRL, as being part of the overall discussion.  I have watched other groups present to the committee as well.  There is a common theme.  As someone with 14 years' experience of being a public representative, two of the most common obstacles I have found that affect SMEs trying to get into and stay in business is, first, commercial rates, which is always a discussion ahead the budgetary process at the end of every year and, second, access to finance.  It is not just access to finance.  The key to it is access to competitively priced finance, which is what all of the committee's discussions have been about.</p> <p>  I hope today's discussion has been an eye-opener for elected members and Oireachtas Members because IRL, as anyone who knows us, does not just advocate on behalf of rural areas.  What we endeavour to do on every issue is to come to the table with solutions.  We are in a healed economy and we need to heal the banking system.  We are not here to bring the problems.  We all know what they are.</p><p>We are trying to bring about solutions as to how we can make finance more readily available and to try to start to rebuild sustainable economies.  The one uncertainty at the moment is Brexit but the one certainty is an ability within the Irish people to build their own economies if they are given the tools to do so.  That is our job, that is, to try to provide the tools across the board - finance being one of them - to allow people to do that.  Arising from today's discussions, if one thing has been borne out for us in Irish Rural Link, IRL, in terms of why we got involved from day one, it is that we have been appealing to Members and Governments to set up the task force.  There is a serious need for round table discussions with all stakeholders to the helm to see how we can all work together to try to bring about those solutions.  There has never been a better time to do so.  I was delighted with much of what Senator Reilly said but the one thing I have found frustrating is the number of reports that continually tell us that there is no obstacle to accessing finance and yet the number of loan rejections has gone through the roof.  I was delighted that the Senator pointed that out because that for us has been the reality on the ground.  In every seminar we have run, in every community we go into, they are the real life stories we hear, of people trying to increase their workforce and of trying to get involved in research and development but they cannot get access to finance.</p><p> I thank the committee again for this opportunity.  We look forward to the report being published and working with all stakeholders to see how we can bring about positive change in communities.</p></speech>

We need our pillar banks, but their focus has very much moved away from face-to-face contact with the customer but the credit unions and Sparkassen have shown that their model of banking harks back more to the day of the face-to-face relationship and ease of doing business.  I think we need both and I welcome the opportunity that Sparkassen has given us.  I thank the people from Sparkassen for coming over, not once or twice but a number of times.  I commend the credit unions on their persistence, because one needs persistence, but be under no illusion, many of us are hugely supportive of what they are doing.  I also commend Irish Rural Link for opening the door and being the link with Sparkassen.</p></speech>
