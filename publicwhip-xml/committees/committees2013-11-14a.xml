Agreed.  Is there any matter arising from them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/953" speakername="Shane Ross" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400003#B00300"><p>On the work programme, can we ask representatives of the Central Bank to come in again?  There have been at least three extremely high profile events in which there has been Central Bank intervention.  One is the finding of the &euro;70 million gap in Royal &amp;amp; Sun Alliance which is without a proper explanation at this stage.  While the Central Bank's involvement is not clear, we need to get to the bottom of it.  It opens the much wider question of how many other insurance companies are involved in the sort of practices we suspect are going on elsewhere and which have a major effect on profits.</p><p>  The second issue is the takeover of Newbridge Credit Union by Permanent TSB.  That was initiated, led and directed by the Central Bank.  In that case there is direct Government involvement in which we will certainly be looking for value for money because of the relationship between Permanent TSB and the State.</p><p>  In recent days news has broken of the credit card issue, where again the Central Bank is the regulator.  I am talking about the regulator coming in in all three cases.  An enormous number of questions need to be answered in all of them.  We need to know if the Central Bank is doing its job properly and what it is doing in all three cases and generally.  We need to ensure these types of problem are not spreading throughout the three industries involved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1060" speakername="Kieran O'Donnell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400003#B00400"><p>The committee's role is to get value for the public purse.  From that perspective, would it be in order to call in the Governor to discuss Newbridge Credit Union?  He visits once or twice a year.  We should do so on the basis of the potential cost to the State.  We should take it from that perspective, linking with what Deputy Shane Ross said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400003#B00500"><p>I support Deputies Shane Ross and Kieran O'Donnell.  It would be appropriate to call in the Governor of the Central Bank at this time.</p><p>  I wish to raise another issue on the State's procurement practices.  As members will know, there is a new office for centralised procurement and a move under way to save substantial moneys for the public purse, which is welcome.  However, there are some issues of concern about certain sectoral competitions.  I am thinking specifically about the stationery contract for schools and academic institutions.  I have acquainted myself with some of the issues involved, which are quite serious.  I would go so far as to say there is a real possibility that far from saving money in some instances, this centralised procurement arrangement might prove costly.  There are concerns about quality, proper invoicing and predatory pricing.  I intend to write to the Cathaoirleach officially on the matter, but I am taking the opportunity to flag the matter as an issue of concern that would most appropriately be examined by the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400003#B00600"><p>I will deal with the first item, Deputy Shane Ross's request.  The Central Bank is not accountable directly to us, unless the Comptroller and Auditor General carries out a report.  Therefore, we would not normally ask its representatives to appear before the committee; we are precluded from bringing them before it.  However, I agree with the Deputy that a considerable amount of taxpayers' money is now being directed towards saving institutions.  In some way the Committee of Public Accounts needs to have some overview or input into the conversation on these matters because they may come before us for consideration in years to come.  Why not do it now when the issues are live in order to express concern?  The electorate expresses concern, as do members.  While I understand the accountability role, we need to have some input.  Perhaps we should ask the clerk to follow up on Deputy Shane Ross's proposal.  We should ask him to find some way of bringing in the regulator, representatives of the bank or whoever it might be to discuss these issues.  We might also call in departmental officials who would be directly responsible in terms of their accountability for taxpayers' money; that is from where the money comes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Clerk to the Committee" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400003#B00700"><p>I shall pursue the issue.</p></speech>

I would like us to invite the Governor or the new regulator who is pretty much invisible - it would be nice to make him visible.  However, I am talking about something immediate; I am not talking about negotiating with them about coming in.  If the committee is to be relevant, we should be seen to respond to these issues immediately.  We do not want the people concerned to simply come in at at a time that suits them; we would like to see them next Thursday.  Can we do this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400003#B00900"><p>Arising from public concern, the Deputy has expressed his point of view that we ask the clerk to go ahead and make these inquiries and facilitate a meeting, if possible, in the shortest period of time.</p></speech>

I requested the newly appointed person responsible for procurement to come before the committee on that day, but we did not discuss the procurement issue.  What the Deputy has stated is quite true; there is much concern in the small and medium enterprise sector about procurement policy.  We are running out of days as we fill our work programme, but it is a big issue and I will ask the clerk, with the agreement of members, to schedule an early meeting in order that we can deal with procurement issues, as outlined by the Deputy.  If she wishes, we can write informally and this can be part of the request.</p><p>  The meeting requested by Deputy Shane Ross will be held as soon as possible, while the meeting requested by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald will be held if we can schedule it.  As agreed last week, even if it is not held on a Thursday, we will have a meeting to facilitate the people concerned.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400004#C00700"><p>We will include that in the proposal.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  No. 3A on the agenda is correspondence from Accounting Officers and Ministers.  Correspondence was received on 7 November from the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, on the need to review the legal code and investigate processes with regard to white collar crime.  This correspondence arose from proceedings at a previous meeting.  I ask committee members to note this correspondence and perhaps we might examine it in the context of the bank stabilisation report which is being concluded.</p><p>  No. 3A.2 is correspondence, dated 8 November 2013, from Mr. Martin Whelan of NAMA on the involvement of NAMA in Mill Shopping Centre, Clondalkin.  The correspondence is to be noted.</p><p>  No. 3A.3 is correspondence, dated 12 November 2013, from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General, Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, providing information requested at the meeting of 3 October.  The correspondence is to be noted.  It was only received yesterday and is now on the agenda.  I propose that it be published, but some of the answers are not answers.  It is quite appalling that it took so long for the Department to respond to us and, in my opinion, the information contained in some of the answers is simply not good enough.  We should consider it more fully at our next meeting.  I will give members the opportunity to read the correspondence and look at the questions asked and the replies given.  They should bear in mind the length of time it took to provide us with the replies and that some of the questions have not been answered.  Deputy Sean Fleming raised this issue at our last meeting.  I propose to include it for discussion at our next meeting before the witnesses come before us and include with it the minutes we receive from the Department to examine the quality of the answers given.</p><p>  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 5 November 2013, from Augustus Cullen Solicitors for Marie O&rsquo;Sullivan regarding The Warrens Wicklow Hostel.  The correspondence is to be noted.</p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence received on 7 November from an anonymous source regarding consultancy fees of &euro;186 million paid by AIB in 2011.  The correspondence is to be noted.  This is not a matter for the committee.  As AIB is 99% owned by the State, we will send it to the Department of Finance for its view on the use of consultants, how they were paid and the tender process involved.  While it is not specifically a matter for the committee, it is similar to the question raised by Deputy Shane Ross.  We should insist on a full and comprehensive answer from the Department of Finance on these issues because taxpayers' money is involved.  There is no point in examining the matter long after the event.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 16 November 2013, from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, on complaints made to the Minister in 2008 by Councillor Padge Reck.  The correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to Councillor Reck.</p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence, dated 23 October 2013, from an anonymous source on governance issues at the Institute of Technology, Tralee.  The correspondence is to be noted and a copy forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority for appropriate follow-up and a note on the action taken in dealing with the matter.  I propose that we invite people involved in the sector because we have received a number of complaints about institutes of technology.  An issue in one institution was raised in the House yesterday by a Deputy who will be writing to us about it.  Perhaps we might examine the correspondence collectively as a unit.  We will produce a report on Waterford Institute of Technology and it may be opportune to bring in the complaints we have received about the institutes of technology and include a commentary on them in the report.</p><p>  No. 3C is documents related to today&rsquo;s meeting.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence received on 11 November from Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, Secretary General, Department of Health regarding a report on medical cards and matters to be considered at this meeting.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3C.2 is correspondence received on 11 November from Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin, Secretary General, Department of Health, on briefing material on matters to be considered at this meeting.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3C.3 is correspondence received on 13 November from Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general, HSE, including his opening statement.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.  </p><p>  No. 3C.4 is correspondence received on 13 November from Dr. Ambrose McLoughlin including his opening statement.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 24 October.  No. 4.1 is the annual report from Pobal, while No. 4.2 concerns the local government fund.  These items are to be noted.  Pobal allocated money to the Tipperary hostel, which is a question which is to come before us again.  We should ask it about the money it allocated and perhaps obtain information from the other agencies on the amounts allocated by them to this project and examine the company now in charge on whether it is sustainable with reference to the accounts.</p><p>  The work programme is on screen.  I propose that we meet the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, DDDA, on 6 February 2014 to examine its financial statements for 2012.  We are finalising a date with Professor Niamh Brennan in respect of the DDDA Glass Bottle site.  As soon as we agree a date, she will appear before us.</p><p>  No. 6 is other business.  The agenda for the meeting on Thursday, 21 November is that at 10 a.m. we will meet representatives of the National Gallery of Ireland to examine the 2012 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General - chapter 15, staff appointments at the National Gallery of Ireland, and Vote 34 - National Gallery of Ireland.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

It is agreed to meet the National Gallery of Ireland on 21 November, as stated, and that if the Central Bank is agreeable to coming before the committee on that date, we meet its representatives before or after the session with the National Gallery of Ireland.  We have also agreed to examine at that meeting the replies and minutes from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Most members have indicated they are anxious to make a contribution during this meeting.</p></speech>

The scheme currently helps in providing medical support to an estimated 43% of the population.</p><p>  The cost of the scheme in 2012 was &euro;1.7 billion, accounting for approximately 12.5% of the Health Service Executive's total expenditure.  The scheme's costs increased from &euro;937 million in 2003 to &euro;1.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 85%.  The number of cards in issue increased by more than 70% in that period and the estimated average cost of a card increased by about one fifth.</p><p>  Eligibility for a medical card is, in the main, determined by a means test based on the applicant's income, taking account of certain relevant household outgoings.  The HSE also has discretion to award a card if not doing so would result in undue hardship.  Medical cards are normally valid for three or four years.  Subject to continuing eligibility, cards are renewed upon expiration.  Eligibility is determined either by way of a full case review by the HSE or through self-assessment by the card holder.</p><p>  Our examination was carried out to assess the adequacy of controls over the initial award of cards and the process of review of cards in issue.  The level of ineligible card holding was also examined.  Shortcomings were identified in the application of controls in 8% of a sample of 2012 medical cards approved.  In 4% of cases, medical cards had been approved in circumstances where the available evidence suggested that the applicant had not satisfied eligibility criteria.  In the other cases, no documentation or inadequate documentation of outgoings had been provided.  Additional guidance and staff training, as well as more formal supervisory reviews of medical card approvals, should ensure that prescribed controls are applied.</p><p>  Approximately 5% of new cards are awarded on discretionary grounds, taking account of the individual's economic and social circumstances and the level of illness and related costs.  A review of cards awarded on a discretionary basis identified opportunities for improving the information supplied by general practitioners, GPs, to allow the HSE to assess the individual's normal medical costs.</p><p>  Administration of medical card scheme processing was centralised in June 2011.  A significant backlog in the processing of applications and renewal notices had emerged by the end of 2011.  The HSE introduced a number of initiatives to deal with the backlog and to prevent further backlogs from occurring.  This included extending the self-assessment basis for the renewal of cards, allowing GPs to amend the medical card database in certain circumstances and extending eligibility for one year for some categories of card holders due for renewal in 2012.</p><p>  In 2012, the HSE issued approximately 366,000 renewal notices.  In 70% of cases, the applicant was asked only to confirm that the relevant circumstances had not changed.  In the remaining cases, a full review of eligibility, comparable with an initial application, was conducted.</p><p>  Overall, 10.7% of card holders had not responded to the renewal notices by May 2013 and their medical cards had lapsed as a result.  A further 1.9% of cards were not renewed because it was found the card holders had died.  Of the remainder, more than 94% had their eligibility confirmed as before or were awarded full medical cards instead of their previous GP visit cards.  Some 1.7% had their eligibility reduced from a full medical card to a GP visit card and 4% were deemed not to have eligibility for either form of card.</p><p>  During 2012, the HSE also reviewed 40,000 cards where card holders had not accessed medical services for periods of 12 months or more.  Eligibility was removed in just under 40% of these cases.  While these cases had not recently resulted in payments for prescriptions or other items, capitation payments to their GPs would have been incurred.</p><p>  Overall, the available evidence suggests there is a material level of ineligibility of card holding in the medical card system.  However, the financial implication of that ineligibility has not been established.  In 2012, the HSE engaged consultants to review excess payments within the medical card scheme.  They estimated that excess expenditure could be in the range of &euro;65 million to &euro;210 million per year.  However, that review was limited in scope as it was conducted on the basis of a review of reports, rather than a detailed analysis of the database.  The review concluded that a more reliable estimate would require detailed analysis of the medical card database.</p><p>  The HSE has not yet developed an estimate of the level of excess payments in the medical card system.  Based on our examination findings, I have recommended that the HSE initiate a cyclical programme of reviews of eligibility in respect of random samples of card holders.  This would allow a reliable baseline estimate of the scale of excess payments to be identified.  Tracking changes in the levels of excess payments would allow the HSE to evaluate the effectiveness of its overall control strategy and to identify the key drivers of excess payments.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to bring clarity to the legal position regarding such eligibility.  As Secretary General of the Department of Health, I strongly endorse the recommendations pertaining to eligibility outlined in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.</p><p>  I will begin with some factual information regarding medical cards.  It may be useful for Deputies to know that, as of 1 October, 1,864,509 medical cards were issued by the HSE.  This represented an increase of more than 60% in the number of medical cards, or 700,000 individuals, since the end of 2005.  More than 40% of the national population hold medical cards compared with 27% at the end of 2005.  Between 2004 and 2012, when medical card coverage rose from 27.7% to 40.4% of the population, unemployment rates increased from 4.3% to 14.4%.</p> <p>This indicates a high correlation between these two variables.  Therefore, as the economic position improves, resulting in more people returning to employment, we should expect to see a marked decrease in the number of medical cards issued.</p><p> As Deputies may be aware, the legislation governing the medical card scheme, section 45 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, allows for persons who are unable, without undue hardship, to arrange a general practitioner's service for themselves or their family to qualify for a medical card.  Under this legislation, the determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Section 45 requires the HSE to have regard to the overall financial circumstances of a person and his or her spouse or partner in view of their reasonable expenditure.  The HSE gives effect to the legislation and the Government's policy through its medical card national assessment guidelines.  Where a person's income is in excess of the thresholds set out in the national assessment guidelines, the HSE uses its discretion to grant a medical card to a person who is unable, without undue hardship, to arrange a GP service.  In doing so, it is obliged to have regard to the financial position and expenditure of the individual and his or her dependants. </p><p> To dispel any misconception that there still might be, I want to clarify that, in line with the legislation I have just outlined, there has never been an automatic entitlement to a medical card on the basis of having a specific illness or condition such as cancer.  While there may be criticism of that approach, the correct interpretation is very clear from a reading of the legislation which has been in place for a considerable period of time.  </p><p> There is an additional arrangement available to persons aged 70 years and over to establish their eligibility for a medical card.  Persons over 70 years of age can also qualify for a medical card on the basis of a gross income test.  Under the legislation, individuals aged over 70 years with a gross income not exceeding &euro;600 per week qualify for a medical card.  Couples over 70 years of age with an income not exceeding &euro;1,200 per week also qualify for a medical card.</p><p> Medical card processing was centralised at the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, in July 2011.  This system facilitates standardised, homogeneous and equitable assessment of all applications, irrespective of the origin or nature of the application.  In previous years there was a decentralised process which led to inequities throughout the country.  Medical cards may have been awarded on a discretionary basis in some geographical areas and not in others because of the lack of a centralised and standardised approach.  This resulted in having regional and local areas in which there were high numbers of medical cards above what one might have expected.  The assessment procedures used to determine eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards has not changed, rather, through the centralised processing of applications where discretion is exercised, it is now applied equitably and consistently based on standard operating procedures, with medical officers assessing medical evidence for cost and necessary expense.  The HSE has in place a process whereby a team of medical doctors, unrelated to the patient, assess his or her situation and grant or decline a discretionary medical card on a medical basis.  Previously, different approaches may have been used in different parts of the country, resulting in an inequitable distribution of discretionary medical cards.  With this standardised process there is fair and equitable treatment for all.  This ensures the scheme operates to enable those who suffer financial hardship as a result of a medical condition to receive the benefit of a medical card.</p><p> For the record, persons in receipt of a medical card may also be entitled to the following additional benefits: exemption from paying the health portion of social insurance, PRSI; free transport to school for children who live three miles or more from the nearest school; exemption from State examination fees in public second level schools and financial assistance with buying school books.  Under section 49(1) of the Health Act 1970, as amended, there is an obligation on medical card holders to advise the HSE if there is a change in their circumstances that could affect entitlement to a medical card.  This provision, allied with data sharing legislation which came into effect in March 2013, allows the sharing of personal data between the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the HSE which will result in a higher level of compliance and an overall reduction in the amount of medical cards issued.  </p><p> The scheme has been in existence since the 1970s and benefited millions of citizens.  I would like members to note this point.  I assure Deputies that there has been no change in the past year to the qualifying criteria for discretionary medical cards.  Notwithstanding the need to secure savings under the medical card scheme, it is important to note that nobody who under the legislation is entitled to a medical card will lose it or be refused one.  I thank members for their time.  I am happy to answer questions they may have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400006#E00700"><p>I, too, welcome the invitation to attend this meeting, in advance of which a report on medical cards was submitted to the committee.  I am also aware that members of the committee have received the briefing material which has been the subject of briefings in the Oireachtas this week.  I will, therefore, be brief in my opening statement.</p><p>  Eligibility for a medical card or a GP visit card is determined on the basis of an assessment of financial means.  If an applicant's means are above the financial thresholds set out in the national guidelines, the HSE examines for any indication of circumstances, medical or social, which might result in undue financial hardship.  Eligibility may be granted on a discretionary basis if these circumstances are such that a person cannot access general practitioner or other medical services without undue financial hardship.  There can be a significant crossover between social and medical circumstances and applications do not fall discretely into these specific categories.  The process whereby the application of discretion may be considered includes a review by HSE medical officers led by a principal medical officer.</p><p>  Almost 2 million people are covered by either a medical card or a GP visit card.  This means that 43% of the population have medical cards or GP visit cards, with the number of people with eligibility having increased by 74% since January 2005.  The HSE continues to make significant progress in the reconfiguration of this key component of national health infrastructure.  The medical card centralisation project which commenced in 2011 has been successfully delivered.  Medical card processing is now carried out, with single national governance, at a central office location, compared with 100 locations in the past.  Customer service processes, assessment of applications and reviews, correspondence and the application of discretion are now operated in a consistent and equitable manner across the country.</p><p>  Turnaround performance in processing medical card applications is reported online each week.  This reporting confirms that the HSE continues to surpass the turnaround rate of 90% processed at 15 days.  For example, as of 14 October, more than 96% of complete applications had been processed in 15 days.  It is important to stress that eligibility for a medical card is founded on the undue financial hardship test.  The HSE must operate within the legal parameters as set out in the Act, while also responding to the financial, medical and social circumstances and complexities faced by individuals who apply for a medical card.  In parallel with a focus on service provision and improvements in customer service and efficiency, the HSE is also focused on its public accountability role in the overall management of the medical card scheme.  New legislation passed in March created the legal basis for the sharing of records with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection.  This will allow for further improvements in the management of the medical card system and offers an additional assurance that medical card eligibility continues to be provided for people appropriately in line with the national assessment guidelines for eligibility.</p><p>  The availability to the HSE of data indicating changes in a medical card holder's circumstances such as change in employment status, income levels and a change in eligibility for Department of Social Protection schemes will inform the HSE in focusing reviews on subsets of the register to identify clients who may no longer be eligible.  The introduction of these additional controls will strengthen the risk management framework for the scheme.  I assure members that the assessment arrangements are designed to ensure people who are eligible for either a medical card or a GP visit card receive it quickly and efficiently and equally to ensure those who are not eligible to receive or retain a medical card do not.</p><p>  Each month the HSE analyses the medical card register to identify those medical card-GP visit cards which are scheduled for review within three months.  We have increased this timeline to four months in respect of those clients who were granted eligibility on the basis of discretion in order to allow an additional month to ensure all pertinent medical and other data are provided for inclusion in the assessment process.  All customers scheduled for review are notified and a process of either full reviews or self-assessments is conducted.</p> <p>The HSE will continue the focus on medical card probity into 2014.  In the nine months between January and September this year, we initiated 428,682 medical card reviews, and we plan to more than double this level of review activity in 2014.  Since the guidelines have been substantially reduced for those 70 years and older, we are required to review the means of over 350,000 individuals in this cohort completely, with the exception of those reviewed in 2013 and where income levels are already held on file by the HSE.  We estimate that approximately 10% of the individuals concerned will be provided with GP visit eligibility in place of full eligibility.</p><p> Since centralisation, 106,828 individuals whose medical cards have been inactive have been contacted requesting residence confirmation.  As of 1 October, 68,333 individuals, or 64%, had confirmed residence and eligibility was removed for 38,495 people, or 36% of the cohort.  The Comptroller and Auditor General commenced an examination of the medical card system in June 2013 and completed it in September 2013.  The audit report produced six recommendations and these have been fully agreed by the HSE for implementation.</p><p> This concludes my opening statement on medical cards but I should mention, with the Vice Chairman's permission, that with regard to the section 38 audit that has been discussed, we have been in a position to provide the report to the committee and in due course we look forward to discussing it.</p></speech>

As Deputies on the ground, we know a major issue for constituents is the discretionary medical card.  Having read the material provided, it can be said about people with discretionary medical cards without fear of contradiction that they are seriously ill, as they would not have qualified for the discretionary medical card otherwise.  In other words, these people got discretionary medical cards on medical grounds because of a serious illness.  Based on the information provided, since the start of the year 45,000 medical cards have been withdrawn, and of those 10,400 were discretionary.  Is that analysis correct?  This is based on a publication provided by Dr. McLoughlin which gives the total number of medical cards.  The review indicated 45,000 medical cards were withdrawn, with 9,981 not reviewed, 3,992 people deceased, 35,733 people who did not reply, and 5,803 cards which expired before the review was over.  The period is January to September this year.  On 1 January this year there were 63,136 discretionary medical cards in place and as of 1 October this year, there were 52,733.  The reduction is in the order of 10,393, or 16%.  The number of discretionary cards at the end of September comprised approximately 0.3% of overall medical cards.  Is it correct that of the 45,000 medical cards which were withdrawn, 10,393 relate to discretionary cards?</p></speech>

There were 63,000 at one point and 52,000 at the next.  There is much movement in the system in the period and the numbers change weekly.  A number of medical card holders who were on discretionary cards may have moved to other medical cards.</p></speech>

For the general public looking at this, and particularly those on discretionary medical cards, it is apparent that these were given on the basis of a serious medical condition.  I am basing my assumptions on the HSE figures.  At the start of January there were 63,136 and at the end of September there 52,733, which is a change of 10,393.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Of the 10,393 people, 6,282 got GP visit cards, with an increase in GP visit cards as there is a direct correlation between a reduction in medical cards and their change to GP visit cards.  Of the 45,000 withdrawn medical cards, a quarter came from discretionary medical cards, but those cards only make up 0.3% of the total number of medical cards.  People with discretionary medical cards have them for medical reasons.  The basis of the medical card system from day one was to provide medical care for people with medical conditions who could not afford treatment.  I am worried that there are people on discretionary medical cards with defined serious medical conditions, whereas a large cohort of the overall number of medical card holders may not use their cards.  Is it correct that 10,000 cards were withdrawn?</p></speech>

The two points concern the overall numbers and granting of eligibility on illness grounds.  The Secretary General has dealt with that and we can go through it again.  Let me deal with the numbers.</p><p>  There were 97,000 clients recorded as having discretion and as of 1 October, 38,238 were recorded as having discretion.  Following a review, 41,779 of those clients had a medical card on the basis of an assessment of their means.  There is a balance of 17,059, and of those who do not eligibility, 2,361 were deceased; we received no response from 6,265 people despite multiple requests; 2,109 did not provide information that we needed to maintain a verification of circumstances; and 6,324 were judged not eligible when assessed the guidelines.  We analysed those 6,324 cases.</p> <p>Of these, 50% were more than 200% above the guideline figures, while 92% were more than 50% above them.</p></speech>

Of the clients who did not have eligibility confirmed following an assessment of their means against the guidelines and taking into account medical or other circumstances involved, 50% of the 6,324 were more than 200% above the guideline figures, while 92% were more than 50% above them.  The point I am making is that we reconcile the numbers flagged on a database simply to manage and control the data.  Where we issued a medical card but exercised some level of discretion, we put a flag beside that registration.  As we review them and some of the clients, when assessed and taking their means into account, receive a medical card, we no longer maintain that flag.  That does not mean that their medical card is gone.  They have eligibility and a medical card.</p></speech>

A total of 38,283 on 1 October still had a medical card on the basis of discretion.  A total of 41,779 are on the register, but they are not flagged as having eligibility on the basis of discretion but on the basis of an assessment of their means against the guidelines.  The balancing figure is 17,059 which I have broken down as follows: 2,361 deceased; 6,265 from which there has been no response despite repeated questions; 2,109 did not provide the material we needed to conduct an assessment, while 6,324 were not eligible when assessed against the guidelines.</p></speech>

In the cases that have come across my desk many of them are disabled children or children with Down's syndrome.  They would have had medical cards since birth or from the first year of their lives.  I am talking about the system; this is not personal.  It is an important issue.  Let us say a person has Down's syndrome and he or she is offered a long-term illness card under the mental handicap heading, a term that must be changed as it has been used since 1970.  It is outdated and I have major problems with it.  Let us consider the conditions that invariably occur with a child who has Down's syndrome.  Up to 90% of such children have asthma, 70% to 80% suffer from hearing loss, while 80% to 90% will have heart conditions, yet when they receive the long-term illness card, they are not covered for any of these.  Does that make sense, given all the time it takes to administer these 6,324 applications for people who are seriously ill, have had medical cards for the past ten years and are a vulnerable group?  We are dealing with their parents who are under extraordinary pressure.  In some cases, they do not have the time to put together what is needed for an application, but if they are offered a long-term illness card, it will not cover virtually all of the conditions from which their child is suffering.  Along with this, when a review was carried out of a cohort of 428,682 and 9% of these, nearly 36,000, did not reply, is it value for money to chase down the discretionary medical card scheme for this small cohort of 6,324 people?  They account for a minute percentage of the GMS cards issued.  There are up to 1.9 million cards issued; perhaps, therefore, it would be better value to carry out a review of these categories.  The point is that this is a group of people who received medical cards because there was a serious illness from the start.  I am trying to see the logic of it and whether there is a need to change the system to deal with this issue.  It all dates back to 1970.  Will Mr. O'Brien address that issue?  Does he understand our motivation?</p></speech>

The underlying point concerns the grounds on which a medical card of any type can be granted are set out in the legislation which does not provide that the existence of a medical condition alone qualifies a person to receive a medical card.  The medical condition is a factor in the assessment of financial hardship against the guidelines.  It is entirely possible that a person's medical circumstances will not change, but their eligibility for a medical card does.</p></speech>

If one has a child with cystic fibrosis, for example, in many cases his or her asthma has got worse and the condition has progressed.  I also see it happening with disabled children.  I am talking about that cohort whose medical conditions have not improved.</p></speech>

I said that under the 1970 Act the fact that they had a medical condition did not, in and of itself, qualify them to receive a medical card.  The medical card test is one of undue financial hardship and the costs associated with the medical condition clearly factor into the arithmetical assessment of their eligibility.  The Comptroller and Auditor General, the Secretary General and I have laid this out.  If it is the view of the committee that it would be better for people in these circumstances to qualify on the basis of medical conditions alone, that could only be given effect by a change in the legislation, not by a change in the administration of the scheme by the HSE.  The HSE would not have a legal right to operate the scheme on the basis described.</p></speech>

If people were granted a discretionary medical card, up to ten years ago in some cases, and the medical condition of their child, whether the child is disabled or has Down's syndrome, has progressively worsened, how can Mr. O'Brien explain to them that the criteria for assessment have not changed?</p></speech>

I wish to make two other points.  In the course of reviews some medical cards are withdrawn.  We all know that some people migrate to ordinary medical cards and that others migrate to other support schemes such as the long-term illness scheme.  That is a factor that is taken into account by those who assess medical hardship.  In the past month we have introduced a further safety net measure for people who have held discretionary medical cards in the past to make sure we know the up-to-date medical circumstances before final decisions are taken.  On the central point the Vice Chairman has made, we endeavour at all times to support the people who need help the most.  That is the way it works.</p></speech>

Would it give better value for money for the taxpayer and, more particularly, people who are seriously ill if more energy was directed, for instance, at the issues under general review?  How many medical cards under general review are in the names of people who are deceased?  Are there medical cards that are part of the general cohort which are not being used?  A lot of the HSE's time and ours, as public representatives, but, more particularly, that of people who have seriously ill children is taken up in dealing with the discretionary medical card issue.

In 2012 we reviewed 360,000 medical cards; this year, as at 1 September, we had initiated 428,000 reviews and by the end of the year we will have initiated nearly 600,000.  That means that there are over 900,000 medical cards in respect of which a review has been initiated.  We have a target of 1 million for next year.

Let me finish by saying every time a medical card or eligibility is granted, it is granted for a window of time, three months in advance of the end of which the client is advised and the review commences.  There is a review date.  In a sense, no particular group has been targeted or identified in any way.  I will outline the only random act we have undertaken.  It was done in line with what the Comptroller and Auditor General had recommended.  This year we initiated a process whereby a random sample was used to establish a baseline to determine how the scheme was being managed.  To answer to the Vice Chairman's question, during a three and a half year window the entire database will be reviewed.</p></speech>

A total net saving of &euro;666 million was published as part of the budget, with a medical card probity saving of &euro;113 million.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to indicate his view of the figure, the average cost per medical card and the number of medical card holders that will be affected by the measure.  Please give us a flavour of the areas where the service plan will involve reference pricing and various other measures.  What does "probity" mean?</p></speech>

That is the broad and accepted definition.  It is important to stress that the figure of &euro;113 million referenced by the Vice Chairman will not have an impact on eligibility.  It is an estimate for the potential reduction in overall costs in one of the categories listed in the annual Estimates volume that could arise as a result of active measures designed to ensure the probity of the medical card scheme.  As I said in my opening remarks, just as our function is to ensure there are no medical cards in force for which people are not eligible, it is equally our function - the communications strategy in place is has been designed this way - to ensure those who are eligible receive medical cards.  The figure of &euro;113 million does not change the eligibility criteria.  It will lead us to a continuation and extension of the fair process in place to ensure by way of a review people will continue to be eligible; that if they are eligible, they will have the medical card to which they are entitled and if they are not so entitled, they will not.  The consequence is that we will reviewing very substantial numbers.  We have indicated that we expect to review in the region of 1 million medical card holders in 2014.  What that will produce will only be determined by the review process.  Therefore, it would not be wise, prudent or in the general interest to speculate on the outcome of individual reviews.  I know there has been a tendency in the media to float various figures, but that it is likely to cause fear and alarm.  The reality is that if people continue to be eligible, they will continue to hold their medical card or their GP visit card, as appropriate.</p></speech>

I wish to pick up on the last statement made by Mr. O'Brien.  The difficultly, of course, is that the HSE has cited budget savings of &euro;113 million arising from medical card "probity" as he put it.  I do not think it is consistent for him, on the one hand, to say we must wait and see what the outcome of the medical card reviews will be and, on the other, to have a stated target saving of &euro;113 million.  It is his figure, the Department's figure and the Minister's figure that has caused considerable public alarm.  How did the HSE land on the figure of &euro;113 million?  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the HSE's research that indicated a range of possible savings through probity measures and the HSE has settled on the figure of &euro;113 million.  Will Mr. O'Brien explain in a succinct manner the logic behind the calculation?</p></speech>

It is an estimate of what might be obtained as the result of a probity exercise.  It does not change eligibility and it does not come, precooked, with a target for the number of people who should lose eligibility, because eligibility does not change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.116" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400010#J01000"><p>Setting a target, or having a figure like that handed down, is the very definition of precooking an outcome.  Mr. Hennessy, Mr. McLoughlin and Mr. O'Brien have been at pains to emphasise that there is no change in the qualifying criteria for a medical card, and specifically a discretionary medical card.  The witnesses cited section 45 of the Health Act 1970 and have underscored the fact that legislation is what determines whether a card is awarded.  I have no argument with that.</p><p>  Moving from the general to the specific, a specific individual is a five-year-old child called Katie Connolly from Douglas in Cork.  She has Down's syndrome and has been turned down on assessment for renewal of her medical card, which she had since birth as decided in line with section 45 of the Health Act 1970.  She has Down's syndrome, asthma and a heart condition that must be monitored every two years.  She has recently been diagnosed with juvenile arthritis.  Her family always understood that on a simple crude means test they would not qualify for a card, but Katie had a medical card as adjudicated by the authorities in line with section 45 of the Health Act 1970.  She now no longer has the card and she has no GP visit card.</p><p>  In this specific case in which a child was judged as qualifying for a full medical card and is now judged not to qualify for any medical card, the legislation has not changed, the child's condition has not changed and the family's means have not changed.  Those elements are constants in the scenario.  Notwithstanding what he has said, Mr. O'Brien is dancing on the head of a pin and the one thing that has changed is the policy in respect of how eligibility is interpreted.  How does Katie, aged five, find herself with no medical card?  I would like to know that.</p></speech>

We are caught by the legal situation.  In the earlier discussion, the Chairman raised issues that are now prudent and proper for the committee to take forward.  The Government must make decisions on whether it wants to provide medical cards to people who have illness, as distinct from having regard to what is in the law at the present time.  We must be clear about that.  We are dealing with legislation and my Department must operate within the policy framework set by the Government, but there is no direction from my Department other than to facilitate people who need medical cards on hardship grounds-----</p></speech>

If Mr. McLoughlin would demonstrate a level of courtesy, I would appreciate it.  The fact of the matter is that this case is representative of many and the child, in accordance with the established law, was adjudged to merit a full medical card under the Health Act 1970.  Under the same legislation, the view now is that she does not qualify.  The child has not changed, the family circumstances have not changed and the law has not changed, so based on what Mr. McLoughlin is telling me, either the child had illegally obtained or been granted a medical card, or there has been a policy change and Mr. McLoughlin and his colleagues in the HSE are moving heaven and earth to try to disguise or conceal the fact.</p></speech>

That is not provided for under the current legislation.  If the political system wants to do that, it is a matter for the system.  I am simply reiterating that has been no change in policy in respect of discretionary medical cards and I want to assure the public that anyone who feels entitled to a medical card should contact the HSE.</p></speech>

The law has not changed.  The law has been in existence since 1970.  Katie Connolly is five years old, which puts her date of birth in 2008.  She was granted the medical card with due regard and in accordance with that legislation.  The judgment was that, given the seriousness, complexity and lifetime nature of the child's medical condition, and notwithstanding the parents' income, the child warranted a full medical card.  However, she now finds herself with no medical card cover at all.  She does not even have a GP-only card.  The legislation has not changed, the family and the child have not changed and the only variable in the scenario is policy.  With the greatest of respect to Mr. McLoughlin, I do not accept the assertion to the contrary.  It would make the committee appear utterly foolish if we were to accept that line.  It is not true.</p><p>  Moving from the particular to the general, if we were minded to do a forensic trawl of the 6,324 cases in which people who had previously enjoyed a discretionary card were found not to be eligible, we would most likely find that the same scenario arises.  People with serious illnesses of a long-term nature were granted medical cards under the legislation by the same authorities now find themselves with no medical card cover.  I am not asking Mr. McLoughlin to defend this.  He does not make the policy calls; the Minister does.  However, Mr. McLoughlin should not come before the committee and tell us black is white.</p> <p>Please do not insult us by doing that.  There has clearly been a change in policy because one does not find a change in legislation or in the circumstances of the individuals concerned.</p></speech>

If it is okay, I will not discuss the particular family, even though we are in discussions with the family and with a number of others who are in similar circumstances.  We are happy to do that and, thankfully, the number is quite small but they are there and there is no point in denying that.

That relates to an earlier point that all cards are subject to review.  All cases are subject to review and there are actually changes in circumstances that are taken into account by deciding officers and by the medical officers who are examining the cases on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>  What has changed?  In the pre-PCRS time, we had a lot of local schemes being administered, by and large, on a stand-alone basis, for which we came in for very heavy criticism from the political system and the Ombudsman at the time.  There was a sense of bewilderment at how somebody could get a medical card in Cork but not in Kilkenny or in Donegal, but not in Wexford.  We had to deal with that, which we did, in a way that established a standard consistent system of application with a single rule set and a process for assessing hardship in a consistent manner with standard operating procedures - essentially, all of the good practices one would expect in a statutory national scheme from a public body.  We now have that in place.</p><p>  The consequences of that change are throwing up the type of cases to which the Deputy referred.  As I said, thankfully, the number is quite small.  We are working with each of those to try to provide supports around them.  One of the things that became very clear to me from talking to the medical officers is that they actually take into account the fact people qualify for other services, such as the long-term illness card, and supports under the Disability Act, which can be quite significant, in some instances, for people, irrespective of whether they have a medical card.</p></speech>

God knows we had many a session here around the backlogs and delays but, fortunately, that appears to be resolved.  I also appreciate that it makes rational sense to have standardised procedures and to have a standard and a transparent approach.  I am not gainsaying any of that.  What I am simply saying is that people - 6,324 - who are ill and in difficult circumstances who were granted medical cards on a discretionary basis now find themselves without them.  I would really be interested - I know it would laborious - to read chapter and verse, almost case-by-case, about those people.  As the Vice Chairman said, in our front line politics and in our constituencies - this is happening right across the State - all of us have the experience of people coming forward with serious long-term illnesses who had discretionary medical cards but who no longer have them and who have no card at all.  I think I have made the point - I will not labour it - sufficiently clear to Mr. McLoughlin that I put that down, as I think any sensible person would, to a change in policy.  I do not think one can arrive at any other reasonable conclusion.</p><p>  In respect of children with Down's syndrome, is there a figure for those children who would have had a medical card but who no longer have one?

I certainly do not want to put words in Mr. Hennessy's mouth but he began to say that we cannot compound something that was wrong by continuing it.  There is a need for a change in policy based on medical need.  That is my view and I appreciate it is for us to pursue that in the political arena but I think it is very disturbing that we have a situation, when there has been no obvious change in the law and in people's circumstances, that one day, people are eligible for a card but the next day, they are not.

I thank Mr. O'Brien, Dr. Mc Loughlin and their teams for their patience during what was quite a lengthy suspension.  We will now switch our attention from bailout exits to medical cards.  The conversation we have had so far this morning has been helpful and constructive.  The figures Mr. Burke provided on the review of discretionary medical cards and how that breaks down, with a high level of detail, were very useful by way of providing a context.</p><p>  I ask the witnesses to outline the communication plan that is now in place with regard to medical cards.  When the HSE makes any announcement about changes to income limits or eligibility criteria, a fear sets in and that can be particularly acute in the context of the vulnerability of the people concerned.  In that context, I know the HSE has put in place a communications plan and I ask the witnesses to outline the content of that plan and to elaborate on how it is progressing.  Has there been much contact with the public?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.179" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013111400013#M00500"><p>Thank you Deputy Harris. We took action on our communications strategy in acknowledgement of the considerable amount of controversy and genuine anxiety and concern the announcement of the review provoked.  The intention of our response was to explain, to clarify and to improve people's understanding of the operation of the medical card scheme in order to alleviate some of their anxiety and concern.  In terms of the elements of the communications plan, Mr. Burke and his colleagues in the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS, introduced an additional control, particularly for people who already held discretionary cards.  That is an important measure which allows us to capture the most up-to-date information on the circumstances of all cases before final decisions are taken.  That control is now in place.</p><p>  The second element  of the communications strategy involved public advertisements, an enhanced helpline and website enhancements, including a new video.  I would encourage all Deputies to look at the video on our website if they get a chance.  It is not lengthy, at approximately eight minutes, but is quite informative.  We are working on a frequently-asked questions leaflet for medical cards which will be ready in about two weeks and will go to all local offices, GP surgeries and hospitals as well as being circulated to public representatives.  We have embarked on a range of meetings and briefing sessions with voluntary and advocacy groups.  We have also embarked on a number of briefings in the political system through the local health fora.  </p><p>  The third element of the communications plan involved a re-working of our written communications.  We came in for some criticism for the tone and language used in some of our written communications with the public.  A review of the notification letters, in particular, is underway.  The language is being personalised and we are enhancing the information that is provided for applicants, particularly with regard to the range of entitlements to services that people have which do not require a medical card.  That might help to reassure people that losing their medical card is not necessarily a catastrophic event, given that a range of other services and entitlements is still available to them.  </p><p>  The final element concerns the issue of discretion.  We are trying to explain that discretion is still available but that it is now being applied in a consistent, fair and equitable manner.  Medical officers are involved in the process and carry out individual, case-by-case assessments.  They pick up the phone and speak to the applicant's GP or consultant, as necessary.  Obviously, the ultimate objective is to ensure the people who need a card get one but the scheme operates within the confines of the statute and the resources available to us.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on the question of consistency because this committee is not so much concerned with policy but with the implementation of that policy in a correct manner.</p> <p>Therefore the expenditure of taxpayers funds is correct.  Every member of the delegation who has spoken today has alluded to an inconsistency or a previous inconsistency in terms of how medical cards were issued in the past.  I note the Comptroller and Auditor General in points 22.6 to 22.8, inclusive, of the report on eligibility for medical cards refers to an inconsistency between regions and that eligibility for medical cards was not consistent.  Can we call a spade a spade and clarify what this means?  Is it the luck of the draw?  If one lived in County Limerick and had a certain condition, one might have been granted a medical card on the grounds of discretion, whereas in County Donegal, discretion may have been applied separately.</p></speech>

We must remember, of course, that it is not that long since health services were provided by a multiplicity of health boards.  In respect of discretionary items, the Health Act 1970 confers that discretion on the chief executive officers of those health boards and although they came together to develop an uniform statement of discretion, it was implemented in over one hundred different places by a hundred different sets of people, many of whom did not know the other hundred.  It was inevitable that there would be inconsistent application of an apparently consistent policy.</p></speech>

I wish to raise the issue of deceased medical card holders.  I looked recently at the figures in relation to this issue and I was concerned to see a level, although lower than in the past, whereby the medical cards of the deceased were continuing to run up costs for the taxpayer.  Mr. Burke supplied the figures.  Of the 17,059 medical cards, 2,361 belonged to deceased people.  As far back as 2003, the then Comptroller and Auditor General had referred to the costs of medical cards being paid for people who had been deceased for up to 14 years.  Will he outline the present position?</p></speech>

We are linked electronically to the death events publication service.  A number of times each month, we get a data feed from the death events publication service and this is integrated into our systems.  On the notification of death, eligibility ceases for a medical card.  In the event of the family being slow in advising the death events publication service and we have paid capitation for a number of months, that is automatically recouped.  There are no overpayments for deceased medical card holders.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to historic cases that related to the previous system, in which the death of a person with a medical card was not communicated to the medical card service of the HSE.  We calculated the over-payment to GPs forensically, and I think, from memory, we recouped that two years ago.  We tightened up the legacy issue.  Now eligibility ceases on death and in the event of an overpayment, that is automatically recouped.</p></speech>

In fact, what I gave the committee was a reconciliation over a window of time, 1 March 2011.  I was reconciling the number of people who held eligibility vis a vis now.  As those individuals passed away, they were taken from the register.  There were no overpayments.</p></speech>

I am concerned that much of the discussion on probity - this word that has now entered the lexicon - the probity focus has been on medical cards being taken from people who currently hold them.  From what I have read and heard from the HSE and the Department of Health, there must be concern about over-payments made to GPs, pharmacists and other.  I have heard the Minister for Health publicly refer to claims for payments submitted by GPs and in some cases the HSE reaches a much lower agreed settlement figure with the GP involved.  Could Mr. Burke give me a feel for that?</p></speech>

This means that once one controls the register, notices of births and deaths and reviews on eligibility, one is controlling that aspect of the service.  Capitation is like a salary that is paid to GPs, but the HSE has control over it.  There are additional payments for annual, sick, maternity, paternity and study leave to GPs but they must provide the name and ID of a Locum to avail of it.  Certain subsidies are given for GP practice secretaries and nurses but they must provide, P35s and PPS numbers of the persons employed.  All of that expenditure is controlled.  Some time ago we identified trends in the GP out of hours service or special services with which we were not happy.  We challenged the GP community and in cases where we were not satisfied with a trend, we did not make a payment.  It was not a question of making a payment and looking to claim it back.  We unilaterally did not make a payment.  We negotiated with the GPs on the ambiguities that constitute a claim in an out of hours setting, and after a mediated process we have agreed with GPs and advised them on the explicit definition.  In the cases in which we had challenged the GPs and had not made the payments, we asked them to make a case on the validity of the claim as part of the mediated process.  In some cases we offered settlements.  If we were satisfied that the claims for out of hours services were valid and could verify them, we made a payment.  Where we were not, we made a settlement, and in the cases with which we were not happy, we made no payment at all.  During the past two to three years, when we have not been happy with a claim presented to us we simply do not pay.</p></speech>

There seems to be a very high level of "non response" when the HSE writes to an individual seeking information.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to it in his report and it has been alluded to in the figures presented to us today.  Am I correct in saying that a cohort of people who receive the letter, and have not left the country do not respond?  I am trying to get into the mindset of such people and the reason that they do not respond.  Does the content of the letter make people too fearful?  Has the HSE conducted research into the reasons for the high level of non response to the letters?</p></speech>

As part of the review process, a person with a medical card may now become eligible only for a GP visit card.  People may appeal decisions and be granted a medical card on appeal.  There is an absolute melting pot of activity in any particular month.</p><p>  When we write to individuals, the person may have decided that he or she is no longer eligible and does not respond to the communication.  We had a separate exercise in which we wrote to individuals who were not using their card and if they did not respond and did not confirm residency, we took them off the register.  On our database we have 2 million people between medical card and GP visit card holders.  Another 1.5 million people are registered under the long-term illness scheme, drugs payment scheme, Health (Amendment) Act.  In total the central register would have 3.5 million plus unique clients.  Even though access and touch off the service happens quite a lot, the address could be wrong.  Incorrect addresses could be an element of the reason for non response.  To safeguard the individual, we agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation and GPs, that if we had written to a client twice and if our address was wrong, when the client approached the GP, the GP could then move their eligibility for three moths to give them the opportunity to talk to the HSE.  We put that measure in as a safety blanket.  In the melting pot of transactional activity, there is churn, when people are fit and well they do not realise their card has expired and when they turn up at the GP, the GP realising he is not getting capitation urges them to get in touch with the HSE system and we assess their eligibility.</p></speech>

Mr. Burke has mentioned some of the processes relating to GPs.  We also have inspectorates for pharmacy and dental services.  They carry out reviews and audits.  Sanctions are available to us.

In the past three or four years we have conducted almost 300 individual inspections with the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Irish Medicines Board.  We all carry separate powers and strengths when we carry out our blitz of pharmacies.  We examine their financial circumstances, for example.  There has been that level of investigation in the sector.  In the past few years we have inspected a significant percentage of the country's approximately 1,700 pharmacies.</p></speech>

There is a real problem when Governments and Government Deputies make pronouncements in good faith.  For example, it was announced that there would be a reduction to service providers of 1.2% in 2013.  Service providers up and down the country have told us that they took a reduction of approximately 2%.  The precise figure they mention tends to vary.  In the case of one organisation, a 1.2% drop would have meant a reduction of &euro;234,000, whereas a 2% drop would have meant a reduction of &euro;390,000.  It is obvious that this makes a real difference in the provision of front-line services for people with disabilities.  In our own day-to-day interactions with these groups we have all seen the impact this has had.  I congratulate Mr. Byrne on his appointment and wish him well in his role as chief financial officer.  Why does 1.2% not always mean 1.2%?  Have service providers which were told they would be taking a cut of 1.2% had to take a greater cut?</p></speech>

In the service plans we propose to the Minister this year we will seek to be absolutely clear about the manner in which each of these things applies to each sector in order that it is fully and transparently described.</p></speech>

That brings me to my next difficulty.  I will give an example of what is happening in many organisations around the country.  I think I gave notice of my wish to discuss this case.  A service provider in my constituency, Sunbeam House Services, which is bound by the Haddington Road agreement was told to make a submission on what its savings would be under the agreement.  It made a submission stating its savings would be approximately &euro;77,000.  I fully accept that it would be irresponsible of me, as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, and irresponsible of the chief financial officer not to challenge all figures.  The HSE actually reduced the budget of the service provider in question by &euro;189,461, rather than &euro;77,000.  The difference between the two figures - a mammoth &euro;112,000 - had a massive impact on services, including the suspension of transport services.  Owing to the Rosetta system, reductions were not possible in some areas because these categories were not eligible.  To its credit, the HSE came back and returned some of the money, but why was it taken in the first place?  I expect organisations that know they are covered under the Haddington Road agreement to make the savings and they expect to make them.  The vast difference between &euro;77,000 and &euro;180,000 placed many vulnerable persons in a really difficult position.</p></speech>

We were obliged to issue that cut into the system.  Having obeyed the requirement to issue the figures, I made a decision within the HSE to draw &euro;147 million of that figure back to hold centrally when I realised that the effects of time-related savings across the board enabled me to do so.  It was not feasible.  I am aware of the situation at Sunshine Home.  We received from all parties details of the allocations they considered they could take and reviewed them across the board.  I believe those discussions continued to a satisfactory conclusion between both parties, but it was unfortunate.  We were, however, obliged to issue a figure.  We decided to take it and hold it centrally.</p></speech>

One cannot issue &euro;150 million across the system and expect an immediate payback on it.  As the Deputy said, negotiations on rosters, etc., need to be carried out.  I made a decision at the time that it was appropriate for this to be done and that is what happened.  As I have said, we agreed to a successful conclusion to the negotiations with Sunshine House on the savings it could deliver and those it can deliver in the future.</p></speech>

The HSE has carried out an extensive audit of another disability services provider in my constituency, St. Catherine's Association.  This matter has appeared on the front page of a national newspaper on at least two occasions.  I am concerned about a couple of aspects of the issue.  The HSE seems to have carried out a very extensive audit of how public moneys were spent in this service provider which does a great deal of extremely good work in my constituency.  How has an audit report that has not been seen by me or people whose children go to St. Catherine's ended up in the national media?  I do not believe it has been published.  Given that the audit seems to have appeared in such a comprehensive manner in the national media, I respectfully suggest the HSE look into who is leaking this document and the rationale behind that action.  As it has been reported on so significantly, I suggest the HSE publish the audit.</p><p>  I do not necessarily expect Mr. O'Brien to be able to respond directly to my final point, but I ask him to look into it.  In the scenario I have raised the HSE has been providing funding for a service provider for a number of years.  The HSE is not suggesting the funding was misappropriated - it is suggesting it was not spent in the manner in which it was meant to be spent.  It was spent on services for children with disabilities.  I would like to know, from the HSE's control point of view, how it took so many years for it to come across this.  Will Mr. O'Brien come back to me with an explanation for how it took so many years for the HSE to discover this issue and carry out an audit?  It is doing a huge disservice to the massive amount of work being done to sustain this service provider - the HSE is doing good work at local level to keep the show on the road - that this comprehensive audit report has appeared, in effect, in a national newspaper.  I am concerned about the leaking of this document.</p></speech>

I share the Deputy's concern about the apparent publication of sections of a report.  We are slightly constrained in how far we can go in this regard at a public forum.  There are processes that may need to be followed and they may be prejudiced, if I can use that term.  I ask Mr. Byrne to provide such information as it is reasonable to provide in these circumstances.</p></speech>

The relevant authorities were informed of the findings at the time.  It was not a comprehensive audit - it was actually a finance and governance review.  We provide funding for over 2,000 charities and disability services throughout the country.  Ours is one of a number of Government agencies that provide such funding.  The Department of Education and Skills also provides it.  We rely heavily, as any organisation would, on the accounts we receive annually from organisations of this nature.  In this case, we are talking about an independent limited liability company with its own board of directors and chairman and its own independent auditors.  We review the statutory accounts which are signed by auditors as being true and fair.</p> <p>Over a number of years we received that.  I could explain here but I will write back to the committee formally in detail.  An issue did arise a number of years ago in relation to this.  As Mr. Tony O'Brien has said, as a health service, we try to work with everyone.  We are very conscious of the 200 plus children with whom this charity deals.  If the company accounts are signed off and supplied to us we will go by those and review those.  We have meetings on a monthly basis with our regional managers of all of these service providers.  To a large extent one would be inclined to say that the matter, when it arose, arose through the fact that the Revenue Commissioners advised us that a note of attachment was coming through.  That was the first notification we had that there was an issue.  We took it up with the board which is being addressed.  Again, I would be circumspect in discussing further as to what has happened.

In regard to the awarding of cards on a discretionary basis and the role of a medical officer in deciding on an appeal, I am interested to find out a little more about this new process.  Perhaps the witnesses would talk me through how the process works.  What is the function of the medical officer?  Is there any oversight in terms of the medical offer who makes the decision or recommendation?</p></speech>

When a person has been assessed against the guidelines he or she may wish to bring health, social or other material.  In quite a number of cases we can see very quickly whether the card should be granted or whether discretion should apply.  There are circumstances where we want or need medical officers to review the case.  We have a team of medical officers spread locally across the country, headed up by a principal medical officer.  In circumstances where an applicant provides us with material about some health or social circumstance and they cross over, all that material on file is passed to the medical officer.  They meet on a regular basis.  They will say themselves that in nine cases out of ten they can make their decision very quickly by looking at the circumstances.  They are medical doctors and they know the health services and the schemes and how health services are delivered.</p></speech>

As well as that they know the services, the schemes in place and how health services are delivered.  They are able to identify if the client can be supported and, if so, in what way.  They conduct that assessment.  If there are situations they find difficult they come together as a group twice a week to discuss those individual cases.  On foot of those individual assessments or case conferences they make a recommendation to the deciding officer who will look at their recommendation.</p></speech>

That is a view that is out there.  I am not saying it is correct but it is a view that has been communicated to me by constituents who have found themselves in difficult circumstances and are in the process of appealing decisions.  One of the other issues that arises in that context is the apparent inability of some constituents of mine to access information records in terms of how that decision was made.  I know of a number of examples where individuals are pursuing freedom of information requests to try to access that material.  Would it be a more transparent process and in the interests of the HSE and citizens if they had access to that information in a much more open fashion?  That is an issue that is hanging over this process.  Clearly, if one is the parent of an ill or disabled child and one's medical card is withdrawn, one has to deal with that particular trauma and fight the system to try to get as much information as possible in order to come to some kind of an understanding as to how that decision was arrived at?  Do the witnesses have any comments on that?</p></speech>

It is a good point and transparency is obviously important in the operation of the scheme.  The group of 12 medical officers, overseen by a principal medical officer, 13 in total, operate to a standard operating procedure.  We will have a look at the issue.  It is important that we put that into the public domain in order that there is good transparency and knowledge about how the process works and the way it works.  The individual medical officers also liaise closely with the patient's GP and consultant, as necessary, if there is an issue of clarity that they may wish to bring to the decision making process.  We will certainly look at the issue of transparency and bringing that into the public domain in a better manner than is currently the case.</p></speech>

We will share that with the client whenever we can.  It might be important to put on the record that we can have applications where an individual applicant may have a life-threatening condition, for example, motor neurone disease.  We have had a number of examples where a medical officer will always look at that.  If one has net income in excess of &euro;10,000 per week or &euro;6,000 per week or &euro;4,000 then the decision of the medical officer and the team will be that individual, difficult as their individual circumstances are, can access general practitioner services without financial hardship.</p></speech>

In those instances, as they assess it, they can arrive quickly at a decision.  It is only where the net income is closer to the demarcation line that there will be that case conference conversation.</p></speech>

Given that it ultimately comes back to a financial calculation they receive a financial statement which sets out the information that has been taken into account and shows the calculations.  There is that level of transparency.  Clearly it should never be necessary for a person to resort to FOI in order to get that kind of information.  Also it may be useful for public representatives to be aware that when they are presented with people who have an issue with the outcome of their determination that their attention might be brought to the statement they receive.  Sometimes we find that people make a case that is not about the financial assessment but about their view of what the medical card system should be as opposed to what it currently is.</p></speech>

If it ever proves difficult for the HSE to recoup outstanding moneys from GPs what kind of sanctions does the HSE impose on that GP, if any?</p></speech>

Therefore, we now link in death events automatically.  We also identify any individuals on the register who may have been granted eligibility for an extended length of time and we have reviewed all of those.  Where we found somebody was on the register, but found no activity over a period with a general practitioner, pharmacist, dentist, optician or whatever - there is extensive data at the back of the register in the context of reimbursement - we wrote to those people to establish whether they are still resident.  If on foot of a number of pieces of correspondence the person did not make contact, we ended his or her eligibility.  We have a safety blanket in the process so that if one of those individuals is fit and well and goes to the GP, he or she can be reinstated.  Does this answer the question?</p></speech>

When cards are reviewed for renewal, the number of cards not extended for renewal tend to fall under three main headings.  One group relates to patients who have died and these cards are dealt with now by recovery, back to the day the patient died.  Some clients decide not to renew, for various reasons.  Perhaps they have returned to work or their circumstances have changed.  The third group relates to people who are refused on means grounds.  Within the middle group, the non-renewal group, some of these may have left the State or gone abroad.  Therefore, it is difficult to be precise.  With the amount of outward migration, I imagine significant numbers fall into this group.</p></speech>

To be clear on the issue of discretionary cards, significant media attention has focused on this area and serious concerns have been expressed in our constituency offices.  Many people fear losing these cards.  What has changed to cause this reaction?  I think I know the answer, but I want the HSE to clarify this.</p></speech>

The response to this is understandable and there seems to be a general view that the medical card scheme should operate on the basis that where certain medical conditions exist, medical cards should be granted.  However, as we explained earlier, that is not the way the medical card scheme operates.</p><p>  The guidelines on how we apply discretion have not changed, but over the years there have been some changes to the primary qualification process for medical cards.  This obviously has an impact on the discretionary guidelines above that.  However, the primary change has been that the centralised process, the consistent application of the guidelines and an active process of review have led to a situation where a significant number of medical cards held previously are no longer held.  Individuals have significant concerns about the impact on them and have expressed those concerns and society in general and the media are reflecting the concern that results from that.</p></speech>

There can be an interval between the death and registration, because there is no compulsion regarding a particular timeline for that.  The DEPS is the primary source used by all State agencies to ensure the veracity of population type registers - whether for screening, benefits or GP visit cards.

Therefore, as well as determining eligibility, we also have the reimbursement function to the 6,500 contractors who provide 80 million transaction items in the primary care field.  The total card of the medical card and primary care scheme is approximately &euro;2.4 billion.  That is our global figure, but there are economies of scale as we centralise medical cards because we are using part of the machinery and systems that are in place for reimbursement.  Our operating costs for 2012, as a percentage of our total spend, were approximately 1.13% of that.  In 2011, the cost was 1.02%.  If we draw a comparison -----</p></speech>

In other words, the cost of administering the service in its entirety was 1.13% of that in 2012 and 1.02% in 2011.  In comparison, comparable reimbursement entities such as Blue Cross, Kaiser or VHI have operating costs from 7% to 10%.  The figure of 1.13% is the overall cost of the administration of the reimbursement and assessment of eligibility.</p><p>  As Mr. O'Brien said earlier, we had an operation which was distributed nationally, involving 450 or more individuals and whatever governance was over each of those. </p> <p>We have now centralised it and there are approximately 150 people there.  The efficiencies in head count allowed the HSE run down its staffing or HR.  Centralisation enabled us to allow some who had previously been involved in that process to become involved in other frontline processes and others to exit the administration.</p></speech>

It made very good business sense to centralise from the point of view of the cost of operating local offices in each of the health boards to administer medical cards.  The saving was in excess of 100 wholetime equivalents who were redeployed into other areas.  Aside from the benefits of a single system and standard operating procedures, rights of appeal and consistency, it resulted in a significant reduction in overhead costs.</p></speech>

Reductions in the overall cost of the drugs that we supply to our 2 million customers, or 3.8 million if we take the other schemes into account, have been in the order of &euro;1 billion.  That has resulted from new and changing supply arrangements with the industry, the proprietary manufacturers and the generic industry.  It has come from efforts to reduce individual prices and negotiations with individual companies.  It has been pushed further with the introduction of the legislation this year to push out reference pricing and where there is a generic equivalent the total drugs bill is approximately &euro;400 million.  We aim to take &euro;50 million out of half of it by the middle of next year.  That will push on next year and the year after.</p></speech>

I have sometimes bought it here because things happen when one is moving around, and it cost &euro;28, for the same quantity of the drug, approximately 100 capsules.

The first drug has been subject to reference pricing as a result of which it is priced at 70% less than previously.  That is a first step.  We intend to do significantly more of that on a progressive basis.  It is interesting to note that, despite reducing the price for a particular manufacturer in effect by 70% it is still sufficiently interested in the market to put full page advertisements in the newspapers to encourage people to continue taking its product at the 30% rate.  We think that there is significant scope in that area and that is why we are aiming for a &euro;50 million budget cut in that area for the coming year.</p></speech>

Will there be real-time information?  The public struggles to get accurate information on costings and so on and they seem to change.  Will this be part of a new, connected health initiative?</p></speech>

Something that is often missed in discussion of the accounts of the HSE is that we receive a clean audit annually.  It was part of my comment, and the Comptroller and Auditor General has commented, that the accounts systems are not fit for purpose.  I would say that refers to the purpose for which they are intended in the future.  We have a disparate system, formerly four health boards, a number of systems, applications and products, SAP, systems across the country and we do not have a common chart of accounts.  It will not be an easy task to develop the new financial model as I know coming from a base of some experience in this area.  It will start with very simple facts, a common chart of accounts and rolling out an integrated system of finance across the health service.  We do not know the costs involved at this stage.  The initial tender has gone out.  PA Consulting has been appointed to carry out the work on delivering the business case which we would hope to have ready in quarter one for issue to tender for support and delivery of this system.</p><p>  I come to this with some past experience.  It is not an easy task but it is absolutely essential for the health service.  It will start with the simple fact of systemising the accounts and bringing them all to one truth, as we like to say.  It is a difficult move because there are approximately 15 different systems across the country.  In response to your comment about administration staff, it is important as well to take into consideration the back office issues, 60% of my finance team produce information and that should be down at 20% or 30%.  That is necessary because with the systems we have we report in different formats, by region, care group etc.  The process has started.  We are working with PA Consulting to develop the business case to go to tender for delivery of this. </p></speech>

It is long overdue to judge by what we see in regard to accuracy and so on.</p><p>  On a separate issue, in my constituency there is an area where service providers whose budget was cut have to manage an increase in salary.  That means in real terms they are cut by 3% or 4% because they have to comply with the Haddington Road or Croke Park agreements, or whatever the case may be.  This is having a huge effect on the ground.  I have come across a real problem in respect of personal assistance for pre-school providers and have gone around the block on it.  I thought the Department of Social Protection looked after this, or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but I understand that the HSE does.  To get a personal assistant depends on what county I am in and who the provider is.  I know of three cases where four-year-olds who have serious physical disabilities are not being granted personal assistants.</p> <p>Yet, if they lived in another part of the country, there would be no problem.  By centralising the issuing of medical cards and discretionary medical cards at least we will have a fairer system.  This is a huge issue.  For these parents and these children next year is no good to them.  While the HSE and the service-provider might be fighting over budgets and politics might be involved, that is no good to these four year-olds.  I am struggling to get an answer to this and it is being raised as a Topical Issue matter in the Chamber today.  There seems to be no one in charge or from what I can see, there seems to be no standardisation.  I ask the witnesses to come back to me as a matter of urgency if they do not have an answer today.</p></speech>

I have one question about discretionary medical cards.  I note that approximately 5.5% of medical cards are awarded on a discretionary basis.  Mr. O'Brien gave some explanation as to how the HSE decides on discretionary cards.  This issue was raised at my party's parliamentary party meeting and there was considerable anger expressed by certain Deputies over the fact that those decisions on discretionary medical cards were not made locally because at a local level people can be much more aware of the actual situation of the individuals and families concerned.  A further note of anger which I want to convey to the witnesses is that when dealing with the office in Finglas which makes the decisions, it is not possible to deal with the same person when discussing an ongoing case.  It would be much more satisfactory if the process is being administered centrally that at least one was able to deal with the same person on any subsequent discussion.  This is part of the same issue.  Could such decisions be made at local level?  If they have to be made at central level, could one at least be able to deal with the same person rather than have to deal with different people all the time?  One of the problems of centralising everything is that the patient is faceless.  That is one of the biggest problems with public service and the Civil Service, that if one is not dealing with people on a face-to-face basis, it is very easy to forget that they are human beings.</p></speech>

We have been listening very carefully to the feedback over the past number of weeks about the controversy about medical cards.  One of the important messages coming through is that while there are significant strengths in a centralised system, with help lines and customer service, it still poses a difficulty for a significant number of people who would prefer to deal face-to-face with the health service.  For that reason and as part of our current initiative we intend to strengthen the information and support available at local health centres and to provide an opportunity for people to be able to walk in and to discuss any problem with the application or with the application of discretion.  That point is acknowledged and has been taken on board that we need a better blend between the advantages of a centralised system and the level of support, information and assistance available at local health centres.  We will be working to ensure that balance is better.</p></speech>

We are trying to ensure that we have a single system in place so that the patient should be getting the same answer irrespective of who is dealing with them.  We have a new head of customer service and a new customer service department and this section can escalate particular issues if required.  As Mr. Hennessy said, we have a wider communications plan to continually make people aware of what other schemes are in place and what they need to do when filling out paperwork.  We also aim to provide a standard customer service to everyone.  I am not sure that it will be possible for the same individual to deal with the same query every day.  We should be able to deal with any patient or client who comes to us in a consistent and standardised way.  Our training will be aimed at such an outcome.</p></speech>

I apologise if my questions have already been asked by other members.  I was struck with the extraordinary increase of 74% since 2005.  The HSE marched everyone up to the top of the hill and gave them these cards and now it is telling them that the number of medical cards must be reduced. Is that a difficult decision for the HSE?</p></speech>

The Deputy's question almost implies that we had a specific target.  What we are doing is applying the rules that exist.  Clearly it is a difficulty, more so for the individuals than it is for us, if a card which a person has come to depend on is removed by reason of his or her loss of eligibility for it.</p></speech>

Quite a number of others lose their cards for various other reasons such as they do not choose to renew, they have left the area or circumstances have changed and they decide not to proceed.

Once an individual has made an application there is a concern about how quickly that will be dealt with.  We receive representations from a number of areas asking about the status of applications.  In the older system there were circumstances where an application was treated cradle to grave by one individual locally and they could be approached by anybody making representations.  In the current system duties are separated.  We have different people at post level and review level.  We have data captured and put into a central engine.  No one individual would have oversight of an application process from cradle to grave.  Separate to that we have a call centre, customer support and a dedicated Oireachtas line.  We receive representations from Oireachtas Members via that line and they ask about the status of applications, what an unsuccessful applicant should do next, whether they have missed something.  They could be trying to help the individual.</p></speech>

As we have centralised that we have provided the platform where we receive electronic feeds of data from Revenue.  We also have access to social protection data.  We are joining up government.  As we go forward and talk about being able to conduct 1 million reviews next year, quite an amount of those will be reviews on the basis of information we have.  We do not intend to review and ask 1 million people to provide us with chapter and verse.  A risk assessment is done on the basis of the information flows we receive.  As that system moves forward over the next number of years exactly the same will happen as our links with the Department of Social Welfare develop.  We should be in a situation where we can provide an applicant with his or her health eligibility on foot of one assessment without asking that individual to provide information.</p><p>  While the 1 million reviews would seem a challenge, over the past two years we have conducted more than 900,000 reviews.  We are answering questions raised in this forum by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  When we confer eligibility we confer a medical credit card.  While it may be free for the individual who uses it, it incurs a cost to the taxpayer, and that cost could be &euro;1,000 or &euro;100,000.  In exactly the same way as we want to ensure everyone who is eligible for a medical card receives one, we should be able on an annual or biannual basis be able to confirm that the person has eligibility to use a medical credit card at the taxpayer's expense.</p></speech>

One of the benefits of that central system is that it gives us capacity use automation and technology to do more with fewer people.

Unfortunately, there was such resistance to centralisation from every quarter that we decided to centralise first and standardise and apply probity as we proceeded.  We all know the result of that, namely, that we were obliged to deal with the backlog that arose in the latter part of 2011 and early in 2012.  As we move forward with the centralised operation, we have already built in links with the Revenue Commissioners and we are establishing them with the Department of Social Protection and general practitioners.  The new system is much more amenable to control.  As we communicate with our clients, we are seeking to ensure that they know what is expected of them.  At the same time, we will start to develop a challenge to anyone who is identified as providing incorrect information or anything of that nature.  A small number are referred to our solicitors in order to answer questions.  The answer to the Deputy's question about whether anyone has been prosecuted is "No".  This is a work in progress as we centralise the operation and begin to use its strengths.</p></speech>

Traditionally, the review process and the review date have been used as the control mechanism.  The test for knowingly providing false information in order to claim an entitlement with criminal intent is a much higher test than that which would normally be employed here.  In terms of a change in circumstances being picked up on renewal - perhaps due to a cardholder returning to work, for example - strictly speaking and under the provisions of the legislation, his or her card should have been returned.  This tends not to happen too often.</p></speech>

We all want those whose cases are worthy to receive their medical cards.  Ninety-nine percent of those to whom I refer have worthy cases.  Any of us in possession of a medical card whose income rose above the threshold might retain it in the hope that nobody would notice.  That is probably quite natural.  When someone is identified as having retained his or her card despite having exceeded the income limit, he or she is not charged with having committing a criminal offence under the law.  I do not know whether the law is right or wrong in this regard, but nothing is being done.  Is the PCRS not under an obligation to do something in respect of those who hold on to medical cards to which they are not entitled once it discovers that this is the case?</p></speech>

It is manifestly clear that there is a commonly held belief that discretionary medical cards have been granted, should be granted or are granted in the context of the mere existence of a medical condition.  This is a widely held perception which is only really being challenged now in terms of the public understanding of it.  Indeed, this perception has been reflected to some extent during these proceedings.  It also seems clear that there is a widely held misconception to the effect that because these cards - like credit cards - include an expiry date, once one qualified when one applied, one has an entitlement up to that expiry date.  By means of the centralisation, standardisation and communications processes, we are clarifying what constitutes true eligibility.  We were asked earlier about the cost-benefit balance and the amount of resources we invest.  In circumstances in which we genuinely do not believe - unless a barn-door case appears - that there is any prospect of being able to prove that someone set out, with criminal intent, to falsely obtain a medical card, we do not take action.  The resources we would be obliged to allocate in order to follow up every instance in which a person is identified as having held a medical card when it was clear that they should not have had one would be completely disproportionate to the benefit.  Our resources are much better deployed in ensuring that medical cards are held appropriately.  Where they are not so held, it is probably because someone has exceeded the threshold probably without even realising it.  At that point, we end their eligibility.</p><p>  As we move forward with the process and reach a point at which we expect that people should have a better understanding and at which we have communicated with them clearly, we will be seeking to do two things in circumstances in which we can prove retrospectively that someone has falsely obtained a medical card.  The first of these is to ensure that the matter is referred to the appropriate authorities with regard to the offence committed, in respect of which there is a small fine.  The second is that in the context of the greater amount of money involved - namely, the cost to the public purse through capitation fees, free entitlement to medications, etc. - in providing that medical card, we might well be in a position to consider taking civil action to recover that cost.</p> <p>We do not believe that we have got to that point yet.</p></speech>

Links with the Department of Social Protection and Revenue are key to that.  There is an awareness of the issue.

That was followed up by intensive work involving a reform board, which was chaired by Tony O'Brien and on which I sit.  This is to look at the total financial control and management system of the health system in all its aspects.  The first significant change in that was the appointment of the chief financial officer, Thomas Byrne, to take over responsibility for the totality of the HSE budget.  My Department has been actively and fully involved in the design of the new reform system which will ensure the appropriate controls and governance are in the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive and other agencies for which the Department will be accountable.</p><p>  In respect of the Department, I have commissioned a reform of the Department of Health and there will be announcements in due course about the shape of that.  I have been actively involved as Secretary General in the reform programme in ensuring the Department of Health has oversight of, say, the new hospital grouping structures and is actively and directly involved in, for example, the arrangements in respect of the children's hospital and other developments.  I can assure the Chairman that we are very actively involved and I would be happy to give him details of that as he sees fit.</p></speech>

I questioned Mr. Watt when he was before the committee the last day and we asked for a response.  It took him a considerable length of time to get together a paragraph to explain that there is a business plan being put together.  Why has it taken all that time to get to the point where the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has encouraged the HSE to introduce a single business coding system and so on and still it is not dealt with?  The members find it frustrating that they cannot get answers on the analysis of various issues or problems that might arise and we are told it is down to the computer system, the 15 different centres and yet, as a big business, the HSE made an application to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform sometime early this year and it is still not dealt with.</p> <p>What is the reason for the delay when the people in the HSE accounts section - I do not say it is Mr. Byrne, but other people who were in place before him - assured us that a system had been identified which was not so much off-the-shelf but could be purchased and put into effect immediately?</p></speech>

That was supported with some external expertise and with Mr. Byrne once he was appointed.  The purpose of that was to agree on a consensus basis the nature of the system we should be seeking from a business point of view, bearing in mind that the health system is about to go through substantial organisational change.  In order to seek to ensure the best possible passage for our business case when it goes into DPER we felt it appropriate to have that level of discussion.  The board concluded its considerations at the turn of September into October.  Presentations were made to the relevant Ministers in the Department of Health to ensure that it aligned with their expectations of what would be required in the future and it was agreed at that point by the board that following the consultation the business case would be developed for formal submission to DPER, which is what is currently happening.</p></speech>

As one would expect, they will seek to interrogate and validate to ensure that they are satisfied that what we are seeking meets the business objectives and in accordance with their own processes they will then approve it in due course.  We will then have to procure the system in accordance with public procurement requirements.

All of the time we are trying to improve communications between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Oireachtas.  We will do everything we can to ensure a quick and speedy response.  We probably need to look at the communications systems on the ground between Deputies, Senators, the HSE and service providers.  I came from another era when one had regular meetings and contacts with Deputies, Senators, county councillors and other local authority members.  We were always in a position to help them.  We should examine whether we could improve the communication across the political system with the health system in the coming years.</p></speech>

Mr. Burke said that some local health offices would be geared up to handle aspects of the medical card queries so we will have a local element back again.

A training programme was already under way for those staff to accommodate the changes announced in the budget this year and to deal with the calls from the public concerning that.  We were able to enhance that to deal with the anxiety and concern that was triggered by the controversy in the media in recent weeks.

I welcome also that it is getting control of the vast bulk of the applications but if I filled the Gallery this morning with people who had their medical cards taken from them or who found out their medical cards were taken from them, they would not believe what they were hearing from Mr. Hennessy.  There are cases which I do not want to go through one by one but rather I will give Mr. Hennessy two extreme examples, and they represent quite a number of people who have turned up at my clinic, and I am sure is the case elsewhere.  The son of a 91 year old woman went to the chemist to get the medication and was told he could not have it because the medical card has been cut off.  I have raised this with the HSE already.</p><p>  The second case involved a woman undergoing cancer treatment for a second time who applied for a medical card but was turned down.  The reason I raise that particular case is because Mr. Hennessy has done something else in regard to the medical cards.  When someone applies for a medical card and is refused, he or she is entitled to a review or an appeal or may go for a review and automatically go to appeal subsequently.  I have seen letters issued from the HSE telling people who asked for a review or an appeal that because they have offered no new evidence they will not be granted the review or appeal.  That is quite different from what I have experienced with the system previously because in any decision the wrong decision may have been made.</p><p>  I have attended meetings with general practitioners who have complained bitterly that they are being forced to write letter after letter to the HSE in support of an applicant who is entitled to the medical card but who for some reason is not getting their message across.  Consultants who are now being asked for letters by patients to support their application are becoming annoyed that they are being drawn into a whole bureaucracy that they simply not cannot afford to manage in their day's work.</p><p>  Has the HSE consulted with the GPs on this issue, the changes to the medical cards for children under five or GP cards because their complaints are that they are stressed by much of what is being imposed on them?  I would like Mr. Hennessy's views on the review and appeal system.  For those patients who are waiting for an application, a review or an appeal there should be a process in place whereby the card is kept open until such time as they are refused and are outside the system following a review or an appeal.</p></speech>

I do not think it would be fair to talk to the particular examples but I can tell the Chairman with certainty that nobody is cut off without repeated notice and without getting the reasons that decision has been taken, and they are outlined in a schedule that accompanies the letter notifying the person; I think the general practitioner is notified as well.</p><p>  Regarding rights of review and appeal, I am somewhat baffled by the letters the Chairman is citing but I would be happy to view them off-line with him because there is a standard right of review and a standard right of appeal, in a consistent manner, that accompanies all the correspondence.  If there is some aberrant letter out there denying applicants or the public the right of review and appeal, I would be very interested in seeing it.</p></speech>

As the director general has said, there is one medical card.  As we assess an individual we may have to exercise discretion.  In some circumstances we will have to involve our medical officers to look at medical or other circumstances that are being brought to bear.  As our medical officers across the country looked at material presented to us on foot of an application we found absolute differences with people making applications.  In terms of what we did, in some cases applicants would get a letter from their GP.  We sought to standardise that.  We engaged over a period of a year talking to general practice and the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, about how we would have a standard form on which GP to GP could communication and set out tritely the type of information our medical officers would have to allow them assess eligibility.  I have already said it was difficult to get that agreement from general practice because in some cases where an individual is looking for a medical card they may well be losing the private patient.  We have pushed the point that we simply want general practitioners to help an individual work through their application.</p><p>  We have sat down with GPs.  We have put forward, as agreed by our medical panel, a standard form that could be communicated, not near administration but GP to GP, setting out the medical circumstances we want as an aid to the applicant in pursuing their application and having whatever discretion needed to be brought to bear.  Those are the circumstances in that regard.</p><p>  Regarding the schedule, we agree a schedule with an applicant.  An applicant makes an application to us.  We provide back a detail of what we believe to be their outgoings and their income, and we try to agree that schedule.  I mentioned already that we have issued close to 1 million of those.  In conversations with other TDs yesterday they made the point about making it more granular.  We are making it more granular but it might be no harm if I read into the record the first or second paragraph of the letter that will go out to people today.  This is where an individual has not been successful.  It states:<blockquote>Thank you for your recent application for a Medical Card/GP Visit Card.  <br />I am enclosing a statement detailing your income and outgoings based on the information you have provided.  This shows that your application is over the financial threshold set out ...  This means that you and your dependants ... are not eligible for a Medical Card ... If you believe the statement is incorrect, please supply information to allow us to check this for you.<br />Your current Medical Card ... will continue until ...<br />We want to ensure that you continue to hold your Medical Card/GP Visit Card if you are eligible.  To do this, we want to check with you if you have information that you <b>did not send us</b> that could make a difference.  <br /><b>Additional information you can provide</b><br />We wish to give you the opportunity to send additional relevant information ...

Regarding what Mr. McLoughlin said earlier about informing and educating people and upskilling the people in the call centres, it might be no harm if we were brought into the loop because we are the ones at the coalface dealing with some of the legitimate cases that are not being acknowledged for one reason or another in the HSE's medical card application system.  While I have found many of the people we deal with very helpful, and some of them are here, we need to know much more in terms of the manner in which it is conducting its business to allow us at least relate to those making the applications.</p><p>  I would also ask the witnesses to bear in mind the fact that many people to whom they are sending these letters, application forms, renewal forms and the random audit forms are elderly and do not have a clue what to do with them in some cases.  They are going to citizens advice centres.  They are coming to our clinics.  Deputy Ross asked if we can influence them.  All we are doing is offering them information and guidance but it is unfair to some that they are now allowed a good deal of time to submit the information and deal with it because they are elderly, sick or are waiting for a consultant's or a doctor's report in some cases.</p></speech>

An article appeared a few weeks ago in a national newspaper about general practitioners claiming treatment fees for dead medical card holders.  It referred to family doctors having claimed more than &euro;1.5 million in taxpayers' money for treating medical card holders who were dead or who do not exist.  According to the article, the aforementioned figure in overpayments was identified by the Health Service Executive, HSE, last year but not a cent has been repaid and a deadline of 31 October was set for doctors who received the overpayments.  While this matter was touched on briefly earlier in this meeting, I wish to delve into a little further, because I tabled a parliamentary question on it to which, in fairness, I should note I received a reply within three days.</p></speech>

If the notification is delayed and we have overpaid the GP, for argument's sake in the event that an individual passes away in April but the death events publication service does not tell us until September, we immediately recoup any gap in that regard.  It is done automatically and there are no overpayments.  That is one point.</p></speech>

We conducted a forensic examination of that, which came to a different sum than that mentioned and we recouped every cent.  Consequently, there are no legacy overpayments.</p></speech>

I am delighted to be here and I always value the opportunity to brief the committee ahead of any of my attendance at the General Affairs Council.  I will give the committee a report on events since the last meeting.  I will also refer to questions from colleagues at the previous meeting.  I will give an update on the pertinent points raised with me.</p><p>  One of the key roles of the General Affairs Council is to support the development of the European Council agenda.  Along with the Taoiseach I was pleased to brief the D&aacute;il last week on the outcome of the October Council meeting, the agenda of which was particularly lengthy, including a dedicated and productive debate on the digital economy innovation and services.</p> <p>It also covered, youth unemployment, banking union and the broader work currently under way on Economic and Monetary Union, as well as migration and other issues.  We took an active part in the work of the Council, not least in the context of the priority which the Government accords to many of the matters that were discussed.  A range of opinions always emerges in these debates but it is in the final conclusions that agreement is reached.  A further priority for Ireland at the European Council was to flag the potential contribution of the digital sector to the effort to tackle youth unemployment.  We were pleased that, as a result, this issue was also addressed at the Paris summit on youth unemployment, which the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, attended earlier this week.</p><p> Since our previous meeting, I have been continuing to build up relationships with my counterparts in other member states.  I visited Rome and Athens at the end of October and had very productive discussions with Ministers in both cities.  Greece and Italy are, for course, to two states which will hold the Presidency in 2014.  I gained valuable insights in both capitals, particularly in the context of youth unemployment and migration issues.  Last week I visited London and Edinburgh and met the my counterpart, the Minister of State at the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office, Mr. David Lidington, MP.  I will be continuing to reach out to my colleagues in all member states.  It is essential to take every opportunity to ensure that Irish positions are understood at political level and that we keep up to date on the developing priorities and challenges for our partners.</p><p> I will now deal with next week's General Affairs Council.  The agenda includes a number of important presentations by both the Commission and the Presidency.  These will cover: the European Commission work programme for 2014; the roadmap on the implementation of the 2014 European semester; the Commission's annual growth survey for 2014; and a Presidency report on the implementation of European Council conclusions.  The draft agenda for the December European Council will also be presented.  Under any other business, my colleagues and I will also be briefed on the EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region as well as on a subsidiarity review carried out in the Netherlands.  I am aware, of course, that members will be particularly interested in the latter.</p><p> The presentation of the Commission work programme is the first agenda item.  As members will be aware, the background to this is that each year an annual work programme outlining how the European Commission President's political guidelines for the 2009 to 2014 will be implemented is published.  The 2014 programme was published on 22 October and this will be the first opportunity to review it at political level.  I understand that members had a meeting with Barbara Nolan, Head of the Commission Representation, earlier this week and I would be interested to hear any of their feedback on that.  In reviewing the programme we must recognise that the term of the current Commission ends next year.  It is no surprise, therefore, that the focus is inevitably on delivery and implementation.  I am pleased that, very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s priorities, the programme is geared towards completing work on measures aimed at consolidating financial and economic stability and promoting growth and jobs.  In a break from the usual format, the 2014 programme sets out which legislative files the Commission believes should be prioritised by the Council and the European Parliament.  The aim is to achieve agreement on these before the European elections next May.  I welcome this as a sensible and realistic approach.  I especially welcome the continued focus of the Commission&rsquo;s work programme on growth and jobs, with a particular emphasis on combating youth unemployment.</p><p> In the economic and financial area, the Commission has committed to completing the banking union, the urgency of which was emphasised by the European Council last week.  Ireland supports the Commission in its drive for quick agreement on the single resolution mechanism, the bank recovery and resolution Directive and the deposit guarantee schemes.  When I was last before the committee, Deputy Eric Byrne made reference to the digital market, its value and the work that is being done in respect of it.  In that context, I am happy to report that great strides have been made to finalise many of the outstanding files for completing the Single Market, with particular reference to the digital Single Market.  I welcome the strong focus in the work programme in respect of this matter.  Important files in this area include e-identification and signatures, public procurement and e-invoicing in public procurement.  I am also pleased to note that the work programme continues the Commission's focus on bilateral trade agreements, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, negotiations with the US, which are of particular interest to Ireland.</p><p> A limited number of new initiatives for 2014 are also set out in the work programme.  These include a labour mobility package and an initiative on resource efficiency and waste.  While the current Commission accepts that these new proposals will not come to fruition before the end of its term, they may well contribute to the agenda and immediate priorities of the new Commission.  Deputy Durkan has on many occasions referred to the status of industrial policy and made the point that while the development of the digital economy is welcome, it is not something in which every existing or potential worker in our overall economy will be able to participate.  I am pleased that the list of new initiatives includes an industrial policy package.  We fully support the need for a strong industrial base which can deliver a robust and thriving real economy for business and society.  It is important to fully exploit the potential of the inter-linkages and mutual dependency between manufacturing and services in particular.  In its work programme the Commission also commits itself to a wide range of preparatory and exploratory work to help prepare the ground for some key decisions to be taken in future years.</p><p> At our previous meeting Deputy Dara Murphy referred to regulatory competitiveness and the need to ensure that the regulations in place - with particular references to those relating to small and medium-sized companies - will be fit for purpose.  In this regard, the Commission is taking a fresh look at existing legislation in order to ensure that it is fit for purpose.  The work programme lists a range of legislative acts which the Commission aims to recast and simplify as part of its regulatory fitness programme, otherwise known as REFIT.  This has emerged as a key priority for President Barroso and is something we very much welcome.  It is essential that we continue to see real and timely progress in the reduction of regulatory burden, especially for SMEs and micro-enterprises.</p><p> The work programme also includes a long list of legislative proposals which the Commission has decided to withdraw.  This is mainly due to the fact that these proposals have been overtaken by new ones, have become obsolete or in respect of which, in a few instances, agreement within Council or between the Council and Parliament has become impossible.  Departments are still studying the text but overall our initial assessment of the Commission work programme 2014 is positive.  What remains to be seen is how much can be achieved in the final year of this Commission's mandate, particularly in view of the time constraints created by the European Parliament elections at the end of May.  I am, however, looking forward to the Commission&rsquo;s presentation and I will be feeding this into our national considerations.</p><p> I again welcome the fact that this committee has already engaged with the Commission on the work programme.  This is very positive in the context of the recent initiative for the planned identification of priorities for detailed scrutiny by all sectoral committees.  In the past, a matter of discussion for this committee and others has revolved around when they should pitch their interventions.  In other words, when should they engage with the Commission or the Parliament.  There is little point engaging with them when everything is cast and when things are already happening.  I welcome the fact that the committee - through Barbara Nolan - has already engaged with the Commission.  I understand it has also extended an invitation to the Secretary General of the European Commission, Catherine Day.  Again, this is a very good idea and I wish the committee success with it.</p><p> From a national as well as a strategic EU perspective, it is crucial that committees focus on the proposals which are of most relevance.  This year is, of course, different because of the approaching end of term for the Commission.  Nevertheless, the annual work programmes are an invaluable tool for committees seeking to engage effectively with EU policy making.</p><p> I will now deal with the second agenda item, namely the European semester.  At our previous meeting, Deputy Kyne referred to this matter and posed a number of questions on it.  I wish to provide him and other colleagues an update on the position in this regard in the context of the General Affairs Council.  As many members will be aware, the European semester lies at the heart of the EU's stronger, post-crisis economic governance arrangements.</p> <p>It is fundamentally about developing and implementing the Union&rsquo;s jointly agreed priorities to support growth and jobs, underpinned by the enhanced Stability and Growth Pact and the Europe 2020 strategy.  The General Affairs Council, GAC, will continue preparations for next year's European semester process informed by two important inputs, a presentation by the Commission of the annual growth survey 2014 and a  presentation by the Presidency and the incoming Presidency of the Roadmap for the European Semester 2014.</p><p> The Commission produced the annual growth survey yesterday setting out the broad EU economic priorities for the year to come.  This marks the first key step in the annual cycle.  The main message of annual growth survey 2014 is that biggest challenge now facing Europe&rsquo;s economy is how to sustain the recovery that is now under way.  It presses strongly for a continued emphasis on five main priorities over the coming year: pursuing differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness for today and tomorrow; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis; and modernising public administration.  This is an issue Deputy Crowe raised on the last occasion I was here.  He made the point to me that we need to have enhanced focused on growth and on from where this growth will come.  This is a discussion that will be taking place at the General Affairs Council and at other European meetings across the coming months in the context of this annual growth survey.  This survey will now be the subject of intensive consideration with the Council and that will, in due course, inform the guidance from the spring European Council to member states on preparation of their national reform programmes and stability programme updates for submission next April.  </p><p> Along with the annual growth survey, the Commission produced yesterday the alert mechanism report, which serves as an early warning on macroeconomic imbalances; the joint employment report, which assesses the social and employment situation; and the report on Single Market integration, which highlights both implementation gaps and priorities with greatest growth potential.  I look forward to the Commission&rsquo;s initial presentation of these matters at next week's meeting.</p><p> In so far as the Roadmap for the European Semester 2014 is concerned, I expect that the Presidency and the incoming Presidency will set clear timelines for managing the various stages of next year&rsquo;s process.  This will be informed by the synthesis report from the Lithuanian Presidency on lessons learned in 2013, as noted at the last General Affairs Council in October.  This committee will recall that effective management of the third European semester cycle was an important focus for the Irish Presidency earlier this year.  The key goal was to ensure that all relevant Council formations worked in a co-ordinated and consistent manner towards a thorough preparation of the March and June European Councils.  Our overall emphasis was on improving dialogue and strengthening national ownership of proposed reform measures.  This is an emphasis that is reinforced strongly by yesterday&rsquo;s annual growth survey.</p><p> The important work taken forward by both the finance committee and European Union Affairs Committee of the Oireachtas has also provided a strong basis for exploring further ways in which the involvement of national parliaments in the European semester processes might be reinforced in the period ahead.  I commend the committee on its initiative in this regard and look forward to working closely with its members to ensure a successful return by Ireland to full participation in the European semester 2014, underpinning an economic recovery that will be smart, sustainable and inclusive.</p><p> The main preparatory work for the next European Council will be done at the December General Affairs Council.  For the benefit of colleagues, it is worth noting that the European Council meeting will take after the General Affairs Council meeting following next week's General Affairs Council meeting.  That is where much of the discussion will place in relation to it.  I will meet the committee to outline my briefing for that General Affairs Council meeting.  Nonetheless next week&rsquo;s meeting will consider the draft annotated agenda.  This will include the Common Security and Defence Policy; economic and monetary union, including banking union; economic and social policy, including SME financing and taxation; enlargement; migration; and energy.  It is immediately obvious that this is a heavy agenda which focuses on many important issues for Ireland.  I am looking forward to next week&rsquo;s discussion as an opportunity to get a sense of how preparations for the Council are proceeding and what colleagues' current views are.  Detailed work is also being taken forward in the relevant Council formations, including ECOFIN, the Foreign Affairs Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</p><p> The General Affairs Council will also receive a Presidency report on the implementation of European Council conclusions.  We appreciate and support the Presidency&rsquo;s work.  Ireland&rsquo;s position here is clear.  We strongly believe &ndash; the Taoiseach has repeatedly made this point &ndash; the European Council has to be seen to deliver on its commitments if it is to be effective.  We must all work to ensure the full implementation of European Council conclusions.</p><p> On a positive note, I am also very pleased to note that agreement has been reached on a new EU budget for 2014.  It is currently expected that the agreement on budget 2014 and draft amending budget 9 will be approved at the General Affairs Council and then by the European Parliament on 20 November.  This is the first annual budget agreed under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework.  It follows the Irish Presidency's earlier work in brokering a political agreement with the Parliament on the multi-annual financial framework.  This budget implies an over 6% year-on-year reduction in the allocation for payments from the 2013 budget.  The final package protects Irish interests, including Common Agricultural Payments payments and cohesion funding.  It also frontloads youth unemployment and research and innovation moneys, from which Ireland will also be a beneficiary. </p><p> My colleague Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, said after the ECOFIN Council that the agreement is a pragmatic one that responds to the needs of a Europe emerging from a painful period of contraction.  Spending at EU level has to reflect this present reality while also meeting the future funding needs of the European Union.</p><p> I also want to let the committee know that, under any other business, the Dutch Government has requested an opportunity to brief the General Affairs Council on the outcome of its recently published subsidiarity and proportionality review, entitled Testing European Legislation for Subsidiarity and Proportionality &ndash; Dutch List of Points for Action.  The review contains some food for thought, which is of interest to all member states, including Ireland.  The October European Council conclusions also welcomed steps being taken by member states with the aim of better identifying excessively burdensome regulation and noted in this respect the subsidiarity and proportionality principles.  I think this reflects some of the thinking we have seen from our colleagues in the Netherlands.  Frans Timmermans, the Dutch Foreign Minister has written to me to draw attention to his country&rsquo;s initiative.  He is seeking to a promote a debate between member states and the institutions on how to achieve a sharper focus in EU initiative.  In that context he is organising a seminar in the Hague in January on the theme, "Is subsidiarity relevant for better EU Governance?"  I will listen with interest to Minister Timmermans&rsquo; outline of the Dutch review&rsquo;s key findings at next week&rsquo;s General Affairs Council.  These are important issues which affect us all and it is important to take time to consider them.    </p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I have made an effort to relate the work of next week's General Affairs Council and in the meetings to come to questions colleagues put to me at the last meeting and I will do my best to answer any new points or questions the members wish to put to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.563" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013111400004#C00200"><p>I will start by asking a few questions and making a few comments.  As the Minister of State will be aware, we attended the COSAC plenary session in Vilnius two weeks ago.</p> <p>His absence was noted.  He would have enjoyed the conversation, which was excellent.  We spok a little about enlargement and the subject of Turkey came up again.  There was a meeting last Monday week, 5 November, on accession.  Could the Minister of State let us know how that went or what the outcome of it was?  We talked about eastern partnerships, in particular in terms of Ukraine.  We had a presentation from Pat Cox, who is one of the special rapporteurs for the European Parliament in the region.  He explained the issues in terms of the current state of play and the hope that we will be able to enter an agreement in the near future, depending of course on what happens with Tymoshenko.  Could the Minister of State give us an update on the position in that regard as well?</p><p> Reference was made to the annual growth survey which was published yesterday.  Does the Government have a view on how we deal with the European semester?  The annual growth survey will be covered by the committee and we have asked Catherine Day in to discuss the issue with us.  She has agree to come in early February.  It will also fall to this committee to consider the draft national reform programme, but then the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform will examine the draft stability programme.  I am not sure which of us, or whether it will be both, will examine the country-specific recommendations and it is also unclear which committee will attend the Article 13 conferences.  Does the Minister of State or the Government have a view on how we should proceed at an Oireachtas level with the implementation of the European semester?</p><p> The Minister of State mentioned the visit of Barbara Nolan from the Commission.  We had a very fruitful discussion with her early this week.  One of the questions we asked her was about Barroso&rsquo;s State of the Union Address, the progress he is making with the proposals on EMU and political union, and what we would expect to see prior to the European elections.  Does the Minister of State have any thoughts in that regard?</p><p> As the Minister of State is aware, the Commission published a document on trying to include social indicators within the semester process.  In the coming weeks the committee will debate the type of indicators that should be included.  We have a number of meetings set up with organisations such as Social Justice Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed and various other groups to talk about the type of indicators we need to see.  The proposal as it stands is that we would have such indicators as long-term rates of unemployment and disposable income in households.  To what use does the Minister of State think we could put the social indicators and how could they be used in practice?</p><p> The other matter on which I wish to comment is subsidiarity and the work being done by the Dutch Parliament.  We had visitors from the Netherlands yesterday to discuss preparation for the Presidency and lessons learned from the Irish Presidency but we also took the opportunity to discuss issues such as subsidiarity.  We noted the fact that in recent weeks the number of reasoned opinions from the Oireachtas has gone from two to four.  We  spoke about green cards, their views on democratic legitimacy and how we can improve it across the Union through the involvement of national parliaments.  It will be interesting to hear the Minister of State&rsquo;s views on subsidiarity in the context of the paper produced by the Netherlands.</p><p> The only other point which I wish to briefly mention before anyone else comments relates to the European Council meeting in December.  The Minister of State will be aware that we talked in the past about bringing in contractual arrangements and associated solidarity mechanisms within the new budgetary processes.  What is the progress in that regard and what is the current state of play in terms of thinking on it?  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

The list includes enlargement, the European semester, the role of committees within that context, social indicators, the application of subsidiarity and the December European Council with reference to contracts for competitiveness.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/971" speakername="Joe O'Reilly" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013111400005#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister of State for his very comprehensive and helpful presentation.  He said at the December GAERC meeting the work for the next European Council will be set out and he listed the agenda items.  Energy is the last item on the list.  An issue came up in conversation with friends recently that is troubling.  While we all support green energy, emission policies and the reduction in emissions it is disturbing that Europe will now be in a disadvantaged position compared to America which is continuing with a policy position that is not based on the same decisions.  For example, shale fracking is taking place there.  They are using traditional energy sources with great success and acquiring it cheaply.  Will that not greatly disadvantage Europe in the future?  If China and other major landmasses across the world are ignoring the dangers of emissions and the greenhouse gas effect, and Europe is the only area adhering to such a policy, while it is a morally sustainable position will it not put us at a huge disadvantage in terms of economic development?  I am interested in a comment from the Minister of State on the matter and how we square that circle.  The matter will require much consideration in the future.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to Deputy Durkan&rsquo;s persistent raising of indigenous manufacturing.  I presume he will wish to comment himself.  I support his view that while it is very important to develop our IT sector, as there is much activity in that regard, that there is room for traditional manufacturing.  We might have taken our eye off the ball in that regard.  I was interested in the importance the Minister of State attached to the issue in his introductory remarks.  Could he comment further?  How does he envisage such development in this country and across Europe?  What could we do to get ourselves more actively involved in manufacturing?  We have a cohort of young people who are not able to get into the IT sector because they do not have the competencies, interest or aptitude.  Many young people were displaced from construction and traditional manufacturing could appeal to them.  I would be interested in hearing a comment from the Minister of State on the matter.</p><p>  My constituency colleague, Senator Reilly, has done much personal work which I happily acknowledge, on the youth guarantee scheme.  How is that proceeding?  Is the Minister of State confident that we can get it implemented and that we will get enough money from Europe to introduce and sustain it?  There is the greatest requirement and moral imperative on all of us to do something about youth unemployment.</p><p>  The Minister of State referred to SME financing in the agenda items.  Any of us who do constituency work know it is an enormous issue.  Will he comment on how optimistic he is that we will get something practical in place or get a return so that by this time next year an SME could more readily access cash than is the case today?  That is an important issue.  I welcome the report of the Minister of State and the degree to which he is focused on the right issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013111400005#D00500"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and his officials to the meeting.  He mentioned that he met with the Minister of State, Mr. Lidington, MP, in London and Edinburgh last week.  Were there informal discussions on the referendum in the United Kingdom on EU membership?</p> <p>In terms of the work programme, the financial transaction tax was mentioned.  I ask for an update on where we are going on that, and if there is any opposition in Dublin or London to it.</p><p> An interesting aspect of the work programme is the establishment of a European public prosecutor's office, of which I have not heard previously.  I presume that will be involved in trans-European issues, whether it be fraud or other criminality.  What role would the Director of Public Prosecutions have in that regard?  If the Minister of State does not have information on it he might follow up on it at a future date.</p><p> A project called the Fourth Railway Package was mentioned.  The point I wish to make is not particularly about railways but the basis of policy on infrastructural projects.  I refer in particular to what is called the TEN-T project regarding transport and the transnational measures therein.  In terms of what that means, if a project encompasses a number of companies, presumably they have advantages in terms of funding compared to Ireland, which has one land border with the United Kingdom via Northern Ireland.  I am aware that under the TEN-T project approximately &euro;26 billion is available over a number of years.  It might be a small percentage of funding <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>matching funding from national Government but the project highlighted in Ireland is almost like a line from Belfast to Dublin to Cork, with the western area left out.  I am concerned that we do not have the options to access that funding that other European countries have by virtue of the land border.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013111400006#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister for attending.  I am proud  we are sitting here as a collective dealing with European affairs against the backdrop of the announcement by the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste that Ireland will see the troika leave on 15 December and that we will no longer be seeking extra financial supports.  As this is the Irish European affairs committee, it is important to convey not only to the Irish public but to the European public, and particularly to those other countries facing financial constraints and difficulties, that Ireland is extremely proud of that, notwithstanding the obligations placed on the sovereign by the European Union vis-&agrave;-vis the Central Bank to carry the buck for the bankers.  Although it was unfair, this country has done a remarkable job in two and a half years and I want the message to go out to our European partners that Ireland has succeeded in regaining its sovereignty, that it is proud it has regained its sovereignty, and that it is happy to work alongside other countries in distressed financial straits with a view to reunifying the European project around fiscal stability. I am extremely proud, after two and a half years of difficulties for this country, that in December we can raise the tricolour for the second time under the new Republic.</p><p>  As I am a member of the foreign affairs committee, many of the issues I will touch on have an international context.  The Chairman mentioned the discussions with Turkey.  I strongly support the Turkish and the Ukrainian relationship with Europe and I ask the Minister to outline how matters progressed at the conference on 5 November.  The 22nd chapter was being opened with Turkey and I would advocate strongly that we should continue to show Turkey this country's commitment to its efforts in involving itself in a greater way with Europe.</p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to give me an update on Ukraine, and what we read in the newspapers is positive in that regard.  The problem for Ukraine is that Tymoshenko - a name that rolls off everybody's lips - was reputed to have done an unsustainable deal on energy with the Russians that bankrupted Ukraine.  The issues of energy and Ukraine go hand in glove.  Given the pressures Russia is applying on the peripheral states, be it Moldova, Ukraine or Armenia - it twisted the arms of the Armenians so much that I understand Armenia has pulled out of its developments with Europe - can we take it the Ukrainian Government is attempting to progress matters but it is under phenomenal pressure from Russia, which has threatened them - these are the winter months in Ukraine - that if it developed the relationship and does not adhere to the customs union the Russians want, it will cut off supplies?  I ask that the Minister be sympathetic to the conditions prevailing in Ukraine and the pressures it is under.</p><p>  I welcome that Albania is about to engage in the accession process.  Having been to Albania, I was most impressed by its rate of development, given its history and its isolation in the past.  It also should be encouraged.</p><p>  The key areas and the challenges the European Council will have to confront are very interesting.  The migration flows issue is coming very much into focus, particularly in the Mediterranean regions.  In terms of the different roles, which I do not fully understand, is Frontex the agency of the European Union that will control migration?  Is the Minister happy that it is sufficiently resourced?  Could he explain Frontex's different functions with the European External Action Service because in the future we will have the debate about military security?  We saw that the French had to act alone in going into Mali to release prisoners.  I know that piracy and kidnapping in Africa, involving captains of ships, is common.  Is the Minister of State satisfied that we can play a sufficient role with our partners in identifying the threats made against European interests by these pirates?</p><p>  The youth guarantee is the key issue.  The Minister of State might have some information but I understand the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, was in Europe discussing the youth guarantee.  I hear figures of &euro;100 million or &euro;200 million may be available here to target youth projects.  Will the Minster confirm the approximate figure?  I believe the ballpark figure for Europe is &euro;6 billion.  Has the Minister any idea of the type of funding Ireland might be able to claim of that &euro;6 billion?</p><p>  I refer to the Minister's contribution.  One of the main priorities of the coming year is modernising public administration.  I do not know whether that is in reference to European or Irish public administration.  We have just gone through two and a half years of the bailout and we had to restructure our entire society.  Will the Minister of State tell me, under the modernisation of public administration as a priority aspect, if there is a view that Irish public administration is in further need of modernisation?  Can the Minister give us a hint as to the area of modernisation that is required?  I thank the Minister of State.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.571" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013111400007#F00100"><p>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for his attendance and for his comprehensive report of the previous meeting.</p><p>  I wish to focus on a couple of points.  To what extent has the EU studied the areas most likely to contribute to economic recovery throughout the Union, particularly in terms of extended and increased employment?  We all remember being told eight or nine years ago that the future would be the digital economy.  While that is the case, it has appeared for some time that the traditional areas of employment are those that have delivered the most in the response to the economic downturn, both here and abroad.  For example, Germany has been relying heavily on exports.  To what extent has the EU studied this issue with a view to maximising employment potential and, as used to be said, lifting all boats on a rising tide?</p><p>  Is each EU country able to access sufficiently the digital economy in order to capitalise on it in terms of employment creation?  Ireland is not able to fully access its most modern elements.  Be it Europe or this jurisdiction, we do not do enough forward planning.  The problems with accessing the digital economy should have been dealt with ten years ago when plenty of resources were available to do so.</p><p>  There is a particular need to ensure that state-of-the-art technology is available in all EU countries.  We are dependent on one another.  If there are gaps in the system in Ireland or its adjoining economies, they will show up in the extent to which the EU and its Single Market are competitive, for example, the degree to which we have state-of-the-art broadband.  Ireland does not have it.  Many people in my and my colleagues' constituencies, including not far from where we are, must roam around their buildings to find the hottest spots for accessing broadband.  This is disgraceful and should not be the case.  The EU should have identified the need for an emphasis on these issues years ago, not now when the problem is there for everyone to see.</p><p>  I have welcomed the semester concept for a long time.  It gives the EU the ability to assess progress under various headings on an ongoing basis.  This would identify deficiencies or inefficiencies and the potential to maximise the benefits of the Single Market.  Unless all of these factors fall into place simultaneously and we move together in the Union, the concept of the Single Market will fall by the wayside.</p><p>  The Chairman will be glad to know that I will make my last point.  I would be interested to know what our colleagues in the Netherlands will say about subsidiarity and proportionality.  I have had views on these issues for some time.  Previously, something was applied to every country on the basis that it suited one country.  However, this does not follow, nor should it.  It must be recognised that not every economy is starting from the same base or is in the same position.  To capitalise on the benefits likely to accrue from the semester and the examination, it is necessary that we emphasise this point.</p><p>  I could discuss other issues, but the Chairman will be glad to know I will not continue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.572" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2013111400007#F00200"><p>I thank all members for their questions and the Chairman for the opportunity to answer them.  I asked whether I had captured everyone's points because I wanted to ensure that, when I appear at these committee meetings, which I do at least once per month, I could refer to the questions asked at previous meetings without needing to re-invent the wheel.  If colleagues put their energies into deliberating on points, I want to register them and be able to revert to them each time.</p><p>  I will begin with the Chairman's good self and some of the points he put to me.  A review takes place each year at European Council level regarding the enlargement process.  This will occur at the December European Council.  The Chairman referred to Turkey.  The Irish Presidency worked hard on that matter.  Chapter 22 was opened up via this month's intergovernmental conference, IGC.  We are supportive of that process.  I have met the Turkish ambassador and discussed the matter with him.  This relates to one of Deputy Byrne's points.  Turkey understands our support for progress by the IGC on this chapter.  This issue was agreed without discussion at the last General Affairs Council, in large part due to the work done by the Irish Government.  If the Chairman is interested, I can provide a detailed update on where the work stands at future committee meetings, but the first meeting on commencing the work happened only a week ago.</p><p>  As to the other countries relevant to this discussion, consideration will be given to Albania's candidate status at the December meeting.  Deputy Byrne asked me about this situation.  There also will be discussion on the initiation of accession negotiations with Macedonia.  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be discussed at next Monday's Foreign Affairs Council, where we believe the emphasis will be on the need for people within its communities to do everything they can to take responsibility for the process.  In the coming months, the EU will take stock of our work with them and what else can be done.  Negotiations have begun on Kosovo's stabilisation and association process.</p><p>  At the December European Council meeting, an overview will be taken of the total enlargement process, which leads on to the points made by the Chairman and Deputy Byrne about Ukraine.  I will attend the partnership summit in Vilnius in two weeks' time.  It will address this and a number of other issues.  Ireland is disposed towards signing and supports the association agreement, but we want to see progress made on the issue of selective justice.  We will examine closely what happens in that country during the coming weeks, but we are also conscious of the pressure on Ukraine and other countries and the work being undertaken by their leaders.  The coming two weeks will be important, in that they will confirm what our position, and that of other members states, will be.</p><p>  Regarding the European semester, I am supportive of the role of social indicators in gaining a more holistic assessment of where economies and societies stand within the European project.</p> <p>For example, the Chairman referenced some potential indicators of unemployment.  If we had given as much focus to the indicators of unemployment as have to those on debt sustainability or deficit levels, the progress that this country and other countries are beginning to make could have been accelerated.  I strongly believe that the role of social indicators is to be valued in understanding and assessing where member states are within their economy and in terms of the social pressures they face.</p><p> Where I do have a concern and where I question their role would be when they gain the same level of equivalence as many of our economic indicators in terms of the macroeconomic imbalances process.  I have used a huge amount of jargon in explaining all of that and I want to explain it to myself as much as to all of the members.  As colleagues will be aware, the macroeconomic imbalances procedure is a process within the architecture of the European Union that asks countries to take recognition of how particular indicators are going, for example, deficit levels in their own national economies.  If action is not taken or if those indicators go completely in the wrong directions, it is open to the European Union to use sanctions in order to ensure countries focus on these in the way they should.  I will go back to the points Deputy Durkan made in that regard.  My rationale for why it is important for measures such as that to be included within that process is because of the strong spill-over effect of many such matters where one country's deficit level can have a strong effect on the ability of another country to fund its deficit.  I believe we should proceed carefully in extending the number of indicators that we use for that process because that will raise severe issues of what are referred to as pro-cyclical difficulties, in other words, where economies are already in difficulty one makes matters more difficult for them by potentially sanctioning them.  That gets us into big questions also regarding the role of national parliaments and the role of national sovereignty in how they manage social issues.  We need to move deliberately and carefully within this area to ensure that we come up with a process that reflects the concerns of many member states about issues such as national sovereignty, the role of parliaments and understanding that some matters need to be looked at in a different way because of their spill-over effect elsewhere.</p><p> I link that point directly into the Deputy's question on the contracts for competitiveness.  While this is an issue that many countries have raised and have discussed, we are not yet at the point of the real substance of how all of this would work, for example, issues such as whether this would have an intergovernmental provenance, would it come out of arrangements between member states, what role would the Commission play in it, etc.  In that regard, our view would be that we have agreed a large amount of measures, such as the Two Pack and the Six Pack, which are all about looking at the performance of national economies and their interaction with the European institutions, and we have also voted in and implemented the fiscal governance treaty.  In the past 24 to 36 months, there is a degree of architecture on EMU that is sophisticated and nuanced.  Our view at this stage is we should focus on making all of that work, particularly given that Ireland is about to move into the European Semester for the first time.</p><p> There were a couple of points Deputy Joe O'Reilly asked me about and I will go through each of them.  On cash access for small and medium-sized companies, I agree entirely with the point Deputy Joe O'Reilly made.  That is why we are focused on completing the banking union and making that a robust process.  If it is easier for banks themselves to raise money, it should be easier for that money to be passed on via credit to the companies of which the Deputy spoke.  That is also why Ireland has been to the forefront in pressing for the European Investment Bank, EIB, to play a more prominent role.  We would argue that the future sources of credit within national economies may not be all commercial bank orientated.  There may be a role for other entities and we would see the EIB playing a role in that.  That is why we welcome the role the EIB is playing in the Luas BXD line, Grangegorman DIT and other initiatives across the country.</p><p> On the Deputy's question on the youth guarantee, in this regard the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Burton, is engaging in extensive consultation with national stakeholders, and particularly with the OECD.  Given the expertise of the OECD in this area, I welcome this.  By the end of this year, which is to say, in the coming weeks, a detailed implementation plan for that will be published.  That will run alongside the work that the Government is already doing in programmes such as JobBridge, internship programmes and in trying to ensure that there are opportunities for our young people while there is not the level of employment for them that we would wish.</p><p> I also agree with Deputy Joe O'Reilly's point on manufacturing competitiveness.  A Europe Council in the first half of next year - this is a point Deputy Durkan raised on many occasions - will focus in on this.  We must have a model for economic growth that has many engines within it and that is diversified so that when something goes wrong in one part of it, we still have other parts of an economy that are capable of growing it.  To state it in a colloquial way, we have seen what happens when all one's eggs are in one basket and we need to have more baskets.  Manufacturing plays an important part in that.</p><p> On the Deputy's point about the trade-off that could occur between environmental sustainability and the national competitiveness of countries at any point in time, the reason I say it "could occur" is that I believe there are many other sources of manufacturing activity and economic activity onto which we are moving that will be environmentally and economically sustainable.  This is something in which nation states must play a role.  The European Union can support it.  It can support it through enabling the development of cross-continent infrastructure.  It can also support it through supporting the universities and colleges in giving them the funding they need to have research in place in the correct areas.  Fundamentally, however, national governments themselves must identify those areas and take a leadership role in that regard.</p><p> On the questions Deputy Kyne posed, I will begin by reference to his question on the referendum in the United Kingdom and whether I raised this with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Rt. Hon. Lidington, MP.  I did not raise it directly in my meeting with him, although I have touched on it in other discussions with him.  However, I have raised it publicly on three occasions: in the North of Ireland, in London and here in Dublin.  I raised it in an address to the Institute of International and European Affairs, I raised it in an address in the Northern Ireland Assembly and I raised it substantively in a contribution I made to the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  In addition, I raised it on Friday afternoon last in an address to the University in Edinburgh.  Our approach to all of that can be framed in terms of two particular areas.  First, we appreciate and recognise the right of any other member state to have a debate regarding its membership and terms of the European Union, given the number of times that we ourselves have done so.  Second, the Government strongly believes that Ireland's future lies within the European Union and within the development of our membership of the European Union, and a full participation within it.</p> <p>I am carefully emphasising that point to our neighbours and other stakeholders.</p><p> There have been more discussions on FTT in recent months but the Irish position remains unchanged.  We believe that the implementation of something like this can only happen when all countries are participating within it, both in Europe and beyond.  We will not be participating within such a framework because it would put Europe at a disadvantage <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>what will happen elsewhere.  We have many people employed in our own banks who are contributing to the economic recovery and we will be cognisant of that in any discussions that take place on this matter.</p><p> I was asked where the fourth railway package currently stands.  We must ensure that we are competitive within any such environment, given our status.  The Department of transport is playing the lead role in that regard to ensure that our infrastructural projects can be funded if other new activities are taking place across the continent of Europe.  </p><p> I agree with Deputy Byrne's point.  In the earlier discussion, I was struck by the number of people who said we would never get out of the bail-out programme and that we were condemned to participating in it for generations to come.  Through the public's sacrifice, this Government has shown that that is not the case.  We have shown that an exit is possible and even though we were the second eurozone country to enter such an arrangement, we will be the first one to leave it.  </p><p> As regards the parties that are now criticising or questioning our actions, I need hardly tell the Deputy that if our country had decided to apply for a precautionary credit line, the same people would still be criticising us for doing so.  We made a decision based on the economic interests of our country and where we are now, due to the huge changes society has made.  Our deficit levels are coming down strongly.  We have already implemented a deficit reduction programme of 18% of our national income during a period when the global economy was in recession.  Since World War II, few countries in the developed world have done the same.</p><p> We had options but made this decision which we believe is in the best interests of our country.  That is the sole reason the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made that decision.  I hope this is another important stepping stone in delivering the appreciable economic growth we want everyone to see.  In that way, the terrible pressure people are under will be lightened. </p><p> I have dealt with the question raised about the Ukraine and I was also asked about the difference between Frontex and the EEAS.  Frontex is the organisation that assesses the work of various member states in protecting borders.  The European External Action Service is a different body, although some of its work has similar consequences.  It basically ensures that EU member states have a source of representation abroad in non-EU states.  I have seen this at first hand in Africa where the work of the EEAS allows a better co-ordination of activities within the European institutions as well as supporting the work of national embassies. </p><p> Piracy and military security are issues that arise consistently at meetings I attend on maritime security and related legal areas that need to be resolved.  We expect to see further proposals on these matters.  Some Irish personnel are operating in a training capacity in Somalia and they will be focusing on these kinds of issues which will become more pressing.  </p><p> I have already touched on the youth guarantee.  As regards modernising public administration, a lot of that work will focus on the European institutions.  Another aspect will examine how digital services can allow citizens to deal and engage better with national administrations.  We need to make more progress in how our public services are organised and delivered in Ireland.  It is work that we must undertake ourselves anyhow, regardless of the EU.  I am sure the European institutions will be of help in allowing us to understand how to do such work. </p><p> I have covered Deputy Durkan's point on engines for economic recovery.  I recall that on the last occasion he also referred to the digital economy when he spoke about market fragmentation.  Due to their economies and scale, various countries do not have access to the same levels of digital infrastructure that other economies may have.  The European Commission has published proposals concerning the idea of a connected continent.  We wish to ensure that the status of operators and regulators in smaller member states is protected and that their work is recognised.  In order for that kind of digital innovation to take place, we will initially have to improve the level of digital infrastructure.  In many cases the responsibility for that sits with national governments.</p></speech>

We must undertake such work ourselves with the help of the European institutions.  Ideas such as the connected continent will assist us in that regard.</p><p>  As regards the role of national parliaments in the Semester process, as a former member of this committee for six years I know there should be a delineation between recommendations by the Executive and by Parliament.  I would be glad to hear the Deputy's views on where committees should sit in this process.  I know he is engaging in this matter already.  Arising from discussions with colleagues about the Semester process, I have learned that if engagement does not happen early between national governments and the European institutions - particularly the Commission - and if the quality of bilateral discussion is not there, we will not get what is required from that process.  I support that process because of the difficulty that Ireland is in.  If it was just our own difficulty, I think we would have had the measure of it.  However, we dealt with our difficulties at the same time as everybody else and the spillover effects cascaded in on top of us. </p> <p>I believe that while the semester process is new and different and will ask questions of parliaments and governments all over the EU, it is the best way of dealing with that.  The basic point is that if we stay inside the framework of the commitments we have made as a Government and respect the role of bodies like the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, which is a domestic institution, all of our participation within the semester process should be positive and supportive.  </p><p> In respect of the subsidiarity work the Netherlands is doing, the Deputy is correct in saying that everybody starts from the same place.  Not everybody ends up in the same place.  This is an area where I would be very interested to hear the thinking of our colleagues in the Dutch Government.  They have undertaken an interesting process.  They have very clearly positioned this as a work that is taking place within the treaties and they want to look at the application of them.  I believe we should be open and engaged and look at the work they are doing.  When they have given us an update - I gather the committee has already informally begun to understand some of this work - I will formally have an opportunity to get an update on it next Tuesday.  When we hear about that work and what they are thinking - they have also organised a seminar on this area - we should reflect on it carefully because we should always be open to thinking about the relationship between member states and the institutions of the EU.  We should be open to ensuring that the relationship that is there is in line with the treaties and the commitments we have given to our people in many referenda over the past number of years.  </p></speech>

I propose to explain what we are doing, what we can do better and what needs to happen for our dying patients and their families in our hospitals.  I am one of the senior nurse managers in charge of the hospital and work weekends in this capacity.  My experience to date is that patients do not always die between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, when all services are in place.  Often one is faced with very profound experiences involving patients and families outside these times.  I was involved with a family whose adult child had died tragically.  On receiving the news, I contacted the hospital Chaplain and we discussed where would be the best place to take the family.  Their adult child had not died in hospital so we would not be involving a ward area but we needed an appropriate space.  In difficult sensitive situations like this, one acts quickly and makes decisions.  Time is of the essence.  We were very conscious of where we would take the family because additional news of a distressing nature needed to broken.  We agreed a space - a small office area - and met the family when they arrived at the main entrance.  We offered our condolences, made tea and were present with the family while tragic news was broken.  It was difficult in this small room for them to move around to comfort each other.  Later, when they were able, we brought them to the Mortuary to see and spend time with their child.  Our viewing area in the Mortuary for families is far from ideal and is outside the main building.  The Chaplain, hospital porter and I tried to make it as tolerable and presentable as possible.  We brought back the family to the room and stayed until they were ready to face their difficult journey home.</p><p>  At times like this one becomes totally absorbed and anxious for the family because one really wants to do the right thing for them in their distress.  This experience affected us and had a profound effect on me.  I wanted to share this with the committee this morning as it captures some of the challenges we face on the ground in providing good end-of-life care in our hospitals. Good end-of-life care is everyone's business, the nurse, the chaplain, the porter.   We get only one chance to get it right.  What I have described indicates the importance of staff having the necessary skills in communication and awareness around end-of-life care to ensure all patients and families are treated with dignity, respect and sensitivity.  We must have appropriate spaces within in our hospitals that afford privacy when breaking bad news to the patient and their family.  We need to ensure our viewing areas in our mortuaries are improved.</p><p>  As a result of the programme, some of this work has started and is progressing.  The programme invites hospitals to embrace their role in supporting all patients at end-of-life, regardless of diagnosis, whether their death is expected or sudden.  It acknowledges that end-of-life care is a core activity in our hospitals.  Almost half of us in this room today will die in a busy acute hospital and almost half will die in a busy ward area as opposed to in the privacy of a single room.  Almost half of us will not be involved in discussions regarding our care.  Staff find it easier to talk to relatives than to the patient.  We know this is based on the results of the national audit on end-of-life care which suggests there is substantial variation in the quality of care offered to patients and relatives at the end-of-life.  The audit concluded that there are 17 ways to improve dying in hospitals, one of which is to ensure the patient is cared for in a single room.  We are short of such spaces and have competing priorities such as income generation and infection issues.</p><p>  How would one know if a hospital is a hospice friendly hospital?  At its simplest, it is a hospital that takes end-of-life care seriously and is implementing the quality standards for end-of-life care in hospitals, which set out a shared vision for what hospitals should be aiming for and what patients and families should expect.  At its heart, it is the culture change programme which introduces numerous practical resources to enhance the culture at end-of-life.  I want to bring the end-of-life care symbol to the attention of the committee this morning.  This has been developed to respectfully identify items connected with end-of-life.  It is inspired by ancient Irish history and is not associated with any one religion or denomination.  When one sees this displayed in the hospital ward it signifies that a person is very close to death or has died.  It signals to all staff, other patients and families that an intensely personal and profound experience is happening to a person and their family in this ward at this time, of which they should be mindful.</p><p>  I thank the committee for reading my submission and ask that all the recommendations therein be given consideration.   I would like at this point to highlight three of the recommendations.  We have excellent committed staff in our hospitals and we need to support and invest in them to ensure they care for our loved ones with competence and compassion.  We need to ensure we have adequate numbers of staff on the ground that can provide compassionate care and be present for patients and their families.  We need a national end-of-life and bereavement strategy to cover all aspects of dying, death and bereavement in Ireland.  We need and can do so much better for our dying patients and their families.</p><p>  When pressed, most of us in this room this morning will say we wish to die at home.  My wish for members and I is that this will happen.  If not, I hope that by the time they die, every hospital in Ireland will be a hospice friendly hospital and offer them patient-centred, compassionate care, because they matter.  The following is a link to a five minute DVD entitled, &quot;A Wish&quot;:<i>irishhospicelibrary.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/a-wish-new-animated-video-from-the-hospice-friendlv-hospitals-programme/</i>.  It captures and explores the important role all staff play in providing end-of-life care for those of us who will die in hospital.  I ask that the committee watch the DVD.  A good death in hospital is possible.  Our challenge is to make it happen.</p></speech>

Whether one includes taxes, as did Benjamin Franklin, is a moot point as there may be ways to avoid taxes but none to avoid death.</p><p>  End-of-life care in the emergency department is a recently coined phrase but the concept predates all of those in this room.  Most people who contemplate the end of their own lives fear certain aspects of it, in particular the risk of pain or indignity.  Whereas it was common up to 50 years ago for people in this country to die at home, it is increasingly uncommon.  Some 48% of deaths occur in acute hospitals, 20% in long-term care facilities, 25% at home and only 4% in hospice care.  When expected, arrangements may be in place to deal with the concerns of the dying person and their relatives.  When unexpected, or precipitate, such plans may be thwarted or simply not yet in place.  Interestingly, surveys have shown that most medical doctors would opt to die at home, if at all feasible.</p><p>  An audit study from four years ago showed that 84% of patients dying in hospital had accessed the hospital via the emergency department, with 24% of the deaths being unexpected.  End-of-life care in the emergency department is opportunistic in that it depends on many factors coming together at the one time.  It relies on the determination of the staff to ensure the best possible experience for their patients and the patient&rsquo;s relatives or friends.  It requires determination to deliver quality care in what is perceived by many outsiders as a chaotic setting.  Every dying person has physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs.  It is relatively uncommon for one person to be able to support each and every one of these needs.  Instead, a team effort is essential.  This team must be prepared and, like an elite squad, practised at its task.</p><p>  The barriers to a high quality death in the emergency department include the physical setting, often overcrowded, noisy, and with high intensity lighting 24 hours a day.  It is psychologically extremely difficult to be plucked from one&rsquo;s bed at home, gasping for breath, and be brought by ambulance, careening through the streets with sirens blaring, to a noisy environment, where the bustle of life-saving measures applied to one person may interfere with the peace and quiet required by a dying woman contemplating her last few hours or minutes on this earth.  There is an understandable reluctance to spend a lot of time with a person known to be dying, whose life cannot be prolonged by any means within the power of nursing and medical staff.  While staff are concerned for these people, the pressure of other patients&rsquo; needs can be very distracting, running the risk of a lonely death in a crowded room.</p><p>  What of the tensions within a family whose loved one has been injured in a  traffic collision or in a murderous assault and now lies sedated, ventilated and paralysed, unable to communicate his or her needs, with no prospect of survival?  All deaths in the emergency department or within 24 hours of admission must be reported to the Coroner.  Post mortem autopsies will be carried out on a high proportion of these, otherwise the legal requirements for death certification will not be fulfilled.  </p> <p>This places further tension on the relations between families and staff, which can, on occasion, lead to difficulty.</p><p> What can be done to optimise end-of-life care in emergency departments?  The first thing is to believe it can be improved, to examine each element carefully and to deal with every deficiency in a constructive fashion.  The environment of the emergency department is designed for large-volume patient care, in a physically constrained area.  To reduce the inevitable noise, bustle and excess light, requires a separate area that can be used to support patients and their families during the process of dying and after death.  This needs to be close enough to the main clinical area to allow ready access with staff able to move to and fro without difficulty.  It should be decorated in calm and soothing colours and fabrics, while keeping in mind the infection control elements required in a clinical environment.  Access to refreshments and to external communications for families is vital.  Nowadays, this means ensuring adequate mobile phone signal strength, which can be a difficulty in areas with radiation protection built in to the walls.</p><p> Staff, whether medical, nursing, clinical or clerical-support personnel, must be all trained in the ways they can support dying people and their families.  At this moment a seminar it taking place in my hospital to teach people how to break this barrier of dealing with dying patients.  Rather than end-of-life care, it is called &quot;journeys&quot;.  It equally means the staff must face their own inevitable death, at least in broad philosophical terms. </p><p> There must be a willingness to engage with the physical, emotional and spiritual needs of patients, whatever the religious beliefs of the staff.  This is increasingly important in an Ireland which 50 years ago had mainly Roman Catholics and Protestant denominations with a smattering of Jewish people, but which now has many other different religious groups, ranging thorough Animist, Buddhist, Coptic, Christian Orthodox, Daoist, Episcopalian, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and others. </p><p> Unless the inevitability of death is recognised, there may be a reluctance to use adequate doses of powerful painkillers despite clear evidence of need.  However, access to adequate pain relief is a must for those who have pain.  Methods to enhance this include the use of technology, such as patient-controlled analgesic pumps or transcutaneous pain relief and the use of personnel, such as pain-control or palliative-care specialists.  The latter are rarely available on a 24-hour basis, but can provide tuition for those who are, such as medical and nursing staff in emergency departments, who can then use the technology as required.</p><p> These issues might be better dealt with if there was a more open and structured approach to end-of-life-care planning at personal and family level.  If a person is discharged from hospital to home with a known terminal illness, there seems to be a reluctance to engage with the person and his or her family to understand the next step in the process.  This leads to panic when the patient eventually and inevitably deteriorates at home.  The family or friends then lose control and dial the emergency number for the ambulance service.  Once that behemoth is unleashed, the result is predictable - the patient will be brought to the nearest emergency department, usually <i>in extremis</i>.  He or she will then die in the emergency department or during the journey.</p><p> In cases where the patient has already suffered a cardiac arrest, there is a natural reluctance on the part of pre-hospital emergency care providers - ambulance personnel - to pronounce death in the home, which leads to ongoing resuscitative efforts and pronouncement of death in the emergency department.  That then leaves the emergency department team to deal with the process of informing relatives and dealing with their grief, and with the logistic difficulties of identification and referral to the coroner.  Although the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council has developed a clinical practice guideline to reduce this problem, it is likely to remain an issue into the future.  I understand that my colleague, Dr. King, will deal with that.</p><p> An increasing concern for emergency medicine practitioners is the apparent reluctance to allow frail elderly men or women die peacefully in nursing homes.  Hypostatic pneumonia, which leads to delirium and death over a period of a few days used to be termed &quot;the old man's friend&quot;.  Once secretions were dealt with, the patient turned regularly to reduce discomfort and pain prevented by the use of &quot;the Brompton cocktail&quot;, the patient would slip away quietly, with their relatives and friends by the bedside.  This no longer occurs.</p><p> A similar issue also affects demented elderly patients who fall in nursing homes or who develop urinary tract infections and sepsis.  The perceived underlying cause is the risk of an adverse comment from the coroner or, worse still, from a HIQA investigation into increasing numbers of deaths in that nursing home.  The fallout from Lees Cross has had both positive and negative effects in this regard in my view.</p><p> Very few emergency departments in this country have adequate physical facilities for death and bereavement, although these facilities are, in fact, cheaper to provide than acute clinical space.  The necessary investment is small relative to the overall health budget, but the potential good for the lives of those who have been bereaved is enormous.  The possibility remains that good bereavement care will lead to shorter, less-intense grief responses and lower levels of psychological ill health afterwards.</p><p> What can the Oireachtas committee do?  It can probably only encourage health policy that supports good end-of-life care, including early bereavement care, within emergency departments.  Ensuring that it is on the agenda for health-care planning is critical to developing a response from planners, managers and clinicians that will lead to a greater, more positive, societal impact. </p><p> It behoves us all to consider how and where we would wish to die and to plan for &quot;a good death&quot; on a personal basis.  Once such a plan is devised, it should be shared with others, such as the next-of-kin and the family doctor, with clarity achieved on the wishes of the person involved.  Using the &quot;think-ahead&quot; template developed by the forum on the end of life and supported by the Irish Hospice Foundation is a readily accessible way to deal with this issue.  It is important to ensure access to this on a 24-hour-a-day basis, ideally in a central online register, to ensure that appropriate levels of care and comfort can be provided consistent with the wishes of the person and his or her current clinical status.  Ideally, every competent person entering a nursing home for long-term, end-of-life care should be provided with support to fill in that template. </p><p> A peaceful, timely death at home or in a nursing home should be seen as the norm, rather than an aberration and a failure of the health care system.  Ultimately we will all die, but there are ways in which we can make that a much more palatable and acceptable process of transfer.</p></speech>

Members will be able to tell by my accent that I am from Kildare.  I have lived there for 12 years.  I am happy to live there and will continue to live there forever.  I will only leave if my second wife wants to leave, because my first is not going anywhere.</p><p>  I was medical director of the flying doctors in Queensland until 2001.  We covered a population of 4 million, which is similar to the whole of Ireland.  I was happy there and had 50 doctors reporting to me.  We had about 100 nurses in the team.  It is at the acute sharp end - better than some services in the world and probably could learn from some others.  I arrived in Ireland as the inaugural director of a nice piece of secondary legislation to establish pre-hospital services in Ireland, which at the time had a basic life-support service.  The ambulances were driven by what were called "drivers", which offends me.  They were not regarded by the community or people as clinicians but were regarded as drivers who would transport the nurse out and bring patients back into hospital.</p><p>  When I arrived I wondered what I would do.  I decided I should look at what was happening on the ground.</p> <p>I decided to go with a newly-appointed deputy and visit every ambulance station in the country.  I had read all the reports and reviews.  Everything had been written down that needed to happen.  I agreed to do the exercise.  I had some preconceptions about what I would find and decided to validate what I saw.  We went to every ambulance station in the country over 18 months.  It was hard work and I got some fright.  I suddenly had to shift my outlook.  I had worked my whole life in acute sharp-end medicine but I realised the best thing I could do to help to improve sharp-end medicine in Ireland was to improve the care of the dead and dying.  Frankly, Ireland was doing it appallingly.  I am not talking about the wake, I am talking about the technical aspects of dying.  I went back to my office and my brief became where to begin.  I will march the committee through several points.</p><p> There was no policy or procedure in place or legitimisation to say a person was dead.  The person could be cold or stiff but not dead.  Some of the drivers were great people who had come out of the boiler rooms but they were throwing in their keys despite the training and orientation for sharp-end ambulance work.  I spoke to one man who has recently retired.  He went to a major bus crash on day one where children were dead as well as others with multiple injuries and whatever.  That was his orientation.  I can talk to the committee about his fading or whatever another time, but he ended up at a lower tier professional level and he had a valid role to play.  Anyone who ended up subsequently being trained at his station had luck.  The station got another man who was sharp-end, one of our new graduates at the higher level.  He had old soap and new soap so he could learn from the old and new ways.  Let us put that aside.</p><p> We had to put a policy in place that recognised the problem because some people were actually trying to resuscitate, do mouth-to-mouth or full bottle, bag and mask, on a cold stiff body.  At the time they had nowhere to go but the emergency department.  It may have been a long way, perhaps an hour away.  I mean no disrespect to them, because I would have done the same, but they sat in the back and folded their arms and did not continue cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, because they knew it was death.  They then arrived at an emergency department and the emergency department inherited the patient.  The doors opened and the paramedics started back doing CPR.  I imagine the emergency department people would have said to forget it and not to waste their time on it.</p><p> The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC, has developed clinical practice guidelines and now it is legitimate that there is a recognition of death.  If a person is a professional, either at emergency medical technician, EMT, or paramedic level, he does not do that.  Instead, if he arrives and there is a dead body, it is not our business and anyway the ambulance may have three 999 calls and if we do not get to them in 80 minutes, there may be a cardiac arrest because we know that two of them are in their mid 40s.  Anyway, whatever the age group, these people can be salvaged and can have a normal life while we are wasting our time in the back of an ambulance.  The case is fixed and there is no job because it is done.</p><p> The next issue is the case where we cease resuscitation.  We train our people now like in North America, Australasia, most importantly, and in the United Kingdom in such a way that if we have done all our tricks and our best people have given every drug and intervention but there is a flat-line trace, then the answer to the question on the chances of survival is: "None".  Then we cease resuscitation and agree to stop because it is all over.</p><p> PHECC has now legitimised that.  A paramedic can do that and stop now, whereas before he used to have to keep going.  These people would keep going to the emergency department and the staff in the emergency department would take the view that they have an ongoing resuscitation.  The emergency department would then spend a minimum of 20 minutes, but we know that 20 minutes goes into an hour and then there is the family aspect and whatever.  Again, people become tied up.  Am I running out of time?</p></speech>

Everyone thinks these scenes are dignified but they are not; they are full of vomit or whatever.  The tubes have made it more dignified.  The view is that the job is done but there are two more to do.  We cannot pronounce death.  Now, the paramedics cease resuscitation but they must wait for the doctor or general practitioner car.  At night time, they may be at the scene where a person has died in home or on the roadside.  They pronounce death but nothing is going to be done and they must wait for a doctor.  It could be ten minutes, one hour or the next day.  Hours are wasted when those people could be out resuscitating others who could survive.  What we need is endorsement.  We do not even need legislation because the city coroner is on board, and we are going to meet the coroners, but we need support for the view that it is legitimate to do what they do in the United Kingdom and Australasia.  It should be signed off that a paramedic can pronounce death.  It is safe.  It is crazy that we have to wait for a doctor, who has other work to do, to do it.  That is where we need help.</p><p>  There is another issue relating to the do-not-resuscitate order.  Let us think ahead.  The HSE has a draft document on do-not-resuscitate orders and the executive must plan to legitimise it.  We need to have it legitimised because we are currently in no man's land and people who do not want to be resuscitated are being resuscitated.  In those last two instances we were missing response times.  The committee members have read the paper.  People who could be saved are not getting a shot because we are wasting time on the acceptance that only a certain person should be able to pronounce death and an acceptance that we need do-not-resuscitate orders.  We do not need legislation but the legislation could help, perhaps, in a secondary way.</p><p>  Finally, we need more ambulances.</p></speech>

You are very welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.601" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Margaret Naughton" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013111400006#G00500"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to be here this morning.  I am here to represent the National Association of Healthcare chaplains, NAHC.  The NAHC is a professional association whose members serve in hospitals and health care facilities.  The purpose of the NAHC is the mutual encouragement and support of its members in ministering to patients, their relatives and staff in health care facilities.  This organisation, founded in 1981, is in essence a proven professional support body for chaplains.</p><p>  What exactly is a chaplain?  A chaplain is a person appointed to provide spiritual and religious care to all patients, visitors, staff and volunteers in the health care setting regardless of faith or no faith.  A chaplain can be ordained or lay.  Chaplains are people of faith who have engaged in the clinical pastoral education programme, a hospital-based experiential programme founded by Anton Boisen to work with and minister to living human documents.</p><p>  Thomas Moore, in his book, <i>Care of the Soul</i>, wrote:<blockquote>Modern medicine, on the other hand, is hell-bent on cure and has no interest in the body&rsquo;s inherent art.  It wants to eradicate all anomalies before there is a chance to read them for meaning.  It abstracts the body into chemistries and anatomies so that the expressive body is hidden behind graphs, charts, numbers, and structural diagrams.</blockquote>However, hospitals are not populated by numbers or ailments.  They are populated by men, women and children of different ages, classes, creeds and nationalities who all have one thing in common: they are all ill.  Charles Vella, a hospital chaplain and priest who has written extensively on the care of the sick, argues strongly that one's suffering is augmented by the humiliation of being thought of as a number on a bed, totally divested of human dignity.</p><p>  A chaplain works to provide empathy and support to those who find themselves in a health care system increasingly coming under pressure for many reasons.  Chaplain address the spiritual and religious needs of the patients they encounter on the wards.  By listening with empathy in a compassionate non-judgmental manner, a chaplain provides support for those who are struggling for whatever reason.</p><p>  It must be remembered that a hospital is a microcosm of society.  I mean that all the problems that exist in our society exist also in our hospitals.  After all, the problems that people have in their daily lives come with them when they enter hospital.</p> <p>Consequently, chaplains are faced with the harsh realities of loss, loneliness, addiction, unemployment and so forth when they come into work each day.  In a difficult working world, chaplains provide spiritual care and this is done through the quality of their presence, by accompaniment and by companionship.  Chaplaincy is about reaching out to those who are distressed for whatever reason.  Where death and dying is concerned, the death of a loved one is one of the most intensely painful human experiences any human being can suffer.  Not only is it painful to experience but it also is painful to witness, if only because one feels powerless to help.  In the context of a maternity hospital, for example, the loss of a baby may be a parent&rsquo;s first experience of death.  The length of the pregnancy has no relation to the depth of grief and sense of loss experienced.  In paediatric ministry, chaplains work with parents whose children have been diagnosed with a life-limiting condition.  Often and regrettably, death is not the worst thing.  There are living deaths in which parents must mourn the loss of a healthy child and learn to live a life full of uncertainty and stress, often with little or support, and to care for a highly-dependent child or young adult, cope with multiple hospital admissions, provide high-dependency home care and care for siblings, as well as to try to maintain their relationship with their partners.  In the case of an accident or sudden death, the sense of trauma, disbelief and anguish is enhanced as the death is sudden.  The impact is immediate.  A person&rsquo;s life is torn asunder instantly and without warning.</p><p> In essence, what does a chaplain really bring to end-of-life care?  A crucial element of our training is self-awareness and being challenged to deal with our feelings about our own mortality, fears and anxieties.  Having confronted these during our period of training ensures that we are equipped to cope with the vulnerability of those we seek to help in stressful situations and particularly at end of life stage.  We all experience the death of a loved one at some stage in our life but the quality of care given to family members around the time of a death - especially when the death is sudden - can and does impact on the grieving process later on.  People speak of remembering what the chaplain suggested, did or wore months and even years after the death of their loved one, which is evidence of the impact of the chaplain&rsquo;s intervention with the family.  Chaplains try to ensure that the needs of the patient and family members are met as much as possible.  In research recently commissioned by the National Association of Healthcare Chaplains, NAHC, and not yet published, it is clear from the findings that most families expect to encounter a chaplain when their loved one is dying in hospital and actively seek the presence of a chaplain.  Chaplains pray with patients and offer to link families of different denominations and faiths with a minister of their own faith when requested or where possible.  Chaplains support and accompany families when their loved one is actively dying and during the immediate mourning period in the hospital.  Chaplains endeavour to prevent people from dying alone.  In the absence of loved ones, a chaplain will sit with a patient assuring him or her that he or she is not alone.  Chaplains are trained in debriefing and this is offered to staff who have been affected by workplace traumas and deaths.</p><p> In conclusion, I will make our recommendations and closing comments.  Working in hospitals is difficult to say the least.  It is emotionally fraught and draining.  The complexity of illness, the levels of care and the turnover of patients have increased considerably in the last few years.  To continue to provide chaplaincy services into the future, we suggest that the Health Service Executive, HSE, embargo be lifted on recruitment in order that more chaplains can be employed.  On foot of the reduction in chaplaincy posts in some hospitals, the service has been reduced to a simple "meet and greet" service, which is not acceptable.  To die in a public ward is not conducive to dying with dignity.  We ask that in every hospital, a single room be made available each time a person is ending their life&rsquo;s journey.  This will ensure that for the patient and his or her family, the end of life experience is a private family one and not one in which a person&rsquo;s dignity and privacy become compromised.</p></speech>

While my background is as a senior lecturer in law in UCC, specialising in medical and health care law, I have also been involved in the area of medical ethics and patient safety for many years.  Although most of us would prefer to die at home, unfortunately it is not always possible for various reasons.  A hospital environment often can be a busy, noisy, crowded place to die with too little time and space given to the privacy and dignity of the person.  Bad news is delivered in wards with other patients overhearing from behind the bed curtain, families wait anxiously for hours to catch a quick word with a busy consultant and patients often are left wondering what is happening to them.</p><p>  I do not intend to speak about the physical environment in which people die, as the joint committee has already heard submissions on this topic.  However, I would like to speak about the duty of care owed by a hospital to patients and their families and what this means.  I am not speaking specifically about a legal duty, breach of which might result in litigation for negligence, but rather a broader ethical duty of care that imports the values of respect, compassion and honesty.  To my mind, such a duty arises from the inherent nature of health care itself, which is to care for the person, physically and psychologically, to cure where possible and to provide relief, support and comfort where cure is not possible.</p><p>  The importance of respect for the dignity of the dying person is a principle with which no one would argue.  While we all appreciate the huge and important advances that have been made in medicine, at the same time we must ensure the care of the person does not become overly medicalised to the extent that sight is lost of the fact that the person in the bed is an individual with a voice, wishes and interests, who may have already come to terms with his or her impending death and is not simply a patient for whom treatment is being provided by numerous health care professionals across multidisciplinary teams in an attempt to maintain vital functions.  Although palliative care has encouraged medicine to be gentler in its acceptance of death, medical services sometimes continue to regard death as something to be resisted, postponed or avoided.  The challenge for doctors here is to balance technical intervention with a humanistic approach to their dying patients.  We need practices and structures that offer a compassionate and competent response to illness, fragility and mortality.  We need a patient-centred approach, which will focus on the patient&rsquo;s health, identity and relationships, as well as the processes that support the delivery of good care.</p><p>  I wish to draw the joint committee&rsquo;s attention to the national consent policy that was published in May 2013.  This policy is intended to apply to all health and social care services conducted by or on behalf of the HSE.  I was the chairperson of the national consent advisory group that drafted this policy and I look forward to its effective implementation to ensure a consistent and high-quality consent process in all hospitals across the country.  There are a few matters in the policy to which I wish to draw members' attention.  First, on the theme of respect and dignity, consent is a process whereby a person gives permission for an intervention following communication of information about that intervention.  The ethical rationale behind the importance of consent is the need to respect the person&rsquo;s right to self-determination, that is, his or her right to control his or her own life and to decide what happens to his or her own body.  Good health care decision-making involves trust between the patient and doctor, open and effective communication and mutual respect.</p> <p>It is important to acknowledge that although those providing health care can usually claim greater expertise in decisions regarding the means to achieve</p><p>the end of better health, such as what medication to use, we must bear in mind that the patient is the expert in deciding what ends matter to him or her, how they want to live their lives, what risks they are prepared to take and so on.</p><p> I refer to the role of the family.  The national consent policy points out that no person, such as a family member, friend or carer, and no organisation can give or refuse consent to a health or social care service on behalf of an adult patient or service user unless they have specific legal authority to do so.  This also means that a family member is not legally entitled to direct that any services be provided or withheld or, more important, that any information be withheld from a patient.  There is very little understanding of this position among families and within the health care system.  Service providers should aim to have good relationships with patient's families, in particular to consult with them about what the patient may or may not want for themselves if the patient is unable to communicate those wishes.  However, in reality, this can be challenging to clinical staff where there is disagreement within the family or where there has been a breakdown of trust between the family and the clinicians.  Further support, training and guidelines as well as more public awareness and discussion in this area would assist everyone involved in these potentially difficult situations. </p><p> I refer to do not attempt resuscitation, DNAR, orders.  A DNAR is a written instruction to health care staff not to attempt CPR in the event of cardiac failure.  It does not have any application to any other aspect of the patient's treatment and care.  There are concerns about a lack of consistency in how resuscitation decisions are made and a lack of clarity about the decision-making process.  The consent policy provides clarity around the issues only in the context of consent.  It does not provide guidance for technical and practical considerations relating to resuscitation procedures.  The national consent advisory group was of the view that there is a need for national guidelines on these issues and I submit that this area would also benefit from wider public discussion so that the public is aware of the decision-making process involved here.</p><p> In 2005, I was appointed by the then Minister for Health, Ms Mary Harney, to write a final report on post mortem practice and organ retention.  In my report, I highlighted the lifelong nature of bereavement, and the instinct we have when a loved one dies to provide the deceased person with as much dignity as possible even in death.  Hospitals must be mindful that they have a duty of care not only to the patient but also a duty which extends after death to show respect for the person's body and to minimise the distress of families by ensuring that appropriate measures are taken in caring for the body.  What the hospital staff see as a body is still someone's mother, father, spouse or child even after death.  In particular, where a post mortem examination is to be carried out, great care must be given to the way in which this is communicated to families and their authorisation sought for this procedure.  The family's experience of the death of their loved one will last for months and years to come and will affect their quality of life and emotional health in many cases.  </p><p> Although improvements have taken place in this area through the publication of national standards for post mortem practice and work done by the faculty of pathology in its quality assurance framework, it is regrettable that the Human Tissue Bill, which was recommended in my report in 2005, has yet to be published and enacted. The enactment of this Bill would ensure clarity and consistency of standards in regard to obtaining consent or authorisation for post mortem examinations and organ retention and provide reassurance to the public that the organ retention controversy of the past will never happen again while at the same time, encouraging medical education and valuable and ethically approved research.  I urge this committee to recommend to the Minister the enactment of this Bill at the earliest opportunity.  </p></speech>

We welcome this opportunity to talk to the committee about staff development and education in regard to good end-of-life care in Ireland.  It explicitly acknowledges that we can make a difference through awareness-raising and training for health care staff and professionals.  At the end of the day, I am here to remind everybody that fundamental to good end-of-life care is the person, the patient or the resident.  We have to keep them at the centre of everything we do.</p><p>  As we have heard, end-of-life care is important to every one of us.  It will be of interest to all of us.  Sooner or later, it will be us or someone we know and love.  Death and dying are part of the human experience.  In the Irish Hospice Foundation, we believe that nobody should die alone, frightened, lonely or in pain.  Unfortunately, for people in Ireland today, death and dying can be a very lonely experience.  If one was parachuted into Ireland from outer space and landed at a funeral, one would think we were brilliant at death and dying.  We are great when people are dead.  It is no problem in that we do not have to talk to them.  We can talk about them and we turn up in our thousands to celebrate their passing and it is a wonderful experience.  People often say they are not afraid of being dead but that they are really scared about what comes before it and about the dying process.  Why are they scared about that?  They are scared because it is the loss of autonomy, the loss of their sense of control, the loss of their dignity and the fact that nobody will engage with them about what is important to them and their concerns.  </p><p>  It is estimated there are approximately 95,000 people working in health care in Ireland.  If one is working in health care, potentially, death and dying will be part of one's job and we need to recognise that.  Today in Ireland, 80 people will die, five of whom will die in a hospice which is the five star care one will get.  What about the other 75?  Can we ensure that those 75 have access to good care too?  The only way we will do that is if we train and enable staff through good education programmes so that they will be able to engage with patients or residents about their concerns and end-of-life.  Unfortunately, at the moment, it is a little bit of a lottery and it is down to whom one meets on the day and how comfortable the person who is dealing with one or one's family is with end-of-life, conversations about end-of-life and what is important.    </p><p>  The Irish Hospice Foundation has been involved in developing or grant-aiding the development of a wide range of initiatives aimed at health care staff in the last decade or so.  We have provided training for more than 5,500 people - members of staff in the health care setting - in the past three years to help them to make a difference to people at end-of-life.  We have three different staff development workshops.  Two of these workshops specifically focus on communication and connection with people at end-of-life.  The third helps staff break bad news more sensitively.  Details of the workshops are in my written submission.  We know these workshops work.  We have had them evaluated by UCD in 2011 and by Trinity College in 2013 and both of those evaluations attested to the overwhelmingly positive reactions of those who attended.</p><p>  What are we trying to do?  The aim of the workshops is to try to help staff to be a little more confident, competent and comfortable around the people for whom they care at end-of-life and to be confident enough to talk to them about what really matters to them.  In this sense, our workshops are very focused on person-to-person communication because we know communication is central to good end-of-life care.  In addition to everything else members have heard, I am here to remind them it is fundamental to good end-of-life care that we keep the person at the centre of everything we do.  We remind staff that good end-of-life care is fundamentally about respect and about really connecting with the person.  There is no better way to show respect to someone than to talk to them and to listen to them, especially at a time of loneliness and distress.  There is no better way to care for somebody than to actually give somebody one's wholehearted attention and to allow him or her to express his or her concerns and for us to do our best to facilitate his or her preference.  A frequent outcome of participation in our workshops is that staff discover that they can become more relationship-focused within the course of the normal working day and that it is not just about the task but about seeing the person.  </p><p>  We take a hearts and minds approach.  When the thank you cards come in, they thank the staff for being so professional and compassionate.  They always link the two.  People want us to be professional - that we know what we are doing and that we are confident in what we are doing - but they want us to be compassionate as well.  When we have the balance of hearts and minds, then one can fly if one is the patient receiving that service.  We look after people's minds.  We educate minds by giving staff good practice tools and theories about how to talk to and listen to people about their concerns and preferences and about how to break bad news, which is the hardest part of anybody's job, how to help people deal with the impact of that news and how to initiate difficult conversations and respond to difficult questions.</p><p>  We also put a lot of emphasis on communication about the heart aspect that death and dying are not just about procedures but about my passion that we need to get this right.  People only die once, so it is not a one size fits all.  We cannot pick the book off the shelf and read all about it and have all the answers.  We are all different, we have different needs and different worries and concerns.  I cannot assume I know what someone wants unless I ask the person.  I will not find out what is important to the person unless I take the time to listen.  All too often, patients and residents will worry about their deteriorating condition and make many efforts to engage with staff.</p> <p>They will say, "I am not getting better, am I?" or, "I don't think I am going to make it.  I think I'm finished.  Am I dying?", and all too often the response of the staff, who are coming from a good place, is to try to keep the person up-beat and hopeful rather than finding out what lies behind that question.  Relationships matter, but particularly when we are vulnerable.  Relationships between patients and residents are particularly important.</p><p> What we are trying to get across is that our work with staff is about reminding them of their own humanity and to remember always that if they are dealing with a patient, a person is more than their illness.  If they see them only as their illness they will miss out on huge opportunities for healing and wellness.</p><p> Patients will often ask us about their end of life.  Questions such as, "Am I dying?  I am not getting better" are often met with, "You're grand, pet.  I'll get you a cup of tea".  The question, "Am I dying?" will be met with, "Not on my shift".  If someone was in bed and they had a sense that they were getting weaker by the day and that their life was slowing ebbing away, and if they were constantly asking the people caring for them, "Am I dying?  I am not getting better.  These tablets do not seem to be working any more" and getting the reply, "You're grand.  We are going to look after you.  Don't be worrying about that", how would that make them feel over time?  Would they keep asking the question or give up?  I believe most people would give up.  The staff would then tell their relatives that the patient is getting very withdrawn.  Why?  Because nobody is engaging with that person.  Nobody is asking the patient what is important.</p><p> I will tell the members a couple of stories, one of which in particular emphasises the need to engage with people.  A staff member in a paediatric hospital I was working in told me this story against herself, so to speak.  She said they had a little fellow with cystic fibrosis whom they knew since he was a baby.  They knew all about him and knew all the members of his family, and he knew all the staff.  She said he was not for transplant.  Everyone knew he was a case for TLC.  He was beginning to die.  She went in to him one morning and asked him how he was and he replied, "I'm really lonely".  She asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nobody is talking to me any more".  That emphasises the importance of good training for staff in terms of communication.  There is something about attaching end-of- life to somebody's condition.  We all fall off a cliff, so to speak, in that regard.  We stop engaging with people on what actually matters.</p><p> We mentioned earlier a good death.  What is a good death?  A good death is me being at peace with myself.  For me to be at peace with myself I have to forgive myself, let go of issues, forgive others, have conversations about what I need to do, put things away and be in a state of readiness.  How will I do that?  The only way I will do that is if somebody sits down and is willing to have conversations with me, and the only way I will be able to have those conversations with that person is if I am trained to do it.  We cannot assume that people have these skills because they do not.</p><p> In terms of what we are looking for, and we are talking about 95,000 people, we believe everybody should have access to training in end of life care.  The system must take ownership of that training and development.  The Irish Hospice Foundation recommends that the health service takes responsibility for delivering good end of life care training and development, and we must take on board the private contractors as well.</p><p> I will conclude on staff support.  The system is creaking.  Staff are doing their best to deliver good quality care but they are struggling with it.  We are not looking for new five star centres or for more people to be employed.  We want to get staff to acknowledge that what they do is very difficult.  Not every death will affect one but some deaths will, and we need our colleagues to acknowledge that for us.  The question to a staff member should be, "Is that family gone?  How are you?  Do you need to take five minutes?  We will cover for you.  Go off and have a cup of coffee" but the question normally asked is, "Is that family gone?  Okay.  I need you to do X, Y and Z".  They write on every carer's tombstone "Own needs not met".  We are very good at giving it out but we are very bad at nourishing ourselves.  We must enable staff to recognise that this work is tough and that to continue doing it we must be skilled, and we must look after ourselves.  I thank the members for listening and apologies for going over time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.610" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Cillian Twomey" time="10:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013111400009#K00300"><p>I appreciate the opportunity to speak with the committee and recognise that as this is the last hearing the members have probably heard most of what has been said in some shape or form previously but it is useful to have an opportunity to stress some aspects of it.</p><p>  First, I speak as a geriatrician, and there are many similarities between specialists in palliative medicine and specialists in geriatric medicine in that with the advancement of medical science many specialties now tend to be more single system specialties whereas geriatric medicine still retains a total person approach, which is important.</p><p>  Second, in geriatric medicine mortality of patients under one's care is a more common phenomenon by virtue of the age of the patient group one manages.  In our own department, for example, 43% of our patients are over the age of 80 although by strict definition one is elderly when one reaches 65; that usually insults most people who are 65, myself included.  There is that total patient approach but there is a confusion of terminology.  What is end of life care?  What is terminal care?  What is a patient who is dying, and are we good at picking up those particular elements of the life cycle?  In some respects we are not, and that comes back to education and training and awareness.</p><p>  Historically, in palliative medicine - members have heard a good deal about specialist palliative care and I support the strong call for its expansion where it is particularly deficient in numbers - those involved looked after patients only with cancer.  Fortunately, that is no longer the case because as we all recognise, there are many illnesses other than cancer for whom there is a phase beyond the curative, which requires support.  For example, in terms of somebody with advanced heart failure, and there is a gradation of heart failure, 70% of patients in the grade 3 or 4 heart failure category will die within 12 months but we do not suddenly announce 12 months before they die that they dying.  Our approach to their management, as in specialist palliative care, will be to look after them to the best possible extent symptomatically through their final months but a recognition in that phase is important from an entire spectrum of issues.  Have they sorted out their family arrangements?  Do other family members realise the circumstances and so on?</p><p>  We have heard already about the numbers of deaths and where they happen.  Each death is unique, whether it is following a traumatic event, a murder, a car accident or an acute medical insult.  A different set of activities might need to be activated in the context of a sudden unexpected death but there must be a series of policies to look after that particular case.</p><p>  In elderly care medicine, most of the deaths are relatively predictable in the sense that they have multiple conditions that, ultimately and unfortunately, will be responsible for taking their life.  My interest in this subject was energised considerably when I was invited to become a member of the Hospice Friendly Hospitals Programme steering committee in 2005.  To some extent I was embarrassed that I had worked for 40 years as a doctor and never questioned the inappropriateness of multi-bed facilities in our hospitals.  If any of us go to London for the weekend with our spouse and we put the card into the bedroom door we do not expect four other couples to be in the room when we arrive.  Were that to happen we would be appalled but we think nothing of having sick people in multi-bed facilities.</p><p>  In the context of end-of-life, it is essential that patients and their families have the opportunity of being in a private area but that is difficult to realise when the percentage of single beds in our hospital construct is so small.  There is an infection control policy, which I support to some extent, to the effect that if somebody is readmitted to hospital who, in a previous admission, had MRSA up their nose, for example, which is of no injury to anybody unless they travel up their nose, they must be put into a single room on readmission to hospital.  We do not have any such diktat stating that if somebody is dying we should put them in a single room.  This event occurs 29,000 a year and I suggest it needs some addressing.</p><p>  Roger Ulrich, whom I reference in my paper, has done a good deal of work on this area and the advantages are far greater than just dignity, respect and privacy for a patient and his or her family when they are dying but he has proven financial savings and greatly reduced hospital care infections by a single room policy.  In my view every bed in a hospital should be a single, with the obvious exception of intensive care and high dependency units.  That should be the target.</p><p>  The benefits of hospice care are well-established and we are indebted to those in specialist palliative medicine for the degree to which they have raised our awareness of it.  A different philosophy is required for dealing with patients coming towards the end of life.  An interesting paper was published this year in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine, </i>which I reference, entitled Generalist plus Specialist Palliative Care.  It states: &quot;[M]any elements of palliative care can [and should] be provided by existing specialist or generalist clinicians [general practitioners and other health care professionals] regardless of discipline&quot;.</p><p>  Who has responsibility in this regard?  We all have responsibility.  The national advisory committee on palliative care defines three levels which I instance in my paper.  Level 1 is a core skill that every health care professional working in a hospital or a community care setting should be able to deliver.  As a geriatrician I could not possibly be asked to look after every old person who is sick, and a specialist in palliative care cannot be asked to look after every person, regardless of age.</p> <p>Let us not forget that dying in younger people is equally in need of this support.  If there is a philosophy of understanding the core issues involved across the board there is a better chance of a total improved care, on the basis that a rising tide raises all boats.  In fact, ironically, the care of those in hospital who are not dying will be enhanced if that culture and philosophy is pervasive.  The ageing population is something to celebrate not to criticise as is sometimes the case when people talk about the &ldquo;burden of older age&rdquo; and &ldquo;bed blockers&rdquo; and so on.  Most of us are lucky enough that we will be very healthy.  There is therefore a need to acknowledge the fact that numerically there will be more older people, and certainly more aged over 75 and 85, who will have medical problems, multiple pathology, for whom there will be a phase when they are dying.</p><p> Some of the decisions one has to make are challenging.  Should somebody who is in a nursing home, or their own home, with a debilitating stroke disease and perhaps dementia as well, be admitted or transferred to a hospital straight away because their temperature rises or they get another infection?  If one calls the out-of-hours medical on-call service the team on duty from midnight to 8 a.m. is not necessarily familiar with the patient or the setting.  There is a low enough reflex to press the ambulance button to transfer that patient.  That reflects a lack of dialogue in that institution between the health care professionals about whether if Cillian, who has these awful irreversible end-stage conditions, gets a temperature, we can deal with that in our own setting and not be afraid.</p><p> Have we asked the patient?  I agree with Dr. Madden that there is a presumption that the dialogue is between the clinician and the family members.  That is an even greater presumption in older age.  There is an automatic presumption that if one is 80 one could not possibly answer a question whereas as we all know that is quite untrue.  One's first loyalty and commitment is to the patient.  Very often a patient will tell the doctor not to talk to his son and to please talk to him.  That is not uncommon.  Have we asked the patient what he would like to do at the end of life?  Not often.  In the geriatric unit in Cork we have a "do not resuscitate" policy, which works quite well but it has been challenging to introduce it.  The centre of gerontology and rehabilitation in UCC is undertaking a study led by Professor Willie Molloy which is studying advanced care planning and the impact that might have on the residents of three large residential care facilities in the Cork-Kerry region.  We are educating the residents who are capable of participating in such an exercise about advance care planning, seeking their views on it.  We are also engaging in an education programme for the professionals, the nurses and doctors in those areas.  We will study a certain number who have been given this training programme and compare them with another group who have not been on the programme to see the outcome.  It might inform the current D&aacute;il statute discussions on advance care planning and on capacity.</p><p> I support the notion of strategy.  It has to be part of every service plan that there is an end-of-life, bereavement, death package.  We need local leaders.  Of the hospice friendly hospitals programme, which involved 40 hospitals, there are only four coordinators of end-of-life care paid on an ongoing basis.  We cannot function without leaders at local level.  I commend the committee for holding discussions on this topic. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joan Kelly" time="10:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013111400010#L00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting me here this morning.  I want to speak about the needs of cancer patients and make recommendations for end-of-life care for them that will better meet their needs.  Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Ireland and cancer patients are the largest group to avail of specialist palliative care.  This is unlikely to change.</p><p>  Cancer accounts for over 8,600 deaths in Ireland every year.  It is predicted that the number of cancer cases will increase from around 30,000 as it is now, to 42,000 in 2020.  Improvements in cancer detection and treatment mean that cancer survival rates are improving, with 65% of all patients diagnosed surviving their illness.  New treatments mean that patients with cancer live longer but will require end of life care.  An ageing population with complex medical needs is likely to increase demand for palliative care services.  This presents a significant challenge for a health system undergoing extensive reform in the face of increasing financial difficulty.  Palliative care is an approach to caring for people with and illness that will not be cured or is life-limiting.  It can be delivered in a variety of settings and no doubt the committee has heard more about that in the past few days.  It is also important to note that palliative care can be delivered in any setting, acute hospitals, community hospitals, nursing homes, hospices or in the patient&rsquo;s home.  The Irish Hospice Foundation found in 2004 that two thirds of people wish to die at home but unfortunately the national average is approximately 26%.</p><p>  In supporting end-of-life care for cancer patients in the primary care setting the Irish Cancer Society provides a night-nursing service to patients in their own homes.  This service began in 1986.  It is the only national palliative care service available to cancer patients at night in their own homes.  The Irish Cancer Society receives no State funding for this service and depends entirely on public donations.  The service plays a vital role in supporting integrated palliative care without which many patients would have to be admitted to hospital and could not continue to receive care in their own homes.  An admission to hospital for people who are as ill as these patients are would unfortunately result in their death's occurring within 24 or 48 hours.  It is imperative that patients being cared for at home continue to be cared for there and have the choice of place of care for their death.</p><p>  In 2012 the Irish Cancer Society provided 7,600 nights of care to over 2,100 cancer patients.  The average cost of a night of care is around &euro;350.  The demands for this service are increasing at a rate of  approximately 7% a year.  It costs the society approximately &euro;2.6 million to provide night-nursing to the entire country.  The Irish Cancer Society will seek further funding and policy development to support integrated palliative care in primary care and recommends that the money-follows-the-patient model should incorporate end of life care at night in the patient&rsquo;s home.  There is a gap in the provision of home care as the Irish Cancer Society night nurses are available generally between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m.  In general day services operate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. which results in a gap in provision between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and 11 p.m.  This can cause considerable distress and is a barrier to patients&rsquo; remaining at home.  The gap needs to be bridged by integrating night-nursing services into palliative and primary care services so that patients have access to 24 hour care if and as required.</p><p>  Palliative care patients require timely access to services and care and should be able to access those services in the most efficient and stress-free manner.  Patients with a terminal illness are entitled to an emergency medical card, valid for six months.  A doctor&rsquo;s or consultant&rsquo;s letter stating that the patient is terminally ill or at the end of their life is required to obtain such a card.  Patients with an incurable cancer who are not expected to survive longer than six months must be reassessed on financial grounds if they survive longer than six months after the card was provided.  This requires extensive paperwork at a time of considerable distress for the patient and the family.</p> <p>It is estimated that 20% of these discretionary cards require such a renewal after a time period of six months.  The society has heard that doctors and consultants may be reluctant to write "terminal" or "life-limiting" on a letter and give that to the patient in support of their application for a medical card.  The Irish Cancer Society recommends that patients in the advanced stage of their illness be granted a special status that does not require them to be financially assessed at a time of significant distress.</p><p> In regard to psycho-oncology services, I have some points to make and I will then conclude.  Some 40% of cancer patients will experience significant distress as a result of their diagnosis.  This requires the intervention of a mental health care professional to help them cope with what could already be a terminal illness at the point of diagnosis or could soon become a terminal illness.  The strategy for cancer control 2006 recommended that the HSE should ensure access and that comprehensive psycho-oncology and psycho-social support be provided to all cancer patients and their families in each of the managed care networks.  Currently, two of the eight designated cancer centres have dedicated psycho-oncology services.  The Irish Cancer Society recommends that dedicated psycho-oncology services be delivered in each of the designated hospitals where cancer patients are treated and that psycho-oncology should be part of the multidisciplinary team and involve patient care from the point of diagnosis onwards.</p></speech>

We know we have a lot to do in this regard.  I commend the witnesses on all the hard work they do, of which we are very aware.</p><p>  A number of points came up again and again in the presentations.  A significant one is the unfitness of our hospital system for end-of-life patients and caring for the bereaved.  Is there a shortfall in training for end-of-life care and what forms of training do we need to provide?  Mr. Nolan was right about the importance of seeing the person beyond their condition of illness and making a connection.  Does he imagine that different levels of training would be useful, such as specific techniques and skills in regard to bereavement awareness?  Does he believe training for dealing with the bereaved should be part of this?</p></speech>

I ask him to expand on that.  What are the key challenges with regard to pain relief in today's health care system?</p><p>  I ask Mr. Plunkett to expand on the reluctance to allow frail and elderly men and women die peacefully in nursing homes, which is somewhat troubling.  In what respect has the Leas Cross controversy affected that issue?</p><p>  Ms Kelly's points about the medical cards were well made.  I am sure she is well aware that this issue has been discussed regularly and I hope it is something on which we might be able to come to a positive conclusion in the future.</p><p>  Professor Twomey instanced the proportions of those who die between long-term residencies, hospitals and their own homes.  Does he believe there is any likelihood those proportions might change over time?  Should we endeavour to change that or is that simply the way the process works?</p><p>  Regarding end of life proofing of homes, is that an issue which needs to be considered and what role could it play in ensuring quality end of life care?</p><p>  On the point Professor Twomey made earlier regarding the perception that people of 80 years of age may not be able to answer questions, many people aged 80 are running countries.  That puts an end to that argument.</p><p>  I found Mr. King's contribution extremely interesting; I could listen to him speaking all day.  I ask him to expand on the final point he made about the need for more ambulances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.626" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013111400013#Q00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentations to us.  I will not touch on every presentation but a general thread running through them was the relationship between the staff, the patient and the relatives - the triangle, so to speak.  Mr. Nolan spoke about staff being confident, competent and comfortable but my thoughts were about the patient and words such as "consent", "choice" and "control".  Listening to what many people said, I believe we remove much of the control from the patients.  Dr. Madden said that the patient is the expert.  I wonder if that should be the title of our report in terms of putting the patient first and foremost.</p><p>  This morning we are focused on the care element at end of life.  Everybody focuses on the end of life and forgets the care element that is so important but there is an issue about control and the interaction with relatives.  I agree with Mr. Nolan on the staff training issue but relatives also face a cliff edge and in that respect they do not know the vocabulary or whether they are taking the right approach because they do not necessarily believe that somebody is advocating on behalf of the patient.  They often do the wrong thing in trying to do the right thing for their relatives.  Do the witnesses have views on how we can raise greater awareness among the public in that regard?</p><p>  That brings me to a specific issue raised about which I am concerned, namely, the "do not attempt to resuscitate" issue.  I did not realise that the legal basis was unclear.  Dr. Madden spoke about the issue of consent, and Dr. King raised it also, but because it is not clear my experience is that the relatives have to unnecessarily repeat the request, which can sound callous at a very sensitive time for the patient and the family.  That aspect hit home for me.  There has been talk about advanced care directives, and the issue of the timing of when those advanced care directives should be discussed arose.  That is something we must take on board.</p><p>  Dr. King gave us compelling messages on the human tissue Bill.  </p><p>  I agree strongly with Professor Twomey on the issue of single rooms.  Having that space is important on so many levels in terms of the patient's dignity.</p><p>  On the medical card issue raised by Ms Kelly, we have had discussions here with the Minister for Health and representatives of the Health Service Executive about the six months aspect.  Effectively, a patient almost has to apologise for living more than the anticipated six months.  We have heard of cases where the patient does not want it written on their form that their condition is terminal.  The family and others may know but we all know people approach these matters differently and to have the word "terminal" written down can be distressing.  A number of issues intermingle in that regard.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses and ask them to reflect on some of the issues I believe are important.  Relationships matter greatly.  In terms of the chaplain service, I would consider providing facilities and spaces.  I am sorry but I had not realised that the HSE employs chaplains.  We need to examine all those inter-relationships with a patient.</p><p>  My final point is about a concern I have that an allocated staff member deals with the death discussion.  If a patient were to ask that question, my understanding is that all staff should be present, certainly from listening to what several witnesses said, including Mr. Nolan, and not postponing that discussion.  It should not be done bluntly but there is a way to do it.  When we are considering our report we must ensure that it is not about having designated people.  It is too easy, when considering reports, to say we will designate people to do this and that because from what I am hearing we should be providing a seamless service.  That is more of a commentary, Chairman.</p></speech>

It is important that we give recognition to the important part they play in this country's health service.</p><p>  I come from a legal background and many of the issues raised touch on the legal area.  I listened to what Dr. King said about not doing resuscitation but an issue arises in that respect.  If medical personnel who are called out to a house arrive and are seen not to take any action, the blame game starts and they find it difficult to try to explain the reason they are not taking action.  The easiest course for them to take, therefore, is to take action even though it might not be the best approach if the person has died but they are afraid to be seen to be not taking action.  That is an issue that arises for staff in those circumstances.</p><p>  Likewise in hospitals, medical negligence is the biggest growth area.  It is not necessarily about the standard of care being provided but that people appear to have more access to information and are more willing to go down the legal route.  That is a huge issue for medical staff.  Professor Twomey will find from his experience that it is putting people into various corners from a medical care point of view.  I do not know how we can deal with that but it must be tackled.  We set up the Injuries Board to deal with claims arising out of car accidents and industrial accidents but we have done nothing to review and change the way we deal with litigation involving medical negligence cases.  That is something we need to review.</p><p>  Dr. Madden spoke about the role of the family in a hospital setting.</p> <p>I had a case myself a few years ago where someone was calling to an elderly person three times a day and providing all of the care for that person, who had no contact at all with his family.  The person was then admitted to hospital and the family instructed the hospital that the care assistant was not to be let near the ward.  The difficulty for the staff in the hospital is how to deal with that.  Even though the person was competent to give his own instructions to the hospital staff, they were getting caught between the two sides.  The person died in hospital and was traumatised as he died because he felt his care assistant had deserted him, whereas in fact it was the other way around.  I have seen that issue arise on a number of occasions.  How do hospitals deal with that?</p><p> The other issue raised was about staff support.  There is not enough staff support in hospital units where a death rarely occurs, and when it does occur, there are no procedures in that setting.  People can be working in a particular unit where death does not occur that often, and there are no procedures for them.  I have come across staff in such situations who are very traumatised by what has occurred, but there is no fall-back for them.  We should look at that within hospitals.  There is a better structure in elderly care for dealing with that, but in other units that is often not the case, and I think we should look at that.</p><p> One of the frightening things I have found with elderly care over recent years is the amount of litigation arising in respect of the administration of estates.  In my first 20 years of practice, I never had to deal with this litigation, but it is arising a lot more.  It is coming into the hospital setting and it is a case of how we deal with that through education and information.  We need to look at it.</p></speech>

First and foremost, nobody wants to die.  If we were to ask somebody where they want to die, they would first say that they do not want to die at all.  By that I mean that we do not really think about dying.  It is kind of a taboo subject and people have very different and personal understandings of it.  That is again an educational deficit that needs to be addressed.   When people are asked where they would best like to die when they die, they all say they would like to die at home.  That is nice and appropriate, but we must caution that sometimes it is not appropriate that they die at home because their needs are such that they need to be looked after in a separate environment.  Even though Mr. Nolan provided the figure that five people will die today in a hospice, several people will die today at home who are part of the specialist palliative care team and are being supported by the home care team at home.  All three levels of palliative care I described need to co-exist and be organised for it to be done properly.  There should be much fewer people dying in acute hospitals than is the case, but that will not happen unless we put the structure in place in the community or at home.</p><p>  Advanced care planning might help a lot to inform progress in the area of residential care centres.  The consultation does not take place when a person is near death or dying.  It could take place today when a person is perfectly well, and the person is asked what kind of care they would like in the event of something happening to them.  Professor Molloy devised Let Me Decide, which is a worldwide document that has been used along these lines.  It is a tweaking of that booklet which is part of the pilot survey.  The initial reaction from this pilot project is that relatives have not been shocked and horrified by the discussion and instead have welcomed it.  Some might say they do not wish to talk about it at all, but many appreciated doing so.</p><p>  A reference was made to Leas Cross.  Without doubt Leas Cross scared the living daylights out of people in many places, because owners felt that if anyone died in their facility, there might be a Leas Cross type inquiry.  HIQA standards for residential care specify there need to be end-of-life care discussions with all residents, so that one has a sense of what should be done in the circumstance.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout spoke about 80 year olds who are perfectly fit and well, and she is speaking to the converted in that respect.  The majority are well.  A figure was bandied about, which is correct, that 25% of those over the age of 85 get dementia, but that means 75% of people over the age of 85 do not get dementia, and many of the 25% who get dementia retain capacity.  I might think Jack Lynch is still Taoiseach because I am from Cork, but that does not necessarily mean I lack intellectual capacity to decide-----</p></speech>

Some of the questions we ask about testing capacity are not very relevant.  That comes together in the context of wills and testamentary capacity.</p><p>  The issue of litigation is slightly outside this debate, but I agree that it could arise.  In my view, collaborative practice mediation is an area of dealing with concerns that needs to be developed very strongly.  These issues arise nearly always out of a communication deficit, and we should try to make ourselves more available for that.  That is easily said but less easily delivered.  In practice, I did rounds on three different wards every week, and at the end of each round I had a meeting with relatives, which is communicating.  I was conscious of the importance and I explained things in plain language and so on.  However, I got into the habit after a while of asking the person to whom I was talking if he or she could provide a synopsis of what he or she thought I had said.  Sometimes I would be horrified as I thought I had not said that at all.  That is bad enough, but then I would meet that person's sister next week and ask the same question, and then I would hear a different version of events.  People do not hear half of what we say when we first meet them, and perhaps they do not understand half of what they have heard.  That means we need to meet them repeatedly.  That is time consuming but worthy of practice.</p></speech>

We will keep a close eye on that.  The issue of "do not resuscitate"  and resuscitation in general is an issue for us in the Irish Cancer Society and for our nurses.  We provide end-of-life care and, of the 2,600 patients we have looked after in the past year, pretty much all of them died at home and without resuscitation, I am glad to say.  Clarification on that issue would be enormously helpful for us.  It can be a grey issue, although it generally is not and any clarifications on that would be most welcome.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.634" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bryan Nolan" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013111400014#R00700"><p>A question before the vote was directed to me about the need for education.  There is a substantial need for education in the health service.  Years ago people had natural skills about how to deal with end-of-life issues, because their relations all died at home and neighbours came in and laid them out and so on.  I have met fully qualified staff nurses who have never even seen a person die or never even seen a dead person, so we cannot assume the people looking after the dying person know what is appropriate and what happens next.  We would say that everybody needs some education.  There are some who need more and then a small group of people probably need everything.</p><p>  I would like to provide an example of how important the Final Journeys programme can be.  Sometimes care is being delivered within a space.  We do not even recognise who is delivering that care.  In one Dublin teaching hospital, we took a group of staff who were working in a particular area - from the doctor down to the tea lady - and we asked them when end-of-life care begins.  The clinicians all said it begins at diagnosis, and that when a person gets a bad diagnosis, we start caring for him or her in an end-of-life care way.  We started drilling down through that idea.  The next thing was that a little voice uttered: "I think that when she stops taking her tea, there is a change."</p> <p>Everybody looked at this person, the tea lady.  I asked her what she meant.  She told me, "There was a lady here recently and when I brought her the tea she told me to go away with the small cup.  She had a mug and she asked me to fill it.  I got on with her really well and over time we had a great relationship.  I knew the day I went into her and she told me she was done with the tea that there was a change.  Very quickly the lady became unconscious.  I used to keep an eye out for when there would be a slice of melon available.  I knew she had a fierce sweet tooth and I used to nip into her when I could and rub her lips with the melon, so she would have the sweetness and moistness of it."</p><p> It was as if she had landed from Mars.  There was complete silence in the room and everybody was looking at this person as if they had never seen her previously.  That is the quality of care that is happening in her space.  Where is that being valued?  Where is it being captured?  Who is saying, "If you are dying on our ward, this is the quality of care you can expect from our service"?  Very often the people who have the deepest relationships with patients are invisible.  They are passing in front of us every day and we do not even see them.  Final Journeys is a wonderful educational opportunity to get people to take a helicopter view of their practice and to see who is providing care, because it is not just me, it is all of us.  When we work together to provide a service, and use all the information we have about the patient and pool it, the only way is up.  The patient will get a five star service.</p><p> In terms of the health care service, everybody in health care must have education, but outside in primary care, to refer to Professor Twomey's point, GPs should be involved.  We do a lot of work with long-stay settings, and people often end up on trolleys in accident and emergency departments because decisions have not been made.  The staff are unable to engage with the residents at a time when they are able, to talk about their wishes and preferences.  We are making these recommendations now, and the Health Information and Quality Authority is saying everybody should have these conversations, but unless we educate and support staff for having these conversations, they will never happen.  In approximately 80% of the admission documentation of the nursing homes I visit, the back page deals with spiritual care or end-of-life care.  There is a line through it, "Not discussed at this time".  How could one talk about end-of-life when somebody has been admitted to long-term care, to their new home?  When does one talk about it?  We need to support staff in their awareness of how to have these conversations, because they are difficult conversations.</p><p> There was a question about making staff confident and comfortable with end-of-life care, and where the patient comes in to all of that.  If we are patient-centred and patient-directed, we could ask the person what is most important to them.  Professor Twomey had a couple of wonderful questions earlier.  One could even ask, "What do I need to know about you as a person that will help me to take the best possible care of you?" and "What are you most concerned about at present?".  The GP could be helped to ask, when he is having his consultation with the patient long before there is any crisis or threat of illness or going into long-term care, "If you ever became seriously unwell, have you ever thought about what you might want?  Have you any worries, wishes or concerns about how you might like to be cared for in the future if you became unwell?  What do I need to know so I can help you with it?".  We do not have these conversations, so decisions are made in crisis and we end up asking the family what they want us to do.  With the best of intentions they want the best done for their mother or father so they ask that the parent be put in the ambulance and sent to the acute hospital.  The poor patient ends up dying on a trolley, surrounded by strangers in an accident and emergency department, as was so well described earlier by my colleague.  The way to get around that is to ask the patient.</p><p> Senator Burke referred to the legal issues.  One thing struck me when he spoke about supporting staff.  He mentioned the ambulance staff arriving when somebody has died and the need to do something.  Whose need is it?  Whose concern is it?  Whose needs are being met in that space?  Is it my need, as the clinician, health care assistant, nurse or doctor, to be seen to do something or is it what the person would want for themselves or is it the most appropriate thing?  Sometimes, it is our need to do the task, because if I am doing a task I can prove I am of use.  Sometimes, however, there is nothing more required than to say, "I am sorry that your mother has died".</p></speech>

The capacity laws in Ireland are inadequate.  They are also offensive.  The current capacity law is based on the lunacy regulations from the 19th century and obviously the language of those regulations is very offensive.  I was happy to see the recent publication of the assisted decision making Bill, the theme of which is the promotion of autonomy.  I like that it clarifies what people working in this area know already, that there is a presumption of capacity.  It clarifies in law that this is the case.  One starts from the basis that everybody has the capacity to make their own decisions.  That is very important.  It also ensures Ireland is compliant with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  It provides a suite of decision-making options to facilitate the patient's autonomy, while recognising that he or she might need support or assistance or a surrogate decision maker, if necessary.</p><p>  Two other aspects of the Bill that are very important are the advanced health care directives, to give support to the legal recognition of those, and the extension of the power of attorney laws to health care.  Both of those will add to the options that are available to try to facilitate autonomy as much as possible.</p><p>  I am delighted Senator van Turnhout picked up on the patient as expert.  That is very important.  She spoke about consent as being choice and control.  It is also about capacity and knowledge.  We can only exercise that choice and control if we, as patients, are informed.  Consent and communication are obviously a process, not a once-off thing.  Professor Twomey spoke about the difficulty for clinicians in giving information, asking the patient to say what they have learned or appreciated from the discussion and having them tell one something completely different.  That is always a difficulty.  There are language and communication difficulties, but these can be circumvented.  One can have visual aids, such as pictorial representations of what one is trying to explain.  There are many different ways in which one can aid that communication, but it is a process and skills are very important in that.</p><p>  Senator Burke mentioned two matters in response to what I said.  The first related to the do-not-resuscitate position.  Bryan Nolan referred to this as well, the expectation of relatives that something should be done.  As with all clinical decisions, the welfare of the patient must be first and foremost.  It is important we do not allow unethical or inappropriate practices to take precedence, such as slow coding or sham resuscitation, where there is a pretence for the family's sake of providing resuscitation.  In my view, that is unethical and inappropriate.  The Senator also spoke about the difficulty for staff who are caught in the middle when there is a difficulty with the family.  Again, why is there always a tendency to defer to the family, regardless of whether they have been heavily involved in the care of the patient, as opposed to the patient?  The staff might have concerns about capacity, which I have mentioned, and there might be legal confusion.  They might feel the next-of-kin has some type of legal authority, which they do not.  They also do not wish to have confrontation, which is perfectly understandable.  They need to have personal strength of commitment to put the patient first.  It is all about communication.</p></speech>

Relationship is at the heart of chaplaincy.  It is about having the time to build up a relationship with a person, to get a sense of who they are, what their story is, what their pains and struggles have been, helping them to find meaning in their past life and helping them to find meaning in their new reality, which can often be the end of their life journey.  If we are reduced to a simple meet and greet service, we do not have the time to build up that pastoral relationship with the person.</p> <p>If we just come in and say, "Hello, how are you?", and move to the next patient we cannot get any sense of who the person is.  Obviously, at the end-of-life stage the person may not have been given any opportunity to work through all the things that are still in his or her heart - regrets, difficulties, etc.  Nobody knows what difficulties another person may be carrying within.</p><p> To move beyond the person, there is the family who will be left to carry the struggle and the pain of bereavement.  If I have not had time to build up a relationship with the family as chaplain, I do not know who they are and I cannot be there to support them.  That is one huge challenge.  If there is an increase in structures for more chaplains, more time and the single room to be with the family while the person is dying, that all adds to building up the relationship where the family can know who the chaplain is.</p><p> I have had many experiences of being present with a person who has died.  As late as last week, I had a situation where a woman died, more or less suddenly, and I was called.  Her husband said I was the person who used to come and with whom the family used to have all the chats and the conversations in the room when the man's wife was very unwell.  We had the opportunity to build up that relationship.  We all say that the patient is central.  That is correct, but we sometimes forget about the family who are left to carry the bereavement at the end.</p></speech>

I would make two points.  The legal requirements needing to be changed will change with initiatives 1 and 2.  There are some advantages to coming last.  We are the only regulator in the world that registered three levels of professional: EMT paramedics, advanced paramedics and UK-registered paramedics.  Other places do not do that.  We have had the tight regulations and the laws changed.  Practitioners in Ireland must practise at the sharp end.  They need to be working for an organisation approved by us, whether it is private, voluntary or statutory, they need to be registered on our register, and they need to be acting under our guidelines and under the medicines regulation.  That is a triple-lock mechanism that no one else has.  In terms of the sharp end, we are getting there.  Do we have enough?  We want more but we are getting there.  I am very happy with the sharp end.</p><p>  On the nuances, the professional always makes the decision.  I remember when I had just graduated I was told by the hospital that there was a ship at sea and they needed someone to go out to treat a person who had had a heart attack.  We found out that a team of sailors had been resuscitating the person.  It was somebody who was cold.  We did not tell them that what they had done was stupid.  We told them that we thought he had passed.  We did 20 minutes resuscitation and we finished.  If that is done professionally, discretion is used and there is good training, that will happen.  The bigger risk to me is if someone is doing that because they are scared of litigation whereas the employee should be scared of litigation if somebody is 40 years old and healthy and could survive and one has one's people deployed on a cold body.  That is where the litigation would be.</p><p>  That aside, I would not be genuine if I did not say that those are the two biggest issues for me at the sharp end.  We are even setting up a retrieval service and the HSE has asked me to lead on that.  We have a neonatal service that everyone knows brings in sick patients.  Every other country has had these wall to wall for ten to 15 years, but we will be going 24-7 with neonatal and probably before the end of the year.  We also have money to establish these for adults in Cork and Galway, seven days a week daytime, and in Dublin.  We are also setting it up in paediatrics.  Before long, not only are we getting the pre-hospital sharp end, we are getting the in-hospital process.</p><p>  There is too much discussion about response times.  The ones in the law are flawed and meaningless.  The biggest risk to patients currently, and we have only snapshot data, is what happens between hospitals.</p><p>  The second point is that this country's system is logjammed.  If one goes to any hospital in the country - Dublin or elsewhere - one has the wrong patients in the wrong places and they cannot move.  There are people in one hospital who need to be in another because they cannot be looked after in the hospital they are in.  They miss the window.  When they are being transported, they are at greater risk of a bad outcome and dying than those in the community making a 999 call.  That is where I see the risk.  That is in the mix for consideration under the service plan.  It was in the mix last year.  The bid to support it did not get up.<b></b>We are not talking about the sharp end.  We want EMTs with only four to six weeks training.  It is a low level of staff cost and a low level of ambulance cost.  In terms of this year, if it does not come out now, if we do not get them this year, I will be thinking that next year the same thing will happen.  Everybody will be logjammed.  The system will be stuck.  I am very nervous about how it will come out in the process this year, but I will be around every year from here and the issue of providing a sufficient number of ambulances will be constantly to the forefront until it is fixed.</p><p>  We have a legacy where the thinking was that if someone was in a hospital they were safe and that if they were in the community and they ring 999, they were not safe but the opposite is the case.  If someone is in a hospital or between hospitals, in my view they are at greatest risk.  In terms of the system here, I agree with every bit of the reconfiguration of acute services, including the grouping of places and linking those.  Every bit of it is sound, but if the ambulances are not put in to do it, it cannot be unlocked and these people will not end up where they need to be.  If the members visit any hospital - Letterkenny, Monaghan, which I have visited, and down to the Beara Peninsula - everyone will tell them they have somebody who needs to be in another hospital because if he is not, he will not get his pPCI and will instead get open surgery or medication.  They are out of their depth where this person is concerned but the right hospital does not have a bed while there is a person in the right hospital which the original hospital wants back.  It is logjammed.  That will be the case every year until it is fixed.  It would be disingenuous of me if I said otherwise.</p><p>  My priorities and what we are working on are the two issues to which I referred.  They do not need a change in the law.  They just need consensus, we will get there, and the committee members can help.  Until the other issue is resourced, that is it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.652" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Patrick Plunkett" time="11:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013111400016#T01500"><p>I do not know where to start.  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked about pain relief and the key challenges.  Is down to the usual.  It is knowledge, attitudes and skills among staff.  There are small groups of people who have great knowledge and skills and the right attitude, while the vast bulk of people do not have adequate knowledge or skills.  That said, above all there is an attitudinal element which we can address much more effectively, certainly in the emergency departments, that it is the patient's pain.  It is not one's own pain on which one must decide whether one is giving enough or not enough or one must not give any more.  One must interface with the patient who will say when they have enough.  There are problems with complexity of dosing, particularly with patients who are on multiple medications nowadays.  There is always concern for toxicity.</p> <p>People bring up the issue about concern for dependence on such medication, however if it is end-of-life care, dependence is hardly an issue.  We need to get the issues related to pain relief sorted.</p><p> In regard to the reluctance to allow people to die in nursing homes, and my comments on Leas Cross, HIQA and the standards, if we could apply the standards adequately in the nursing homes, then I do not think we would have a problem.  Again it is an attitude and knowledge issue.  It is people running scared.  People are frightened that they will be the people hung out to dry if they let the person, who is known to be dying, die from another issue such as an urinary tract infection.  I think a great deal of work needs to be done to change those attitude.  It needs a lot of support from both clinicians, support groups and HIQA.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout did not realise that the legal basis of "Do not attempt resuscitation", DNAR orders was not clear.  Senator Colm Burke commented on the fear of litigation by litigious relatives.  There are certainly issues in this regard but we must stand on our professionalism.  Dr. Madden came up with this issue, if I am not mistaken, about family versus the competent adult and conflict in instructions.  I have long held the position that if I am unable to communicate adequately with the patient or rather that he or she is unable to communicate adequately with me, my role legally and morally is to advocate on behalf of that patient.  I do not have a role to advocate on behalf of the relatives.  The relatives do not have the decision making capacity in general, virtually in every case they have no decision making capacity for a patient who cannot communicate.  What I do is make it very clear to the relatives that I am interested and need to know what they think the patient's view would be, not their view, and I make it very clear to them that this is not their decision to make on whether to resuscitate, that it is my decision.  I will make that decision and I will relieve them of that burden.  I will not allow conflict to arise between members of the family because otherwise it may.  The level of relief that brings to families is unbelievable because suddenly this burden has been taken away from them.  They know they do not have the knowledge and skills to make those decisions and now they know they do not have the responsibility to make them either.</p><p> I think we must remember that all we are doing in resuscitation - I am coming away slightly from end-of-life care in one sense - is that we are postponing premature death.  Death at the appropriate time should not be postponed any longer.  It is appropriate.  Coming back to Senator Colm Burke's issue about advanced paramedics arriving, two issue arise, one cannot force engagement in a futile resuscitation.  That is immoral at the very least.  The mechanism that the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC has developed in clinical practice guidelines is that we work with machines which can tell us that it is futile to continue resuscitation.  It is not simply an opinion plucked out of the air, it has a sound, solid scientific basis as well as everything else.  It is vitally important that we ensure that control at all times, up to the point where it is no longer possible, remains with the patient.  It is their illness, their life and death.  Our role is as an assistant in that.  We are there to advise and to assist people through their life.  Ultimately we are all going on the same journey and perhaps we will end up in a similar place. </p></speech>

I thank members for that.  It is very evident this morning that a common theme is running through our presentations.  I think it is the recognition that staff are our greatest resource and that we need to invest in them.  There is high expectations of our staff in very challenging and demanding environments.  We really must invest in our staff.   Some of the challenges we are faced with is to try to get staff released for 20 minutes, 30 minutes or one hour in our busy clinical environment.</p><p>  In regard to investing in the training of staff, that is a key priority but we have to look at some of the statistics that came out in the end-of-life audit, where some 56% of staff were distressed or troubled after their experience and exposure of dealing with families and dying patients.  We do very little to support our staff.  That is an issue that needs to be looked at as part of a national bereavement strategy.  Senator Colm Burke referred to death happening in areas where that does not normally happen.  When one is in an acute medical area, where there would be high numbers of deaths every week and sometimes very difficult scenarios, it is very difficult for staff to keep continuing.  That must be acknowledged.  We need to mind our staff because they are our resource and none of this will happen unless we invest in them as well as mind them.  As no specific question was addressed to me, these are my general comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-11-14a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/989" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013111400017#U00300"><p>Thank you Ms Breen.  I  draw the attention of members to the comments by the actor Gabriel Byrne to Simon Carswell in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 November.  Perhaps he was resonating the points made by Professor Plunkett's today.  Telepathy is good.</p><p>  I thank all the witnesses.  Over the past number of weeks we have had six sessions to look at the end-of-life care in Ireland and what can be done to ensure that people of all ages can end his or her life in a way that is dignified.  We have heard from a wide range of experts, including academics, practitioners, policy makers, advocates, service provides and charitable groups.  All who appeared before this committee shared their experience with us and gave us an insight into the reality of death, the humanity in our society and also the inevitable outcome that awaits us all.</p><p>  At the outset of these hearings I made the comment that we have a long tradition of dealing sympathetically and respectfully with end-of-life care and bereavement.  I hope these hearing in the past number of weeks have shown the importance of that caring and respectful approach.  While we have a great deal more to do, it highlights the need for the same approach to be reflected in health policy so that the health services can provide that type of end-of-life care.</p><p>  Both Professors Plunkett and Twomey outlined how people die, that 25% of all deaths occur at home, the focus on hospice care, the issue of long-term residential facilities and acute hospitals.  They underlined the multiplicity of places in which death occurs.  However the issue that does not get noticed in public health policy is that death is a reality for all sectors in the health system, no matter what part.  It is not just confined to one section.  It is important that a comprehensive policy of end-of-life care be developed in which we reflect the totality of the health system and make it workable across all sectors of the health service.</p><p>  One of the key points I learned from our witnesses is that providing quality and respectful end-of-life care is not just about money and resources but about care, consideration and communication, the expression of the human element and taking time to talk to people.  It is very often, as has been borne out strongly today, an issue of a respectful environment for the patient, in which he or she can have conversations, say goodbyes and provide space and support for loved ones and families to grieve in the immediate aftermath of the death.  As a young clerical student who spent five years studying theology I worked with Dr. Twomey in the then Cork regional hospital and now Cork University Hospital.</p> <p>I do not want to be too personal.  While watching him doing his ward rounds when I was a young student, I was always struck by Professor Twomey&rsquo;s generosity of spirit.  Even though he has retired, he is still involved with Marymount University Hospice.  I did not say it at the beginning, so I will say it now.  He left a legacy that stuck with me.  He spoke about patients and families.  I was struck by Dr. King&rsquo;s reference to a body being stiff and cold.  That was the one factor that resonated with me as a porter at the hospital, because the body in question was a person.</p><p> I compliment Professor Twomey on his great work in the hospital.  I learned a great deal in that hospital by watching his humanity and that of his colleagues.  We have heard about the whole-of-staff approach.  It is impressive.</p><p> Our meetings form an important component.  We must deliver a policy based on written submissions and oral hearings.  We will report to the D&aacute;il and the Government on end-of-life care.  We have undertaken a positive body of work.  I thank members for their co-operation, interest and vision in having this as part of our work programme for this calendar year.  I thank all of the witnesses and organisations that generously gave of their time to share with the committee their invaluable experience of and insight into end-of-life care.  If I may single out one person, it would be Ms Angela Edghill for the support she gave Paul, Niamh, Luke and me in co-ordinating these hearings.</p><p> This is just the end of one part of the process.  The committee will discuss and publish its report and, it is hoped, have it discussed in the D&aacute;il, leading to further work.</p></speech>
