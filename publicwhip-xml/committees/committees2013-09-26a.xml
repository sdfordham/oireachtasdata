Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  No.  Correspondence 3A.1, dated 24 September 2013, is from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, providing additional information requested at our meeting of 18 July, to be noted and published.</p><p>  Correspondence 3B.1, dated 10 September 2013, is from Mr. Michael Barrett, Lakeside Marina, County Westmeath, to be noted and a copy forwarded to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for a note on the issues raised.</p><p>  Correspondence 3B.2, dated 11 September 2013, is from Mr. Stephen Mulholland, Ballivor, County Meath, regarding Permanent TSB charges, to be noted.  This is not a matter for the Committee of Public Accounts.  There are appropriate avenues to appeal bank charges and we will inform Mr. Mulholland of this.</p><p>  Correspondence 3B.3, dated 12 September 2013, is from Mr. Daniel O'Mahony regarding evidence previously given to the committee by the Department of Education and Skills regarding the home tuition scheme, to be noted.  The committee has dealt with the issue and Mr. O'Mahony has been advised of the position.</p><p>  Documents relating to today&rsquo;s committee meeting are 3C.1, correspondence received 23 September 2013 from the National Asset Management Agency regarding a briefing paper on matters to be considered at today's meeting, to be noted and published, and 3C.2, correspondence received 25 September 2013, also from NAMA, regarding the opening statement at today's meeting, to be noted and published.</p><p>  I will not read through the list of reports, statements and accounts received since the meeting of 19 September.  If members have any issues arising, I ask them to let the clerk know.  They are all to be noted with the exception of 4.10, NAMA's annual report and financial statement for 2012, which will be examined at today&rsquo;s meeting.</p><p>  The work programme is now on screen.  A meeting has been scheduled with Forf&aacute;s and Ordnance Survey Ireland on 17 October 2013.  We will examine Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s accounts at 10 a.m. followed by Ordnance Survey Ireland&rsquo;s accounts at noon.  We may have a private meeting on Thursday, 24 October to consider our report on bank stabilisation.  A meeting has been scheduled with Bord na gCon on 7 November 2013.  Do members have comments on the work programme?  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report will be published next week and from this we will outline our work programme beyond the dates I have mentioned.</p><p>  Two matters arise under any other business.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been in contact with the committee about sending a delegation to examine the oversight of expenditure in a programme country.  At this early stage we are looking at travelling to Ethiopia, possibly on Thursday, 14 November.  The clerk will be in contact with members on this.</p><p>  The second issue relates to the banking Inquiry.  As members may know, the commencement order for the Act which provides for an Oireachtas inquiry was signed by the Minister yesterday.  Last year the committee did a lot of work on scoping out the issues which should be addressed in any such inquiry, and these are laid down in our report which was published in July 2012.  In this report the committee indicated clearly it is best placed to conduct such an inquiry and this remains the position.  Work on the procedural framework which needs to be put in place before permission to undertake an inquiry can be given is under way, but it will be later this year before it is complete.  We will probably write to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, CPP, referring to our recommendations in the report.</p></speech>

The CPP is drawing up the procedural framework for the inquiry and I believe we should send our report to it.  I do not believe it will consult us.  It will probably set down guidelines.</p></speech>

Has this been established?</p></speech>

This remains the case.  To inform the CPP, we will forward our report, indicate our interest and indicate how we perceive the inquiry can be carried out.  It will then be up to the CPP to decide how to carry it out.</p></speech>

I support the Chairman in his efforts.</p></speech>

The legislation was enacted yesterday and it is up to the CPP to decide.  I understand it will be some time before this happens.</p></speech>

It was enacted yesterday and we have applied to the CPP for compellability.  We had to wait for the Act.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013092600003#B01300"><p>With regard to the committee's work on NAMA, the Committee of Public Accounts is named in the legislation as the committee to which NAMA is responsible.  It is also responsible to the Minister, and much of the Minister's dealings with it will happen behind closed doors, perhaps as they should.  The Committee of Public Accounts is the one body which can publicly hold NAMA to account.</p><p>  The 2012 report will involve a great deal of work for the committee and I wonder whether one session is sufficient or suitable.  Perhaps today will prove it is, but when we consider the amount of work we will have with NAMA, how important our oversight role is and how different it is to the role of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, we might consider giving more time to it in the future.  Over NAMA's ten year span the Committee of Public Accounts will be the only Oireachtas committee with the power and responsibility to hold it to account and ensure it does the job we want it to do for the taxpayer and the State.  We would regret it if, in a number of years, we looked back and saw we had not given it enough attention.  It last came before the committee in June 2012 to discuss a specific report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and its first appearance before the committee was at the end of 2011.  We should try to schedule more regular meetings with NAMA.  It will shortly give the Minister its medium-term report for 2013 and this would be an opportunity to bring NAMA before the committee to discuss the report and not only have meetings on the production of an annual report because it contains so much.  I do not know to what extent we will be able to discuss the IBRC issue today, given it is not included in the 2012 annual report, but it is a significant issue for NAMA.  We could spend five hours discussing 2012 and not speak about the IBRC.  This would be a mistake and we will see how it goes.</p> <p>During particular sessions, the committee has sat for a long time.  It is not fair to witnesses or committee staff to sit for five or six hours.  We should be aware of that when planning meetings with NAMA.  Perhaps we should break a meeting into two sessions on the same day or over two days if we are to ensure we do the job as thoroughly as we want.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013092600004#C00200"><p>That is a fair point.  Be it NAMA or any other body that appears before us, I will be guided by members if they believe that additional time or meetings - or even a full day meeting - are required.  I take the Deputy's point on the number of hours that we sit with witnesses.  If he believes that a further session is necessary after today's session - he is right that there is a great deal of detail concerning IBRC, NAMA and so on - I will accommodate a further meeting.  I am sure NAMA will respond positively.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1034" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013092600004#C00300"><p>Can we not wait for NAMA's annual report every year to call on it?  We could call on it twice per year and still have a great deal of important work to do.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013092600004#C00400"><p>The Deputy stated that NAMA was finalising a report for the Minister.</p></speech>

It relates to medium-term progress in 2013.  It will be mentioned in the opening statement.</p></speech>

The areas covered by NAMA are so extensive that we will need a great deal of time.  It is a much bulkier area than many of the others we address.  Given the fact it is of considerable interest to the public and the State, we should focus on it more strongly.</p></speech>

The potential impact of the IBRC resolution is forming a central part of that planning.  We are already discussing the issues with NAMA.  That has been going on since the middle of this year when the previous audit finished.</p></speech>

The issues will be dealt with in those.  I might also point out that, under the National Asset Management Agency Act, I am carrying out an assessment of the extent to which NAMA has made progress in achieving its overall objectives.  I will have an additional report on that matter.</p><p>  When NAMA appeared before the committee last year, Deputy Sean Fleming made the point that the timing was perhaps not ideal in that the annual report had not yet been presented.  NAMA produces quarterly reports, which are not complete reports.  If the committee has two meetings, the timing and the amount of information that members will have available might dictate whether one will be in late July or possibly early September, as we are doing to examine the annual report, and the other will be at the half-year report.</p></speech>

A key objective for NAMA in its management and ultimate disposal of the assets is to maximise the return to the State.</p><p>  The process of transfer of the targeted loan assets to NAMA was completed in 2011.  The acquisition values for the loans were finalised in 2012.  NAMA has paid a total consideration of &euro;31.8 billion for the loans acquired.  This was 43% of the gross amount of &euro;74 billion owed to the financial institutions by the related debtors.  That debtor liability transferred in full to NAMA.</p><p>  To facilitate effective management of the individual loans, NAMA has grouped them on a debtor connection basis.  Each portfolio of loans is managed collectively.  NAMA undertook a comprehensive business plan process whereby each debtor connection was required to submit a business plan for the connected portfolio of loans, setting out proposed debt repayment strategies.</p><p>  NAMA concluded its assessment of the individual debtor business plans in 2012.  Arising from this process, it has adopted a management strategy in respect of each of its debtors.  At the end of 2012, NAMA had agreed a support or disposal strategy in 76% of cases.  In the remaining 24% of cases, an enforcement strategy was determined as the optimum approach.</p> <p>The financial statements for 2012 received a clear audit report, which issued on 2 May 2013.  Without qualifying my audit opinion, I have drawn attention to Note 2.1 in the financial statements.  This describes NAMA's main funding source, which is in the form of short term borrowing with a Government guarantee.  The note explains the basis on which the board is satisfied that it was appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern<i></i>basis.  Some of the key financial highlights for 2012 are: NAMA generated a profit, after impairment, of &euro;228 million; interest on loans recognised in the year amounted to &euro;1.2 billion; just under &euro;3 billion was raised in 2012 from the sale of underlying collateral and loan assets; the 2012 impairment charge of &euro;518 million on loans and receivables reflects a net deterioration over the year in NAMA's projected cashflows from its loan assets - the total accumulated impairment charge to end 2012 was &euro;3.3 billion; the carrying value of loans and receivables at end 2012 was &euro;26 billion before impairment; by end 2012, NAMA had redeemed &euro;4.75 billion of its initial borrowing.</p><p> Two special reports on NAMA have been published by my office to date.  The first report, published in October 2010, reviewed the asset acquisition process and the governance and procurement structures put in place.  The second report, published in May 2012, reviewed the loan acquisitions to date and the profile of the collateral underlying the loans acquired.  It also looked at how NAMA manages its relationships with borrowers and at the results of its initial debt management activities.  It found that a major challenge faced by NAMA was to ensure that remittances by debtors out of their rental income were based on up-to-date control listings.</p><p> Under section 226 of the NAMA Act, I am required to carry out an assessment of the extent to which NAMA has made progress in achieving its overall objectives.  The analysis to underpin the report has been substantially completed and the report is now being drafted.  I expect that the report will be finalised in the coming months.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013092600005#D00300"><p>NAMA's appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts today arises from the publication some months ago of its results for 2012.  For the second year in succession, NAMA is in a position to report profits after impairment despite the difficult market conditions that prevailed in Ireland in 2012.  Before discussing our 2012 results in greater detail, I would like to make a few general comments about the mandate which members, as legislators, gave NAMA and the progress we have made in fulfilling it.</p><p>  Approximately four years ago, the Oireachtas enacted the legislation which established NAMA.  Crucially and commendably, section 10 of the NAMA Act outlines the primary objective set by the Legislature for NAMA, namely, to achieve the best financial return<b><i></i></b>for the State from the assets entrusted to it.  That statutory clarity has been very important in guiding us over the past four years, particularly when faced with a broad range of public views as to what NAMA should be doing.</p><p>  At the time of its establishment, it was widely accepted that NAMA could not expect to fulfil its commercial objective quickly given the scale of its loan acquisition of over &euro;70 billion and the distressed state of the Irish property market.  There was an acceptance that the taxpayers' best interest would be served, in the words of the Act, &quot;by protecting or otherwise enhancing the value&quot; of the acquired assets.  This is what we have sought to do.  We adopted two key principles: no fire sales and no hoarding.  The board's Business Plan of July 2010 refers to a &quot;phased and orderly&quot; disposal of assets.  A NAMA fire sale in the Irish market over the past three years would have caused serious disruption and would have had the effect of crystallising a major loss for taxpayers, on top of the losses that they have had to fund in recapitalising the various financial institutions.  Instead, our approach has been to release assets for sale in the Irish market in a manner which takes account of the market's capacity to absorb them.  It should be borne in mind that even in 2006, at the peak of activity, there was only &euro;3 billion of investment activity in the Irish market and fewer than 100 transactions.  </p><p>  Within our overall approach, we are pragmatic.  Every asset supporting our loans is ultimately for sale and we are always open to reasonable offers.  The reality is that there is limited demand for some segments of our portfolio in current Irish market conditions.  Our approach to assets which are not currently for sale is to protect and enhance them, through asset management, so as to maximise their ultimate sale value when market conditions improve.  This means ensuring that rental income from assets is maximised and that it is applied towards meeting debtor liabilities to NAMA.</p><p>  Our phased asset disposal approach not only makes commercial sense but is also in line with the rationale underlying the EU Commission's approval for the NAMA scheme in 2010.  The Commission took the view that State aid under the NAMA scheme was permissible if the State had a reasonable prospect, over a medium to long term horizon, of recovering NAMA's outlay on the acquired loans.  The Commission approved the payment of an acquisition price corresponding to the long-term economic value of the loans.  It did so on the basis that NAMA would be in a position to recover this over an expected ten-year life span as market conditions normalised and the Irish economy recovered.  It was well acknowledged that the recovery of a very distressed Irish market in a distressed global economy would only be gradual.</p><p>  When EUROSTAT determined in 2009 that NAMA debt would not be treated as part of the general Government debt, it did so on the basis that NAMA was established for the sole purpose of addressing the financial crisis, that it had a finite life span and that it was not expected to make material losses.  This fits well with NAMA's key objective which is to ensure that the Irish taxpayer will not be faced an additional financial burden after we have completed our work.  For all of these reasons, we do not view our mandate as being the management of a massive fire sale which would have the effect of imposing a greater financial burden on the State.  We have instead adopted a phased and orderly approach in dealing with the disposal of our Irish assets, with a view to recovering what we believe to be their intrinsic value.  By contrast, we have been very active in the British market in terms of asset sales because of the level of demand for those assets, the depth of the market relative to our asset holdings and the strong price performance of London and the south east over recent years.</p><p>  One of the principal measures of our progress is the repayment of NAMA senior debt.  We issued just over &euro;30 billion in Government-guaranteed senior debt to the financial institutions from which we acquired the loans in 2010 and 2011.  We will redeem &euro;750 million next week, thereby bringing the cumulative redemption to date to &euro;7 billion.  We expect to reach our target of &euro;7.5 billion, 25% of senior debt, by the end of this year.  We further expect that another 25% of senior debt will be redeemed by the end of 2016. This will leave &euro;15 billion of NAMA's senior debt to be redeemed after 2016.  Our current view is that we will be in a position to redeem all of our senior debt by 2020 and thus eliminate the State's contingent liability.</p><p>  To meet our debt redemption targets, cash is key for NAMA.  As of last Friday, we had generated &euro;13.7 billion in cash, including &euro;9.2 billion in disposal receipts,<i></i>from property and loan sales and &euro;4.5 billion in other income,<i></i>mainly rental income from assets controlled by our debtors and receivers.  We have secured over &euro;800 million in additional security for debtors' loans by taking charges over previously unencumbered assets and by reversing asset transfers.  Much of the cash generated has been applied towards repaying NAMA'S senior debt.  As I mentioned, &euro;7.5 billion is scheduled for redemption by the end of this year.  We also need to have sufficient cash reserves available to cover our costs, including debt interest and loan servicing fees to the banks.  We also need cash to invest over the next three years in various commercial and residential projects which, when completed, are expected to yield a strong return for the taxpayer.  By the end of August this year, we had approved funding of &euro;2 billion across our entire portfolio, &euro;900 million of which relates to Ireland.  It is important to note that NAMA is self-funding and does not cost the Exchequer anything and, therefore, is not a burden for the Government in the context of its annual budgetary arithmetic.</p><p>  Having emphasised earlier that we are not engaged in a fire sale, it is important to draw attention to the many ways in which we are stimulating transactions in the Irish market.  By approving asset sales by debtors and receivers, we are releasing a substantial flow of properties into the market.  Our debtors and receivers have sold over 2,000 individual properties in Ireland to date and currently have &euro;1.5 billion worth of Irish residential and commercial property on the market.  This will increase by a further &euro;350 million to &euro;400 million over the coming weeks as we will be bringing two portfolios, mainly high quality offices and residential, to the market.  These portfolios will be attractive to the large institutional buyers in the markets, including the promoters of recently-established and proposed new REITs.  We have indicated that we are willing to lend &euro;2 billion in vendor finance to support transactions involving commercial property and loans.  We have already advanced &euro;375 million of this in five transactions and there are a number of other transactions in the pipeline.  We are also working closely with the IDA to facilitate the provision of accommodation for large businesses which have plans to create jobs in Ireland.  These include Novartis which has entered into a letting transaction for a number of office blocks at Elm Park in Dublin.  Other significant transactions include the purchase by Scottish and Southern Energy of its new corporate headquarters at Leopardstown and the investment of over &euro;100 million by the Kerry Group in a new facility at Millennium Park in Naas.  We hold security over a large number of properties and lands in the Docklands area of Dublin.  The decision by Dublin City Council to establish a Strategic Development Zone, SDZ, in the area is a very positive move.</p> <p>There would appear to be a good fit between NAMA properties in the docklands area and the need to accommodate the continued expansion of the financial services and technology sectors.  There are, however, various planning and infrastructural obstacles to be overcome and we continue to engage extensively with Dublin City Council with a view to promoting ideas which will hopefully resolve these issues.</p><p> There are numerous other similar examples of development initiatives to which we are advancing funds and development capital.  These include The Square shopping centre in Tallaght, the Beacon South Quarter in Sandyford, the Charlestown shopping centre in Finglas, as well as Scotch Hall in Drogheda and developments in Cork, Kildare and Galway.  There are other initiatives where we are at an advanced stage of evaluation of their commercial viability.</p><p> One area of our activity which attracts regular comment is social housing.  Relative to the number of applicants on housing lists, which was estimated by the housing authorities to be close to 100,000 in 2011, NAMA debtors and receivers did not have a large stock of housing units available for sale or lease, but we moved quickly to identify those which might be suitable and we have been very active since in expediting delivery to the extent that it is within our control.  To date, we have offered 4,350 units to the local authorities, with approximately 2,150 of these either deemed to be unsuitable or no longer available by the time the authorities had assessed their suitability.  Another 300 are still being assessed, which leaves approximately 1,900 which have been deemed suitable by the local authorities.  Over 400 of these have been delivered or contracted to date, with at least another 200 by year-end; for the other 1,300, we are awaiting the final go-ahead to acquire them on the assumption that they will be deemed suitable by the housing agency or local authority concerned.</p><p> Let me emphasise that all we can do is to identify the units, offer them to the local authorities and housing bodies and then await their formal agreement to contract.  The pace at which units are delivered to the people who need them is largely beyond our control.  In some cases, certain works are needed to finish the units and we have provided funding of &euro;10 million to enable at least 600 housing units to be delivered by the end of this year.  Often, there are issues with certification, performance bonds and levies and compliance with legislation such as the Multi-Unit Developments Act.  It is untrue to suggest that NAMA is responsible for the slow pace of delivery to date and I will confine myself to the suggestion that the earlier everyone engages, the sooner progress will be made on this important issue.</p><p> With market activity in Ireland, there has been a lot of positive development this year.  The residential market in certain urban areas appears to be stabilising and commercial prices are improving, with the volume of investment transactions already well up on last year.  It is estimated that close to &euro;1 billion of transactions have been completed by the end of August, which is almost twice the level achieved in the whole of 2012.  The nature of investor interest has also changed and we are seeing fewer investors with overly ambitious return expectations and short payback horizons.  We are seeing instead more interest from long-term players, such as pension funds and real estate investment trusts, which tend to focus more on the long-term income generated by assets than on the prospect of near-term price appreciation.  This is a welcome sign of a market easing back towards normalisation.  However, I would caution that the resurgence evident in the Irish market is not yet broadly based or homogenous.  Investors are mainly interested in prime Dublin office space and income-yielding apartment blocks.  There are only a limited number of such assets available in the NAMA portfolio or anywhere else for that matter.  As the supply of available prime assets reduces relative to demand and as economic recovery gathers pace, we can expect investor interest to diversify both geographically away from Dublin and also into a broader range of asset classes as investors seek yield in a low interest rate environment.</p><p> I will turn now to our results in 2012.  I am pleased to report that we recorded an operating profit, before impairment, of &euro;826 million in 2012.  The main positive contributors to this profitability were interest and fee income of close to &euro;1.4 billion and a net profit on loan and property disposals of &euro;188 million.  On the costs side, we incurred interest expense of close to &euro;500 million on our debt, with administration costs of &euro;119 million including two major elements of fees of &euro;56 million paid to the banks to carry out loan servicing and &euro;37 million in costs, mainly staff costs, reimbursed to the NTMA.  I should point out that our costs are low by comparison with similar entities internationally.  One indicator commonly used for asset resolution entities such as NAMA is the ratio of operating costs to cash generated, and for NAMA in 2012, this was 2.6%.  Internationally, the ratio for similar entities has typically averaged 6% and in some cases has been as high as 12%.  By comparison with our peers, therefore, we run an efficient operation and that is indeed appropriate given that we ultimately work to a mandate from the taxpayer.</p><p> Our profit for 2012 after tax and impairment was &euro;228 million, reflecting an impairment charge of &euro;518 million.  This brought our cumulative impairment provision to &euro;3.3 billion by the end of 2012.  I wish that I could report that there will be no further impairment but, unfortunately, in a portfolio as diverse in asset class and geographically as NAMA's, that is not the case.  Over the coming days, we will be submitting to the Minister for Finance our results for the first half of 2013 and, while I cannot disclose the specifics now, I am happy to report NAMA made a profit in the first half of this year.</p><p> In terms of assessing impairment, we go through a rigorous review which tests the robustness of the cash flows that we expect our portfolio to generate all the way to 2020.  We look at expected disposal proceeds and the income projections for assets and we ask hard questions about whether they remain realistic.  These disposal projections evolve over time, as harder market information comes to light about particular assets or market segments.  Our impairment process involves taking a detailed look at cash projections for about 85% of our loan portfolio and making an assessment for the entire duration of the loan, which is to 2020 in many instances.  This contrasts with the approach that we understand is typically adopted by banks internationally, which involves a detailed review of approximately 25% of the projected loan cash flows.  We also take a very conservative approach to recognising projected gains and losses, as losses are recognised immediately whereas gains are not recognised until they are realised in cash.</p><p> As members know, the Government decided earlier this year to appoint special liquidators to IBRC with a mandate to arrange for the valuation and sale of the IBRC loan portfolio.  As part of that decision, NAMA has been asked to acquire any loans not sold by the special liquidators, and this acquisition is likely to happen late this year or early in 2014.  Our working assumption is that we will acquire a substantial proportion of the IBRC loans and we are making our preparations on that basis.  We have, as yet, limited visibility on what we may acquire and, for that reason, it would be unwise of me to speculate too much on the strategies we might adopt or the time horizon over which we might expect to manage out the portfolio.</p><p> What is abundantly clear at this stage is that this new portfolio will present a major challenge for NAMA.  Potentially, we could be acquiring a portfolio of commercial loans with par balances totalling &euro;20 billion.  Operationally, it is likely that we will manage the larger debtor connections directly, as we do with the existing portfolio.  The smaller IBRC debtors - of which there could be up to 2,400 - will be managed on a day-to-day basis by a service provider acting under delegated authority from us.  To put this into context, we currently deal, either directly or through the participating institutions, with approximately 800 debtors.  If the bulk of the IBRC portfolio transfers to us, the number of commercial debtors being managed by NAMA, directly or indirectly, could increase from 800 to over 3,000.  That does not include over 13,000 mortgage holders whose loans - aggregating to par debt of &euro;1.8 billion - may also transfer to us if the residential portfolio is not sold by the liquidators.</p><p> We expect we will need to recruit between 180 and 220 additional staff directly in NAMA to provide a range of services relating to the new IBRC portfolio if we end up acquiring the bulk of it.  Such recruitment would be challenging enough at the best of times but faced with public pay restrictions, it becomes much more so.  Already this year, NAMA has lost 28 members of staff, over 10% of our headcount, on top of the 22 staff that left in 2012.  With each departure, there is a loss also of business knowledge, continuity and of momentum.  In all probability, the exodus will continue as the market improves and the high quality people in NAMA are targeted by entities such as banks, property firms and private equity funds.</p><p> I very much understand the rationale for the reductions in public sector pay and the need to ensure that no sector is left unaffected by the burden of adjustment.  Moreover, a certain level of staff turnover is to be expected as the property market recovers and this is particularly so in an agency with a finite lifespan.  Nevertheless, the reality is that NAMA is still continuing to expand due to the liquidation of IBRC and the portfolio under our management may well increase by up to 50% over the coming months, potentially by approximately &euro;12 billion.  NAMA is also a commercial organisation which must operate on behalf of the taxpayer in the international arena.  Against that background, it faces potentially serious consequences arising from the scale of staff turnover and the quality and experience of the departing staff.</p><p> Four years ago, the Legislature set NAMA a challenging commercial mandate.  I hope members consider that we addressed our mandate with vigour, realism and commercial dexterity.  The various milestones reached to date in terms of cash generation and debt repayment could not have been achieved without the very able staff we were fortunate to recruit.  Our difficulty now is that we are losing many able and talented people and we are facing an uphill battle in retaining others.  Replacing specialist staff is difficult and we cannot press-gang property, banking and other specialists into joining NAMA or force them to stay if better opportunities arise elsewhere.</p><p> NAMA is an enormous undertaking for the State and we have proved that we can deliver on our commercial mandate in what has been a very tough economic environment, both domestically and globally.  The commitment and resolve of the board and staff to contribute to a resolution of Ireland's difficulties is beyond doubt and I must pay tribute to them.  I assure the committee that we will continue to do our very best for the citizens of the State.</p> <p>I have addressed some of the key issues relating to NAMA as I see them at this stage of our evolution.  The chairman, Frank Daly, and I are happy to discuss any issues the committee wishes to raise with us.</p></speech>

NAMA will hit the first repayment target this year of 25% of the loan repayments.  That is estimated at &euro;7.5 billion.  That was estimated at &euro;8.1 billion in the original repayment schedule.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Back in 2010 everybody was predicting that by 2012 and 2013, based on official figures from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, the economy would be growing at 2.5% to 3%.  That has not happened, so the board must take account of market conditions.</p></speech>

We just go with official forecasts and we adopt the strategic plan in the context of what the economy is doing.  This time last year, I would not have been very confident about the Irish market in terms of how quickly it could recover.  However, we have seen the amount of transactions that have taken place in the first eight months of this year and the build up in 2012 over 2011.  That has certainly been very welcome in terms of activity and interest in the Irish market as the Irish recovery story occurs and, in fairness, due to the job that has been done by everybody, including the Government in sticking to its fiscal targets.</p></speech>

Until they met those targets, they would be constrained in lending.  That is the reality.  They both met their deleveraging targets.  Bank of Ireland met it earlier this year and it was announced earlier this week that AIB had met its deleveraging target.  As we move forward one will see them probably becoming more active lenders into the market.  Also, the big difference between early last year and now is that more international players are prepared to bring either real money into the country or to lend it.  International banks are prepared to lend into the Irish market to fund people to buy property.  That was not the case early last year.</p></speech>

However, I am basing it on what is happening at present and the continued interest in the Irish property market.  As I said, the market is not homogenous.  We are fortunate with the NAMA portfolio in that 93% of it is in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Of that 93%, 67% is in Dublin, 10% is in the commuter belt, 10% is in Cork, 4% is in Galway and 2% is in Limerick.  Our assets are in those major cities.  Only 7% of our assets in Ireland are outside them, which amounts to approximately &euro;850 million.  That &euro;850 million is quite small in the context of our current loan book.  If that takes much longer to recover, it will not hold back NAMA in meeting its potential.  We have been very fortunate, unlike other asset management companies in other countries, that from the start 44% of our portfolio was outside of Ireland.  It allowed us to generate a great deal of activity to give us a chance to hold back on the Irish market and let that market recover.</p></speech>

We have taken substantial impairments.  The majority of the impairment figure to 1 December of &euro;3.3 billion that the board has recognised to date and which has been signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General as being appropriate has been against Irish assets.</p></speech>

The impairment exercise is as much a mathematical exercise as anything.  One puts all of the cashflows in and discounts them back using - I do not want to get technical - what the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, call an "effective interest rate".  The effective interest rate for a NAMA portfolio is, on average, about 5%.  One accrues income and discounts it back.  One also accrues an income on assets which are not income generating, like land, and 5% is discounted back.  Depending on when one is going to put it up for sale, and purely as a mathematical exercise, if one is going to put it up for sale in 2013 or 2016, that would have an effect on what the impairment figure is going to be and the discounted value versus carrying value.  That is how one calculates one's impairments.</p></speech>

In 2009, there was only &euro;97 million worth of activity in the Irish property market.  In 2010, it was about &euro;200 million.  In 2011, it was something similar.  In 2012, it was about &euro;550 million.  Already this year, the Irish commercial property market is worth in excess of &euro;1 billion.</p><p>  As I said in my speech, we sell into the market on the basis of what the market can absorb.  If one is going to put more onto the market than it can absorb then, in effect, one is going to give away the portfolio for nothing.  That is not NAMA's objective or its commercial or statutory remit.  It is to have an orderly and phased disposal of the assets and to sell them at prices that are realistic and captures their intrinsic value.</p></speech>

To get the 15% figure by 2016, NAMA will be getting rid of most of the overseas assets.</p></speech>

If one looks at where NAMA's overseas assets remain, about &euro;7 billion of the &euro;9 billion in overseas assets are in the UK, primarily in London and the south east, and about &euro;2 billion of the overseas assets are in three other locations by value: Germany, France and the US.  They are places where there is liquidity and activity so one can get those assets sold.  It has been very deliberate on the part of the board of NAMA strategy to say that we will sell the overseas assets, asset manage the Irish assets, take the income earned on the Irish assets and sell them at the appropriate time.</p><p>  If one thinks about it in terms of this, and this is really just common sense, if one has income-producing Irish assets that are giving an income of 8% to 9% per annum, and that was up until the start of this year, and now the yield from those assets has contracted and is coming down more towards 7%, which means that the price of the assets has risen, one is better off to take the income, wait for the yields to contract and sell them at a realistic level.  That is what this is about.</p></speech>

That is where the blend will come from in the next 25%.  It is the market itself improving, investor interest increasing, but it is also the wherewithal we have, coming largely from the UK, to invest in our Irish assets, so that by the time the assets come for sale, they will be much more valuable.  All of that will contribute to the 25%.  As the CEO has mentioned, the location of our assets in Ireland is very important.</p></speech>

If we have achieved 50% of our bond repayments on NAMA through the bulk being overseas sales, and that at an increase above the value at which we purchased them, which is good, but then relying almost wholly on the Irish market over a two year period to realise 30% on NAMA bonds, and I understand the point on rental income, do we really think that the income being generated from those assets will be sufficient over a two year period, combined with the recovery in those asset prices in that period?  We are talking about a significant jump, despite what investments might be made.</p></speech>

In saying today that we are confident that we will repay all our senior debt by 2020, we have done that on the basis of a very detailed look at projections right out to 2020 in respect of every one of our NAMA managed debtors.  It is not a theoretical exercise or anything like that.  It is a very hard look at cashflows, sales projections and the timing of those right out to 2020.</p></speech>

The majority of it has come from debtors who are working with us.</p></speech>

By value, it is well over 70%.  By number, it is probably now down to about 55%.  In terms of the way that we manage the portfolio, NAMA has 800 debtors, the top 190 of whom are managed directly by NAMA, and the other 600 of whom are managed by the participating institutions, if one assumes that the IBRC was still in place.  We are now finding that a lot of those smaller debtors, because they effectively got involved in the speculative buying of land and were not really developers, are consenting to receivership.  They no longer want to deal with the assets because the land is never going to be developed, and things like that.  One is finding is that a lot with the smaller sized debtors.  That is why there has been a decline in number, but if one looks by value, over 70% by value are working consensually with NAMA, which are mainly the NAMA-managed ones.</p></speech>

It will be a harder task for the agency because these people are not willing to comply or work with NAMA.</p></speech>

There are over 12,000 loans and 55,000 individual saleable property units in the portfolio.  That is what we inherited.  Over time, we are looking over the 55,000 units and trying to identify the ones that are better to sell now, if there is an opportunity to sell as part of the whole business plan process, and the ones that are better to manage as assets.  Maybe there is an opportunity to put some capital in to build on a site that has planning permission and sell the complete product.  This is a complex business.  We are not just looking at one debtor and deciding to work with that debtor until the end; we have 800 debtors to look at every single day to try to figure out how to meet our cash flow targets every year.</p><p>  I appear before the troika every quarter and every time the troika tells me that it wants me to repay the NAMA bonds as quickly as possible and sell the portfolio as quickly as possible.  We must reply to the troika, as we do to members, that this must be done in an orderly and phased way to realise the maximum value of the portfolio so that the taxpayer is not faced with another hole.  If we do not generate enough cash to get rid of the contingent liability of the State, the Government has guaranteed NAMA bonds and must make up the difference.  Our job is to make sure the contingent liability is not realised.  As the chairman said, and as I said, we rigorously look at cash flow, the value of the assets and the market segments at points in time.  It is not static and things change from month to month.  Overall, we are very confident that by 2020 we will have realised enough cash to pay off the senior debt on the portfolio.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy is correct in that I expect there will be a rump of assets left at the end of NAMA's work in 2020.  They may not be sold by that date but we think we will have generated enough rental income on the assets to make up for the rump of assets left.  The rump of assets that may be left is potentially the &euro;900 million worth of assets outside the main urban centres in Ireland.  It is not a big problem.</p></speech>

NAMA does not have to continue to exist.  If it is only land, the Government has other mechanisms to give it to local authorities or to the OPW.  Our objective is to sell down everything but NAMA is a complex infrastructure and we will not need it forever, as the Minister said last week.</p></speech>

A very good report was produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General in terms of the acquisition and its key point, which not everyone is aware of, is that while the banks got the long-term economic value, the value we paid the banks for the loans was equal to the current market value of the properties in 2009.  We took the value of the property in 2009, added the long-term economic value based on a European formula and then put it into a cash flow model and discounted it.  By discounting over a number of years, we eliminated the long-term economic value.  This is detailed in our 2011 annual report as well as in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It means that the value the banks received was equal to the current market value of the property as of 30 November 2009.</p></speech>

However, the legislation does not exactly say that.  The legislation is open to interpretation as to what exactly NAMA is meant to pursue above and beyond the value of the assets as it acquired them in 2009.  Looking back to Mr. Brian Lenihan, he said that the amount the borrower owes will not change because of the transfer of the loan from the bank to NAMA.  However, as we have heard on previous occasions when Mr. McDonagh has appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, that view has changed in NAMA and Mr. McDonagh is looking to realise the assets as best he can over a ten-year period.  This will become more important as debtors begin to work out Irish property in the market.  A debtor who works with NAMA, makes the repayments and recovers the cost of the assets as they were purchased by NAMA in 2009, will be let off after a period of two years.  The statement made by Mr. Brian Lenihan when the legislation was originally enacted is no longer the position.  We have seen a bit of creep.</p></speech>

I would love to be able to say that the value of the underlying assets was &euro;74 billion.  The value was &euro;32 billion when we bought them.  What we are trying to realise is the &euro;32 billion.  We are pursuing each and every debtor for the maximum amount of money he or she can repay, either through selling the underlying assets, going after the debtor for unencumbered assets or reversing asset transfers.</p> <p>In my statement earlier I said that, to date, we have taken &euro;800 million from debtors which they had as unencumbered assets or had transferred to third parties.  We forced them to give back those assets.  We are doing asset searches on people and are asking them for sworn statements of affairs.  We check that their statements of affairs are correct.  I assure the Deputy that if debtors have more assets than they have declared to us, we will pursue them.  While I do not want to refer to any specific case, NAMA is in the courts quite often pursuing people where we believe they may have assets other than those they have declared to us.</p></speech>

I am not referring to any specific court case.  I am referring to debtors who are working with the agency, doing their best to help NAMA realise the value of the loans when they were purchased in 2009.  Some may do that and receive a salary, which is fair enough if they are the best people to manage the portfolio.  They might also realise a profit if they bring back more than what the agency paid in 2009.  Then, after a two-year period, they are off the hook.</p></speech>

One could take the view that we should get rid of every single debtor, appoint a slew of receivers and get them to manage the assets but we do not believe that is the best way to work.  Sometimes we have to cough hard and accept that the best approach is to work with debtors on a consensual basis and help them to realise the maximum value of the assets.  We must make sure they have given up all of their personal assets and then, in return for working with us over a period of time, we may enter into a commercial deal with them to the effect that once all of the assets are sold and there is nothing left, the difference is written off.  The reality is that this is not inconsistent with the personal insolvency legislation under which a debtor can declare bankruptcy, which some of our debtors have done, and effectively all one is left with then is the charge over the assets and there is no further recourse to the individual concerned.  Of course, there are also debtors in our portfolio who have borrowed through special purpose vehicles and therefore we have no personal recourse.  All we have is recourse to their assets.</p></speech>

The option is always there for people who have completely over-borrowed to seek bankruptcy in Ireland or, as in the case of many of the major debtors here, in Britain or elsewhere.  In some other jurisdictions, one can be out of the bankruptcy process after one year.</p></speech>

A lot of these people got caught up in the whole thing.  They borrowed huge amounts of money.  They accept they made a huge error, got caught in an asset bubble, over-borrowed and over-paid for assets.  They basically want to find a resolution because a lot of them would have families and children.  They want to make a contribution towards the recovery of the Irish economy by getting the most back for NAMA.  That said, it must be a commercial arrangement because we are a commercial business.  This is not a business which has a huge amount of empathy for people, to be honest.  We have to look at this from a commercial perspective and work out what will generate the best return for the taxpayer.  We want to get rid of the contingent liability hanging over the taxpayer at present.</p></speech>

To pick up on his final point, the contrast between the situation for those operating under the personal insolvency regime and those working on a commercial basis with NAMA is that under the former regime, there are very strict limits on what people can spend and the lifestyle they can lead is very tight, whereas in the case of three people working with NAMA, they are earning over &euro;200,000 a year.  To compare the NAMA system with the personal insolvency regime and say they are similar is pushing it, in my view.</p><p>  I wish to ask about the issue of NAMA staff, which has come up in the press quite frequently lately.  Mr. McDonagh mentioned the fact that NAMA lost a lot of staff this year and last year.  I was going to ask how many staff were lost in 2013, but Mr. McDonagh gave us the figure for two years.  A total of 50 staff have been lost, which equates to one quarter of the staff.  How is NAMA coping with the loss of talent every year and is it impacting on business operations?</p></speech>

We recruited a lot of these people in 2010 and 2011 when the banks and property firms were letting a lot of people go.  As the economy improves, obviously opportunities arise for these people.  We are doing our best to retain people and to recruit people to fill the gaps.  One of the things we are doing now is promoting those we recruited initially at a junior level who now have one or two year's experience to fill the positions of those who leave.  It is not easy but we must accept the environment we are in.  We are doing our best to manage it.  In reality, if someone is very good and is highly skilled, he or she will have opportunities elsewhere.  People are people and if they are in their mid-30s, with a family and a mortgage, they know that the lifespan of NAMA is finite, ending in 2020.  If they get a job offer from somewhere that will see them working beyond 2020, then they will accept that offer to give themselves longer-term security.</p></speech>

The Irish banking market is shrinking.  People in AIB are being given voluntary redundancy, as are staff in Bank of Ireland.  There does not seem to be very many job opportunities in the Irish banking sector.  Are NAMA employees going abroad?</p></speech>

Some of the main banks here are gearing up to deal with distressed mortgages and other items on their loan books and people who have worked in NAMA, having spent three years managing debtors and dealing with distressed assets, are being targeted.  There are also a number of international property and private equity firms coming into Ireland with the intention of buying assets and they are also recruiting people.  Some people have moved to London too.  A number of those would have come over from the UK when we recruited them and have now moved back to London.  There are also some Irish people who have chosen to move to London.  One of my senior financial staff has just been offered a job in Washington with the IMF.  That goes to show how far our staff can travel.</p></speech>

There is a perceived conflict of interest in people leaving an organisation which manages one of the largest property portfolios in the world to go to work for private companies with which they may have had dealings in the past.  What is Mr. McDonagh's view on that?  It seems to me that the people who are working for NAMA have a huge amount of knowledge.  As Mr. Daly said, NAMA has prepared, until 2020, an analysis of how its portfolio will be disposed of, how it expects its cash flows to pan out and how each of the 800 debtors will be dealt with.</p> <p>It has built a base case in that respect.  Senior people in the organisation have a very good knowledge of how NAMA will operate until it closes in 2020.  Therefore, they have a large level of knowledge of the future development of the Irish property market.  When they leave to work with people who are investing in the Irish property market, is there a conflict of interest?  Are they being hired because they are working for NAMA and have insider information?</p></speech>

They might not have had the same level of knowledge when they were recruited.  We have strategies for dealing with our 800 debtors until the time comes when all of them are ultimately realised.  Very few people have access to information with a high level of detail.  Having said that, people who are employed by the NTMA and assigned to NAMA are obliged to comply with the Official Secrets Acts.  Their obligations under section 202 are of lifelong application - they are not confined to the duration of one's work with NAMA.</p><p>  There are two aspects to the answer I will give to Deputy Nolan's question, which I was also asked at the launch of our annual report.  The best way of ensuring no one can steal a march on anybody else is to ensure all the assets are openly marketed, in so far as practicable.  If a particular legal issue arose, that would probably be the only exception.  This approach means that everybody has the same access to the same information.  When the Minister was asked the same question at the launch of our annual report at the end of May, he said he encourages the movement of people between the public and private sectors because it generates new ideas in the public sector.  He also said it promotes a better understanding of the public sector on the part of the private sector.  The reality is that people who work in NAMA have to give three months' notice when they resign.  We have the option of putting them on gardening leave for that period.  The reality is that we cannot stop someone from making a living.  If we think somebody is using information inappropriately, there are mechanisms to deal with that under the present legislation.</p></speech>

The NTMA, which is the employer, recently reviewed employment contracts.  After taking legal advice, it decided to extend that period to six months in the cases of new people and people who are being promoted into senior positions.  There is a certain period of time for which one can restrain people in this way.  If one puts them on gardening leave, one has to pay them for that period.  I accept that there is an issue with the impact on the organisation of people leaving.  Enough sanctions are already in place, including the confidentiality provisions under section 202 of the NAMA Act, the provisions of everybody's employment contracts and the obligation to comply with the Official Secrets Acts, to ensure we have a mechanism for dealing with people.  I regard the people who work in NAMA as professional.  They are recruited for their expertise, rather than their specific knowledge of individual assets.  One way to ensure they cannot benefit from their specific knowledge of individual assets is to ensure the assets that go up for sale are openly marketed.  If everybody can see them, nobody has exclusive information.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh explained that some of it is quite technical and relates to year-on-year interest calculations that are based on assets that are not generating income, etc.  Surely some of it must relate to a simple revaluation of the portfolio based on current market value.  Could Mr. McDonagh split the &euro;3.3 billion between the two categories - that accounted for by technical calculations and that accounted for by the actual degrading of the portfolio?</p></speech>

It is a comprehensive exercise.  It is not based on one particular element.  One looks at one's assets at the end of each reporting period and at the planned timeline for their disposal.  One might have said at the end of 2012 that one would dispose of an asset in 2014, but when one looks at it now one might decide to dispose of it in 2015 instead.  That can cause a technical movement.  In addition, one might have predicted that one would get &euro;10 million for an asset that one was disposing of, but one might now predict that one will get &euro;11 million for it because the market has improved.  In such circumstances, the updated valuation would be included.  As I said at the outset, we undertake this form of individual analysis for 85% - by value - of our portfolio.  We believe that internationally, banks undertake this exercise for just 25% of their portfolios.</p></speech>

As it accounts for almost 10% of the value of the portfolio - &euro;3.3 billion is 8% or 9% of &euro;34 billion - it is quite a significant figure.  How much of an impairment had NAMA projected into its base case in 2010 when NAMA was set up?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.178" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013092600011#K01200"><p>In 2010, we did not project any impairment because we expected to get back the value of what we paid for the assets.  As I said to Deputy Murphy, in the base case scenario we were expecting or projecting to get a profit of approximately &euro;1 billion after we sold the assets, paid off the debts and paid off all our costs.  I suppose the difference between 2010 and now is that while we have taken an impairment, we have also been able to generate more income on the portfolio than we thought we would in 2010.  When we inherited the portfolio from the banks in 2010 and 2011, approximately 20% of the rental income that was coming in on the properties was mandated to the banks.  The debtor was collecting the money, but whether he was paying off the interest or the capital is another thing.  Under NAMA, we have captured all the income of the debtor as part of his or her work with us or through receivers.  As a result, over 95% of that income is coming directly to NAMA.  The rental income is much stronger than we predicted in 2010.  That compensates for the decline in value, which is reflective of the market conditions.  As I have said, the majority of the &euro;3.3 billion has been against the Irish assets.  This reflects the decline in the asset values in the Irish market.</p></speech>

NAMA did the initial assessment of the loans, before it took them over in 2010, in order to calculate the discount.  Is that right?</p></speech>

Each of the individual properties or securities for loans was valued by a property valuer for the banks.  We got our own property valuers to say whether we agreed with that value.  If we agreed with it, we accepted it.  If we did not, we rejected it and got a new evaluation.  That was done by reference to 30 November 2009.  However, the market values have declined.  If one studies any of the indices - the IPD is an internationally well-recognised index - one will see a reflection of the fact that there was a fall in asset values of 25%, on average, between the end of 2009 and the end of 2012.  That is the market we have to deal with.  That is the reality the board has to face at the end of each financial year.</p> <p>At the end of each financial year, when it is preparing its accounts and submitting them to the Comptroller and Auditor General for audit, the board must face the question of whether the impairment exercise is robust and reflects the reality of what we will recover on these assets between now and 2020.</p></speech>

The valuations had to be approved and are subject to audit by the European Commission which has looked at all of the valuations to see if they were correct.  If they were not, there would be a state aid issue.  There is, therefore, a huge exercise under way in looking at every single property that was valued and independently audited to make sure the value of the assets was correct as of 30 November 2009.  The valuations were not only NAMA's view but were independently verified for state aid purposes by the European Commission.</p></speech>

It is now more likely that NAMA will break even.  Given the decline of 25% in the market value of NAMA's Irish portfolio, the agency must make up lost revenue if it is to reach a break-even position.  How is the gap being bridged?  Surely it will be greater than &euro;1 billion.</p></speech>

The banks had very little information to give to us on the portfolio and we had to make a conservative projection of how much income we would receive from the assets.  Thankfully, as it turned out, the assets were better located geographically.  In addition, they were producing much more income than the banks had probably realised.  The reason was that debtors were pocketing the income and not passing it over to the banks.  As part of our detailed business plan exercise which started in 2010 and finished in early 2012, as the Comptroller and Auditor General noted, we looked at every single asset and asked whether it was income producing and, if so, where the income was going.  We told debtors that if they wanted to work with NAMA, they had to mandate that income to NAMA and that if they would not do so voluntarily and were in default, we would have to appoint a receiver.  The income from the assets, therefore, has been much stronger than we anticipated, based on the information available to us in early 2010.</p></speech>

The information we received on loans was that a loan had been provided and was secured on a particular property.  We were not given any indication as to whether the property was, by and large, income producing.  Sometimes the income might have been low because the asset had been provided rent-free for a period, which is common, or the debtor had not told the bank that it was generating as much income as it was.  We had to systematically go through an exercise to identify how much income individual properties were producing and where this income was going.  We then had to ensure it was mandated to us.  This is not an easy exercise.</p></speech>

There is also the issue of the mandating of income and the good management of and investment in the assets.  The main factor that has made the difference between the &euro;1 billion profit projection we made at the time of the base case and the current position where we believe we will repay all our senior debt is the way the market has changed.  There was a 25% change in the market between 2009 and 2013 which we could not have forecasted.  I do not believe anybody forecasted it and if one listens back to what was said at the beginning of that period, the view was optimistic.  I would also like to be a little optimistic because if the market changed to such an extent during a downward spiral between 2009 and this year, it could also come back between now and 2020.</p><p>  The board must be very realistic.  We can only produce a strategic plan and make our projections based on what we know now.  However, if there was a fair wind in the market between now and 2020, we could do more than just repay our senior debt.  We could, for example, cover the sub-debt and perhaps return to a scenario where we would make a profit.  We have to be realistic today, but we also have to acknowledge that, just as the market has gone down in recent years, it could also improve again in the coming years and bring us back to a more optimistic view. </p><p>  From the Deputy's point of view - he is quite right to ask us about the difference between then and now - we are being realistic about what we see right now.  The board must be realistic.  Things could change, however, and we could come before the committee in two years to say the market had improved by 5% or whatever other figure, which would change the scenario.  Every time we look at our strategic plan, engage in the exercise of impairment or make cashflow and disposal projections, we have to take account of what is happening in the market.  We would be foolish if we were to write a strategic plan and develop a scenario and then decline to react to what was happening.</p></speech>

The agency's projection that it would make a profit of &euro;1 billion has changed to one where it expects to break even.  Given that only one third of the NAMA project has been completed, I am worried that in one or two years the projection may change again to one of making a loss of &euro;1 billion or &euro;1.5 billion.  I am trying to tease out with the witnesses how fragile the market is and the possibility that it could move in one direction or the other.  The point I am trying to make is that the situation is volatile.  When I asked representatives of NAMA about the base case at our previous meeting, they stated they were certain the agency would break even.  I am trying to find out, in percentage terms, what is the risk that we will not break even but will instead make a loss.</p></speech>

One could say we might have come before the committee today to express a much more pessimistic view were it not for the good management of NAMA assets in the past three years, from mandating the rents and investing to the sheer professional management of the assets.  We have to take into account that we are in a somewhat volatile environment.</p><p>  Our opening remarks and other recent statements point out that we are seeing good signs of stability in the market.  These have been noted for several months and are not a phenomenon that has been noticed this month.  There are signs of growth in certain areas of the commercial market.  For example, there is a demand for prime Dublin space and huge investor interest because investors see Ireland as a good place in which to invest.  In the residential space - the most challenged sector in the popular mind - there is resurgent demand in certain areas in Dublin.  This is funding the building of houses in certain parts of Dublin and Cork.  This comes as a surprise to people, but it is a reflection of current demand and a lack of supply in particular niche areas.  The Deputy is right that the market is the market.  To a certain extent, the way we manage our portfolio can help the market.  If we had dumped assets or engaged in a fire sale in the past three years, the prediction would have been much gloomier.  Just as the market went down in the past three years, it can also go up and it is definitely stabilising.</p></speech>

Is that because NAMA has not been disposing of its assets in Ireland, but has been withholding them, thereby creating demand and pushing up activity and prices?</p><p> My other question has to do with the model.  NAMA has gone from a position of having assets, with very few rents, to getting into a rental driven market.  Is NAMA looking at changing its disposal strategy more towards a rental product?  I believe that in an article in the papers, Mr. Mulcahy suggested NAMA was looking at selling off 10,000 social units, based on rent and so on, as an investment product for large property management type businesses.  Is that a change in model and is NAMA's mandate best served by having a longer period of operation, beyond 2020, so that it can realise the value of rents over a longer period of time rather than dispose of assets?</p></speech>

The NAMA board of seven set its target for 25% of its debt by the end of 2013.  Within a few months of setting that target, the troika arrived here and adopted that target.  It said we had to meet that and had to generate the amount of money required to pay off 25% of the debt by end 2013, whether we were on target towards achieving that or not.  The question was where we could get that money and the best place to get it was from the overseas markets where we had assets.  During 2010-2011, while the European crisis was almost at its height, London was seen as a safe haven and people were moving their money to London.  The majority of buyers of our assets in London have been cash buyers, so were not relying on debt finance.  There were also people from wealthy countries and sovereign wealth funds who wanted to buy good assets in good locations and these were driving yields down.  The yields on assets in London when we acquired them were probably 5.5% -----</p></speech>

When the yields started contracting below 5%, we would take the money and get out.  We held back from dumping on the Irish market.  We said we would sell as much as we could into the Irish market, but we were not going to do it in a silly way that would make the situation worse.  There was a lack of bank finance in the market for mortgages and commercial property here as the banks were forced to deliver.</p></speech>

The yields went all the way out to 9% and are now coming back towards 7%.  Effectively, the market is beginning to correct to an equilibrium.  We are not holding assets here until yields get down to 2% in Grafton Street, which they did at the peak.  That is not our strategy.  Our strategy is orderly and phased and is to have enough in the market where there is enough demand.</p><p>  The recovery story in Ireland has been very important.  Fiscally, the Government is staying on track.  It is getting out of the bailout programme and getting back into the bond markets.  This has been crucially important in terms of the international investors we meet.  It is important to them that Ireland is a stable economy, has a stable government and is meeting its fiscal targets.  It is doing this, which has led to a lot of people, in a low interest environment internationally, considering the situation here.  They can get something like a 1% yield in the US, or get ten-year German bonds at close to that.  People are looking for a yield and if they do not invest in government bonds, they want to invest in real assets, which are a big protector against inflation.  That is why people are interested.  Ireland is seen as a recovery story and that is why they are coming here.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether NAMA should continue after 2020.  That is not how the board thinks.  It is still working towards 2020.  This completely presses me and the executive team.  We try to ensure that we are continually on target towards 2020.  The rental strategy has been driven through asset management, maximising the income on the assets pending their sale.  We have 10,000 residential units, mainly apartment blocks in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway, rented out and we have another 4,000 offered up for social housing, which will hopefully be rented out also.  Over time, we will sell down that portfolio.  That has always been part of the strategy, but in the meantime we wanted to prove they could generate an income.  If one has an income generating asset, one will get a lot more for it than for a non-income generating asset.  It will attract more buyers.  There is nothing unusual in our strategy or change of strategy.  Selling the assets was always in the plan, but it is a question of how we do it over time.</p></speech>

Then, Dublin City Council, through the city manager, drew up an initial plan in the context of its designation as a special development zone.  This plan looks at the land bank area between the new Central Bank headquarters, the infamous building below the Conference Centre which it bought from NAMA, down to the O2 and across the water into the south docklands or the old Boland's Mill area.  The initial plan was drafted, presented to the council and published.  Submissions were requested and we and a large number of other parties made submissions.  These submissions are being considered currently by the city manager and will then return to the council.  The plan will probably go then to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I understand that it will be May or June next year before the area achieves its special development status.</p><p>  In regard to NAMA's interest in the land bank down as far as the O2, we have security, through our loans, of over approximately 90% of the development land.  As part of the strategic development zone plan as published, a certain amount of that will be designated commercial and a certain amount residential.  It is important the balance is right in that regard.  It is also important the balance is right in terms of density and height in the context of the city.  This is a matter for the council and the city manager and possibly An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p><p>  In our engagement on this we are also pointing out there is an issue of key infrastructure.  There are two big infrastructure aspects in the docklands.  One involves the transport authority and CIE, regarding a new train station or interconnector and how that will be dealt with.  If that work is going on, how can building go on around it?  The second major infrastructure issue is sewerage and water.  There is no point building big buildings and putting thousands of people in the area if sufficient water cannot be provided and, more importantly, if sewage cannot be disposed of properly.  It is not just as simple as designating a strategic development zone and saying we will put a commercial business in one place and a residential block in another and everything will be fine.</p> <p>The reality is that if those other things are not dealt with at the same time, we have to think about them holistically in terms of achieving what will be the best for the city.</p></speech>

We deal a lot with the IDA and its representatives tell us that when foreign direct investment comes to Dublin, the companies want their locations to be based in the north and south docklands.  The big firms are located in the south docklands area near Boland's Mill, with IT companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and so on.  The legal firms also want to be close together there.  In the north docklands, we are probably looking more towards the growth of the IFSC through financial services companies and major banks that want premises in that area.</p><p>  This is not speculative.  The last thing NAMA wants to do is to engage in speculative development.  The country has had enough problems because of that.  However, we need realistic planning so if we have an SDZ and we get demand from a company that wants to locate in Ireland, we can build an office block for it and get it there within a defined period of time.  These multinationals have multiple choices of locations in different countries, and they look for security of tenure in terms of delivery of premises.</p></speech>

We have just done a deal with the council to acquire the carpark, which will allow the future development and growth of The Square town centre, and which will generate about 300 jobs in construction and about 300 jobs on an ongoing basis.  We have had a very good engagement with South Dublin County Council, Kildare County Council and with all the local authorities.  We meet them quite a lot.

Before NAMA existed, no houses were being made available in these numbers to the local authorities.  There has been a change in the model.  Previously, the local authorities were provided with a capital grant which was used to buy housing.  Now the model involves long-term leasing and NAMA is trying to help the process.  As soon as a local authority wants social housing, NAMA will buy the property and put it on our balance sheet and lease it out.  This facilitates the delivery mechanism very efficiently.  We are realistic in that the Government no longer has the money to give the capital grant.

A total of 84% of our hotels are located in Dublin or the greater Dublin area, Cork, Kerry and Galway.  Twelve hotels are closed.  The majority of the hotels are owner-operated and an equal number are either operated by management companies or leased by third parties.  We have heard the case being made that NAMA hotels are undercutting others.  We have had two engagements with the Competition Authority as a result of complaints to it.  We ensure our hotels are viable and that they are not engaged in distorting competition.  We have given all of the information to the Competition Authority which stated in its report that it had decided not to pursue the matter as it was satisfied with the information provided by NAMA and that NAMA was not engaged in aggressive pricing.  It is quite usual for people operating in the market to throw out the glib comment that NAMA is allowing its hotels to undercut others.  That is not the way we operate.  We made a commitment to the Competition Authority that NAMA assessed all of its debtors to ensure hotel debtors were viable.  If a hotel is not viable and is costing us money, we order its closure and will not fund its continued operation.  I can assure the Deputy that hotels operating under NAMA are operating fairly on the basis that the Competition Authority is satisfied.</p></speech>

There has been a great improvement in hotels.  In 2010 one of my big concerns about the hotels portfolio was that occupancy levels were down to somewhere between 40% and 50%.  These levels are now over 90% in Dublin and in some of the better tourism areas in Cork, Limerick, and Galway they are around 80% to 90%.  There has been a significant turnaround in the hotel sector and there is more buyer interest.  Factors include the improving economy, while The Gathering has also resulted in a significant influx of tourists.  Many people wish to buy assets in Ireland.  A person complained to me last week that he had flown into the country in his private jet and had to pay &euro;300 a night for a hotel room in Dublin, as if he were in London.

If debtors had other associated loans, these came with the land and development loans.  This was because there was talk about taking the systemic risk of the debtor out of the system also.  We have sold over &euro;9 billion worth of assets.  Many of the assets we sold were income producing because that was where the market demand lay.  What we are doing in the meantime is investing development capital in order that the work on other assets can be finished.  Once these assets are income producing, we can sell them.  There is a constant need, as one sells, to replenish-----</p></speech>

That feeds into the impairment exercise we carry out.  When we do up our cashflows for the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit, we look at the disposal value of and the income relating to all of the assets up to 2020.

IDA Ireland came before the committee recently and expressed concern about the availability of office accommodation in Limerick city centre in terms of attracting foreign direct investment.

One would have to wonder what state the banks would be in now if that had not happened.  As Mr. McDonagh has pointed out, the mandated income which is now coming into NAMA, and therefore ultimately to the taxpayer, which was not the case before the debtors came into NAMA, include the assets recovered through asset searches totally &euro;850 million.  Social housing has benefited through the provision of sites to local authorities, and sites have been provided to the health sector and education.  We are keeping a lot of those debtors going through ordinary working capital.  That is keeping jobs intact and is growing jobs.  The &euro;500 million of investment put back into those debtors was to help them to grow and expand and to preserve, protect and grow jobs.  It is fine to talk in money terms but there is another wider dimension to what NAMA has been doing for the past three years.</p></speech>

We have no role in the valuation of the assets.  The liquidator will value them and offer them to the market.  It is great if the market buys them, but if it does not, they will go to NAMA as we are the reserve buyer.  That is what the Minister has directed and that is part of the legislation in terms of the IBRC liquidation.</p><p>  In terms of what we will do with the &euro;4.1 billion cash balance, &euro;1.25 billion of it will be used to meet the &euro;7.5 billion target by the end of the year.  We are also directed by the Minister to keep &euro;1 billion on stand-by to give to the special liquidator if he needs it for capital for the very businesses Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell mentioned, which are within the IBRC, if they need money and he decides it is worth advancing money to them as working capital.  That is guaranteed by the Minister in terms of getting it back.  We are always conservative in terms of holding enough cash on NAMA&rsquo;s hands.  Many people think Ireland is broke and that we are desperate to sell assets at whatever price they offer.  I say to potential investors that it is lovely to meet them and thank them for coming to this country.  I say that we really want to do business with them but when I say we have &euro;2 billion cash in the bank, their faces drop because they realise we are not a distressed seller.  That is very important from the point of view of value for money for the taxpayer.</p><p>  We actively engage with the IDA.  In Limerick, not only have we spoken to the IDA but we have also spoken to the new city and county manager, Mr. Murray, who is a very able and competent man.  A number of items are under discussion in terms of where we might potentially have premises which might be useful.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell is aware, in Limerick no more than elsewhere, we say to people that if we invest money to complete a project or develop something, we want to know that someone will be there rather than it just being a question of building it and they will come.  We have enough buildings around the country.  Limerick is one of the key strategic locations in terms of where we have our assets.  Through active engagement with Mr. Murray and the IDA, Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell will begin to see solutions.</p></speech>

Mr. O&rsquo;Leary tells me about some of the investors to whom he is talking in terms of those properties, but in other cases he does not say anything for reasons of confidentiality and because he is trying to negotiate.  He might ask about a particular property an investor is considering to find out how soon it could be delivered.  If the property is in NAMA, we work hard to deliver it.  Mr. O&rsquo;Leary is correct to point out that there are a few sites around those areas where people want to locate.</p> <p>For instance, those involved in the IT sector all want to be located in the same area around Google or whatever the case may be.  One would be looking then at deciding to build from scratch, and were one to do this, one must have the right planning.  One issue is that the special development zone for the north and south docks is crucial in terms of allowing this.  However, even if the aforementioned special development zone comes into being in May 2014 and if it is working properly, whereby one submits the planning application and it is fast-tracked, then the first building probably would be delivered in 2016 or early 2017.  There is a certain lead-in time, and that is what Mr. Barry O'Leary is worried about in the first instance.</p></speech>

I have another "how many" question.  I apologise if this has been answered already but it goes back to those individuals who have worked in NAMA and who went on to work for a company that does business with NAMA.  Since NAMA's formation, how many people have left the agency and gone to work with companies that do business or have done business with NAMA?</p></speech>

Some of these people obviously have joined companies which have nothing to do with NAMA.  However, to be realistic with the Deputy, a number of other people have joined companies that may have some dealings with NAMA.  As I indicated earlier, our best defence against that is to make sure that assets are openly marketed and that, in effect, by having the same information as everyone else, no one can steal a march on anyone else.</p></speech>

I worked in the United States and the big debate 20 years ago pertained to the revolving door in respect of United States Senators and Congressmen.  Eventually, they dealt with the issue but it took years.  They have a vastly more developed lobbying system over there and eventually they were obliged to do something about it.  While that has been talked about in Ireland, given the sums of money involved and the importance of NAMA to the taxpayer, can Mr. McDonagh give me an idea of how many of the aforementioned 50 people have gone to companies that have done or do business with NAMA?  I was not present for the question but I have been informed that Mr. McDonagh referred to a three month or six month cooling-off period.  I am trying to figure out how many people have actually gone to such companies.</p></speech>

However, they are under contractual obligations and statutory obligations in respect of the Official Secrets Act as well as confidentiality clauses in the NAMA Act.  There are provisions to enable one to deal with someone who breaches such obligations.  I reiterate that the biggest defence is for an asset, which is put up for sale by NAMA or by the debtor in a case to which NAMA must give its consent, to be openly marketed in order that anyone who can buy that asset has an opportunity to bid for that asset and has the same information as anyone else.  It is a difficult issue and I accept what the Deputy is trying to say.  The reality is that people will come to work in NAMA, where they will work for a number of years, after which they will try to get a job somewhere else.  This is what is happening.  People are being given opportunities elsewhere because we cannot compensate them, to be frank with the Deputy, in the context of trying to hold on to them.</p></speech>

It probably is fair to state that Waterford's city centre has suffered a great deal over the past five years with the departure of businesses.  My understanding is that NAMA is examining its assets around the country to ascertain how they can be rejuvenated and turned into viable options.  Included among the sites is the Michael Street site in Waterford city, which I am told could be developed by the original promoters with approval from NAMA.  I understand, and it has been stated in public, that there have been talks about developing the site, possibly with the original developers.  As I understand it, there was a two year planning process, which ended in late 2008 with approval being given by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Waterford local authority implementation group report published this month mentioned the Michael Street site a couple of times.  It spoke of the site's importance, and in its recommended high level intervention section, it stressed that the local authority, in conjunction with NAMA and other stakeholders, should progress further in the development of an appropriate retail centre in Michael Street, Waterford.  It is a block, formed by New Street, Michael Street, Alexander Street and Stephen Street, in a central location in a city that really has been devastated in the retail sector in particular.  What kind of developments have taken place with the local authority and the developer in question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013092600018#R01300"><p>Yes, I am somewhat familiar with the site.  It is about three acres in size and there is a functioning multi-storey car park on part of it at present.  There is a series of other buildings and a current planning permission, which I believe expires probably later this year.  However, the general consensus appears to be that the current permission is unviable in the times we are in.  That is a consensus across most of those who might be involved in it, including ourselves.  NAMA has done some work on it because we have funded the demolition of six derelict houses on New Street, where there were complaints about anti-social activity and behaviour.  We also have demolished a derelict sports hall at which the same problem had emerged.  In addition, in co-operation with the owner, quite a few shops on Michael Street have been repaired and renovated.  Consequently, there is not complete inactivity on the site, but to get to the core point, the current permission probably is not viable.</p><p>  However, everyone agrees there is a strong case for a good retail development in that area of Waterford.  That is part of the Waterford city development plan and, as the Deputy noted, the implementation group on the reorganisation of the local authorities in the region certainly has highlighted it as one of its high level interventions.  I spoke recently to the city manager on the subject.  As to what is happening at present, a design study has been commissioned and a survey is being undertaken about retail demand in the area.  We are actively engaged with the city manager in looking at that site in the coming months.  As to the involvement of the original promoter, that is something that must be teased out as we go along.  NAMA's general policy is of open marketing and open involvement, but the Deputy can be assured that there is active engagement between ourselves, the city council and the city manager on the site.</p></speech>

However, I am aware that the city council also intends to be very active with regard to access to the site and from Dungarvan, Kilkenny and all of that.  It comes back to the point that if we can see something commercially viable coming out of there, we certainly will be very active in there.  I do not wish to get into legalities here but there may possibly be an issue in the background there that must be solved along the way.</p></speech>

While this issue has been raised by other colleagues, I wish to ask Mr. McDonagh about staff leaving and going to work with other property entities and people who have had interactions with NAMA.</p> <p>He has explained that the notice period is three months.  Does he not believe it would be a good idea to have a cooling-off period?  I entirely accept the point that one cannot stop people from earning a living.  That is the reality of it.  People will naturally change, move and advance in their careers; I accept that.  However, it would not be unusual in an institution such as NAMA, given its work on behalf of the State and the taxpayer, that there would be additional sensitivity and a provision for a cooling-off period.  What is Mr. McDonagh's view on that?  Would he favour that?  Has he suggested it?</p></speech>

NAMA does not have employees itself; they are all employed by the NTMA.  People in the NTMA had a notice period of only one month.  This contrasts with the position in NAMA, in which we said we wanted a three-month notice period.  That was put in place from the very start.</p><p>  The NTMA, further to its having taken legal advice, has stipulated in respect of newly hired staff and people promoted into senior positions, which happens in organisations over time, that the notice period can be extended to six months.  Part of the provision for those with new contracts and those who are promoted is such that if they move to a company that is to deal with any part of the NTMA, not just NAMA, they must recuse themselves from dealing with that company for a further six months.</p></speech>

Therefore, any new people coming into NAMA will be subject to it.  The issue really revolves around people who already have contracts of employment and cannot change them.  However, we are managing this very carefully.  We have told staff that if they are going to join an organisation we believe might be interacting with us, they should leave on the day of resignation.  We stipulated a three-month notice period and that one cannot contact anybody in the office.  We shut off IT systems.</p></speech>

The staff work on behalf of the taxpayer; that is their mandate.  Therefore, they will understand that there is considerable sensitivity, not just in NAMA as an entity but also among the general public in that the agency is working in the public interest, over the notion of people hopping from NAMA to another commercial organisation and bringing their knowledge with them.  One cannot erase it from somebody's mind.  Have Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Daly, who must work within NTMA norms, had a discussion at any stage with the Minister or anyone else?  Have they suggested a cooling-off period of, say, 12 months, which would not be excessive or overly arduous?  Have they had this conversation?</p></speech>

We are trying to juggle a lot of things here.  We are trying to juggle the desire to have a reasonable contract for people with the fact that we are finding it very difficult to hold on to people in the first place.  We are finding it very difficult to recruit people.  Therefore, there has to be a balance in respect of the conditions attached to staff contracts.  As Mr. McDonagh said, the board is very conscious of this matter.  We would be satisfied with the situation that obtains now.</p><p>  Much conversation takes place on this matter.  It is almost as if there were evidence that people had abused their positions.  That is not the case.  Mr. McDonagh outlined earlier the consequences of abuse, under the Official Secrets Act, the NTMA legislation and section 202 of the NAMA legislation.  One must look at this in a balanced way.  People move from organisations such as NAMA and move within the financial and property sectors.  They are being poached from NAMA, I believe, for their expertise and skills, for which we hired them in the first place.  I do not believe they are being poached for any so-called insider knowledge they might have or any use they might make of information relating to debtors that they gained in NAMA.</p></speech>

It should not be a matter of Mr. Daly or me speculating on whether staff are being recruited for reason A, B or C or for insider knowledge.  Given the task and mandate of NAMA and the fact that there could be outside interests that just might seek to headhunt a senior member of staff from NAMA for his insider knowledge - having such knowledge is unavoidable if the staff member is doing his job properly, which I presume is the case - there should, as a matter of good practice, be a cooling-off period.  A period of 12 months would be appropriate and not overly arduous.  It would not stop somebody from getting a different job but would stop him from getting a job that would result in a conflict of interest.  I would have believed that the board of NAMA would have raised that matter with the Minister as a matter of good practice.  It has not done so.</p></speech>

While the board is satisfied with what is happening and is balancing everything, the Deputy is making many hypothetical arguments.  I do not want to come across as being defensive on this but believe we have a fairly balanced regime in place.  It is rigorous and onerous.  If there were a cooling-off period of 12 months, for example, one could not interfere with somebody's right to work without actually paying him during the period in question.  Taxpayers might have another question to ask, through Deputy McDonald or another Deputy, if there were people in NAMA sitting at home for 12 months while being paid by the agency.  The board balances and considers all these factors.</p> <p>We are now in a space where we are comfortable with what we have.  I can assure the Deputy that it is something we pay a lot of attention to and which is reviewed and monitored regularly.</p></speech>

To be clear, I believe it was a mistake from the inception of NAMA not to have joined the dots and looked for potential conflicts of interest and not - as a matter of good practice - to have initiated that cooling off period from the get-go.  I have heard Mr. Daly's answer, however.  As regards winding up Anglo or the IBRC, how many staff does Mr. McDonagh anticipate will come across to NAMA?</p></speech>

It is fine for Mr. McDonagh to make that statement about the current loan book.  However, the world wants to know when will he have finished his task.  When will he have removed the entirety of the contingent liability on the State and its citizens?  In a sense, while it is not misleading, it is not fully complete, to say "we therefore can confidently say that we will have cleared the decks by 2020 because this IBRC loans issue that might be transferred is unquantifiable".  I take the point that at this stage Mr. McDonagh does not know what exactly he will have to deal with.</p></speech>

As regards the IBRC loan book, we do not know what is under the bonnet other than the high level of information, as I have told the Deputy.  We will approach it in the same way as we approached our existing book, by getting under the bonnet as quickly as we can and then working out a timeline when we think that can be resolved.</p></speech>

I understand Mr. McDonagh's concern and the IDA's concern for commercial space.  I represent the northside of that docklands area.  Mr. McDonagh spoke about the new Central Bank, but I would have thought that Boland's Mills was the building of note on the southside.  The previous Docklands Authority made an unholy mess of the development of that area and there are concerns locally that that should not be repeated.  I was gratified to hear Mr. Daly talk about examining things holistically, including working with the HSE for primary health-care centres and whatever other social infrastructure might be delivered in that part of the city.</p> <p>Given the position the agency occupies, will the agency reiterate its understanding that these proprieties are not just in commercial zones but in old neighbourhoods in which people live.  What progress has been made in providing premises for health infrastructure in the area in question?</p><p> I cannot understand the hold-up with local authorities and the 4,000 units which the agency has identified as suitable for social housing?</p></speech>

We are supportive of this and that is why it needs to be done in a way that works for both the businesses involved and the local communities.  The chairman has met the local communities there to find out what they want for housing, schools and health infrastructure.  We are into sustainable development which can be done commercially.  The mistakes of the past were not the agency&rsquo;s.</p></speech>

We are also ensuring that we listen to the people, the local communities and the schools involved.  Last week, I met with an association of former dockworkers who are looking for a venue to display historical artefacts related to their former work.  Our overwhelming desire is that it will be commercially successful so it will bring business to the area and sustain people living there.</p></speech>

One, a local authority may inform us there is too much of a concentration of social housing in an area and it is trying to limit it.  We cannot control that and it is up to the authority to work with a community as to what is an appropriate limit.</p><p>  The second point is that the approved housing bodies were really reluctant to sign leases for NAMA properties as they were only interested in getting a capital grant from the Government to buy the units.  There has been some re-education going on in this area.  As I said in my opening statement, we will continue to make units available for social housing and the quicker people engage with us, the quicker they will be delivered.  We will put &euro;10 million into completing these units.  As such works will include finishing apartment blocks, landscaping and so forth, it is a win-win for everyone involved.  We are doing everything to address this issue.</p><p>  Yesterday, we informed the Ministers, Deputies Hogan and Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, that we have noticed there is more traction on the other side to take these units from the agency now.  If not, the market will take the units and they will not be available.  Everyone involved is beginning to understand this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  It will not solve the whole issue but it will be a substantial contribution to resolving some of it.</p></speech>

We have highly qualified and good staff.  However, we have a complex portfolio with 55,000 individual property units.  The people buying our assets are no fools.  I need smart and clever people on my side of the table to make sure we protect the taxpayer.  We will continue to do the best we can.

Both the Department and the Minister would be aware of what is happening around this.  It is a fact of life that people are getting the opportunity to move because of more remuneration.  To do this job properly, I need to have people with the right skillsets.

It is an issue that is on the radar of the board of NAMA and the advisory board of the NTMA on which the Secretary General of the Department of Finance sits.  The Minister is aware of this issue.

It then took a section of those loans.  It looked at the ones that were left with each of the banks.  How many of these loans are borderline in respect of where they should be either in NAMA or some other arrangement?

At the very start, the European Commission was specific about the type of loans that NAMA could take.  It said we could only take land and development loans and associated loans of a debtor if they had a land and development loan in the first place.  The banks' books - and I do not know what the quantum is - contain loans which, as the Chairman specified, are properly buy-to-let or other commercial properties but did not have any land and development loans at that time so they were not eligible for transfer.  That was not controlled by us.  It was controlled by the European Commission.</p></speech>

I apologise to the witnesses for coming in a second time but it does relate to what I said earlier before the witnesses came in about the committee taking more of a role and spending more time and resources with NAMA.  I want to briefly touch on a few things and look at something relating to process.  I know there is not much that the delegation can say about IBRC but I want to clarify whether NAMA's time horizon for working out those loans as they come across is 2020 as well.</p></speech>

There is the vendor finance, which is standard practice in the market.  We are getting a good return on the provision of such finance in this case.  Vendor finance does many other things.  It brings other people to the table.  It helps to increase the competitiveness for one's assets and to increase the price.  I have been before the committee when we have been questioned about where we sold on assets and then they increased in value but NAMA was out of it.  Here is a commercial opportunity, therefore, to see if there is an upside to this that NAMA would continue to get a payback.  I acknowledge the general point the Deputy is making but, at the end of the day, we are a commercial organisation and we are not going to take equity stakes in everything we sell but here was one.  I can assure the Deputy we went through it in detail.  The case came to be the board, went to a credit committee and went through a rigorous evaluation.  The package at the end was a very good commercial outcome for NAMA.</p></speech>

The agency provides vendor financing to bring other people to the table but it has only brought itself to the table.  Mr. Daly referred to a rigorous process but we cannot see that.</p></speech>

If the Deputy saw the plethora of papers that comes to the credit committee or board regarding a transaction such as that, he would have everything, including a detailed risk assessment.  At the end of the day, that is the call we have to make.  I can assure him that as far as the board and the executive of NAMA is concerned, we were very satisfied in this particular transaction with the outcome.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh when referring to salaries and retention of expertise in his opening statement was giving a warning in a sense in the context of the commentary in the past about a soft landing and the questions about why we were not warned.  When we look back at another area in which a State agency made a big mistake, we see all the meetings were held, different discussions and papers were involved and all the rigorous process was gone through but it was a massive mistake for the State.  I have a worry when I see this as NAMA stepping outside its brief in this regard by getting involved with private entities to purchase loans from itself.  I have a concern about that.</p></speech>

Has NAMA costed the impact of the freedom of information, FOI, legislation?  How much will it cost to deal with FOI requests?  I have no doubt the agency will be busy in this regard.

Clearly it will have implications for NAMA.  Many people have an interest in the agency in terms of FOI requests and, therefore, we have advertised to recruit four specialist FOI staff to deal with that and see how it goes.  We have talked to other bodies that have become subject to the legislation.  We have projected based on their experience that we could have between 500 and 1,000 FOI requests in our first year.  Clearly, there will be costs in trying to deal with that.</p></speech>

I give the usual reminder about mobile telephones and electronic equipment, which can interfere with the sound system.</p><p>  We are joined by representatives from the Special EU Programmes Body to discuss the European Union's Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, PEACE IV and, possibly, INTERREG V.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome the chief executive officer of the programmes body, Mr. Pat Colgan, who is accompanied by Mr. Shaun Henry, director of managing authority, and Mr. John McCandless, communications manager.  We look forward to exploring new opportunities in the programme for 2014 to 2020.  I am aware that the representatives have been working hard on the programme throughout the summer and, subject to different jurisdictions' agreement in 2014, we look forward to an engaging conversation on where the programme will be going.  The European Commission has already identified areas of potential co-operation around youth, maritime affairs, eco-innovation and business co-operation.</p><p>  Before I call the witnesses to make their presentation, I advise that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances at this committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their remarks.  They are directed that only cognisant evidence on the subject matter of this meeting is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Colgan to make his opening statement.  I do not doubt that members' will have many questions and observations to make.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.584" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Colgan" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013092600003#B00300"><p>It is always a pleasure to report to and work with this committee.  I will make some introductory remarks before opening the floor to discussion.  Members will have received two briefing papers, from us and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, respectively.  I understand the emphasis of this meeting is the PEACE IV programme, although I am happy to refer to the INTERREG programme and take questions on that subject.</p><p>  We have been preparing a new PEACE programme since April 2012, when we received formal notification from the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government that we should begin the process of preparation.  These programmes are being prepared in the context of EU cohesion policy regulations, which are still in draft format.  We anticipate that they will be approved before the end of the year, probably in October or November.  That is an important dimension in terms of being able formally to finalise the programmes.</p><p>  It is good to note that Article 6 of the draft European territorial co-operation regulation makes specific reference to provision for a PEACE IV programme.  The article specifically mentions that it should address issues of social inclusion, social cohesion and combating poverty in the region, and that it should continue to address the issues facing society in Northern Ireland and the Border counties as a result of the conflict.  In line with that reference, a budgetary provision of &euro;150 million was made in the multi-annual financial framework for a new PEACE programme.  That money comes from the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF.  In addition, on 14 June 2013, the UK Government and the Northern Ireland Executive made a commitment to allocate a further &euro;50 million from the UK's ERDF allocation to the programme.  That money comes from the broader European territorial co-operation allocation funding for the UK.  It will be added to the other &euro;150 million to create a fund of &euro;200 million for the new PEACE IV programme.  A statement was made at the time of the declaration that the Northern Ireland Executive and the UK Government would like this money to be used in areas they referred to as a united youth programme.  This statement was made in the context of the Building United Communities paper, which was published by the First Minister and deputy First Minister and sets out certain targets on similar issues to those we have been dealing with under the current PEACE programme.</p><p>  It is important to note that changes may occur in the intervention rates.  The draft regulations make provision in the new programme period of 2014 to 2020 for changing the intervention rate from 75%, as it stands at present, to 85%.  This means we could award grants of ERDF money for up to 85% of the cost of projects, which projects would need to find 15% instead of 25% funding.  To date, projects have been receiving 100% funding, with 25% coming from relevant Departments in each sector.  However, with an 85% allocation rate, it is conceivable that some projects may bring forward their own matching funding, including funding in kind in some cases.  This new theme also has implications for the final size of the budget for the programme.</p><p>  We are required as part of the programme preparation process to carry out certain formal evaluations.  We carry out an ongoing <i>ex ante</i> evaluation process, which involves formal monitoring of the programme preparation process to ensure it complies with all the regulatory and legal requirements.  We also carry out, as part of the process, a strategic environmental impact assessment of the programme, and we are also required to carry out an equality impact assessment.  Those three assessments or evaluations are ongoing in parallel as part of the work we are doing in programme preparation.</p><p>  Another important analysis that needs to be carried out in the programme preparation process is what we refer to as a socioeconomic analysis.  This is a broad brush review of the socioeconomic situation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties and, in the case of INTERREG, western Scotland, and the key issues facing the communities and economies of these regions.  A formal and comprehensive study was conducted by the economist unit in the Northern Ireland Department of Finance and Personnel and is available on our website.  It provides an extremely important context for programme preparation in terms of identifying the key socioeconomic issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>  We conducted an extensive consultation process in regard to the preparation of these programmes.</p> <p>From August to November 2012, we organised approximately 20 events around the region that were attended by more than 1,000 participants.  This demonstrated a large level of enthusiasm, interest and appetite for these programmes.  Consultation covered both INTERREG and PEACE.  We also invited written submissions from organisations to give us their opinions on what the programmes' focus should be and what lessons should be learned from the current programmes.  We received 173 written applications, all of which we have published on our website.  We have also published on our website a summary document of our consultations.</p><p> This consultation is an important part of informing us as to what the priorities for the new programmes should be.  The consultees included Departments, State agencies, local authorities, political parties, the community and voluntary sector and the educational sector - the entire spectrum of society.  There was an enthusiastic uptake of the invitation to consult with us.</p><p> The consultation process is fed into a formal monitoring system for the programme's development.  In consultation with Irish Departments and the Northern Ireland Executive, we set up a programme development steering group.  There is information on its membership in the committee's notes.  It meets regularly to oversee the programme preparation process.  It plays an important role for us in ensuring that the preparation process is in line with the priorities of Government policy and meets the issues raised in the consultation.</p><p> The strong themes emerging for the PEACE programme from the consultation process and society in general are: a heavy emphasis on the importance of concentrating on or addressing young people's issues, particularly in disadvantaged areas; an emphasis on issues of educational underachievement; issues of young people not in education, employment or training, NEETs; an emphasis on integrated education or shared education as an opportunity for breaking down societal barriers; and support and enthusiasm for continuing with the concept of creating shared spaces, as developed in the PEACE III programme.  In this context, I refer the committee to the Peace Bridge, the Skainos project, which it visited in east Belfast, and similar projects, for example, Castle Saunderson.</p><p> The theme of civic leadership has emerged, particularly in terms of the role of local authorities' engagement with and leadership in communities.  A further emerging theme is the importance of continuing to share the learning of the PEACE programmes from 1995 to 2023 on a broader scale throughout Europe and further afield.</p><p> This is probably enough by way of introduction.  I am happy to take any questions or observations that members wish to make.</p></speech>

As a representative of two southern Ulster counties, I am familiar with a number of worthwhile initiatives in those communities that have been funded by the programmes and INTERREG.</p><p>  As representatives of the Border counties, we have been concerned about an issue since the early 1990s when the first PEACE programme was initiated, namely, the question of additionality.  This funding stream, which is meant to be additional to the Border counties, is often used as a substitute for adequate central government funding.  We must always watch this issue and be careful about it as regards this programme.</p><p>  Mr. Colgan referred to an emphasis on education.  At various meetings, the committee has dealt in detail with the lack of educational attainment in particular communities in the Six Counties.  I have a concern about Mr. Colgan's remarks on progressing integrated or shared education.  Driving these initiatives is the remit of education Departments.  It is mainline government activity.  I hope that the investment that is necessary to give young people in disadvantaged areas an opportunity to increase their levels of educational and skills attainment will not be left to a relatively small programme like this one.  Otherwise, the Departments in Stormont and our State would be allowed to opt out of providing adequate funding to necessary programmes.</p><p>  We are all influenced by where we come from and the projects with which we are familiar.  The Cavan and Monaghan local authorities have been proactive in the PEACE partnership and have worked closely with other local authorities when delivering the programme in the North.  In this clustering arrangement, local authorities take the lead in specific projects, even where those projects are introduced outside their own areas.  This model has worked well and I hope that it can be continued under this programme.</p><p>  Mr. Colgan mentioned Castle Saunderson in my county, the Skainos Centre in east Belfast and other projects.  These are exceptionally good projects that would fall between all of the stools on which Mr. Colgan is depending for central government funding from any jurisdiction.  I welcome these developments and hope that these types of initiative can continue under the new programme.  However, I am concerned about this funding being a substitute instead of an addition.  Given our consultations with the PEACE programme at local and central level, it is the programme's desire to ensure that funding is additional to central and local government funding.</p><p>  Mr. Colgan might clarify his statement that the intervention rate will decrease to 15%.  Will matching funding be provided by central government or must local promoters provide the 15%?  I am unclear on that point.</p></speech>

It is good to see the briefing on developments and new operational programmes.  Across Ireland, England, Scotland and Europe, it is vital that we target youth unemployment.</p><p>  I live in County Roscommon 30 or 40 miles from the Border.  Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal are wonderful counties, but a county can sometimes be excluded.  To my east is County Leitrim and to my north west is County Sligo.</p> <p>I understand there are initiatives to include such areas, but if we are moving into the west of Scotland maybe it is time to expand.  I am quite sure that many projects have been trawled and examined with a view to joint participation, but it may now be time to come down a few miles to try to include that area also.  There are opportunities there, and it is not for the want of tapping into this fund.  Where I live was the home of the Connaught Rangers in which, 100 years ago during the First World War, Nationalists and Unionists fought side by side.  Because of our history these men were forgotten, but history can be an effective uniting force, as I see when I go to the Skainos Centre, the Shankill Road or even to the Falls Road.  Many men from the Falls Road joined the Connaught Rangers in Roscommon because they wanted to be part of a nationalist force.  If we wanted to undertake some cross-Border memorial or education project on the Connaught Rangers, what would be the best way to access funding to build a centre?</p><p> I welcome the emphasis on energy efficiency in a cross-Border context.  The way forward is not what we make but what we save.  I look forward to the witnesses' comments.</p></speech>

It is interesting that the contribution has now risen to 85%, which is a new development.  It would be interesting to explore in more detail what "contributions in kind" from groups means exactly.  In many past cases where groups could have provided labour or land, it was not considered as a contribution in kind.  That clarification would be welcome because it will make it easier for projects.</p><p>  The Chairman also referred to the broad-brush socioeconomic analysis that will arise as preparation for consideration of the programme's themes.  A much more detailed socioeconomic analysis is available, on a ward-by-ward basis, when it comes to assessing project applications and the awarding of funding to such projects.  I assume and hope that that is something the Special EU Programmes Body, or SEUPB, will use at that stage.  Quite detailed information is available to allow an assessment, rather than just a broad-brush socioeconomic analysis across the North and the Border counties.</p><p>  Unless I failed to pick it up, there was no reference to turnaround time.  Will there be improvements in this regard under the new programme?  It has been a particular bugbear for many community groups, including those who have applied under all previous programmes and the current one.  Has there been any specific attempt to address turnaround time for PEACE programme projects here, compared to other projects across the EU which take half the time?</p><p>  While I know it is not part of the next programme, the Narrow Water Bridge project involves three councils - Louth, Newry and Mourne, and Down District - which have publicly committed funding for it.  The SEUPB has been actively examining additional funds for that project.  Is there any update on it?  The Taoiseach has expressed some interest and people were also seeking an update from the Department of Finance and Personnel in the North.  </p><p>  The SEUPB made an award of &pound;4 million to the Orange Order.  In the North, we have had probably one of the worst summers in many years.  I know that award was specifically for community relations work and reconciliation.  Has all of that money been allocated?  Has there been any discussion about the outcome that was supposed to be attached to such a significant award, given what has happened to community relations over the summer around the marching issue?  Is there any ongoing engagement between the SEUPB and the Orange Order on what was expected to come out of a significant funding award?  Over the winter period and into the summer, there have been street protests in Belfast.  The ongoing protests in Belfast were clearly not about reconciliation and peace building.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.591" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Colgan" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013092600005#D00300"><p>Some of the issues overlap but I will take them as they came.  I might ask my colleague, Mr. Henry, to address the education question because he has been doing some thinking on that with Government Departments.  That was the point raised by Deputy Brendan Smith.</p><p>  We share with the committee an appreciation of the importance of additionality.  This money should be giving us extra options for doing new and interesting things that would not otherwise have happened.  As regards the discussions we are having with Departments, the intention is that it should be fully additional.  It is a bit different from the way it used to be in previous programme periods.  The European Regional Development Fund, or ERDF, money is genuinely seen as additional now and not substituting for government budgets.  As the body implementing policy, the SEUPB takes its direction from the policy Departments.  However, we take on board the importance of additionality as well.  </p><p>  The local authority model was raised.  We agree that that model of clustering and co-operation has worked extremely well.  In Northern Ireland in particular, the 26 local authorities have clustered themselves into seven different clusters plus Belfast City Council.  It has been an efficient way of getting money into local communities.  It has also encouraged co-operation across municipal council boundaries, where the partner principle has worked extremely well.  We see that continuing in the context of the review of public administration reforms that will take place in Northern Ireland.  We imagine that new clusters will be shaped in and around the RPA boundaries as they emerge.  Those are the discussions we are having with local authorities at the moment. </p><p>  On the southern side of the Border, the six local authorities have an impetus for the new vision for local authorities' roles arising from recent reviews.  We will continue to work with them on that and we see an important role for them.</p><p>  We welcome the committee's comments on projects such as Castle Saunderson.  Unfortunately, we expect that this programme will be smaller than the current one, which is valued at approximately &euro;333 million.  The next programme will have a value of &euro;200 million from the ERDF, with a potential 15% additional matching funding which would bring it up to &euro;230 million.  We are therefore talking about a project that is 70% of the current programme's size.  Our flexibility for doing large projects such as those will be less than it is in the current programme.  It will therefore be incumbent upon us to identify specific iconic and important projects that would be worth funding.  We look forward to doing so.  </p><p>  A number of committee members - including Deputies Feighan and Smith and Mr. Conor Murphy MP - mentioned the intervention rate.  Matching funding is currently provided by Government Departments, so we are in effect funding projects up to 100%.  If the 15% rate is taken - and the member states will have some discretion; they may decide to have a different intervention rate for the programme - it could continue to come from Departments and therefore we would continue to have a 100%-funded programme, or there is the option that projects might bring that matching funding to the table themselves.  The matching funding could be in kind, which would include overhead contributions and staff costs.  That would make it a bit more flexible in terms of particular types of project.  It gives us more flexibility in the new programme.  We are in discussions with the member states about how that might be applied.  No decisions have been made on it yet.  This is all part of the recommendations and proposals that will be coming from us to the Northern Ireland Executive and to Irish Departments.  It will depend on that. </p><p>  I will now ask Mr. Henry to say something about the educational points that were raised by Deputy Brendan Smith.</p></speech>

We are particularly mindful of that in the context of education.</p> <p>During the public consultation process to which Mr. Colgan referred, the common and consistent theme was that any future PEACE programme should target youth and young people.  We believe there are opportunities within the formal education and informal youth sectors through which young people from different backgrounds could share their education and youth experiences.  We are mindful of the limited budgets that will be available within the PEACE programme and are trying, therefore, to identify suitable interventions within the education and youth sectors that provide real added value and would not otherwise happen.  We are hopeful that we will be able to identify such interventions.  It is important that young people coming out of the education system are given opportunities to have sustained and quality experience sharing of education, utilising the informal sector of youth clubs and youth organisations to create these types of opportunities.  We are working through this process with the relevant Departments in Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.594" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Colgan" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013092600006#E00200"><p>We are working closely on these issues with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland and in Dublin with the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  As these are sensitive policy areas, it is important the lead Departments provide us with our direction on them.  It is in this context that the proposals I have suggested are made.</p><p>  Deputy Feighan asked about the exclusion of Roscommon from the programme.  I take his point.  On how parts of the west of Scotland became part of the INTERREG programme, this relates to changes in regulations in 2007, which was when the current programme period commenced, which allowed for a maritime border of up to 100 km in terms of co-operation.  The introduction of this change made it possible for co-operation between western Scotland and Ireland.  That is the basis on which that occurred.  However, we are required to work within what are clearly defined eligible areas, which are defined by EUROSTAT in Brussels and relate to populations and specific definitions of areas that are contiguous or share a border with another partner.  Roscommon is just outside that, as is Meath.  There is flexibility around approximately 20% of programme expenditure that can be spent outside the eligible areas and we should, perhaps, be looking a little more proactively at how we might take advantage of that.  I take the Deputy's point that Roscommon is close to the designated region and has some very important stories and linkages of which we could take some advantage.  We look forward to exploring that into the future.</p><p>  The socioeconomic analysis to which Mr. Conor Murphy MP referred is a comprehensive and broad brush, although that definition probably does not do it justice.  It is a fulsome and comprehensive socioeconomic analysis.  We are mindful of the local dimension of these socioeconomic analyses, particularly in the context of the types of initiatives about which we are speaking and the word-by-word analysis of issues of serious social and educational deprivation and so on.  It is very much a part of our thinking.</p><p>  Reference was also made to the turnaround time.  As part of the consultation process we asked people to tell us what they thought worked well and what did not.  This was identified as an area of the programme that is not working well.  This relates to the manner in which we establish the rules for programme implementation.  We are in discussions with personnel in the Department of Finance and our Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on new approaches, if possible, to the implementation of the programmes.  In this regard, we are making suggestions and recommendations.  We are hopeful that we will be able to put in place a system for INTERREG and the PEACE programme based on the difficult lessons we have learned during this programme period.  We look forward to putting forward specific suggestions in this regard.  It is important we meet all of the governance requirements of the Northern Ireland Executive and Irish Departments, but we believe it is possible to do so while being more efficient and predictable in terms of project applicants' expectations of when they could expect to get a reply in regard to a particular application.  This is very much a part of what we are trying to do.</p><p>  On Narrow Water Bridge, I am sure everybody in the room is familiar with the issues around this matter.  Our discussions on this matter with the lead partner are continuing.  Members will be aware that the tender bids received were significantly in excess of the amount available for award, which presents difficult issues for the project.  However, we will continue our discussions with the lead partners and relevant Departments involved.</p><p>  On the Orange Order, I accept it has been a difficult summer, particularly in Northern Ireland.  We are in close consultation with the Orange Order.  We meet it regularly and carefully monitor implementation of the conditions contained in its letters of offer.  I am satisfied that we are making a good deal of progress in this regard.  Is it perfect?  No.  Many things in Northern Ireland are not perfect.  However, it is important we continue this dialogue.  The projects we are putting in place with the Orange Order are, I believe, challenging it in terms of the way in which certain things are addressed and the way in which its institution, infrastructure, organisation and culture is open to the rest of society.  The PEACE programme enables us to have conversations with organisations like the Orange Order which we probably would never have been able to have had.  Despite the difficulties and complexities associated with it, it is in my view well worth continuing and pursuing for the benefit of everybody in society.</p></speech>

I have learned a great deal from the presentation.  Mr. Colgan spoke about new approaches and widening the body's remit.  I would like to put on record some of my concerns in regard to the long-term goals of what the body is trying to achieve and what we are trying to achieve.  One of the biggest threats to the stability of peace in Northern Ireland, the Border regions and wider afield is from dissident republicans.  A profound issue on the north side of Dublin, which is in my constituency, is the growing simplistic definition or analysis of what the Northern situation is about and dissident republican organisations tapping into disconnected young people in this regard.  There are issues of educational disadvantage tied into this, including economic disconnection and so on.  It is very easy for dissident republicans in the South to present a simplistic and one-sided view of the political reality in the North.  This pushes mainstream republicans and Nationalists further to the green side, which makes mainstream unionism and mainstream loyalism even more nervous.</p><p>  Other issues affecting my constituency include local authority staff, whose responsibility it is to remove political graffiti, being threatened, an increase in paramilitary style events and an increasing mobilisation of dissident republicans in Dublin and, I assume, elsewhere.  The first ceasefire took place in 1994.  For young men now in their 20s and 30s, this is a distant memory, if they recall it at all.  When meeting community groups from Northern Ireland, they expressed the concern that 17 and 18 year olds who have no memory of what the Troubles were like but who have heard stories about it from particular people may feel they have missed out and may be trying to relive some of the glories of the past.</p> <p>Talking to someone who has been through the Troubles and who may have emerged enlightened from a period of detention or what he or she has done or experienced is easier than talking to a young person who has not been through such an experience.  I wonder if there is potential for greater connectivity with different parts of the country, not only the Border regions, with a view to addressing the growing threat posed by people who take a simplified view of the politics of the North.  Disaffected young people may be easily politicised and radicalised by this particularly dangerous view, which is growing in popularity.  I am especially concerned about this issue given what took place in the North in the past.  This meeting is a perfect forum for acknowledging the issue.  What are the witnesses' views on this matter?  Has it been discussed by the Special EU Programmes Body?  Could the SEUPB offer practical solutions or engage in outreach on this issue?</p><p> As the representative of a constituency in central Dublin, I hope to get a perspective on what the joint committee can achieve.  I do not pretend that particular emotions have been consigned to the past or that everyone has moved on and we all take an enlightened view.  A whole new generation, not only in Northern Ireland or the Border counties but also in my constituency, is making life very difficult for local communities and could make life difficult for this island, North and South, if we do not engage proactively to address the issue.</p></speech>

Our guests did not indicate what funding will be available under the INTERREG programme.  While I accept it is probably early days, is there a figure available for funding under the INTERREG programme?  A sum of &euro;200 million may seem to be substantial but the annual allocation will be less than &euro;30 million as the programme is to run for seven years.  We must understand that while the funding may have a positive effect, it will not address all issues or solve all problems.</p><p>  The funding will be used to meet "the specific and complex challenges of social inclusion, youth work, education and capacity building".  This is a broad and ambitious range of areas.  While &euro;200 million may be a drop in the ocean, I hope that, combined with matching funding, it will have the intended effect.</p><p>  I raise an issue that ties in with the proposed Narrow Water Bridge project and perhaps other similar projects of which I am not aware.  If money is not drawn down and expended by the end of the programme, will it roll over into a subsequent programme or will it be reallocated to projects where there is a shortfall in funding?  If, for instance, the Narrow Water Bridge project is delayed, which no one wants, can the &euro;17 million committed for the project be reallocated to other projects or will it be sucked back into the European Union and take years to extract through a complicated bureaucratic process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.599" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1166" speakername="Jim D'Arcy" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013092600007#F00300"><p>I welcome our guests from the Special EU Programmes Body.  I had a great week at Fleadh Cheoil na h&Eacute;ireann in Derry where the new Peace Bridge has become an iconic structure and has delivered great benefits to the city.  I congratulate the Special EU Programmes Body on its role in that project.  I hope a new bridge at Narrow Water will be just as iconic for the south Down and north Louth areas.  As well as economic benefits, such projects also deliver higher order benefits.  Major funding issues have arisen for the Narrow Water Bridge project, which the Special EU Programmes Body fully supports and in which it has played a helpful role.  I hope the problems will be resolved in the coming weeks.</p><p>  On PEACE IV, I share the concerns expressed about the concepts of additionality and substitution and hope they will not apply.  While I do not often differ with Deputy Brendan Smith on many issues, I disagree with him slightly on one issue.  Statistics show that educational attainment is significantly lower than the national average in the Border counties of Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim, Donegal and, to a lesser extent, Sligo.  The same statistics show that unemployment is higher than the national average in these counties.  Moreover, a very high score in the deprivation index is recorded in most electoral areas and hinterland of the gateway towns of Dundalk, Sligo and Letterkenny and the hub town of Cavan.  These high scores can be largely ascribed to the educational needs of these areas where the number of people who complete third level education is very low in some cases.  I hope consideration will be given to the possibility of providing additional Government investment in education in these areas in conjunction with the institutes of technology.</p><p>  I would also like PEACE IV funding to be provided for the development of second language skills.  On a recent visit to Manchester, I was driven to a football match by a Greek taxi driver.  In a discussion about our families, he told me his two daughters, both of whom had degrees and spoke two foreign languages, were working with him.  According to my driver, every child in Greece learns two foreign languages.  Most of the people employed by PayPal, National Pen and other companies located in Dundalk are recruited abroad because Irish people do not have the language skills required to deal with foreign customers on the telephone.  For this reason, I would welcome any initiative to use PEACE IV funding for the purposes of foreign language acquisition.  I thank our guests for appearing before us for this very interesting engagement.</p></speech>

He is also correct to place the funding in perspective.  Effectively, the sum of &euro;230 million will be allocated over ten years rather than seven years because there will be a three-year window to complete the spending at the end of the seven year period.</p> <p>We are actually planning from 2014 to 2023.  It spreads it out considerably more.</p><p> There is still no decision on the allocation for the INTERREG programme.  That will be decided between the British Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Irish Government in terms of the allocation of their European territorial co-operation funding that they receive from Brussels.  However, we anticipate the programme will be similar in size to the current programme, which is worth &euro;256 million.  We do not know the details of that yet, but that is what we anticipate.  The two programmes together are worth &euro;400 million to &euro;450 million.  That gives a better sense of scale.  It is much more important to have complementarity between the two sister programmes in that regard.  However, on an annual basis it is not a considerable amount, which is why in our discussions with the stakeholders in terms of programme preparation we say it is very important for these programmes to have a very clear, targeted focus and are not spread too wide thereby having less impact.  We are trying to prioritise specific areas of intervention where we believe the programmes can make a difference and leave something iconic and significant that is a specific additional contribution from the programmes.</p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about the rollover of money and the reallocations of money.  Money allocated within a programme period - the current programme period is 2007 to 2014 - must be spent within that programme period and cannot be carried forward into another programme period.  Those are the regulations.  In the current programme period we have until the end of 2015 to spend all of our allocation even though the programme comes to an end at this time.  The new programme period technically begins at the beginning of 2014, will run until 2020 and there are three years after that to spend it out.  So as I said it is from 2014 to 2023 but there is no carryover from one period to another.  If it is not spent-----</p></speech>

So there are 2014 and 2015 to spend out.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about projects that are not viable.  We can take that money and reallocate it to other viable projects, something we have done on many occasions in the past.  It is a normal and natural part of programme management to come up against these kinds of difficulties.  We work very hard with the relevant Departments and other key players in the region to identify other projects that can absorb this funding.  The major objective for us is to maximise the return for Northern Ireland and the Border counties for all of these moneys.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in made a very interesting point.  We are facing those very issues all the time in Northern Ireland - this kind of work with young people and the kinds of influences they are under.  One of the big challenges for us under PEACE IV is to see if we can make some difference in this regard.  We have a good long track record of working with young people, and youth groups and organisations.  Much of our work has been in building links across communities and across the Border, and engaging with groups of young people in many different ways from both a cultural and skills point of view and also in terms of understanding issues, understanding each other and building relationships.  We believe that has potential.  There is a demand and requirement for us to do a good deal more of that.</p><p>  The suggestion of getting more dialogue going with areas such as in the Deputy's constituency is one we would welcome.  As I mentioned previously, we have the option to spend 20% of the value of the programme outside the programme area provided the activity is of direct benefit to the eligible region.  For example, we are in discussions with other regions throughout Europe sharing the experiences of the PEACE programme.  We have done some work in Cyprus, the Balkans and in the Basque country.  We have been asked to share our experience with a number of other regions and areas.  We look forward to continuing to do that.  I see no reason we should not also do that with areas of Dublin that have particular synergies or similarities in terms of the challenges they are facing.  That may be worth exploring and we would be happy to talk to people about that.  It is possible.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Henry to address Senator Jim D'Arcy's point on educational attainment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.605" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Shaun Henry" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2013092600008#G00400"><p>We are all very mindful of the low educational attainment in some of the most deprived neighbourhoods, whether that be in inner city areas, rural areas or in the Border region.  When children leave the school system without obtaining qualifications, it very much limits their lifetime opportunities and leaves them vulnerable to becoming involved in a range of activity that works against the aims and objectives of the peace process.  We are aware and mindful of that.  However, we are also mindful of the very limited budgets we will have available.  We are aware of a number of Government initiatives both within Ireland and within Northern Ireland to try to address this issue of educational under-attainment.  We are aware of the complexity of the issues because it involves not only interventions within the school, but very often interventions within the home environment.</p><p>  As I said previously, we are trying to identify how a peace programme can add value to the educational experience of young people.  That added value is likely to involve building trust, tolerance and respect for difference.  We need to ensure young people leaving our educational system have a value system that enables them to make a positive contribution to a diverse society.  We are trying to identify that type of added value in our consultations with the relevant authorities, North and South.</p><p>  It is worth noting that we are in discussions with the institutes of technology in the Border region and with other third level institutes within Northern Ireland to explore how they could participate in the future INTERREG programme and in particular to explore the potential of increasing their capacity in research and innovation.  We believe the INTERREG programme may hold out opportunities to boost the research capacity of the institutes of technology and through that could have a very positive impact on the Border region economy.</p></speech>

I had the opportunity to visit Lurgan GAA club along with Ms Dolores Kelly, MLA.  In addition to the traditional games of football, hurling and handball, a very active youth club is based there and uses those facilities.  There has been considerable difficulty in the area over the years.  The model that was developed between the GAA club and local youth clubs there provides an exceptionally good resource for young people to participate in youth activities.  Perhaps that type of model using existing facilities might be worth considering.  The witnesses may be familiar with it.</p></speech>

The three main codes of football all work very much in a partnership way at a local level and we are funding a broad range of those programmes.  We also fund a range of youth-sector initiatives for young people who perhaps do not wish to be involved in that type of sporting activity and for disengaged young people.  As Mr. Colgan said earlier, over the PEACE programmes we have accumulated a broad wealth of experience of how to engage with marginalised and vulnerable young people.</p> <p>Sporting organisations are definitely a very positive way to engage young people, as are a whole broader range of youth programmes.  We would be keen to build on that experience.</p></speech>

The project has seen land owned by the Ulster GAA Council transformed into a multi-sport facility for rugby, Gaelic football, cricket, soccer, hockey and bowling.  It is an excellent example of the co-operation that is possible.  We are happy with how the Ulster GAA Council and, as Shaun Henry mentioned, all the other sporting organisations are engaging with us, and there is the potential for more of that.</p><p>  We also have a football-for-all initiative that we run with the Irish Football Association in which we work with the fans on sectarian issues.  We have showcased the projects on international stages which we recently did in Brussels, for example.  We are getting some great reaction from around Europe on the initiatives that we are engaged with.</p></speech>

A few innovative and creative suggestions have been put forward.  It is an important topic, especially for this committee which is focused on the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 and relations between the North and South.  Obviously, the programme is very much Border related, but there can be a good bit of creative thinking around bringing people together.</p><p>  I acknowledge the work of Pat Colgan, Shaun Henry, John McCandless and their team.  They have been working continuously and earnestly to make a better Northern Ireland.  I am more acutely aware of the positive benefits of the Special EU Programmes Body to County Donegal and the Border region, but the impact of its work is - I hesitate to use the word "legacy" because every time that word is used in the Northern Ireland context it is seen in a negative vain - leaving a legacy.  The body deals with a lot of pain and hurt in Northern Ireland and it is important that we always remember that when we are having conversations about trying to understand what people have come through over the past decades and how that is still the reality.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in pointed out the wider realities, that there are still sectarian challenges and that a lot of walls - I mean that in a mental rather than a physical sense - need to come down.  The work of the body is more than symbolic and more than significant.  I was delighted to be part of the opening ceremony of the peace bridge in Derry and to have the First Minister standing alongside the deputy First Minister.  If an assessment had been carried out on which figure had made the bigger impact, the measurement would show that the First Minister made a massive impact in Derry.  I hope I am allowed to say this in public because this is what he said on the day - but he even referenced the town as "Derry".  There was a tremendous generosity of spirit.  Equally, when Martin McGuinness, the deputy First Minister, was at the opening of the Skainos Centre in east Belfast, if one carried out an impact measurement it would show that he certainly made his presence felt and he went down very well.  </p><p>  There is a lot of work to do, but the work of the body is a cornerstone not only to the future understanding of what led to the impasse in Northern Ireland over a period of 30 years but to the future of Northern Ireland.  We as a committee are looking to the future and anything that we can do to pull people together.  Funding of &euro;150 million was mentioned and Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned &euro;30 million.  Money sometimes gets the attention of politicians, but this committee is in the business of reconciliation.  The carrot and the stick are always there but, if we can be progressive and creative in our thinking in bringing people together, whether that is young people in east or west Belfast, inner city Dublin or in the Border area, we may be able to make their lives better.</p><p>  I look forward to our ongoing engagement.</p></speech>

I extend a c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte roimh gach &eacute;inne.  I thank the witnesses for being here in such large numbers.  This meeting is divided into three sessions of one hour.  Not wanting to sound too much like a schoolteacher, I remind our witnesses that they will have three minutes per presentation, after which there will be an opportunity for questions and answers.  I ask members to be precise and tight in their questioning.</p><p>  As part of our preparations for the budget, the committee decided it was important for it not just to engage, but to be able to listen to and participate, with witnesses as part of the pre-budget submission period.  The committee felt in its role in the Houses of the Oireachtas that it was important to have witnesses appear before it as part of our pre-budget preparations.  Even though they have their own pre-budget hearings in different parts of the city, it is important for us to engage with them.  They are most welcome and I again thank them for coming.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, witnesses should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of a long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that Members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House, or any official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Apologies have been received from Deputy Robert Troy, Deputy Regina Doherty and Senator Imelda Henry.  I call on Mr. Chris Macey from the Irish Heart Foundation to make his opening remarks.  I again remind everybody to keep to three minutes.</p></speech>

We also developed a joint submission on tobacco control with the Irish Cancer Society and fully endorse the points it will make today.</p><p>  Members of the committee are well aware of the facts behind Ireland&rsquo;s obesity crisis.  One in four three year olds, one in four primary school children, one in five teenagers and 61% of adults are obese or overweight, and these rates are rising.  Despite this, the State continues to fail in its duty of care, particularly to protect the health of children from a multinational processed food and beverage industry whose sole remit is to maximise profit for its shareholders and accepts no responsibility for the impact of its marketing tactics on public health.</p><p>  We believe the resulting excessive consumption of energy dense processed foods and sugary drinks must be tackled through action on many fronts, including the following fiscal measures: taxation to increase sugar-sweetened drink prices by at least 20%; unhealthy foods and beverages currently subject to zero or reduced VAT to be charged at the standard rate of 23%; and a regulatory impact assessment of healthy food subsidies and taxes on unhealthy foods.</p><p>  Sugar-sweetened drinks are a key driver of our obesity epidemic.  Although they have no nutritional value, they are packed full of calories.  Children who consume these drinks receive around 20% of their recommended daily sugar intake from them.  It is estimated that each extra glass consumed daily increases by 60% their risk of becoming obese.  In addition, one in five one year olds, more than half of four year olds and 82% of 13 to 17 year olds consume a sugary drink daily.  While the overall number consuming carbonated drinks has fallen since 2001, the daily intake has increased by more than one third among those who drink them.</p><p>  A health impact assessment and modelling exercise by the Institute of Public Health and Oxford University for the Department of Health estimates that a 10% additional tax on sugar-sweetened drinks would reduce the number of obese adults by approximately 10,000.  A 20% tax would have an even bigger health impact and generate extra tax receipts of around &euro;60 million which could fund subsidies for healthy food and drinks and thereby counteract claims that such taxation would be regressive.</p><p>  Industry groups claim taxation would not work, but in 1992, the removal of a special tax on soft drinks drove consumption up, suggesting the public is sensitive to their price.  The industry also claims that taxation would cost jobs.  However, reduced spending on sugar-sweetened drinks would result in higher expenditure in other areas and incentivise the industry to reformulate unhealthy products, thus being exempt from additional tax, opening up new markets and positively influencing public health.  Research has shown the employment effects of a sugary drinks tax combined with a subsidy on fruit and vegetables would be neutral at worst.</p><p>  Unhealthy food is generally subject to the standard 23% VAT rate, but products like croissants, banoffi pie, chocolate chip biscuits and jam doughnuts are charged at a reduced rate.  Sugar, icing sugar, chocolate spread and pizza have a zero VAT rating.  These anomalies make no sense whatsoever and we urge their removal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.620" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Kathleen O'Meara" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013092600003#B00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to address them on the joint submission being made to the Government by the Irish Cancer Society and the Irish Heart Foundation to this year's budget.  I will speak on behalf of both organisations, and Mr. Chris Macey of the Irish Heart Foundation and I will take members' questions afterwards.</p><p>  Our submission concerns tobacco and we have four recommendations: the regulation of the tobacco industry in Ireland, ensuring tobacco tax increases benefit the Exchequer and not the tobacco industry, a price escalator for tobacco taxes, and a comprehensive tobacco smuggling strategy.  Why do health charities concern themselves so much with tobacco?  Our objective is to continue to cut the smoking rate in Ireland, and it cannot be achieved unless the tobacco industry is controlled here, specifically in how it operates in the market and the profit it makes.</p><p>  Three big international tobacco companies dominate the market in Ireland: British American Tobacco, Japan Tobacco International, and Imperial Tobacco.</p> <p>Dr. Robert Branston, an economist at the University of Bath in the UK, has conducted research which shows that these tobacco firms enjoy profits of 55% after duties on sales in Ireland.  He estimated that their combined profits in Ireland in 2011 were &euro;104 million after tax, which is about three times the profits enjoyed by the food and alcohol industries.  Those are super-normal profits.</p><p> We propose that the State intervenes in the tobacco market by appointing a tobacco regulator with the purpose of curbing the excessive profits of the industry. This could yield up to &euro;65 million to the Exchequer.  In 2011, total tax receipts for tobacco were &euro;1.42 billion while the cost of smoking related illness to the Exchequer is estimated to have been around &euro;2 billion, so the tax collected from the industry does not meet the cost of caring for those people whose health has been ravaged by their addiction to tobacco.</p><p> Our second proposal is to adjust the structure of tobacco tax to ensure that when tobacco tax is increased, it benefits the Exchequer, not the tobacco industry.  We seek an increase in the specific tax on cigarettes, with a corresponding decrease in the <i>ad valorem</i>tax.  Specific tax is levied on the volume of cigarettes sold, while <i>ad valorem</i>tax is calculated on the price of the packet of cigarettes.  That would mean tobacco profits are squeezed, with more revenue to the Government.</p><p> Third, we are calling for an annual tobacco tax escalator of at least 5% above inflation in tandem with a national anti-smuggling strategy.  This would bring a 60 cent tax increase this year.  We stress that the smuggling rate is not the 30% plus claimed by the tobacco industry and the groups it funds.  The real rate is provided through IPSOS MRBI research for the Revenue Commissioners, and last year smuggling fell to 13% from 15% in 2011.  That is still unacceptable, but if high tax fuels smuggling as some people claim, that has not been the UK experience where the smuggling rate has fallen from 21% to 9% in the past ten years, while tax increased by 77%, making UK cigarettes dearer than here.</p><p> Committee members may have heard that tobacco companies and their front groups criticise tax increases, but over the past decade the rate of industry increases has been higher.  Therefore, while the Government has made small increases, the industry has in fact made its own, and in some cases higher, increases.</p><p> We want increased resources to tackle smuggling.  It is important to know that Revenue estimates that 87% of smuggled tobacco is the product of the legal industry getting into the supply chain and just 6% is counterfeit, so supply chain control is a key issue.  In the past, cheap tobacco jurisdictions have been knowingly flooded with cigarettes which are then smuggled into other European countries.  We need extra detection equipment, such as scanners in our ports, in addition to more supply chain controls.  In addition to tackling supply, we must address demand, and our proposals include the introduction of legislation to make buying illicit tobacco a criminal offence.  We need to be aware that industry-sponsored lobbying on tobacco tax is aimed solely at maintaining its extraordinary profit levels at the expense of the public purse and, of course, public health.</p></speech>

First, we have seen an increase this year in the trend in which a family carer can receive income from the Department of Social Protection or service support from the Department of Health but not both.  That matter, which is completely contrary to Government policy, is arising on the HSE side.  The two systems were designed to reinforce each other, so what is happening is crazy.</p><p>  Second, I made the point to the committee last year that fair deal wastes money in an avoidable way.  It is a statutory right to put people into residential care.  However, there is no equivalent right to put them into community care, so when the budget runs out, the only available option is to put them into residential care, even if that is not what they need or want.</p><p>  The employment control framework is underpinned by the Haddington Road agreement.  For example, if a person living in Carlow or Kilkenny has a child between six and 18 with mental disability, that child would probably never be able to access psychological or operational therapy services on the State system because the limited resources available are concentrated on those aged under six.  We have no argument about the concentration on those under six, rather we have an argument with the fact that how the framework is operated leaves that gap.  We have no argument with the principle of a framework.  It is how it is operating that is at issue. </p><p>  Respite beds are empty in certain parts of the country.  Last year, a charge was introduced for those who avail of more than 30 respite days a year in a State residential centre.  The scheme and the charge seems to be slightly troubling in principle but, when it is looked at carefully, the scheme is relatively fair.  The problem appears to be about how the scheme is communicated and the fact that people are more scared than they should be of how the arrangement works.  Furthermore, it results in empty beds.  That does not represent a saving as the costs associated with the beds are still there.  It is a lost opportunity.  The situation is occurring because there is no proper audit of resources and there is no way to move those resources effectively around the country were we to identify waste in any part of it.</p><p>  We also flag up a concern about the effect of the recent Labour Court recommendation.  Although we are not criticising the court, its recommendation on the terms and conditions of 10,000 home help workers directly employed by the HSE is significant.  We have little doubt that it will have an adverse impact on patients, carers and other home help workers employed by voluntary organisation such as the Carers Association or even the commercial organisations because it will cause scarce resources in the HSE to be diverted to directly employed staff for no visible increase in services.</p><p>  On the Government's phased roll-out of medical cards, we point out that every healthy family carer is saving the State not one but two health bills, because were the family carer to get sick, the person they are caring for must also be looked after by the system.  Consequently, family carers should be a priority in the pecking order in the roll-out.  In addition, the prescription charge for card holders was introduced last year.  Although we have no problem with the principle behind that charge, it could be restructured on a revenue neutral basis so that the old and chronically ill are not penalised.</p><p>  The proposals to replace the mobility allowance scheme have not emerged.  We understand that the problem is a difficult one, but we assume that the <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement by which the old scheme will continue until October will be extended until the new scheme is introduced.</p></speech>

I am not going to stick to my script, but I ask Members to read it.  I am someone who normally talks off the cuff; that is why I end up in so much trouble a lot of the time.  I could spend all day talking to members about there not being enough personal assistance, PA, hours.  I agree with all that Chris Macey said and I could elaborate on his points.  However, what I want to say to members more than anything else is that it is not the money that we do not have but the money that we have that is most important.  I do not know whether the figure for disability services is &euro;1.3 billion or &euro;1.4 billion or some other amount in that order.  I have 60 years experience of living with disability and working in all aspects of it, through which I earn a reasonable living.  The difficulty I have is that although the support to people with disabilities is provided for, when the services are provided, usually what happens is that people and families are made even more dependent.  The reality is that people can never have enough and the State cannot continue to provide the services.  How do I know that?  The same situation is arising in every other state across Europe.</p><p>  I am sure that members are familiar with the UNCRPD, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  There is much debate about that and we are waiting on one more piece of the jigsaw to come together.</p> <p>All that says a number of different things.  Services must be provided in a form of support.  That form of support must be a form of empowerment, choice and building and developing people with disabilities to understand their rights and responsibilities.  If we do not do that, we will continue to have funding and more funding, so I urge many of those here to stand back.  The policies within the Department are nearly right but there is a lot more to be done.</p><p> We need to look at how we fund people with disabilities.  If we move to Australia, we have the national disability insurance scheme.  We should be discussing at European level and should be in search of a Commissioner for disability.  We should be getting European-wide support.  Disability occurs right across Europe.  We may think it is a subsidiary point but it is not.  I urge members to step back and think about how we spend such valuable money.  I am very mindful of the figure today, which I understand is &euro;77 billion on the wrong side of the equation.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.630" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Timmins" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013092600005#D00300"><p>On behalf of Age Action, I thank the Chairman and the committee members for this invitation to be here.  The cumulative impact of a succession of austerity budgets is taking a very heavy toll on older people who are being forced to make drastic decisions to make ends meet.  We carried out a nationwide consultation between February and April 2013 when we were preparing our pre-budget submission.  It involved asking people whether austerity affected them and the actions they are taking to deal with it.  We were shocked by the results.  Although we work with older people every day, we were genuinely taken aback by some of the things that came back in the questionnaires.  They ranged from people going to bed at 7 p.m. to remain warm, to people sitting with hot water bottles and turning off the heat, to people choosing between food and fuel, to people who could no longer afford to keep their pet.  Our pre-budget submission highlights how older people on fixed or falling incomes are being hit on four sides as a result of austerity.  They are being hit with new taxes and charges, cuts to their income supports, rising prices for essential goods and services and cuts to publicly funded services on which they depend to remain living independently in their homes.  Faced with growing pressure from all sides, many older people are being faced with very tough decisions as to what to pay for and what to do without.</p><p>  Our submission smashes the myth that older people have not been affected by austerity.  That myth is out there and is being perpetuated time and again.  If we do nothing else, we would like to say that the poorest of older people who are dependent on the State for their basic needs are among those who have been hit hardest by austerity.  If we get no other point across, it will be a very good day's work for me.  On the income side, fixed pensions are expected to pay a series of new taxes and charges.  Property tax is equivalent to two or three weeks' pension for many older people.  The prescription charge was trebled in the last budget.  It only affects the sickest and poorest.  The carbon tax has been extended this year and will be doubled in the forthcoming budget.  The increased charge on a person&rsquo;s home under the nursing homes support scheme will increase from 15% to 22.5%.  At the same time, key supports for older people are being cut.  The means-tested winter fuel allowance was cut by six weeks, the gas, electricity and phone allowance under the household benefits package has been cut, there have been cuts in the respite care grant and funding for the home adaptation grant, and there has been the loss of waivers for bin charges.  The list goes on and on.</p><p>  Meanwhile, prices for essential goods and services are soaring.  This pre-budget submission was compiled in April and we looked at key prices going back to 2008 and 2009, which was the last time the State pension increased.  We are particularly worried about the cost of energy.  Electricity prices have jumped by 32%, gas prices have increased by 26% and home heating oil has increased by 25%.  These energy  figures do not include the latest increases, which were approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation in recent weeks.</p><p>  The other element of austerity is that key services on which older people depend have also been cut.  An example would be home help hours.  In 2007, the HSE provided two million more home help hours compared with today.  Austerity is also taking a psychological toll on older people.  It was very clear from the submissions and questionnaires that older people are uncertain about what the future holds.  Many of them feel guilty and that they are a burden on society.</p><p>  Our pre-budget submission features 32 recommendations.  I will not go into them all but what we are asking the Government to do in this forthcoming budget is to ensure it poverty-proofs all measures and not just those related to older people in order that the most vulnerable in society are not penalised further.  We need to protect the State pension because it is the bulwark against poverty in later life for the majority of PAYE pensioners.  We need to reverse the cuts to the household benefits package.  If we reverse no other cut, we must reverse the cut to the means-tested fuel allowance for the poorest of older people.  We need to ring-fence the carbon tax in order that it goes into home insulation programmes.  The original intention of carbon tax was to protect people.  We are also looking for a property tax exemption for households with an income of under &euro;12,000 per annum and the scrapping of the 4% interest charge.  We have not received figures back from the Revenue Commissioners.  Our experience is that very few older people are taking that up but are going without to pay their property tax.  A copy of the full submission has been sent to the committee and is available on our website.</p></speech>

In May of this year, the Irish Government hosted European month of the brain as part of events for its EU Presidency.  The irony is that Ireland is among the most challenging countries in which to live with a neurological condition.  In the year in which our country was the focal point for neurological conditions, we are calling on the Government to halt the effects of years of successive cutbacks to health and disability services which have had a devastating impact on people with neurological conditions and their families.</p><p>  I am aware of time constraints this morning and refer members to our full pre-budget submission.  I will group some of our most important themes under the following headings.  Overall, living with a neurological condition in Ireland is becoming increasingly difficult because of the range of cuts to health, education and disability services which have taken place over recent years.  Neurological conditions are among the commonest causes of significant disability so, proportionately, these people are the most vulnerable to these cuts.  The examples outlined in our pre-budget submission include increases in the cost of medical care represented by prescription and other charges, cuts to transport services which effectively deny access to health services for those who need them, and cuts to personal assistance services.</p><p>  We are critically reliant in Ireland on the not-for-profit sector to provide neurological care.  The strength of this sector has been steadily eroded because of successive funding cuts of up 15% in recent years resulting in the curtailing and withdrawal of vital helpline, respite and support services to people with neurological conditions and their families.</p><p>  By cutting community-based home support, transport and other services, we are choosing the most expensive option for caring for the growing numbers of Irish people with neurological conditions.  Cutting community supports places greater reliance on hospital and nursing home care.  While cutting community-based supports does not have the same optics as removing beds and closing wards, its effect is no less devastating on our health services and those who need care.</p><p>  What is the Neurological Alliance of Ireland calling for?  We are calling for the Government to take actions in line with its policy of keeping people in their homes for as long as possible by halting and reversing key cuts in community-based supports such as personal assistance, home help, home care supports and home adaptation grants.  We call for it to recognise that not-for-profit neurological organisations cannot sustain further cuts without them having a devastating impact on vital services and supports for people with neurological conditions.  We call for a halt to funding cuts to disability organisations and for the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to renew the scheme for national voluntary organisations.</p></speech>

They will appreciate that two minutes will not allow me to go into all of this in any great depth.  I noted a number of points in the Irish Heart Foundation submission.  The Department of Public Health at the University of Oxford estimates that a 10% additional tax on sugar-sweetened drinks would reduce the number of obese adults by approximately 10,000.  I support the case and the point.  People will challenge it in discussion and debate.</p> <p>How do they do that and what methodology is employed?  It is a difficult thing to quantify.  The only supportive evidence for it was the information that suggests the public is sensitive to price.  In terms of winning the case, those of us who are open to making the argument need to have more information so that we can be of help.  It is not enough for us to be supportive in broad commentary.  It would be helpful if we had an idea of how the impacts were assessed.</p><p> Mr. Macey drew an important link between the additional drink tax and the flip side of the coin, that is, the subsidy.  We want people to think about subsidising fruit and vegetables in order to make them more affordable and attractive, and to encourage parents to explore the variety of good food options.  That is a welcome idea which I would endorse.  </p><p> The committee recently discussed the issue of the tobacco market.  I acknowledged on that last occasion that to the best of my knowledge there are no differences among the members of this committee, across all parties and none, in our intentions regarding the impact of the tobacco industry on the health of the citizenry.  Ms O'Meara referred to the appointment of a tobacco regulator with the purpose of curbing the excessive profits of the industry in Ireland and suggested that such an approach could yield up to &euro;65 million for the Exchequer.  I am interested in the details of her proposal.  We are given a figure of &euro;65 million but we need to be able to make an argument in support of it.  She also proposed an adjustment of the structure of the tobacco tax to ensure that when it is increased it benefits the Exchequer rather than the tobacco industry.  I ask her to explain how the tobacco tax has benefited the industry.</p><p> Her submission contained a staggering fact on tobacco smuggling which merits the attention of the media at large.  The submission claims that 87% of smuggled tobacco products come from the legal industry.  I am not challenging her to substantiate the claim because I am buying it straight off and I can only deduce that the tobacco industry is in some way complicit in utilising certain countries and markets in order to enter supply chains in Ireland, Europe and elsewhere via the back door.  That issue needs to be highlighted and addressed because it is a serious charge.  I do not doubt that it is the case.  The industry has a serious case to answer.</p><p> I apologise to other speakers that I cannot respond to all of their contributions.  I have made note of their points and questions and I thank them most sincerely for their time.  What they have given us in written format is very important and welcome.</p></speech>

I may get more than two minutes but I am aware that time is limited and I will not be able to cover all the areas they discussed.  I particularly empathise with the presentation by the Irish Heart Foundation and the Irish Cancer Society because I have personal and family experience in both of these areas of health.</p><p>  I draw attention to a thread that runs across the submissions, namely, that all the organisations want people to be able to remain in their own homes and communities.  That is critical for all the clients of the various organisations before us.  A number of issues arise, of which fuel poverty and medical cards are of particular importance.</p><p>  A shocking study on fuel poverty has been prepared under the direction Professor Goodman of Dublin Institute of Technology.  The study, which was peer reviewed and publicly funded, was launched last year by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte.  The research indicates that in excess of 1,281 winter deaths occur over summer deaths in Ireland.  That figure is one of the highest in Europe and is even higher than the rate in Scandinavian countries, which experience much colder winters than Ireland.  In the context of the cuts introduced since the Government came to power in the free fuel schemes, the reduction of the scheme from 32 weeks to 26 weeks and the cuts to the household benefits package for electricity and gas heating units, it is essential for these cuts to be reversed if people are to be able live in their own homes.  I hope this will be taken on board by the Government in the coming budget.</p><p>  I have referred on numerous occasions to the issue of medical cards and the fear that exists among sick, elderly and disabled people that they may lose their cards.  Medical cards are being reviewed in instances where they are not due for review.  A considerable number of elderly people who have valid cards which were assessed, approved and issued by the HSE with expiry dates up to 2020 are being subjected to review.  That practice must stop and I hope the Minister for Health will instruct the HSE to desist.</p><p>  In regard to the question of discretionary medical cards for persons with serious and ongoing illnesses, such as cancer and motor neuron disease, these people are not qualifying for cards.  That is something which will have to change and I hope the committee puts that argument strongly and clearly to the Government.</p></speech>

In regard to the comparison of home care packages with the fair deal scheme, we will face a serious problem in this country over the next 17 years as the number of people aged over 65 years increases from 500,000 to 900,000.  We need to start long-term planning for this demographic change.  I am not sure we are doing sufficient planning.</p> <p>Mr. Timmins talked about the fair deal scheme and the 7.5%.  Some 34,000 people have entered the fair deal scheme since 2009.  Some 12,000 of those have died and the total refund to the fair deal scheme has been only &euro;7.5 million in real terms, so the 5% or 7.5% will not make a huge difference in real terms.  It causes anxiety with families and is an issue I come across regularly when I am acting in my legal capacity.  I am not sure we are giving enough support to families in how to manage the problems they face or will face.  I am not necessarily talking about financial assistance.  We have tended to get the message out there that everything is State dependent.  I wonder if we need to be more proactive.  We have been very proactive on health issues such as smoking but we have done no education programme with the general public on how we can all make a contribution to elder care.  What is the view of the witnesses, who have made very good submissions here?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.641" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013092600007#F00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  My first question is for Mr. Chris Macey of the Irish Heart Foundation.  We are all aware of the obesity crisis in Ireland.  As he stated, 61% of adults are obese or overweight.  He believes the over-consumption of processed foods and sugar-sweetened drinks are the main contributors.  If tax on sugar-sweetened drinks were increased by 20%, he maintains it would generate &euro;60 million.  We charge the standard VAT rate of 23% for the unhealthy food.  What is the best way to spend this money to combat obesity and overweight?  I am working on the committee's report on obesity, which we will present to the D&aacute;il in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>  My second question is to Ms Kathleen O'Meara of the Irish Cancer Society.  I do not smoke, and the main reason is because of my father.  I lived at home for 25 years and all I can remember of my father is the constant cough every morning.  I agree that smoking-related illness costs an estimated &euro;2 billion per year and the tax revenue from that industry does not meet the care of these people.  My main concern is the damage cancer can do.  How can we stop young people and pregnant women from smoking?  What suggestions does Ms O'Meara have if finance were made available to combat the effects of tobacco addiction?</p></speech>

I agree with my colleagues that the presentations were very clear.  Deputy Healy picked up the point on community care.  It is a strand that runs through all, as does the concept of rights and not charity.  The fair deal scheme, respite care, the carer's allowance and even the policy decision Mr. Dunne talked about in Kilkenny all come together.  When we try to raise these issues, for example about the fact that people are being pushed from community care into the system, we are told that is only a one-off, anecdotal case.  All the budget submissions here are saying the same thing.  Can the witnesses provide the evidence that this is systematic and not accidental or one-off?  That would be really useful.  It is very welcome to see some revenue generating measures being promoted but we all know that cost-wise it makes no sense, and it also goes against the individual's right to be cared for in their own community and home.  If that is what they choose we should support that decision.</p></speech>

After last year's committee there was a witch hunt in the HSE for three days, and the case I referred to of somebody who was being put to bed at 3:00 p.m. was addressed.  I specifically did not give the details because that was not the point.  I wanted to highlight a different issue, which is that within the labour and management systems this is the sort of dysfunction that happens.  We regularly meet Ministers and senior officials.  We give them cases; they say it is shocking; the case is reversed.  We are wasting so much time and effort within the Oireachtas system doing that sort of nonsense.  We do not have the resources or the access to the information, so all we can offer is anecdotal evidence.  As legislators if the members are hearing a very diverse group of organisations coming in with the same message, that points at something needing to happen.</p><p>  On Senator Colm Burke's questions about the community-based approach, there are increasing efforts to develop volunteer initiatives but there is a limit to how appropriate they are within the system.  I refer to the age-friendly counties initiative as a positive initiative.  It is outside the health area and that is a conscious point around ageing and dependency.  Within the HSE the social care agenda is being squeezed out by everything else.  It is due to pressure on resources.  I am not trying to malign any individual.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Timmins" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013092600007#F00500"><p>I agree with Senator Colm Burke's point.  With an ageing population, the State needs to prepare in terms of pension and health care.  Families need to prepare.  We all need to prepare.  We will all grow old if we are lucky, and the decisions we are making now about where and how we live will have an impact.  Communities also need to prepare.  We run a program called care and repair.  We will have a major conference tomorrow in Croke Park to examine the future of that program and how we can continue to fund it, because our sponsorship is running out.  We will also examine the community groups who are working with us to see how we can grow it on the ground.  This is a programme where volunteers come in to do small DIY and visitation.  Many of the people we deal with are not receiving social care but might need the grass cut or a light bulb changed.  They are the vulnerable side of older people who are hugely affected by emigration.  Many of their families would have done these jobs.  We have seen a marked rise.  We need funding for that, whether it is from the corporate sector, the State or both.  They are the kind of programmes we need to examine.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Healy on fuel poverty.  Fuel poverty is affected by a person's income, fuel prices and insulation.  Two of those three issues have been markedly hit by the State.  People's incomes and income supports are falling, while the price of energy, over which the State has no control, is soaring.  This issue must be addressed and there is huge dependence on the State to address that.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, has a fuel poverty strategy in place and there is a home insulation programme working.  We need more funding to go into that.  If I am freezing this winter there is no point in knowing there is a home insulation programme which will get to me at some stage.  That will not keep me warm.  We need more money to go into the scheme so that more homes can be insulated.</p></speech>

I agree that we need that evidence base.  On neurological conditions, one of the key indices we could have is the direct knock-on impact on acute hospital services of the lack of community services for people with neurological conditions.  A report came out in the UK last week which identified the number of unscheduled care admissions of people with neurological conditions to acute hospitals as one of the clearest indices of the lack of community services for people with neurological conditions.  The report showed that the number of emergency admissions for people with neurological conditions is very high and that is a direct reflection of the lack of community based supports.  We need to collate that information.</p></speech>

People want to live in the community and it is more cost-effective for a number of reasons.  If people wanted, and it was more cost-effective, to live in institutions we would all live in them.  Why are we asking to make a different rule for people with disabilities or others who have, very often, been forced into dependency by the system?  I am not disabled because I choose to be.  That is my condition.  It presents an extra few barriers a lot of the time.</p> <p>I do not want anybody fencing me in.  I want somebody to help me over the barriers.  That is all we all want and, therefore, that is the evidence.  I am reminded of the "why do they not commit suicide?" approach.  One has to pick that up right now.  Members may recall a famous politician who said that because he could not see the warning lights or he did not want to see them.  We are wasting good money on doing bad things.  It does not matter what evidence we bring to the committee.  Members are the people in power.  How many times do we have tell them?  How many different ways do we have to dress it up?  This is their society.  Members are the protectors of the taxpayer's money.  The deaf soldiers, the Magdalen laundries and other abuse survivors have nothing compared to what we have coming.  We will have an extra court after next week.</p></speech>

This is generally recognised to be the most comprehensive study of its kind to have ever been carried out in Ireland.  Data on purchasing activity was used to assess the impact on consumption and then nutritional data was used to assess the impact that would have on reducing weight.  Clearly, it is an estimate and the only way we will ever find out how effective this tax would be is to impose it.  The industry argues there is no evidence but the only evidence one can have is to bring it into effect.  The study also examined what has happened in other countries and it found that a tax below 10% raised revenue but did not affect behaviour whereas a tax of more than 10% affected behaviour and reduced obesity rates.  I can get a much more detailed answer on that to the Deputy if he wishes.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick asked how we can solve the obesity crisis.  There is no short answer to that but the first thing we have to do is make healthy food cheaper and unhealthy food more expensive.  We have a man who had a heart attack last year who said he used to eat fast food five times a week.  He has cut this down to three times a week because it is cheaper to get a pizza from a takeaway than to cook a pork chop and boiled potatoes for his family of an evening.  That is an issue.  The other factors are not necessarily about spending money.  We have to restrict the power of the multinational marketing industry.  Some of the best brains in the world are targeting children.  One estimate is that for every healthy food advertisement a child sees, he or she sees 99 unhealthy food and drinks advertisements.  People then comment on personal responsibility and ask why children and adults cannot see beyond all this marketing but it is impossible.  They are bombarded by it and there is no way out.</p><p>  The third factor is information.  Half our teenage girls have been on a diet, which is an incredible statistic.  That is terrible in its own way but they are not even allowed to see front of pack labelling that will show them the amount of calories they are taking in.  The State is protecting the multinational processed food industry from the public rather than the other way round.  That has to be wrong and we have to challenge that.  We are back before the committee asking for the same measures as last year.  Another year has gone by and nothing has been done.</p></speech>

With regard to a tobacco regulator, we have models of regulation in other sectors such as the energy, aviation and taxi regulators.  There is market failure in the tobacco market and there are excessive profits.  Three companies sell 90% of all legal products.  It must be recognised that there is market failure and excessive profits.  An office of tobacco regulation should be created, which would intervene, cap the price, take the excessive profit and give it to the State.  This is set out in great detail in our submission.  This basically amounts to an intervention by a regulator in a market that is failing to curb profits and return them to the Exchequer against a background of recognising that those excessive profits are generated by an industry, half of whose consumers die as a result of using the product.  From a public health perspective, that is the model we propose.</p><p>  With regard to tobacco tax increases, one must examine the tobacco tax structure, which is set out in graphics in our submission.  In 2010 the European Court of Justice ruled that minimum pricing was illegal.  We have minimum pricing here.  Since then there has been a trend of introducing lower end tobacco into the market at &euro;6 or &euro;7 a pack and then there is the high end of &euro;9 a packet or 32 cigarettes in a pack of Benson &amp;amp; Hedges for &euro;10.  In view of the current tobacco structure, the tobacco industry is allowed to make increases on premium cigarettes and well known brands while keeping low end cigarettes cheap.  We have a nice graphic on page 10 of our submission.  This means that the industry benefits as a result because the tax is levied on the volume of cigarettes sold and the <i>ad valorem</i> tax is levied on the price.  Companies are using that structure to increase their profits.  Cigarettes are cheap to produce and profits are high.  A small increase, therefore, will produce a major profit but it will not affect consumption.</p><p>  The Government introduces a small increase in the budget in response probably to lobbying by ourselves and so on.  Every year for the past ten years, the industry has also introduced a small increase, which means their profits have increased.  Consumers do not notice because all they hear is there has been a budget increase and at midnight the price of cigarettes will go up.  They might see a 10 cent or 15 cent increase on television but they do not realise they are paying 20 cent or 25 cent more.  The tax increase is absorbed and because it is not a high increase, consumption is not affected.  The WHO agrees with our argument that high increases will hit consumption.</p><p>  The smuggling figure of 87% comes from Revenue; it is not ours.  The example we quote is 3.1 billion packets of cigarettes were supplied to Andorra in a single year.</p> <p>That would be equivalent to every Andorran citizen smoking seven packets a day.  So many of these cigarettes ended up in Ireland.  I think members of the committee have got it in one.  I do not need to say anything more about that.</p><p> Regarding young people-----</p></speech>

We support what the Minister is considering regarding standardised packaging.  That would greatly protect young people from the marketing tactics of the tobacco industry.  We believe it would have a major impact.  The second thing is price.  We have carried out some focused research and the Irish Heart Foundation has done some focused-group research with young people.  They are particularly price sensitive.  I remind members that consumption has dropped in Ireland.  We are at just under 22%, down from 29% and price is certainly having an impact.  We urge members to back our proposal for a tax escalator of inflation plus 5%, which would be 60 cent this year.  I thank the Chairman for his indulgence.</p></speech>

In order to address the needs of carers, we have emphasised the restoration of the respite care grant to &euro;1,700, which we believe is essential.  I have personal knowledge of the impact of that in real cases and I do not need to be convinced.  I am somewhat concerned that I am arguing for slightly more than what is mentioned in the opening paragraph which states that all income supports for family carers must be protected at current levels.  I wonder about the language because after the significant reductions in recent years, that is not enough.  We all get beaten up by the barrage of where we are at and everything.  We almost succumb to the weight of guilt placed on us and that we cannot be looking for anything more - never mind what Mr. Naughton said earlier.  Is that the correct language to use?</p></speech>

I recently spoke to somebody who had addressed a meeting of GP and practice nurses and raised the issue about the importance of GPs giving advice to families on the obesity issue especially regarding young children.  The reaction from the audience was not positive.  Their attitude was that if GPs raise the issue in their surgeries they lose patients - entire families have left surgeries.  How should we deal with such reluctance by the front-line carers to raise the issue when there are clear signs of unhealthy eating and obesity in families?</p></speech>

For the past 12 months I have been working on obesity.  I have looked at reports for the past five, ten and 15 years.  Every approach was continually requested.  At this stage of the game something needs to be done to tackle obesity.  I will take into account what he said this morning and will send a copy of my report in two weeks.  I would be interested to hear what he thinks of it.</p></speech>

We have never previously called for a cut to be reversed, but we seek the restoration of the respite care grant or alternative ways of making it up.  We acknowledge that if the Government wants to be creative there are other possibilities.</p></speech>

The respite-care grant has had a huge impact on family carers, who are the forgotten heroes in Irish society.</p><p>  In response to an earlier comment from Senator Colm Burke, the national positive-aging strategy deals with how the State is preparing for an aging population.  In April, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, published a national positive-aging strategy.  It does not have an implementation plan yet, but we were told it would come within six months.  That six-month period expired yesterday.  We need to see the State start to implement a national positive-aging strategy and start to plan for an aging population.  We cannot continue to put our head in the sand; the issue will not go away.</p></speech>

It has been shown that GPs have a major role in areas such as this.  For example, when GPs get involved in smoking cessation, it has a major effect.  Obesity is similar and I would be concerned if health-care professionals on the front line do not feel it is something they can discuss.  There are sensitive issues here, but these are professional people who are well used to dealing with such sensitive issues.  I am somewhat surprised.  I will carry out some investigations and come back to the Senator on it.</p></speech>

Many people with disabilities are on permanent allowance etc.  Disability allowance in particular of the three major allowances there, is the lowest paid.  Yet they are not entitled to go on the unemployment register so we are trapped.  If there is 200% employment in the country, we cannot get on to that employment register because we are locked into a kind of thing.  Of course if we manage to break through that, like some of us have, we are okay, but most people are trapped there - 105,000 at the moment.  They cannot get onto any of these schemes or anything like that.  In terms of housing, the 3% quota and all of those, they have cut in the first year alone the lowest people.</p><p>  I could go on forever talking about the cut in PA services, less housing and education.  The Deputy knows them all and could rehearse them all.  That does not mean the pain is less this year.  Actually the pain is greater this year because now depression has replaced hope in many of these families.</p><p>  If we talk about alcoholism, obesity, drugs, etc., they come about through the absence of education.  We have parents today who need much more support and time than ever before because they have no extended families to support them, educate them and bring them through.  I am talking about parents.  They do not realise it until it is too late and obesity has already set in.  They do not realise they have often been facilitating it.  The bottom line of that is that community does not care anymore.  Community is very much what the British introduced in the 1970s when they had community care but no care in the community.  That is the problem we have and we had better wake up.  It is all ahead of Deputy Regina Doherty.</p></speech>

Some members have left due to various commitments but I hope they will be back in due course.  This committee decided it is important to hear from the witnesses at these hearings rather than have external briefings, all organised in witnesses' own sectors and spheres.  Each group has three minutes.  I will be strict on time because we want to engage in questions and answers.</p><p>  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled, thereafter, only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice or long-standing rule of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against either a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Ms Angela Edghill from the Irish Hospice Foundation to make her contribution.</p></speech>

I feel I am preaching to the converted because, having met many of the members on a one-to-one basis, I noted they have read our full pre-budget submission.  In the interest of brevity, I will concentrate on three issues that we refer to in the submission.  The first is the specialist palliative care budget, &euro;72 million for 2013.  That sum pays for home care nurses in each of the 26 counties and nine hospices throughout the country.  We know there are three areas in the country that do not have a hospice.  This is a vital service because the mortality rate will remain 100%.  The needs of people are increasing and the budget has decreased by 14% over the past five years, and by 3% in each of the past two years.  Despite that, the hospices and home care teams have managed to increase their services.  We are the perfect pupil doing what the Government says, namely, doing more with less.  Everybody present today will see we deal with the most vulnerable people in society but they should note death is a uniquely vulnerable and lonely experience for most people.<br /><font color="#0000FF">  </font>The hospices do an amazing amount of work.  We are not asking for an increase in the budget but that the budget be maintained.  The chairperson of the voluntary hospices CEO group said it has trimmed away every item of excess expenditure it could find.  It has cut to the bone and managed not only to maintain services but also to increase them.  If the budget is cut again this year, the services will be fragmented and suffer.  Everybody says that but it is true in this case.</p><p>  Around the country, the voluntary and community sector supports the hospice services.  In Waterford, for instance, the Waterford Hospice Movement pays &euro;400,000 per year to support the home care services.  The south east has no inpatient unit.  This cannot be sustained so it is very important that the service be maintained.  Members will have received my statement so they will know all the figures.</p><p>  Let me announce some good news on children's palliative care.  We now have the consultant in children's palliative medicine and the eight nurses my colleague spoke to the committee about last year.  Five of the nurses and a consultant are currently funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation through public subscription or fund-raising.  The public is providing the funding.  We would really like it if the HSE started to think about sustainable funding.</p><p>  We do not have hospices in three areas of the country.  There are unopened hospice beds provided by the voluntary sector in St. Francis in Blanchardstown and Marymount in Cork and we are delighted HSE says it will build the hospices in Waterford and Kerry.  We would like it to happen as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I represent an organisation that has 61 voluntary members.  It provides 80% of the services for intellectual disabilities across the country.  Most of the services have been founded by parents and families.  Most still have family and parents involved in their governance.  Effectively, we support nearly 22,000 people across the country.  I am the managing director of Sunbeam House Services, a Wicklow-based adult service providing supports for 360 people in the Wicklow area.  We provide 410 jobs and support 350 families with what they believe are very necessary and critical supports.</p><p>  Unfortunately, over recent years, the demand for our services has outstripped the supply.  We are constantly looking for ways to innovate but, over recent years, we have seen more than 17.5% taken from the budgets of the various organisations providing the supports.  It may not sound like a very big figure but when already operating on a not-for-profit basis, it becomes very difficult to sustain the cuts.  Up to 20 September, 831 school leavers have been provided with some level of support, but nothing like what they need.  Unfortunately, quite a number of them have very complex needs.  They probably need very significant supports but are not getting them.  They are now on a waiting list.</p><p>  We spent the past two years implementing the value-for-money report, considering the policy review and ensuring that the sector as a whole has made progress in that regard.  We can demonstrate very clearly that is what we have been doing.  We potentially face a considerable number of cuts this year.  If they occur, everybody, including Ms Angela Edghill, will say he or she deals with the most vulnerable people.  Organisations supporting affected people are now facing growing deficits that are very significant.  Services cannot continue where growing deficits occur.</p><p>  My organisation has had to implement very significant cuts regarding what we consider to be substantial services for 44 people.  We operate across an urban-rural divide and there is not very good rural transport, unfortunately, at this point.  Owing to the Haddington Road agreement and all the cuts imposed over the past 12 months, we now have to reduce that, which has an impact on the lives, jobs and finances of families.</p><p>  Next year, we know there will be at least another 800 school leavers affected.  This year, a sum of &euro;12 million was required to provide the relevant services.  Some &euro;4 million was provided, yet most of the affected individuals received some level of support.</p><p>  I am not here just to speak about the organisations as it is very important that cuts to DA, carer support and respite care be reconsidered, as advocated by other witnesses.  Increases are required because the cost of living among the people who are being supported has been very much eroded over the past five or six years.  The people of whom I speak are among the most vulnerable.  That is not a clich&eacute; but I acknowledge it is a statement that members will hear for the rest of the day.</p></speech>

Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, is the representative body of private home care providers throughout the country.  It employs roughly 6,000 staff and cares for approximately 8,500 clients.  It contributes approximately &euro;36 million to the economy each year.</p> <p>In putting together our budget submission we have been very cognisant of our current economic difficulties and the imperative to ensure our limited resources are put to best use; the historical overspend in the health budget, in particular, which has led in the past to cuts to front-line services rather than structural reform; and an increasingly ageing demographic profile which means any issues or difficulties we now face will only be magnified in the years to come.</p><p> Our budget recommendations call on the Government to make better use of existing resources, which would incur no extra cost to the Exchequer, would follow the Government&rsquo;s stated policy of money following the patient and would enable older people to remain at home for as long as possible.  We make five principal proposals and I will focus on two recommendations in particular, which are immediately achievable and could deliver immediate savings to the Government in 2014.</p><p> In line with the Minister&rsquo;s often stated aim of getting the money to follow the patient, we question the wisdom of ring-fencing &euro;1 billion of the total &euro;1.4 billion budget for older people for residential care through the fair deal scheme.  We call on the Government to amalgamate the budgets to allocate funding in accordance with patient need and wishes, which could potentially save approximately &euro;69 million in 2014.  In an effort to ensure we provide the best quality care to the maximum number of older people we call on the Government to ensure all home care provision which falls outside that provided directly by the HSE is allocated or commissioned in an open and transparent manner, with quality being the key basis for approval.  This would entail stopping the use of section 39 funding for home care provision and instead redirecting those funds to the home care package scheme where we feel there is more accountability and transparency.  Several HSE reports have shown the gross inefficiencies of using section 39 funding for home care provision and redirection could potentially save a further &euro;48 million in 2014 alone.  I look forward to answering any questions in the question and answer session to follow.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that 22,000 people reside in a home from home with our members nationwide.  We provide in excess of 23,000 jobs in local communities throughout Ireland.  Having high quality residential care is an essential part of the continuum of care for older people.  Notwithstanding the point made by the previous speaker, rather than focus on only one area of care or state one service is better than another, we need to look at the continuum of care for older people to ensure the appropriate care is given at the appropriate time.</p><p>  The fair deal scheme has been very successful from the point of view of older people themselves.  As the former Minister stated, it is affordable, accessible and anxiety-free.  However significant issues arise which must be addressed.  With regard to the upcoming budget we agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, who addressed the committee on 25 July and stated the scheme should remain ring-fenced and should follow the principles of money following the patient.  Under the fair deal scheme, a person chooses to apply for the scheme based on his or her medical and social care needs.  Those in nursing home care now are much more highly dependent and have much more complex care needs, which means there is a requirement for the scheme to remain protected on this basis.</p><p>  An issue for our society with its ageing population is how we develop and fund the range of services we need for our ageing population.  Residential care is but one element of this.  One of our concerns is the significant pressure with regard to public units complying with physical environment and HIQA standards, but there has been little development.  Our members will also be under some pressure in this regard.  Given our ageing population there is a requirement on us, and committee members as policymakers, to examine how we will develop a range of services for older people.</p><p>  In our pre-budget submission, we state the narrow definition of goods and services under the fair deal scheme should be reviewed.  The definition of long-term residential care services includes bed and board, basic aids and appliances and nursing care, but does not consider the holistic care needs of the resident.  Items such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and activities are excluded from the scheme, and from our point of view this beggars belief.  We strongly argue the scheme should remain ring-fenced and should be adequately resourced to deal with waiting lists.  On 9 July, the Minister told the committee that 777 people had been assessed as requiring nursing home care but were awaiting funding.  We could speak about statistics all day, such as the number of delayed discharges.</p><p>  Our submission includes proposals on developing new services in the immediate term.  Our key point is on how we should work in partnership.  It should not be about public versus private versus voluntary but about ensuring our society has the appropriate services for older people.  We strongly argue there should be a forum on long-term residential care involving all players to ensure we address the growing needs of our older population.</p></speech>

Mental Health Reform is a national coalition of 39 non-governmental organisations promoting improved mental health services and implementation of the Government&rsquo;s mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  I wish to share some of the concerns expressed to us in public meetings this year.</p><p>  Shortfalls in staffing still have a negative impact on people seeking support.  One person was on a list to see a psychologist but lost access because the psychologist went on maternity leave and was not replaced.  Another person told us that because there are not enough professionals to provide support, people on a waiting list are seen by a student trainee.  We also know that waiting times for child and adolescent mental health services had increased at the end of 2012 and were 17% higher than in 2011.  At our public meetings, people told us of their difficulty accessing services when they are in a crisis, resulting in long waits in accident and emergency units, which are inappropriate and stressful places for someone in mental and emotional distress.</p><p>  As committee members know, central to the Vision for Change policy is the development of holistic, multidisciplinary, community-based services.  We welcomed the commitment in the previous two budgets to invest &euro;35 million in community mental health services, including a commitment to appoint 891 staff in total between 2012 and 2013.  However, there continues to be a challenge in translating this commitment into reality.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, reported in a Topical Issues debate on 19 September that a total of 803 of these posts were at some stage in the recruitment process, with almost 400 of last year&rsquo;s posts either filled or awaiting clearance and 220 of this year&rsquo;s posts having been accepted.  However, the HSE's staffing report for the end of July showed a net increase of just 192 posts, which represents an increase of approximately 2% in staffing.  We are concerned the pressure on the HSE to lose 2,400 whole-time equivalents throughout the health service is undermining efforts to resource mental health services as the Government intended.  Our recommendation to the Government ahead of the budget for 2014 is that the &euro;35 million be allocated for community mental health services as promised in the programme for Government.</p><p>  This year, as we did last year, we highlight the need for a national information system for mental health services.  Under HSE structures, it is not possible to tell how many mental health service users await psychological therapies, how many have an individual care and recovery plan, how many service users are satisfied with the service or how many are using community-based services.  We call for an allocation towards this in 2014 and that the Department of Health ensures the new director for mental health, Mr. Stephen Mulvany, makes real progress in 2014.</p><p>  Mental Health Reform recognises the Government faces difficult choices in this year's budget to maintain control over the country&rsquo;s finances.  The recommendations we make in our pre-budget submission are based on cost-effective solutions which would help Government services for people with a mental health condition be more efficient and, at the same time, fulfil the Government&rsquo;s policy commitments on mental health.</p></speech>

In our budget submission, we wish to highlight the negative effects of the economic downturn on the health service as well as the opportunities the recession can create to improve health and health care.  Our submission covers four main areas that I will try to go through as briefly as possible.</p><p>  Regarding health system reform and investment in health services, a recession offers opportunity for reform and the Government is embarking on a major reorganisation of our health services in order that the majority of an individual's health care needs are met in primary care.  Since 2009, however, Government expenditure has decreased by 10% and there are 11,000 fewer people employed in the health service.  While some efficiencies have been made, there have been signs in the past year or so that the health system is under significant financial strain.</p><p>  In terms of hospital services, the IMO recommends that capital funding be provided to support the proposed reconfiguration.  Under the principle of money following the patient, the Government must ensure adequate financial and human resources are provided.  To ensure primary care patients are treated in the appropriate setting, money must follow the patient out of secondary care and into primary care.  Chronic disease management and prevention must be adequately costed and resources must be forthcoming from this important programme.  The Government must also ensure adequate investment in facilities and resources to support primary care teams.</p><p>  The IMO is concerned about growing health inequalities and inequalities in access to care due to the recession.  It is important that budgetary measures do not widen these gaps further.</p><p>  The IMO welcomes the publication of "Healthy Ireland" and is calling for the development of a detailed implementation plan.  We emphasise the importance of a health impact assessment.  All public policy, including budgetary measures, should be subject to health impact assessments.</p><p>  Regarding access to care, there should be no further increases in out-of-pocket payments for all public patients.  The Government must identify and prioritise resources for universal access to primary care.</p><p>  The third pillar in our submission regards suicide prevention.  There is a link between recession and suicide.  There is a need, therefore, to ensure adequate resources are available for a suicide prevention programme.  We recommend the full implementation of the recommendations outlined in Reach Out, the national strategy for suicide prevention.  We also call for the availability of suicide intervention teams in all hospitals on a 24 hour, seven day per week basis, and for the piloting of community-based, 24-hour crisis mental health care provision throughout Ireland.</p><p>  Our submission's final pillar of minimum alcohol pricing is fitting, given the day that is in it.  Despite an increase in excise duties last year, alcohol remains cheap to purchase relative to the societal costs of the problem.  There is room to introduce a minimum alcohol pricing structure to reduce the burden of excessive alcohol consumption.  There is evidence from Scotland, which is pressing ahead with minimum pricing, that difficulties arising from EU competition law do not apply to this issue.  The IMO calls on the Department of Health to continue working with counterparts in Northern Ireland and Scotland on introducing a minimum price structure for alcohol, based on grams of alcohol as opposed to units.  We also published a paper recently on young people and alcohol that we would be happy to distribute to the committee.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Sadlier.  As we have concluded our presentations, I express my hope that this day does not become a festival of alcohol consumption.  I regret, and I hope that many of those present agree with me, that this supposed celebration of Arthur's Day is wrong.  It sends the wrong message.  Perhaps the committee should consider the issue again, given the vested interests of the alcohol industry.  I do not mean to take over the meeting, but it is a sad day when a drinks company can manipulate a market of young people in particular on the basis of celebrating culture and music.</p><p>  I call Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, who may be able to join the coalition of two minutes plus two minutes again.</p></speech>

He most certainly speaks for me.  I have no doubt he is echoing the views of everyone present.</p><p>  I ask for the Chairman's patience, as we have agreed to raise a couple of additional items in the course of this engagement.  I will not be abusive of the time.  I will not be able to direct questions to each of our guests, so I thank them all for their oral and written contributions.</p><p>  I wish to ask about the most distressing of all situations, which Ms Edghill referenced, namely, palliative care for children.  The Irish Hospice Foundation highlighted a recommendation.  What can the system do to improve?  Ms Edghill told us about the advances made in the past year, but that was done at the foundation's cost and through the generosity of the citizenry.  The foundation highlighted a reasonable proposition in the second of its two recommendations under the heading of children's palliative care, namely, to facilitate staff releases for training and the progressive roll-out of children's palliative care education and training programmes.  Will Ms Edghill expand on that recommendation?</p></speech>

The Chairman will ask Ms Edghill to respond later.  What is the current system?  I understand how stretched front-line service staff are within the HSE system, but is there any facilitation currently?  To what extent is the need?  Let us all join the foundation in trying to have that particular matter addressed.  It is a common-sense measure that needs to be done appropriately and adequately.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. Hannigan's affirmation of the need, not only to restore, but also to improve support for carers.  I appreciate his remarks that reflected on the committee's engagement with the previous panel.</p><p>  The submission from Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, contains two points that might merit expansion.  Both are interesting.  I endorse the first, namely, incentivising people to take on work in the home care sector.  Unquestionably, this is important.  There may be a range of measures involved, not only monetary.  Where that need presents, people are really challenged.  They are challenged by what they want to do as well as all the other factors that make more difficult the obstacles that can present.  This relates to the HCCI's third recommendation.</p><p>  It is also necessary to consider the entire issue.  Sometimes, we can say societally that people are able to provide for themselves, but this is not always the case.  There can be false notions of people who have lived through particular income streams.  I am referring specifically to recommendation No. 5 on the extension of the definition under IT47 so as to include for tax relief entitlements the provision of these supports for those who may, on the face of it, appear to be in a position to provide for themselves.  This may not always be the case.  Mr. Harty instanced cases of people who were being forced to consider residential institutions for care.  Will he expand on that point?</p><p>  I apologise to Mr. Daly and Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI, as I am not able to focus on specifics.  Our overall experience, and my experience personally, is that the overwhelming number of nursing home providers in the private and voluntary sectors are providing an excellent service.  We would be lost without them.  There tends to be a focus on specific reports that can have a challenging impact on many of those who are adhering to the highest standards.  It is only fair that a balance be struck.</p><p>  Regarding mental health reform, I wish to ask Dr. McDaid about two points.</p></speech>

The Chairman will be pleased to know that the cross-party group on mental health launched our pre-budget submission, the second that we have had, in the past week.  We fell down last year, but we made one the year before.  We are back in business and have been able to strike a concord across all of the political views in these Houses.  We have reflected on the &euro;35 million allocation.  It must be spent in its entirety, for its purpose and within the current year.  It is a continuum and is provided in respect of needs in 2014 and ongoing.</p><p>  I have only one question arising from this point.</p> <p>I note the opening commentary reflects that the inspector of mental health services is pointing again to the need for a national programme of reform, driven by the director designate of mental health services.  We have addressed the matter before and I have no specific issue with the individual, whom I know and have met in his previous work life within the HSE.  In his presence I nevertheless raised concerns regarding the appointment and the process.  What is the position of Mental Health Reform Ireland and is there any indication that what the inspector of mental health services has argued for is under way?</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Sadlier for his contribution.  We are very concerned, as a committee, about two critical areas, and only one has been reflected in the presentation this morning.  That is the impact on GP practices and primary care of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  There has been a significant reduction in the money directed to GP services and the IMO has referred to a reduction in overheads and staffing costs.  It has also mentioned the impact on phlebotomy services, warfarin and blood pressure monitoring.  I know from engagement with GP services that there is also an impact on ancillary services that have been brought together in a collective centre of doctors.  The witnesses mentioned specialist nursing provision and there are other elements.  The consequence of the impact is displacing people from primary care into accident and emergency hospital scenarios, which already cannot cope with the load.  I ask the IMO to take the opportunity to elaborate on the impact as it is a concern.</p><p>  What is the position of the junior hospital doctors and the ongoing engagement over the threatened industrial action?  How will that manifest itself and will the witnesses give an update on that issue?  There is a shared concern in that regard.</p></speech>

I will address my questions to Ms Angela Edghill of the Irish Hospice Foundation.  I am afraid of dying so having the group here is interesting; we cannot choose when we are born but all must die so it is a major part of our living lives, particularly if we can die well.  The submission concerned holding on to the &euro;72 million already available to the organisation but can the witness tell me two major negatives that will arise if the &euro;72 million is not maintained?  She spoke about voluntary community service amounting to &euro;400,000 and unopened beds.</p></speech>

I will not address questions to everybody as we could be here all day, as Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in noted, because the topics are so interesting.  I thank everybody for their presentations and we will take them all on board.</p><p>  Ms Edghill and the Irish Hospice Foundation do fantastic work and it is incumbent on us as a committee to try to ensure, in whatever way we can, that the &euro;72 million is ring-fenced and untouched.  We must also ensure there is a transition path from the voluntary funding servicing child palliative care services to sustainable funding, and each of us must take that on board.</p><p>  I have specific questions for Mr. Harty and Mr. Daly.  Although a "battle" may not be the right word, there is a struggle going on with regard to the care of more mature elderly people and those who suffer from disabilities.  The merits of what is offered by the witnesses' organisations are unquestionable and second to none but if there was an amalgamation of budgets, could they describe how it could look?  The organisations are competing for the right reasons, and there are good services offered that we need, although the vast majority of families would prefer to keep mothers, fathers, nannies and grandads at home for as long as possible.  The two elements should not compete but rather be working in harmony.  How would best practice look in an amalgamated world?</p></speech>

What is the current position of doctors, not only junior doctors but also general practitioners?  I have heard of a number of cases where a GP who is not a partner in a practice is having hours cut, with days employed reducing from five to two or three.  As a result these doctors are giving notice and emigrating.  Has the IMO come across such events on a large scale?</p><p>  With regard to junior doctors in hospitals, we are educating quite a large number of people through the university system every year, turning out over 600 people, with a cost of &euro;90 million per annum.  We have done nothing to keep them in Ireland.  Even if we agree to take on many more junior doctors in the hospital system, would the numbers be there to be employed?  What do we need to do to keep such people in the country?</p><p>  With regard to the hospice budget, the Marymount Hospice's number of beds is increasing from 24 to 44, with 36 extra staff to be employed.  If the budget is to stay the same, somewhere will suffer.  The employment of extra staff will absorb a share of the &euro;72 million, along with the beds, although it is great to see the increase in Marymount and I welcome it.  Nevertheless, the last thing we need to hear is that somewhere else will suffer.  What additional funding is required to ensure nobody else suffers?</p><p>  I have a further point relating to home care.  Could we offer a tax package - as we have done in other areas - where the first &euro;15,000 earned in providing home care assistance would be tax-exempt?  Would that be of benefit in getting more people into assisting in the area?</p></speech>

With regard to the Irish Hospice Foundation and children's palliative care, I was at a launch a few years ago and the HSE was very positive about how it would make the process sustainable.  Will Ms Edghill clarify when the wheels came off that commitment?  I thought sustainability was on track so where is the gap in funding?  The public has supported these essential nurses through the Irish Hospice Foundation but where is the gap?</p><p>  With regard to the National Federation of Voluntary Bodies, there was mention of school-leavers and I have not been aware of that issue.  Why are these people falling into limbo on leaving school and how long does that limbo last?  With regard to nursing homes and the continuum of care in the home, there was mention of becoming "anxiety-free".  In the previous session we heard that the system is being structured to push people into a system with schemes and support, rather than necessarily allowing a person to be cared for in their home.  I welcome any thoughts on how to achieve a continuum of care, although it is not a competing model.  We should be considering the person and individual, and where they can be best cared for.</p><p>  I am concerned about the &euro;70 million promised with regard to Mental Health Reform Ireland.  The IMO raised the alcohol issue and I fully endorse the comments.  Any time the matter is discussed in these Houses, it should be done as a public health issue and it should not be dealt with by other committees.</p> <p>For me it is a public health issue.</p></speech>

The presentations were excellent.  Each witness made a good case for their budget and I wish them the best in the future.</p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, is a firm believer in the policy that money follows the patient.  I fully support that.  As Deputy Regina Doherty said, it is important that older people stay at home for as long as possible.  My question is for Nursing Homes Ireland, NHI.  Representatives from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, appeared before the committee a couple of weeks ago.  It is currently organising regulations and inspectors for nursing homes.  I was very impressed.  They realise a nursing home is a different situation because for the people in a nursing home the nursing home is their home, and it is important that they are looked after and that everything is done correctly.  There are currently 22,000 people in nursing homes under the fair deal nursing home system.  Are there any vacancies at present?   People are always looking for vacancies but they cannot seem to find a place.</p><p>  Second, I understand there are 23,000 staff employed directly in nursing homes.  However, every time I visit a nursing home there are always different staff.  Is there a problem retaining staff?  People get used to certain staff caring for them but then they disappear.  Is there a big turnover of staff? </p></speech>

There are about 18 minutes left.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.701" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Matthew Sadlier" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013092600014#O00400"><p>I will be as brief as possible.  There were three basic issues so I will compact my replies rather than address them individually.</p><p>  Regarding the question on primary care, since 2008 and FEMPI there are over 0.5 million extra GMS patients with medical cards than there were previously.  General practitioner income has dropped by 23% under FEMPI.  What we wish to emphasise is that GP income is not a personal income for the general practitioner.  They are a sole practitioner running an infrastructure with overheads and premises.  The difficulty is that, since I qualified ten years ago, we are in an era where patients have a higher level of expectation of chronic disease management and health screening, rather than the concept that one waits until one has a problem before first going to see the doctor.  General practitioners are finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet and to be able to provide proper chronic health screening and proper management for chronic illnesses.  This is leading to services having to fall by the wayside if one cannot economically maintain them.  As part of my presidency, we conducted a tour of the country and met practitioners in the different areas.  They say they are obliged to let their primary care nurse or their practice nurse go or use the receptionist or drop the ability of the services they can provide to the community.</p><p>  Second, there were two questions regarding the junior hospital doctors or the NCHDs.  It is a very frustrating situation.  I was a junior doctor or NCHD in Ireland for 13 years and during every one of those years the issue of hours was discussed.  The fact that the NCHDs in Ireland, as a group of workers, had to resort to industrial action to have the legislation which was passed by the Oireachtas implemented for them is just bizarre in any shape or form.  Yes, there is an ongoing process.  I understand they are before the Labour Court today.  The planned industrial action for yesterday was suspended.  It is an ongoing process and talks are ongoing, so I cannot say any more than that.  </p><p>  Recruitment and retention is another significant issue.  For one year post graduation medical graduates must remain as interns and the Medical Council said last year that less than 50% of interns had maintained their registration within Ireland after internship.  The Irish health service has always depended on junior doctors or NCHDs to provide a vast amount of services.  Since before I graduated we have campaigned to increase the number of specialists in the country so there can be a consultant provided service.</p></speech>

On pay issues, Ireland is now the lowest paying country in the English speaking medical world, which is where we compete for doctors.  Ultimately, doctors do not choose whether to work in Ireland or Finland but whether to work in Ireland or the UK, Canada or Australia.  Of those areas, at specialist levels we are significantly lower paid than is the case in the UK and this has been a huge problem in recruiting from overseas.  If one is coming from a very long distance away, one does not necessarily see a huge difference between a small town in Ireland and a small town in England.</p><p>  The last question was about alcohol.  We have published our paper on alcohol.  I will conclude with that.</p></speech>

As of today, more than 17,000 people in Ireland have signed a petition supporting investment in mental health services, which is an indication that there is widespread recognition of the need for support.  In addition, people want to have good quality mental health services available.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the director for mental health.  We have consistently advocated for the appointment of a director for mental health and we are pleased to see somebody taking up that role.  We have met with him and are impressed with his commitment to continue the reform agenda.  However, we are concerned.  Anybody in that role must have control of the budget, adequate resourcing and an information system that can enable them to manage the system effectively.  It is very difficult for somebody in that role at present to be able to manage effectively when they do not know how many people use the services, how many staff there are in the services and where they are, and what the waiting lists are for adult mental health services.  We have none of that information, so that is a real priority.</p><p>  We also seek an implementation plan that would assist with transparency.  We used to have an independent monitoring group for the mental health policy, A Vision for Change.  There is no longer an independent monitoring group and no annual report to tell us how well the HSE and other Departments are doing on delivering the policy.  The child and adolescent mental health services already have an annual report and it would be helpful to have something similar for the other mental health services and the policy as a whole.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tadhg Daly" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013092600014#O00800"><p>To refer to the points raised by Deputies Doherty and Fitzpatrick, they will note from the submission that I spoke of that concept of a continuum of care.  It is important to realise that 4.6% of the population over 65 years, a relatively small number given the total, reside in long-term residential care.  Over 65 years is something of a misnomer.  In fact, if one visits any nursing home, one will mainly see people who are over 80 and 85 years because of the dependency and the complexity of care.</p><p>  With regard to the debate about home care versus nursing home care, I do not see it that way.  What we need is to have that continuum to ensure that at a particular point in a person's life the appropriate services are available for them.  The Deputies are not comparing like with like.  Senator van Turnhout mentioned the concept of people being directed towards residential care.  That is a myth.  People are medically assessed by a multidisciplinary team before they are approved for nursing home care.  In fact, I draw the committee's attention to the report of the Ombudsman yesterday.  One of the cases she took up was that of an applicant who was refused support under the nursing home support scheme even though the medical team had directed that the person was more suitable for nursing home care.  It is not a case of either-or and, in my book, it should not be.  My mother is 83 years of age and is living happily on her own in west Cork, and when my time comes I would like to live in my own home as well.  However, when the time comes that one is unable to maintain oneself in one's own home because of the dependency or complexity, it is important to have the high standard, high quality nursing home care that is required.</p><p>  On 9 July the Minister, before this committee, mentioned the fact that, at that time, 777 people had been assessed as requiring nursing home care but were not in a position to access it because the funding is not available.  Add to that the figure for August of 693 people in delayed discharges in hospitals.  If they could be maintained in their own homes, they would be discharged to them.</p> <p>The vast majority of those are people with complex needs so they need nursing home care.</p><p> The fair deal scheme is under review and we have proposed in our submission to the review that there should be a parallel scheme for home care mirroring the fair deal scheme.  Our fear is that, if the fund is amalgamated, it will remain at its current financial amount and more people will draw from it.  This would create more problems in terms of people trying to access appropriate funding.</p><p> With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's point about vacancies, the HSE's service plan for 2013 alludes to the undersupply of residential care beds in north Dublin and other urban areas.  It is difficult to get a nursing home in some areas.  Our fear is that, if we do not act now to develop appropriate services for the older population, it will get worse.</p><p> With regard to staffing, Dr. Sadlier referred to recruitment and retention.  It is very important for the nursing home sector.  We must engage with stakeholders in what we term workforce planning to ensure we have the appropriate skills for residential and community care.  As an organisation, we are active in continuous professional development and training of staff in order that they can upskill and have a career path within a nursing home.  Someone who is a carer today may decide to become a nurse in five or six years time and become one of the people in charge.  There are more opportunities in the private sector for people to develop their career paths.</p></speech>

I wish to address the two points made by Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in concerning carers.  One of the most difficult jobs is the job of the carer.  It takes a special kind of person to take it on.  One of the advantages of the recession is that there are currently more carers available than were available at the height of the Celtic tiger.  As the economy improves, that will not be the case.  We must also take into account the fact that demand and resources will increase all the time.  One of the major issues is the question of sourcing quality carers.  We must move towards a situation where caring is looked on as a career rather than as job.  In the short term, we find ourselves competing with the social welfare system for people who want to take on work.  Initially, we cannot offer them enough hours and they are not willing to forgo social welfare payments.  That must be examined.</p><p>  With regard to the extension of the IT47 definition, it does not make any sense to have barriers in front of people in respect of their care choice.  Not extending the definition and not allowing tax relief is pushing people towards residential care or other care that they do not necessarily want.</p><p>  I will reply to Deputy Regina Doherty and Senator van Turnhout together.  I agree with Mr. Tadhg Daly that it is not a battle between our two sectors.  There is a place for residential care and a place for home care.  We must be careful about creating an artificial demand through the placing of budgets in silos, so to speak.  A little over a year ago, the Minister gave figures of 29% of people in residential care being deemed low dependency and 16% medium dependency.  Clinically, 30% of people could be looked after at home and their preference is for this.</p><p>  One of my members told me about an interesting case recently.  It concerned a 93 year old woman who lived independently in the Wexford area.  She had to go into hospital for a procedure and the hospital told her that she would need care when she left.  They told her she had to apply for the fair deal scheme but she replied that she wanted to live at home and intended to apply for a home care package.  She applied for both schemes on the insistence of the hospital and was refused a home care package but received the fair deal scheme.  The woman is now living in a residential care home where she does not want to be and the cost to the State is &euro;1,000 per week when it could have been &euro;200 or &euro;300.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Fitzpatrick's point on regulation and staff, one of our major bugbears is that the home care sector is not regulated.  From our point of view, we should probably have regulated that sector before the nursing home sector.  The mere fact that the nursing home sector has people around means there is some control in place.  Some 95% of home care service is delivered one to one with vulnerable adults.</p></speech>

It is barmy.</p></speech>

The major savings for the health sector will be in community care moving up the acuity level and being able to look after more acute cases in the community.  In order to foster a cadre of professional providers in the community, we must let money follow the patient.</p></speech>

There are statutory provisions and protection for children up to the age of 18.  Once they hit 18 years of age, all of that falls away and all funding and support they receive at that point falls away.  There is a requirement to separate children and adult services and, as a result, there is constant negotiation between the HSE and providers of care to provide support for those individuals.  I support the idea of money following the individual.  That would ensure the continuum of care would be there for individuals.  The individuals we support are those who work across all elements of services here.  It is most important to try to keep people in the community as long as possible, which has been Government policy for quite a period.  We support that, but at this point it is more difficult to do that because the requirements are to ensure they are kept safe.  For statutory bodies, keeping them safe means keeping them in an institution.  There is clear evidence that it is cheaper for the State, better for the individual from the perspective of mental health and better from the primary health perspective to remain at home and to be supported at home.  As well as improving the carer's allowance and respite allowances for people living in their own homes, members must continue to advocate for that.</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about training.  As budgets are squeezed and staff are not replaced when on leave or ill, it becomes more difficult for services to release staff for training.  We appreciate that.  Children's palliative care is a particularly specialised area.  This is an ongoing problem.  The Irish Hospice Foundation provides much in-house training in hospitals.  We find staff are decent and will come in to do training when they are not rostered to come in or when they are on their day off.  We cannot rely on people to continue to do that and it is unfair on them when they are already under stress and working hard.</p> <p>It is an ongoing problem.  We appreciate that it is a budgetary problem too and that it costs more to release staff and to replace them while they are being trained.  It is an area we need to keep an eye on.  The difficulty is that staff are trained, for instance in communications.  In particular with children, a lot of it would be about working not only with the child but with the family.  A lot of work needs to go into that.  If it is not constantly regenerated, all that learning is lost if those staff move on to a different area or leave.  It is an ongoing difficulty.  I am sorry I cannot be more specific.  We are not the direct service provider but I could happily get the committee to talk to one of the children's outreach nurses who would be able to explain the situation a little better.</p><p> Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell asked me what would happen if the budget is reduced any further.  What would happen first is that the voluntary sector would try to fill the gap, as it always does, but that would become more and more difficult.  In the event that it is now cut to the bone &ndash; and it is &ndash; in various areas of the country, for instance in Waterford they are paying &euro;400,000 a year towards their home care team.  In Kerry the voluntary hospice sector is paying nothing because the HSE fills the gap.  The picture is different all around the country.</p><p> Palliative care is a relatively new specialty in Ireland and hospices are relatively new here in their current form.  The whole situation is a little fragmented and a bit underdeveloped.  It will become more so.  There may well be waiting lists.  Referrals to palliative care come at the very end of life.  Often, one does not have a month, two months or three months to think about a waiting list.  That may happen.  This is conjecture but what we envisage is that the situation will become more fragmented and it will also stifle development.  As an organisation, the Irish Hospice Foundation itself invests more than &euro;5.7 million a year into development.  A lot of the development is in partnership with people in the HSE and voluntary hospices.  They will not always have the resources to give us that back if they do not have the money because they will not have the staff.  It is a bit more than two.</p><p> Senator Burke asked what would happen if Marymount gets all it is supposed to get.  That was in the 2013 HSE south service plan so we hope that will not come out of 2014 and that the money will be ring-fenced.  It is a bit like that.  We are constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul.  There is already inequity around the country and it would be very unfair if it did not happen.</p><p> Senator van Turnhout inquired about sustainable funding and where is the gap.  There are ongoing discussions with the HSE.  We are fearful that the budget might be reduced further.  That said, people constantly step up to the plate.  All of the organisations would say that.  The voluntary sector constantly steps up but there will come a stage where one just cannot step up any further.</p></speech>

The reality, as pointed out by Mr. Naughton at the previous hearing, is that it assumes that people are working and can benefit from it.  The large proportion of people in those care situations would not benefit because they are probably not working or there would be a marginal benefit because they might only have a pension which would not be at a sizeable level.  While tax exemption might be helpful it might not be supportive of what is required.</p></speech>

I welcome representatives from the Children's Rights Alliance and the National Youth Council of Ireland to our meeting.  I thank them for the work they undertake on behalf of all of us and for both their oral presentation and the written submission they made to us.</p><p>  I remind people that their mobile telephones should be turned off and not left on airplane mode as they interfere with the recording of the proceedings and with the quality of the sound, and our staff should not have to put up with that.</p><p>  As was the case in the two previous sessions I ask witnesses to remain within the time remit of three minutes each.  I hope we can have a good discussion similar to the two previous discussions.  I apologise for the absence of some of our members who had to attend other meetings.  Unfortunately, it is part of life in Leinster House that when we are at the end of a session members drift off to other events and I apologise for that.</p><p>  Regarding privilege, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair and parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I again welcome Ms Tanya Ward, Ms Saoirse Brady and Mr. James Doorley to our proceedings and I ask Ms Ward to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

We believe the committee's scrutiny of the budget is crucial.  It is playing a very important role in examining and reviewing children's services and budgetary decisions around children.  We welcome that the committee is taking the time to look at the budget.</p><p>  I am from the Children's Rights Alliance.  We unite over 100 organisations and our aim is to make Ireland one of the best places in the world to be a child but we are also a member of the End Child Poverty Coalition so this is an area that is very close to our hearts.</p><p>  Before giving members an overview of what we want to talk about today I will paint a picture of children in Ireland so that they can have a profile and understand what we are dealing with.  According to the census the number of children in the country is growing.  Since 2006 there has been a 13.4% increase in the number of children in Ireland.  That brings the number of children here to 1,148,687 and at the same time we are making serious cuts to child benefits.  Since 2009 we have made a cut of &euro;450 million to child income supplements while at the same time the number of children is growing.  There is a complete disconnect between the way we are making budgetary decisions and the needs of the people at large.</p><p>  Members will see from the presentation we have given them that we have included some statistics on the deprivation levels of families living here.  It is from the EU SILC survey.  They will see that in 2011 over 30% of families were living in deprivation.  There are 11 different indicators of deprivation but what that means is that in every second meal children might get to have a piece of chicken or other meat, they are wearing second-hand clothes, they do not get two new pairs of shoes each year and they do not have the opportunity to have a roast dinner every week.  Those are the kind of things people take for granted.  Over 30% of people here do not enjoy that in their everyday experience.  The number of children in families at risk of poverty increases to just 18%, therefore, nearly 20% of children in this country are at risk of poverty and over 9% of children are living in consistent poverty today.  Those statistics reflect the changing dynamics of the recession but we must keep them in mind when we are making decisions about budgetary cuts.</p><p>  In terms of the issues I want to talk about today, one is child benefit and the back to school allowance.  Our view is that child benefit is incredibly important as it is one of the only measures the State has to address child poverty.</p> <p>If one thinks about it, it is one of the only things one gets if one is a parent and is caring for a child.  It is the one thing that distinguishes one from a family that does not have children.  We are calling for no further cuts to child benefit.  We do not think families can afford and survive another cut.</p><p> We are also calling for the back-to-school allowance to be reinstated.  A &euro;50 cut was imposed last year, which is a significant amount of money for a family on low income.  It is a pair of cheap shoes, two pairs of socks and a vest.  That is what was taken from families last year.  The only real saving to the Exchequer was &euro;17 million, which is not a huge amount when one considers that almost 200,000 families benefit from the allowance.  We are calling for it to be reinstated, which we think will have a big impact on family life.</p><p> The other issue to which I wish to bring members' attention is the lack of investment in children's services.  The IMF and others say our welfare rates are very high compared to those in other countries.  However, one has to look at the amount of money we invest in children's services.  The cost of living in other countries is cheaper and it is cheaper to raise children because they invest in services for children.  They have free schoolbooks, highly subsidised child care and free health care for children.  We do not have these services.  Every cut the Government makes has a serious impact on the enjoyment of children's rights.  Much of the &euro;450 million cut from child benefit and income supplement over the past number of years has been lost to children and families and it has not been reinvested.</p><p> The last point I wish to raise concerns the new child and family agency.  A Bill is going through the Houses at the moment.  It is the biggest public sector reform that this Government will lead.  It will combine 4,000 people providing services for children.  The budget currently is approximately &euro;550 million.  We are calling on the Government not to reduce the budget of this agency.  Five hundred and fifty million euro is not a lot of money when one considers the number of children in this country.  We calculate that the budget breaks down to approximately &euro;479 per child.  If there was an effective service which was not crisis-driven and going from one crisis to another but which actually invested in early intervention and the prevention of abuse and neglect, it would be closer to the &euro;1,000 mark.  We call on the Government not to cut this budget but to increase it going forward.</p></speech>

The National Youth Council of Ireland is the representative body for 45 national voluntary youth organisations working with young people.  I have no doubt all the members are very familiar with the work of our members.  The title of our submission is "Beyond Austerity", because we believe that after five years and numerous budgets in which there have been cuts and adjustments, we need to give young people some hope and a plan for the future and something beyond the troika leaving Ireland and regaining our sovereignty.</p><p>  One of the key issues for us is that funding for youth work organisations working in every community in Ireland has been cut by approximately 30% since 2008.  It is a sector that works with many young people.  In 2012, we commissioned Indecon to undertake an assessment and it found that our members engaged with more than 380,000 young people.  There are 40,000 volunteers and approximately 1,300 paid staff.  It is a service and a support for young people which is very much led by organisations and volunteers and which is obviously complemented by staff.  However, it has been very badly hit over the past number of years.</p><p>  Even though youth work services comprises only 14% of the budget of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, last year it comprised 33% of the overall budget.  Organisations have had to make savings and, unfortunately, have had to reduce services to young people, reduce hours and cut back pay.  Up to now we have been struggling on, but another &euro;3 million cut has been pinpointed for 2014.  Essentially, our pre-budget submission is stating that this sector has already taken a 30% cut and a fairly heavy share of the burden.  We would like the sector to be spared in 2014.</p><p>  Another issue on which we are very much working is youth unemployment.  We welcome the Government's work in the area of the youth guarantee, which our organisation first proposed in March 2011.  The key thing is a high-quality education, training and work experience opportunity.  It is not enough to get young people off the live register; it is important to get them onto a sustainable path and into sustainable work.  We know the Government has set up an interdepartmental working group, which is very positive.  A plan is going to the European Commission.  Ireland must put money up front but it could also access significant funding from the European Union's youth employment initiative.</p><p>  We are particularly concerned about the young people who have been on the live register the longest.  Approximately 28,000 have been on the live register for a year or more.  We are concerned that if the fund is focused only on those closest to the labour market, those young people will be left behind.  In our pre-budget submission, we propose that a strand of the youth guarantee be used to assist young people who are most disadvantaged.  Our member organisations, which have a track record and credibility, could contribute significantly.  Some are doing this in a small way with limited resources.  We would certainly like to see an overall budget of &euro;20 million in the youth guarantee budget ring-fenced for that.</p><p>  Ms Ward mentioned the whole area of child poverty.  We are also members of the End Child Poverty Coalition and I will not go over the points she made.  I refer to alcohol-related harm.  Given the day that is in it, Arthur's Day, we have a proposal in our pre-budget submission about revenue-raising.  Many people come in here and say they want the Government to spend more.  We were members of the national steering group on substance misuse which proposed a social responsibility levy.  We have added a bit more detail to it and are saying there should be a 1% levy on the turnover of drinks manufacturers - the large companies producing the alcohol.  Based on the drinks industry's own data, we estimate it could potentially bring in approximately &euro;25 million.  We believe that money could be used to support initiatives to work with young people to tackle alcohol-related harm and to replace drinks sponsorship of sport and fund activities.</p><p>  I refer to the issue of emigration.  We produced a report in May entitled "Time to Go?", which looked at the issue of emigration.  Obviously, we want young people to stay in Ireland and we need to create opportunities for them here, but we must face the reality that young people are leaving.  Our research, which we conducted with young people in Canada and in the UK, indicated that many of them were going with either a lack of information or insufficient information and support.  Some additional supports are needed.  A very modest sum, an extra &euro;1 million, should be provided to groups to give young people who have already decided to emigrate more assistance and perhaps to engage more with the large number of young people who have left so that we can encourage them to come back when, hopefully, the jobs and opportunities are available in Ireland.  I will be happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

It has been a very busy morning in which we have addressed many issues.  I thank the Children's Rights Alliance for its presentation.  I am sorry I missed the beginning of it but I am familiar with it.  I refer to the child and family agency Bill, Committee Stage of which we will address shortly.  I believe we have a fine Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and the establishment of the new Department was arguably one of the best decisions of the new Government since 2011, although the legislative programme is progressing a little slower than we would have wished.  Following the successful passage of the referendum on children's rights, there is a programme of work which I am very happy to support.  My concern, reflected by Ms Ward, relates to resourcing.  I refer to the transition from the family support agency within the Health Service Executive to the transition period and on to the child and family agency, which hopefully will be <i>in situ</i> at the earliest point in 2014.  We had hoped it would have been in place by 2013.</p> <p>If it gets off to a bad start in terms of resourcing it will be such a disappointment having regard to all of the hope and expectation surrounding it in terms of what could be realised from it.  I strongly endorse Ms Ward's point about resourcing.  It is not enough to have the right policy, we must also have the commitment.  The Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, cannot be burdened with the responsibility alone of ensuring there is adequate resourcing.  I make that appeal and urge all voices, irrespective of their political disposition, to do so.  This is a Cabinet responsibility.  The issue of children transcends several Departments and we need joined-up thinking in relation to children especially, as never before.  We must recognise that the needs of children incorporate education, health, social protection - I could go on.  Those respective Departments all have a shared role in this respect.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, in his role and responsibility, must ensure that there is adequate resourcing.</p><p> We are considering the introduction of new legislation on the registration of child care facilities, including after-school care.  This is something we will be addressing.  The Minister has only just got it across the line in terms of agreement on it at Cabinet.  It is important that resourcing would be an integral part of it but I would welcome the registration process.  I am not sure if the Children's Rights Alliance commented on this in the document before me.  Agreements on it with Cabinet got across the line yesterday morning and I would like to hear what the representative of the Children's Rights Alliance might have to add about it.</p><p> I wish to deal with a further matter covered in Mr. James Doorley's  submission on child benefit.  As a working Deputy on the ground, I know from dealing with cases, as I have in several of the instances that have presented, and this is not anecdotal, that decisions were made to significantly reduce child benefit over a number of years.  Mr. Doorley has starkly presented the figures on a compendium over 2011 to 2013 showing the impact on families with three or more children being that of a cut of &euro;100.  That is a significant sum of money that has had a negative impact on families with the burden of responsibility most often falling on the shoulders of the mother.  I am eating into the Fianna F&aacute;il time now.</p></speech>

He made the point that there should be no further cuts to child benefit for those currently in receipt of social welfare benefits.  We have to turn this around at some point and no further cuts should be in any way contemplated and we have to start to restore child benefit.  We need to use language like that, particularly when there is an opportunity perhaps for more imaginative measures at this time.</p><p>  Children and young people should not be disproportionately affected by the cuts but we know that they most certainly have been.  I recall saying this to Mr. Doorley on a previous occasion but opportunities for children are closed to an ever-growing number of young people across Irish society because their parents can no longer afford these options, which are important in filling the day, the week and the lives of young people.  Childhood passes so quickly.  Because of the economic situation that is particularly affecting those most challenged, those dependent on social protection and those on low to middle incomes, and children are suffering as a result.  They suffer with potential life-long consequences because they are the excluded and marginalised and they become acutely aware of it within their peer group and at school.  Some are able to continue to enjoy social options and outlets but it is no longer a choice for others.  It is very sad and this must be realised and faced up to if we are to have a society of equals, which is what it should be all about.</p></speech>

They say that every day is a school day and the figure Ms Tanya Ward gave initially, which Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in just missed, was that there has been a 13.4% increase in the child population since 2006.  We have to contrast that against the cuts.  We have an increasing child population, which all the economists tell us is important for demographics purposes, and yet we are not protecting their childhoods.  Another stark statistic is the back to school clothing and footwear allowance figure Ms Ward gave of &euro;17 million received by 200,000 families and what it would actually cover.  We need to examine that.  Often when we have a debate on child benefit, and I will go out and defend it, we are told that we do know what it is spent on.  We are very clear on what the back to school allowance is about, so I am concerned about that aspect.</p><p>  With regard to the child and family agency, I am a little concerned with already having to ask for there to be no cut in its resourcing.  How do we know that the amount that is being allocated to the new agency is a fair proportion of what should be allocated from the HSE?  How do we know that the starting point is fair and that the agency is not already starting way behind the starting line?  That is a concern I have on that issue.</p><p>  Regarding youth work services and the question of cuts, there has been an increased legislative basis for youth work with vetting, and rightly so, but has that removed costs for organisations that provide such services?  The Seanad is currently discussing the issue of bullying and that arises when an issue becomes a problem, whereas youth work involves getting in much earlier and engaging in preventive early intervention work which we should be supporting.  </p><p>  We are all concerned about the level of youth unemployment.  Mr. Doorley mentioned the youth guarantee and leveraging EU funding.  Will the State have to also leverage funding and what will be the relationship and the timeline in that respect?</p><p>  My final point is on alcohol-related harm given the day that it is.  We made a very strong statement in the previous session which I would advise the representatives to read.  People are not aware that youth organisations will not take funding from alcohol companies.  This is not said enough.  Often it is said that the sports organisations are torn about this issue.  The other day I tweeted about the events of today and I had a difficulty that an organisation, <i>drinkaware.ie</i>, was promoting alcohol.  I got a telephone call from the organisation questioning my action of tweeting.  The problem is that the drinks industry funds this body which then promotes the drinks industry.  If youth work organisations will not take funding from the drinks industry, there is an issue for them; this relates to the levy Mr. Doorley spoke about and that money could go to youth work organisations and in that way there would be a legitimate way for such money to go to them.  That is not heard in the public debate.  I would encourage youth work organisations to say clearly and strongly to the public that every youth organisation has a policy that it will not take money from the drinks industry.</p></speech>

I would point out to Mr. James Doorley that I started off in politics as a direct result of being on a national executive of a youth organisation.  I remember being in Leinster House lobbying to try to retain funding for youth organisations many years ago when youth organisations were only beginning to get some degree of recognition.  We have come a long way since then.  Now more than ever, and Mr. Doorley emphasised the point, we need to do much more.  As has been said, the birth rate has increased from 60,000 a year to 75,000 and while it has dropped back in the past 12 months, we face major challenges in the years ahead.  Does Mr. Doorley consider there could be more co-ordination of the funding made available to youth organisations to ensure better use is made of it?  What can be done in that area?</p> <p> One of the difficulties I have encountered in respect of EU funding relates to the delays on the part of the Departments in trying to access such funding.  The first matter they tend to consider is the amount of money they will be obliged to provide before they apply for that funding.  This issue was brought home to me in 2009 when Dell closed its operations in Limerick and the relevant Departments were not even aware of the existence of the European globalisation fund.  A problem arose because at that time, the rules relating to the fund stipulated that 50% of the moneys would be provided by the EU and the other 50% by the Irish Government.  We were advised that the Government would not be in a position to put its share of the money forward, so we convinced the European Union to increase its portion to 66%.  As a result, &euro;21 million was made available to the Limerick area.  Is Mr. Doorley satisfied that Departments are doing enough to ensure we obtain the maximum benefit from the EU funding that is on offer in order that the maximum number of people here will benefit?</p></speech>

Child benefit is a universal payment.  Notwithstanding the fact that there have been cuts to this payment, some of which could not be borne by certain families, the simple fact is that not all children are equal.  Where does Ms Ward stand with regard to the universality of the payment?  Should child benefit be taxed in the case of wealthier families?  Would this have a direct impact on the children involved, even though they come from such families?</p><p>  I could not agree more with Ms Ward regarding the back to school allowance.  Those who are genuine in accessing this payment are down to pennies.  It is not a case that they have pounds and shilling left.  There is a real need - the Minister for Education and Skills has been trying to take action in this regard - to question the level of common sense displayed by schools.  Some schools continue to oblige parents to spend &euro;40 or &euro;50 on tracksuits for children as young as six and seven.  Those children might wear their tracksuits for 15 minutes of PE per week.  The &euro;40 to &euro;50 to which I refer is additional to the money the parents are obliged to pay for school uniforms.  It is bizarre.  I would not care if we had money coming out of our ears.  This should not be happening and it should be questioned.</p><p>  I am scared that Ms Ward referred to the fact that the budget for the new child and family agency might be cut.  Why is she of this view?  Is it because everything else has been cut or is there another reason for her concern?</p><p>  We all hope that the youth guarantee scheme will have a positive impact.  Mr. Doorley referred to an amount of &euro;20 million.  Is there a specific strand he would like to see developed in respect of the scheme and, if so, will he describe it?</p></speech>

The system for early childhood education has been developed in a very <i>ad hoc</i> way.  The impact of this has been that there is a real lack of quality across the board.  In other jurisdictions, early childhood education has been developed in a way that is properly resourced and subsidised by the state.  The authorities in those jurisdictions have much more control over the quality of the education that is provided.  We took a different tack and decided to give child benefit payments of substance to parents.  Effectively, we did not choose to regulate the sector and we are dealing with the costs and consequences as a result.  It is astonishing that when we established the early childhood year, on which we are spending a great deal of money, we did not even introduce either a basic registration system or a quality assurance system.  We welcome what the Minister is doing in this area because it is a very important step forward.  However, there is a long way to go in the area of early childhood education.  What the authorities need to do is introduce a second free preschool year.  This is extremely important because not only does the free preschool year subsidise the cost of early childhood care for families, it also means we obtain a better bang for our buck.  In last year's budget, &euro;136 million was cut from child benefit but only &euro;18.4 million of this was reinvested into after-school clubs.  What the Government should have done was used some of the money saved to establish a second free early childhood year because this would have been a good investment of resources.  These are the type of issues we need to consider.</p><p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy regarding the cost of poverty on children's lives.  We are all aware that children who are living in poverty stop asking their parents for things.  They do not ask for new shoes for school and they are happy to go to school in second-hand clothes.  They are excluded by their peers, they do not go to the cinema, cafes, etc.  They cannot take part in all the other activities in which other children are involved.  They do not expect good presents - or any presents at all - at Christmas or on birthdays.  They stop expecting all those things which are considered to be good about a child's life.  That is the cost of poverty for children.  One of the good ways in which this could have been addressed would have been through maintaining child benefit supplement.  In the context of Deputy Regina Doherty's point, we are of the view that child benefit should remain universal.  If one wants to tax people who are on high incomes, then one should use the tax system to do so.  This might be politically unpopular, but if one wants to increase revenues, one uses the tax system to do so.  Child benefit is the only thing families and children actually receive, so it should remain universal.</p><p>  In compiling its report, the advisory group on tax and social welfare, which was chaired by Ita Mangan, did some work on reforming child income supplement.  We would support research in this area but we are opposed to some of the recommendations contained in the advisory group's report.  The group recommended that child benefit should remain universal but that it should be reduced and that a second tier payment should be introduced.  To obtain the second tier payment, the suggested threshold would mean that one's income would have to be approximately &euro;25,000 per year.  That is not much more than what a family of two on the dole receives.  In the context of trying to get people into work and out of the welfare trap, the recommendations in the report are very problematic.</p><p>  On the points raised by Senator van Turnhout and Deputy Regina Doherty in respect of the child and family agency, our view on the costings involved is actually right.  No one has carried out a proper costing with regard to what the agency needs to start up operations.  It is dealing with many of the problems in the child protection system by bringing the different services together.  Members will recall the report on child deaths which was published last year, the Ryan report and the report on child abuse in Roscommon.  These reports highlighted that there are many problems around inter-agency co-operation, and a lack of information sharing.  One of the key problems, however, is the lack of resources.  There are just not enough social workers to deal with the high number of case files.  What will happen the new agency if it does not have adequate resources?  It will simply focus on child protection and it will not place an emphasis on early intervention.  Children have a right to grow with their families.  There is an obligation on the State to provide families with as much support as possible early on to prevent a scenario where they end up in foster care situations.</p><p>  We are extremely concerned that the agency's existing budget is going to be cut.  We have spoken to political insiders who indicated that it is a serious possibility.  The new agency represents the largest reform of the public sector the Government has introduced and there is a possibility that its budget is going to be cut.  One would expect that it would receive an injection of funds during its first year of operations to allow it to introduce new management systems.  There is a huge job to be done by the new agency in integrating all the different systems.  There is also a huge job to be done in the context of introducing new management systems within the agency.  If one speaks to social workers who were working within the HSE several years ago, they will state that they could have been going about their business for three years without anyone discussing their caseloads with them or what was happening with the children involved.  That was the background to it.</p><p>  My final point in respect of the agency's budget is that it is carrying forward a historical deficit from the HSE.  The amount involved is difficult to assess.  Depending on to whom one speaks, it can be as high as &euro;50 million or as low as &euro;20 million.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it can be a case of penny wise and pound foolish, particularly in the context of the long-term impacts of high levels of unemployment and young people leaving school early.</p> <p>We even see it with the figures relating to mental health and, unfortunately, young people who die by suicide.  The activities, sports and services that our members provide to young people can make a difference.  We all know from the small spaces and activities which young people are involved in that the situation outside the school environment can make a big difference.  A significant adult can make a big difference to the lives of many young people.  Thankfully, many young people have one within the family but many people do not and sometimes they turn to someone who can help and support them.  The Indecon report we received last year showed as much.  Indecon is an economic consultancy that examined investment very much from the perspective of pounds, shillings and pence.  It concluded that for every euro the State invests in youth work, it gets back &euro;2.2 in the long term.</p><p> The National Economic and Social Council and the OECD issued statements last week.  They indicated that in terms of employment young people have been hardest hit.  We are not trying to create an intergenerational conflict; we are trying to emphasise the need to recognise that children and young people have been hard hit.  There was some talk when the promissory note was announced in terms of lessening the &euro;3.1 billion this year.  For these young people the numbers are increasing but the challenges they are facing are increasing as well.  Youth work services have already taken a 30% cut in 2014.  We are not looking for more money but we are calling for the cut to be cancelled in 2014.</p><p> Senator van Turnhout will be well aware of the position because of her work in the sector.  Most youth services in the country are provided by voluntary organisations.  They have pushed and lobbied for vetting, quality standards and a range of other things but these come with extra costs and pressures.  The committee is aware that the sector has 40,000 volunteers and 1,300 full-time staff equivalent.  It is primarily a volunteer-led service.  The extra requirements that they must meet reduces the amount of time they have to work with young people.  On top of that they must find money to run the services.  Furthermore, they have been hit by the double-whammy of reduced public funding while many have significantly reduced fund-raising.  Many organisations are trying to raise money in all sorts of ways to run their activities.</p><p> The alcohol issue was raised.  I was on the sports marketing group some years back which discussed getting rid of drinks industry sponsorship of sport.  As a GAA fan, I always believed that it was wrong.  I understand where sports organisations are coming from and that they are getting the money to provide the services, but I always took the view as a GAA fan that the money they were getting was coming from companies that were doing a good deal of damage to the young people they were meant to be working with.  The irony is that for any young person who wishes to excel in sport, drinking alcohol is counterproductive.  I agree that youth organisations should not accept money from the alcohol industry.  It is simply against our principles.  We are in place to assist young people.  We would have no difficulty getting money in the morning and we need to remember that in the current context.  This is why we believe in a social responsibility levy.  This would involve the State imposing a levy.  Alcohol is not an ordinary commodity; it is a product that has always been licensed because it is seen as a product that has consequences.  We believe the State should impose such a levy.</p><p> Senator Burke referred to value for money.  A value-for-money review is currently being conducted by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We believe that we must make better use of public funds, there is no doubt about that.  However, sometimes because of the way the system is organised, in many cases there is no incentive for organisations to try to do things in a better way because organisations get cut across the board anyway.  An organisation that has saved a great deal of money gets punished because it is told that it has cut costs here and there and therefore it will get less because it has been seen to reduce the budget.  We need to consider incentivising organisations.  This is not to say that many organisations have not cut budgets and costs already.  Most organisations froze increments in 2008, most have cut pay and salaries and most have let people go and reduced services.  There is a limit to the extent to which organisations can cut back.  The irony is that it is possible for organisations to end up with staff but no money to do anything and that is not sustainable either.</p><p> I agree completely with the comments on EU funding.  A total of between &euro;6 billion and &euro;8 billion is coming down the track with the youth guarantee.  That represents a great opportunity for Ireland.  It has been estimated that we could potentially access between &euro;100 million and &euro;150 million.  I agree that we need to ensure this money is drawn down and spent well.  There is only a two-year window for the youth guarantee.  Our concern is that the money might be used to top up or replace some existing schemes and that would not be good enough.</p><p> Deputy Doherty made a particular point about the youth guarantee.  We believe the youth guarantee should support all young people who are jobseekers to get them into work.  We recognise that some young people who have left school or college recently may need a little support to get into a job or extra training but we are particularly concerned about the most disadvantaged young people because many of them have been on the live register for a long time.  We maintain that of the potential &euro;100 million or &euro;150 million, at least a strand of it should be solely for those young people who are long-term unemployed and who perhaps have limited skills and qualifications.</p><p> The youth guarantee in Sweden and Finland has been successful.  Ireland is not Sweden or Finland but those countries found it far more challenging to engage with the young people who were longer-term unemployed.  More work needs to be done in this area.  Some of these young people need what is called prevocational work.  They may have literacy issues, substance misuse problems or family issues or they may have had a bad experience in school and need a little extra support.  To throw a person into a job when, for example, he has literacy issues only creates more problems.  I heard a representative of a major shopping retailer state recently that the business was sent 28 people who had been unemployed to fill positions.  The business decided that none of them were ready to start work because they needed a good deal more support before they would be ready.  Those people may well be ready in six months or a year.  This is where the youth guarantee gives us a great opportunity but it is a short timeframe.  I am involved in the pilot in Ballymun.  It is a challenge to get all the organisations and statutory agencies to work together.  It is a great opportunity but I agree that we need to ensure we use the money well because it is badly needed.</p></speech>

I remind all present, including members, the media and those in the Public Gallery that mobile phones and BlackBerry devices must be turned off completely because they interfere with the sound system even when in silent mode.</p><p>  I welcome the delegation from the Office of the Ombudsman.  We are pleased to welcome Ms Emily O'Reilly, Ombudsman, who will present the annual report of the Office of the Ombudsman for the last time in her current role.  On behalf of the committee members I wish to congratulate Ms O'Reilly on her new appointment to the position of European Ombudsman and to wish her every success.  We are very proud that an Irish person has been elected to that position and it is a tribute to the fantastic work of the Office of the Ombudsman.  It is hoped Ireland can continue the good work.</p><p>  I welcome Ms Bernie McNally, director general, and Mr. Fintan Butler, senior investigator, Office of the Ombudsman.  I thank the Ombudsman for forwarding her presentation which has been circulated to members.</p><p>  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p></speech>

Members will be aware that I published my 2012 annual report yesterday.  This is my tenth and final annual report since taking up the position of Ombudsman in 2003.  During that period my office has dealt with over 25,000 complaints against public sector bodies and carried out several key investigations into various aspects of public administration.</p><p>  My office continued to receive high numbers of complaints in 2012.  While there had been a drop in the numbers of complaints, from a record 3,727 in 2010 to 3,412 in 2012, the number was still 25% higher than the ten-year average of 2,774.  The largest number of complaints received involved the Department of Social Protection.  Complaints relating to local authorities represented just under one third of complaints and one fifth were in respect of the Health Service Executive.  A total of 11,178 inquiries were dealt with by the Office of the Ombudsman in 2012.  It is very likely that following the extension of the remit of the office, the continuing pressure on public services to do more with less and with increasing numbers of people seeking State supports of various kinds, the complaint intake will continue to be significant.</p><p>  I have attached as Appendix 1 to this presentation a brief summary of four cases in my annual report which I wish to highlight.  This information has been circulated to members so my remarks will be brief.</p><p>  In case No. 1, my complainant was granted arrears of survivor's contributory pension amounting to &euro;68,000 because I discovered that the Department of Social Protection had sufficient information available to it in 1999 to be aware of his entitlement but failed to notify him at the time.  Case No. 2 involved Letterkenny General Hospital which gave my complainant a number of conflicting diagnoses in relation to a serious genetic abnormality.  Following my office's intervention, the hospital's clinical director met the complainant and arranged for a further definitive medical review by another specialist which confirmed that she did not have the condition.  The cost of the review was covered by the HSE and it also refunded her the cost of her private consultation which amounted to &euro;1,000.</p><p>  In case No. 3, due to incorrect information from the Department of Social Protection, my complainant moved to Guernsey with his family in the belief that he would continue to be paid jobseeker's benefit for a period.  The Department apologised for its handling of the matter and offered an<i> ex gratia </i>payment of &euro;1,000 as redress, which the complainant was happy to accept.  In case No. 4, a married couple applied for medical cards to the HSE but suffered considerable delay in having the applications processed, despite the fact that their circumstances were such that it should have been apparent at an early stage that they were eligible.  The HSE awarded the medical cards backdated to 15 working days from receipt of the application and agreed to refund all medical, dental and optical expenses for the 20-month period of delay.  I also contacted the Revenue Commissioners, which agreed to refund the income levy paid by the couple while the application was being processed, on the basis that individuals who hold full medical cards are exempt from the income levy and any overpayments of the universal social charge due to the delay on the part of the HSE.  Members have also been provided with copies of the 2012 annual report which provides details of a number of other cases highlighting the type of case handled by my office in 2012.</p><p>  Over my ten years in office, I have constantly urged various Governments to extend independent oversight to all public bodies.  In May this year the remit of my office was extended to over 180 additional organisations, including all publicly-funded third level education bodies.  On the passing of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act in 2012, I described it as a historic day for the Office of the Ombudsman and Irish public administration generally.  Since 1 May 2013, all public bodies with significant interactions with the public are subject to independent and impartial oversight by the Office of the Ombudsman. </p><p>  However, I feel I must once again draw attention to some very important areas of activity of the Department of Justice and Equality relating to immigration, naturalisation and prisons, which continue to remain outside the Ombudsman&rsquo;s jurisdiction.  This anomalous situation is virtually unique in terms of the jurisdiction of national ombudsmen in other countries and I know that members of this committee raised their concerns about the matter during the debates on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill.  This concern is much appreciated.  These areas were not placed within my remit in the Bill as I was told that other measures were being actively progressed by the Department of Justice and Equality.  The Minister for Justice and Equality announced in 2012, before the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, that a new complaints system was planned for prisoners.  He stated this system would be open, transparent and independent and would provide an immediate mechanism to deal with such complaints on the ground.  The new procedures for the investigation of complaints went live on 1 November 2012.</p><p>  In May 2013, Judge Michael Kelly, Inspector of Prisons, presented his report, An Assessment of the Irish Prison System, to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Chapter 8 of the report gives a detailed description of the new procedures.  However, he declined to comment on investigations commenced under the new procedures since 1 November 2012 as they were then in their infancy.  However, he voiced concerns in the report about the fact that the new complaint procedures provide only a process for the investigation of category A complaints, which are complaints of the most serious nature, including assaults, serious intimidation, etc. </p> <p>He called for a robust complaints procedure to be brought in for category B and C complaints and also asked, as a matter of urgency, that section 31 of the Prisons Act 2007 be amended to strengthen his own investigatory powers in certain areas.  This suggests to me that there is much work to be done in terms of establishing a fully effective and comprehensive prisoner complaints system.</p><p> In regard to immigration, residency and asylum, the Minister has indicated that a new statutory appeals system will be established through the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.  We await the enactment of that legislation.  Until we see the final shape and substance of the new complaint processes in the immigration area, it would be premature of me to judge how effective they will be.  I take this opportunity, however, to express concern regarding the delay in advancing the Bill.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated a willingness, during the debate on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012, to revisit that legislation if it was found to require fine-tuning.  In that context, prisons and asylum matters may be the subject of further consideration at some time in the future.  I expect the new Ombudsman may wish to monitor progress in both these areas.</p><p> The consequential increase in complaint numbers arising from the expansion of the office's remit will be managed within existing resources and supported by the significant operational reforms we have implemented in the past two years.  The office's strategic plan for 2013 to 2015 sets out our plans for greater engagement with public bodies under our remit to encourage effective systems of complaint resolution locally, thus improving satisfaction with the service at point of contact and preventing the need for escalation to the office.  It is early days to seek to quantify the likely number and types of additional complaints the office will receive annually from the new bodies under its remit.  However, I will give members a general overview of the most recently available figures relating to valid complaints received against the new bodies in 2013.</p><p> As provided under the amending Act, I can examine only actions that occur on or after 1 May 2013, with complainants normally required to exhaust local appeal processes before coming to my office.  In total, we have received 78 valid - by which I mean admissible - complaints against the new bodies.  I have divided the breakdown of the figures into four broad sectoral categories and attached them in appendix 2, which has been circulated to members.  Aside from the valid complaints being dealt with, my office has received a considerable number of telephone queries in regard to a wide range of the new public bodies, as well as complaints that were invalid or premature because they were not taken up with the public body concerned or the actions complained of predated 1 May 2013 or were otherwise outside our remit for whatever reason.  Adding the valid, invalid and premature figures together, my office has received more than 200 complaints against the new bodies to date.</p><p> I will now make some general comments on our experience in dealing with the new bodies.  My office has appointed sectoral leads to deal closely with the organisations in question in the four sectors and to monitor, analyse and process the initial complaints received in each sector.  These sectoral leads have had a high level of direct engagement, including face-to-face meetings with a number of bodies, to establish a clear understanding of their processes and procedures and the challenges they face.  The engagement also serves to give the new bodies a better understanding of my office's approach to complaint handling and the level of co-operation we need to investigate and evaluate complaints fully.</p><p> The sectoral leads report that the co-operation and engagement from the new bodies has been positive and open.  In regard to Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, it is perhaps not surprising that we have had quite a number of valid complaints - a total to date of 55, or 140 if one includes invalid and premature complaints - given that SUSI has recently processed a very high volume of grant applications in the run-up to the current academic year.  In fact, quite a number of SUSI cases taken on by my office relate back to the 2012-13 academic year, as some appeals took a significant length of time to process in SUSI.  I can also deal with complaints about undue delay in dealing with grant applications going back to 2012-13 which were not resolved by May 2013.</p><p> As it commenced the new centralised grant processing system last year, SUSI was faced with considerable challenges and a very high volume of complaints.  In the meantime, however, it has been refining its processing systems to make them more efficient and effective.  SUSI has met officials from my office on a number of occasions and I am entirely satisfied with the level of co-operation it is providing.  Needless to say, if the individual complaints my office is dealing with suggest further ways to improve the system, we will communicate that information to SUSI.</p><p> I have repeatedly welcomed the establishment of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  The Ombudsman has a duty to report to Parliament, and any broad concerns or issues identified by any Ombudsman relating to the public administration system must provoke the interest of, and a response from, Members of Parliament.  This committee is a pivotal bridge between elected representatives, the Office of the Ombudsman and members of the public who may have suffered harm at the hands of public bodies.  Its petitions function enables members of the public to complain to the committee on a wide range of matters relating to the provision of public services.  In recognition of the statutory independence of my office and to avoid any overlap or duplication, the committee's terms of reference provide, among other things, that the committee will not accept complaints which have been the subject of a decision by my office or are under active consideration by my office.  This is a practical and sensible approach to take and the office will continue to liaise with the clerk to the committee on such issues.</p><p> I am aware that Standing Orders cannot provide for the non-application of party whips to members of the committee.  When I appeared before the committee in July 2011, however, members seemed to take on board my pleas that they seek to act on a non-party political basis when considering my annual report and other reports.  I do not want to put particular members on the spot on this issue, but I noted Deputy Charles Flanagan's contribution on this point.  It summed the issue up very neatly and courageously when he said:<blockquote>I am conscious that I speak as a member of a Government party with a large majority.  However, if the committee is to work to its potential - and supporting the Chairman will be vital in that regard - we should be less swayed by the rigorous application of the party whip.  If there was ever an opportunity for any Oireachtas committee to be less dependent on the rigours of the whip, this committee may most appropriately take that approach.  I welcome the Ombudsman&rsquo;s observations in this regard, as contained in a report published earlier this year.  I hope we will work together on an all-party basis, arriving at decisions by way of consensus rather than taking positions along narrow, partisan and party political lines.</blockquote> I attached particular importance to this issue because of my decidedly painful experience in dealing with the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the aftermath of my special report on the Lost at Sea scheme.  I do not propose to rehash that battle today, but if I had to give an example of how an Oireachtas committee should not deal with an Ombudsman's report, it is as good an example as one could find.  As I leave office, one of my great regrets is that I did not manage to achieve redress for the Byrne family.  I remain utterly convinced as to the merits of the case I presented at the time.  It is only fair to say, however, that my experience with the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has been nothing but positive.  Although I await members' report to the D&aacute;il on the two special reports I brought before them, I have confidence in their commitment to good public service, fairness, accountability and openness.  I very much hope the next Ombudsman will continue to receive the same level of interest as I have done and that there will be a continued constructive engagement with the committee and a strong and courageous mutual commitment to good public administration.</p><p> I will now give the committee an update on the special reports to which I referred, in which I found that the mobility allowance, MA, and motorised transport grant, MTG, schemes were in breach of the Equal Status Acts.  In the case of the former, the breach related to age grounds, whereas in the case of the MTG scheme it related to the way in which &quot;severe disability&quot; was being defined by the Health Service Executive in the Donegal area for the purposes of eligibility criteria.  The HSE accepted the recommendations of my report on the MTG scheme.  Since its publication, the applicant who was the subject of the investigation was approved for the grant following the review.  An additional 50 people who had been refused the grant, having been deemed eligible on previous occasions, had the recent decision overturned and were also awarded the grant.  I made a separate recommendation to the Department of Health that it issue a circular to the HSE in regard to eligibility criteria around the issue of &quot;severe disability&quot; and to ensure the definition of the term was not in breach of the Equal Status Acts.  This recommendation was rejected, leading to one of my special reports to the Oireachtas.</p><p> The second report related to the mobility allowance scheme.  The Department of Health had originally accepted my recommendations to make the scheme compliant with equal status legislation.  However, when the recommendations were not implemented and I pursued the matter, I was informed that it must belatedly reject them.  Following my appearance before this committee in regard to the special reports, members held separate hearings with the Minister for Health, the Minister of State with responsibility in this area and the Secretary General of the Department and other senior officials on 6 February 2013.  On 25 February 2013, the Government announced its decision to abolish both the MA and the MTG schemes with immediate effect.  Existing recipients of the MA were to continue in payment until June, and this cut-off point was subsequently further extended.  On 11 June 2013, the Government announced that new statutory provisions would be established in regard to financial supports for disabled persons with mobility needs.  The Government has established an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, to develop proposals for a new scheme or schemes, and the group has been asked to report back to Government by October.</p><p> The closure of the schemes shocked me.  Such decisive action contrasted sharply with the inaction of the Department during the period since 2000 when the Equal Status Act was first enacted and, in particular, with its inaction since 2008 and 2009 when it was on notice from my office, and from the Equality Tribunal, that the MA scheme contravened equality legislation.</p> <p>The law is the law.  If the law is unaffordable, as the Department claimed, then the Oireachtas has the power to change it.  In fact, it has a duty to do so even if some of the options available will be unpopular.  I saw no evidence of serious effort in the period from 2008 to address the issue and thus prevent the ultimate devastation caused to many people with disabilities when the shock announcement was made that the schemes would be abolished.</p><p> At the launch of my annual report for 2012 yesterday, I gave a cautious welcome to the announcement by the Government that payments are to continue to be made temporarily by the HSE to those persons currently in receipt of the mobility allowance.  I very much hope that the interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, will resolve the situation regarding the two schemes in an urgent and equitable manner.  I also understand that this committee plans to report in due course to the D&aacute;il, as provided for in its Standing Orders, on the outcome of its various deliberations on the matter.  I appreciate that this may pose some difficulty for the committee and will, to a certain extent, be a test of its stated commitment to seek to act in a consensual manner.  It is important that the committee would comment on the findings of my report and on how such maladministration can be prevented in the future.</p><p> My office has recently completed a number of investigations which, if time allowed, I would mention briefly.  However, I need to note serious concerns with yet another report which just last week was rejected by the Health Service Executive with, I have to presume, the backing of the Department of Health.  The rejection of my recommendations must now be a matter for my successor in his or her first weeks in office and I do not wish in any way to dictate how he or she should respond.  However, as the investigation was initiated and completed on my watch, I feel duty bound to report briefly on it now.  The investigation involved 17 cases where claims for repayments under the health repayment scheme had been refused. This scheme was introduced in 2006 to refund charges which had been levied illegally by health boards in respect of long-stay care over a period of many years.  In the cases to which I refer, repayment claims were refused on the grounds that the applicants had not paid what are termed in the legislation as "recoverable charges".  These negative decisions were upheld by the health repayment scheme appeals officer.</p><p> Following my investigation, I recommended that repayments should be made in all but one of the 17 cases.  I also recommended that the HSE should examine the remaining case further.  The HSE very recently sent me a detailed statement of the reasons it has decided to reject my recommendations.  All of these reasons were, in fact, matters already raised by the HSE in the course of the investigation and matters on which I had reflected carefully before completing it. Among the HSE's reasons for rejecting the recommendations is a claim that I did not have jurisdiction to conduct the investigation in the first instance.  This, unfortunately, appears to be the continuation of a pattern of behaviour on the part of the HSE and, more particularly, the Department of Health in respect of Ombudsman investigations.  It will be a matter for my successor to decide how best to deal with the situation which has now arisen.  Among my successor's options will be that of sending a special report to the D&aacute;il and Seanad.  In the event of my successor making such a special report, the involvement of this committee will be pivotal in determining the eventual outcome.  I think it appropriate that I should, at this stage, inform this committee of the situation which has arisen.</p><p> Another issue of great importance raised by me over the years as well as by my immediate predecessor, the late Kevin Murphy, was the need to give constitutional status to the Office of the Ombudsman.  As far back as 1996, the Constitution Review Group recommended that the Office of the Ombudsman should be given constitutional status.  The review group pointed out that in the same way as the Comptroller and Auditor General monitors financial accountability, the Ombudsman monitors administrative accountability.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office has constitutional status.  It seems somewhat anomalous that the local government system, which is subject to my jurisdiction, also has constitutional status whereas my office does not.  I spelled out the arguments in favour of such status in my office's publication on developing and optimising the Office of the Ombudsman which was issued to all political parties in February 2011 in the run-up to the general election.  My office has made a detailed submission on the matter to the Convention on the Constitution and it will await with interest the proposals that emerge from that forum.</p><p> Earlier in the year, when I presented my 2012 Office of the Information Commissioner annual report, I highlighted a growing concern with regard to the failure of some public bodies to meet timeframes for compliance with requests by my office for information relating to review applications.  Indeed, it has become increasingly clear that many public bodies do not have adequately resourced freedom of information functions and that the priority afforded to the administration of freedom of information matters by many such bodies appears to be deteriorating as resources diminish and demands for greater efficiencies naturally increase.  This is a worrying trend which requires immediate action, particularly in light of the Government's commitment to reforming and extending the freedom of information legislation.  As I stated in my 2012 report, public bodies must recognise that the administration of the freedom of information process, as a statutory function, should be afforded as much weight as any other such function.  The administration of freedom of information should not be seen as an optional function from which resources may be diverted as other priorities arise.</p><p> I want to wish my successor, whoever he or she may be, all the very best in his or her work as Information Commissioner and Ombudsman and in the other statutory roles which come with the office.  As the remit of the office expands and the public service comes under further pressure, the job will continue to be challenging.  However, as the challenge grows, so too should the perceived importance of the offices in seeking to ensure a public service that acts in a fair, proper and open manner towards the public.</p><p> I again wish to thank the committee for its time and attention and for all the consideration it has given to me, my officials and the office during recent years.</p></speech>

Before I open the floor to members, I wish to inform her that the committee will be completing its report on the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant schemes fairly soon.  When she submitted her report on this matter, we wrote to the Department of Health seeking an explanation.  We then brought the Minister for Health, one of his Ministers of State and the Secretary General of his Department before us in order that they might explain what they intended to do about Ms O'Reilly's recommendations.  As she is aware and as she informed the committee just now, they announced, after our meeting with them, the cessation of the schemes.  We then demanded that they come back before us and we brought in the Secretary General.  That meeting was quite emotional because representatives from the Centre for Independent Living and the Disability Federation of Ireland also took part and indicated their deep alarm at the implications of what is involved.  Our focus was to ensure those groups would be at the heart of any revised scheme and that they would be fully consulted.  We ensured they would be part of the process.  The committee is extremely concerned with regard to the implications of what is involved.</p><p>  We brought the Secretary General of the Department back before us again to deal with the legacy issues the Ombudsman raised in the context of why lessons were not learned from previous occurrences which cost the taxpayer considerable sums of money.  We were also concerned with regard to the application of the law, which is a key issue when any scheme is being devised.  We have had a considerable and lengthy engagement with the Department on this matter and we intend to complete our report fairly soon.  We will, of course, submit the report to the Ombudsman's office.  However, it is important at this public forum to provide her with a clear indication that we intend to respond to and work vigorously in respect of any reports of this nature that are submitted by her office.</p></speech>

I am sure all members share the Chair's pride that Ms O'Reilly will be our representative in Europe.</p><p>  In the context of her most recent report, Ms O'Reilly stated that the HSE and the Department indicated their view that she did not have jurisdiction to conduct an investigation into issues relating to the health repayment scheme in the first instance.  It is my recollection that this is not the first occasion on which those two entities have made such an observation regarding the Ombudsman's jurisdiction.  How is it that arguments remain about said jurisdiction?  Surely it is clearly defined.  Why do the Department and the HSE continue to make observations of this nature?  If I recall correctly, there was an argument between Ms O'Reilly and the two entities in question regarding whether the matter to which I refer falls within her jurisdiction.  That argument obfuscated the position with regard to the actual case involved.  I am confounded that this is the case.</p><p>  On freedom of information compliance, Ms O'Reilly referred to public bodies not being adequately resourced and stated that the priority afforded to freedom of information requests seems to be deteriorating as resources are diminishing.  Is that Ms O'Reilly's observation or is it their observation to her?  Have the bodies in question indicated that they are very concerned with regard to diminishing resources or is it the case that they are saying nothing at all and that this Ms O'Reilly's observation about them?  Ms O'Reilly also stated that the statutory function of administering freedom of information should be afforded as much weight as any other such function.</p> <p>Is Ms O'Reilly saying that public bodies are setting aside their statutory function in this respect or not treating it with the seriousness it deserves, or are they saying they cannot cope?  That is an important issue because the Government is intent on expanding the application of the freedom of information legislation and on giving the office more powers.  If organisations cannot cope with such requests on a practical level, this committee, or whatever version of it will be in place, will end up in a few years time dealing with complaints that such organisations were not able to respond to freedom of information applications.  I think that is what Ms O'Reilly is suggesting.</p></speech>

In any argument that it could put out in that respect, it was taking that approach.  Regarding the question of the remit, it was raising an issue that had been dealt with fairly comprehensively almost 30 years ago when the Ombudsman's office was set up.  I will ask my colleague, Fintan Butler, who has the detail on that, to comment further on that.</p></speech>

It argued that the decisions of appeals officers are not administrative actions and that administrative actions are what the Ombudsman is empowered to deal with.  That jurisdictional issue was raised back in 1985 or 1986, particularly in the area of social welfare where, by definition, 95% of the complaints that came to the Ombudsman would have gone through the social welfare appeals process, which is a statutory appeals process.  An argument was made at the time that the Ombudsman should not be dealing with decisions of appeals officers statutorily appointed and that the Ombudsman should confine his or her activities to looking at administration in the very small narrow sense of sending out letters, communications and so on but not substantive issues.  That argument about jurisdiction was despatched fairly rapidly back in 1985 or 1986.</p><p>  The consequences of accepting the HSE's argument now would be that virtually all social welfare cases would not be within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and a great deal of the health service activity would be outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, as would the decisions of agricultural appeals officers.  The issue is not only the appalling vista of those areas being taken outside the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman but also a legal one about what is an administrative action.  We are very confident from advice we have got over the years that the actions of appeals officers are actions which are administrative actions.  They are not legislative actions or judicial actions and there is only one other box into which they can fall, which is that of administrative actions.  That question has been thoroughly deal with.  As to why this issue is being raised now, we can all wonder about that but it is something that has long since been despatched.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.762" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013092600006#E00500"><p>It would be setting at nought about three decades of work that we have done.  Many of the complaints with which I would deal personally, which are the slightly more complex ones, would involve examining how a decision had been made in an appeal.  It is our bread and butter work.  The suggestion made is a legal nonsense given what has been the universally accepted practice of the office for the past number of decades.</p><p>  The core issue in the health repayments scheme in regard to those particular institutions was that they were arguing that what patients had been in receipt of were inpatient services and they are the services that lend themselves to the charges and, in effect, they were saying that all they were getting was bed and board, but we do not accept that.  It has been widely accepted in cases dealt with through the courts and in other ways that similar institutions are giving inpatient services.  The Cheshire Homes was involved and so on.  A settlement was made in respect of institutions on a par with that a year or so ago and the Department of Health paid out a significant sum of money.  As far as we are concerned, these institutions are absolutely similar to institutions in respect of which the Department has paid up.  This is an issue with which my successor, and ultimately perhaps this committee, will have to deal, and I thought it was important to flag it.</p><p>  In regard to the freedom of information requests,obviously on a daily basis officials in the Information Commissioner's office engage with officials dealing with reviews and applications for records and, largely, we hear from them about what is going on.  When the freedom of information legislation was introduced in the late 1990s, very high end infrastructure was put in place within the Department of Finance through the central policy unit and various user groups.  It was a well-functioning machine at the beginning and many of the officials dealing with freedom of information requests in the various public bodies were trained to quite a high level, but as disenchantment with freedom of information requests set in within the public administration, that level of support fell away.  It was no longer seen as an elite function and therefore the supports that were given to it initially were no longer there.  When times are tough and people are looking for areas in which to cut back, there may be a temptation to cut back in an area that certain public bodies have never accepted as being a core and critical function.  We would take a different view, obviously.</p><p>  I welcomed the freedom of information reform and congratulated the Minister, Deputy Howlin, and his Department on pushing it though despite some quite robust opposition to it in certain areas.  However, it will be pointless if the resources are not put in place to support it because information delayed is information denied.</p></speech>

C&eacute;im &iacute;ontach &iacute; di agus don t&iacute;r.  The Ombudsman has set the bar quite high for the next fear an phobail, which is the title the late Michael Mills gave the position, which is an appropriate term.  A people's champion is what the Ombudsman is meant to be.</p><p>  I note from Ms O'Reilly's presentation the support she has for the remit to be extended to areas and I support the call for areas such as justice, immigration, prisons and the naturalisation process to be brought under the remit, and one hopes progress can be made on that in future.</p><p>  I had intended to raise an issue which, interestingly, the Ombudsman raised, that of the outstanding recommendation in the case of the Byrne family in County Donegal.  She probably would not want to rehash it here but I hope this committee will address it because what happened in that case was wrong and it needs to be examined and put right.  That issue was raised when this committee was set up by a Labour Party Deputy who is originally from County Donegal but is now in my constituency.  Addressing this is part of our work programme and at some stage we will get to it.  It is to be hoped we will be able to deliver on the recommendation made by the Ombudsman many years ago.</p><p>  Ms O'Reilly referred to the provision of additional resources.  The more work that is passed on to the Ombudsman's office and the Freedom of Information Commissioner, the longer the delays there will be in dealing with cases unless the necessary resources are put in place in that office.  What is the extent of the delay in dealing with complaints made to the Ombudsman or how long, on average, does it take to process them?  I accept that will vary depending on the nature of the complaints.  What additional resources in terms of staff and equipment are required for the Ombudsman's office to function at a reasonable level?</p><p>  Regarding hostility shown by some Departments to investigations or questions from the Ombudsman's office, the HSE and the Department of Health seem to be hostile in that respect.  How do we start to overcome that culture of secrecy or closed shop that still abounds in some Departments?  Is there something we as a committee or as legislators can highlight to ensure clarity is brought to those Departments and that they fully understand that they must comply with the Ombudsman's requests?</p></speech>

I am glad Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised the lost at sea issue because it is something that has continued to trouble me.  It was the first, and at that time the only, recommendation that had ever been rejected by the Oireachtas.  I had to battle hard to get it to the committee in the first place.  The committee at the time split along party political lines, which was very unwelcome.  When I was at the McGill summer school some time ago, Francis Byrne, who is one of the family members who made the complaint originally came up to me and asked me if I would intervene one more time.  Whenever I have been asked about this case over the last while I have taken a purist approach in that I have said I did my statutory duty and brought the matter to the attention of the Oireachtas which made its decision and that was it.  However, I did make a commitment to Francis that I would make one more attempt at it.  Perhaps my director general might not be too thrilled but I have discussed the matter with her and with some of the officials.  Perhaps in my final act as Ombudsman I will write to the Taoiseach and raise this case again and see if something could be done for the family because it should not be forgotten that while certain parties opposed the recommendation, other parties supported it at the time.  It is something that has continued to haunt that family.  I used to talk about the case in Europe when I was on the election campaign.  When people asked me what was the most difficult thing I had to do I mentioned it as it was difficult at the time.  I am very glad that the committee might raise the issue again and that I will fulfil the commitment I made to the Byrne family.</p><p>  I will ask my director general, Ms Bernadette McNally, to talk about the resource issue.  I appreciate the difficulty every public body has at this point in time.  I said a few times yesterday that everybody is under the cosh.  They have austerity measures in effect and they have to shave huge amounts of money off their bills while still providing adequate services to the people.  Inevitably the Department of Health and the HSE are going to be at the centre of the issue because they are making literally life and death decisions and they are trying to husband their resources in particular ways.  My point is not that I am in an ivory tower and I can just make a recommendation and that I am not the one who has to find the money for it but history has shown us how health has sometimes evaded its responsibilities and the legal imperatives on it that ultimately catch up with the Department.  Ultimately, we are all the losers in that regard.  The Department, understandably, acts in a fearful way.  It sees my recommendations and expect that it will cost money.  There is no black and white solution to any problem.  If people come and talk in a frank, open and honest way and find ways through particular issues, that seek to address the resource issue but also seek to address people&rsquo;s real needs and rights then I am confident that ways can be found to a solution.  In terms of the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant, the Department knew for years that it was out of kilter with the equal status legislation and it knew during the boom years as well so there was absolutely no excuse for it not to get its act together in that regard.  I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach&rsquo;s office and the group set up under Sylda Langford are looking at the difficulties experienced by people with disabilities and trying to devise a more modern scheme.</p><p>  I also welcome the fact, as the Chairman said, that people who are living through this rightly demand to be actively involved.  Their mantra is something like not without us, about us.  Despite the economic difficulties we have we are still a wealthy country even compared with some of our colleagues in the rest of Europe.  It should not be beyond either our resources, wit or capacity to make rational decisions and be creative in order to devise a scheme for the relatively small amount of people who are in need in that respect.  That is why I said yesterday at the press conference that it is time for all of us to have grown up discussions about this.  If you will forgive me Chairman, that is the role of the committee to facilitate those discussions.  When people come in with barriers up already it can be difficult to get through to them.  One of the great things the committee can do is attempt to break down the barriers.  I will ask the person who is in charge of all these resources to account for herself.</p></speech>

As regards resources, like every other public body we have been squeezed.  We are down about 16% on the staffing that was sanctioned for us in 2006.  However, we accept that is a requirement in these times and like every other public body we look at how we can provide our service more efficiently.  Despite the fact that we have doubled the number of bodies over which the Ombudsman has jurisdiction, we did not seek additional resources, we simply asked that we would maintain our existing resources and not receive further cuts.  As I speak we continue to negotiate.  We have a very good relationship with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it has very much honoured the commitment to date.</p><p>  The service we provide to members of the public is good but it could be better.  In terms of waiting times, we close 60% of our Ombudsman cases within three months, 77% within six months and 90% within one year.  That is good but there is definitely room for improvement.  The cases that are slow tend to be very complex ones that might involve a death in the health system.  Such cases take a lot of time.  Planning cases, unfortunately, also take a significant amount of time.  We have weekly operational meetings to try to improve the efficiency and get faster response times within existing resources.</p><p>  We are a multifunctional office and there are many benefits to that in terms of moving resources around.  If we see a little bit of a lull in the Office of the Information Commissioner, OIC, activity we move staff across to the Ombudsman and <i>vice versa</i>.  Our biggest resource expenditure is on the Office of the Information Commissioner side.  We are happy to say that when we approached the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform earlier this year for additional resources we got sanction for that.  The recruitment process takes time but we hope to recruit six additional staff for the OIC in the next six months.</p></speech>

I welcome the Ombudsman, thank her for the work she has done and wish her the best of luck and every good wish in her new role.  It is significant and well deserved that she got the position through election.</p><p>  I heard about the mobility grant and transport grant issues at my first meeting.  It was a bolt from the blue.  Since then we have had several meetings and discussions and the matter has been in the media.  At a constituency level one has to deal with people who are terrified.</p><p>  The Ombudsman referred this morning to how the scheme affected a small amount of people in need but in the context of the equality legislation those in need would not get anything given the resources available which would render the schemes completely useless.  Sometimes equality legislation and fairness are not the same thing.  Women drivers are penalised under equality legislation.  They are paying more now because they are treated the same as men in terms of risk.</p> <p>They are treated equally but one could argue it is hardly fair.  It does not always work effectively because sometimes the equality legislation and fairness do not go hand in hand.</p><p> On the freedom of information issue the Ombudsman mentioned in her annual report, I suggest that could be a fundamental piece of work this committee should be doing in terms of being more proactive and fleshing out the point she made about FOI resources in public bodies to determine, as a public oversight committee, the way public bodies are resourcing their FOI requests or even directly engaging with FOI officers to get some feedback and see if this is an issue that should be taken further.</p><p> I was very interested to read Ms O'Reilly's comments on the justice, immigration and naturalisation issues.  Does she have any opinion or comment on the direct provision elements within that Department, which is something that arises often in media?  I have a concern, particularly for families and children in that system, and I believe there should be a role in that regard.</p><p> I was not a Member of the Oireachtas when the lost at sea scheme was being debated but I come from a sea fisheries community in Castletownbere, west Cork, and I can tell the Ombudsman that the people in my community followed very closely the struggle she had personally, and her office, and they empathised with that.  Without going into the details of it I welcome the Ombudsman's comments today.  It was one of those issues that was publicly debated in my community while it was ongoing and we look forward to a further debate on that.</p><p> On the Whip system, I entirely agree that committees such as this one should not be under a Whip system.  I believe in the Whip system for fundamental policy decisions in the D&aacute;il and Seanad Chambers but in committee we should deal with reform adequately.  I agree with Ms O'Reilly's comments on the Whip system, particularly for this committee.  We should not be shackled.  We should be able to deal with consensus and be big enough to do it and make those decisions.</p></speech>

I go along with those comments.  As Chairman I am pleased to report that often it is the Government members of this committee who are more vociferous in challenging the negative implications of Government policy.  It has been my experience that the committee has responded to the Ombudsman's appeals and approached the issue in that way.  It is also a new dispensation in terms of this committee and this D&aacute;il term, which is vital to support the role of her office and to allow the public access our services.  I call the Ombudsman.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.769" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013092600008#G00300"><p>I thank the Deputy.  I agree that sometimes strange outcomes can emerge when people are trying to be equal.</p><p>  Regarding the mobility allowance, the issue was that people could not apply for it if they were over the age of 66 when they applied but if they applied for it under the age of 65 they could keep it.  We had the anomalous situation where we might have had two 68 year olds with similar disabilities, backgrounds, conditions and so on but only one of whom had the allowance and the other had not.  Obviously, that would be deemed to be unfair.</p><p>  Regarding the direct provision, I wrote quite a lengthy article for <i>Studies</i> magazine during the summer, a copy of which is on my website, in which I explored the direct provision issue.  This arose from a complaint I had handled in regard to a woman and her family who had been in direct provision but then one of her young children developed mental health problems.  She left direct provision.  Unusually, she was granted supplementary welfare allowance, SWA.  Normally, people in direct provision get nothing; they are not entitled to anything.  She was given that.  She applied for it but did not get it.  An appeals officer allowed it and that was then overturned.  Was it overturned on appeal?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-26a.773" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2013092600008#G00700"><p>That is right, and this was highly unusual because normally an appeals officer's decision is accepted.  If it has been challenged it would have to be through the courts, therefore, this was very unusual.  In the end we managed to sort that for the woman but by this stage so much time had moved on, her daughter had been placed in voluntary foster care and the entire family split apart.</p><p>  There is an increasing public consciousness about direct provision, and particularly as it relates to children, because at our relative stages in life four or five years is not a big deal but for a child it is an entire part of childhood or adolescence and there are children who spend between three and seven years in direct provision.  I may have quoted here previously Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness who talked about how children can grow up in those units without ever once experiencing a mother or father cooking a meal for them.  I believe it was Michael McDowell, when the direct provision system was brought in, who said that nobody would stay there for longer than six months and that is not the case.  If the Government decides on a particular policy, so be it.  It can be accountable for that policy to the Oireachtas or to the electorate but we all have a duty, as human beings, to see that when that policy goes wrong or is ineffectively operating that children particularly do not suffer.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for his comments on the lost at sea scheme.  One of my good friends in Howth is a fisherman formerly from Castletownbere and I had many conversations with him during that time.  There was a lot of sympathy for the family within the fishing community which, even though it stretches around the coast, is quite close-knit.</p><p>  I welcome the Chairman's comments on the Whip system.  I am aware of the difficulties.  We witnessed it during the debate on the abortion legislation and all of that and as I noted the other day, the Whip system can sometimes be a protection for members also because it protects them from undue pressure.  At the same time I have always had a strong sense in this committee that there is a feeling that if it is going to work it has to work together.  It does not have executive power as such.  It will be making recommendations and ultimately the Government will decide on certain things, therefore, it has that  freedom to make recommendations in a unified way, assuming all the members agree, but if at all possible it should not be split on party political lines.</p></speech>

I have raised many issues with the office over the years.  I recall particularly a change made to the carer's allowance, which was a very restrictive scheme when it was introduced, and also issues relating to local authorities such as raising a road which was perhaps desirable but caused flooding in individual houses or a number of houses.</p><p>  I apologise that I must leave to go to the D&aacute;il to chair a session but my brief question is on resources.  This is my first meeting of this committee, therefore, this question is for the Chairman as well as for the director.  Regarding engaging with people, whether it is this committee meeting with groups in regional meetings - the Ombudsman's office has had regional meetings also in the past and it is something I would welcome for the future - with all the technology available it is still important to meet people who have an issue.  There is a host of issues which I will not raise now but some of them have been raised by my colleagues and by the Ombudsman.  Does the Ombudsman envisage that this consultation will continue?  Information meetings have been very useful in the past and I hope they will be useful in the future.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for noting the personal element in any of these issues and it is something I have always taken on board in my work.  Sometimes we can get blinded by technology and many people, particularly older people, have felt further ostracised from the apparatus of the State by having to negotiate IT to get through to it.</p> <p>Staff from my office continue to conduct regional visits around the country.  We think this is very important and that they should continue, even if increasing numbers of people are contacting us through e-mail, the Internet and so on.  As for the purpose of this office, one of its functions is to continue to show a human face, that is, for someone to actually sit down and listen to people.  That is still a vital function.  We also try to make our services as accessible as possible.  People can write to us on the back of an envelope, ring us or come in to us.  We try not to be bureaucratic in this regard.  Thereafter, once an investigator is working on a case, they can communicate with him or her freely also.</p></speech>

It is prestigious for herself and the country and members wish her well.  </p><p>  Although I will be obliged to leave to attend another meeting, I seek clarification on a couple of points on the general operation of the office.  In respect of investigative officers in the community, does the office have an outreach facility whereby in the case of individual difficult cases that require further clarification or elucidation, there is provision for staff to go out and meet people in the community?</p></speech>

Sometimes we might be involved in a planning case in which someone has tried to describe a particular issue, for example, about a road.  I recall one of the most intractable issues we ever dealt with pertained to Uggool beach in County Mayo.  Sometimes we receive enough information through photographs, descriptions and so on, but very often we simply go down, put on the Wellington boots and actually meet people.  Consequently, we are very free in that sense.</p></speech>

I was recently obliged to deal with a case involving a child from my constituency who was in hospital in Dublin.

We have looked at many issues pertaining to the allocation of housing during the years and noticed the different approaches that tend to be taken in different areas.  We have always sought to have these systems rationalised and made clear in order that people know exactly where they are on a list, the reason they are on that list and what are the criteria.  I am sure it is the Deputy's experience that people are often confused as to the reason such and such a person got a house and they did not.  Policy is policy and while Members of the Oireachtas decide on it, we deal with its implementation and it must be clear.  We dealt with a case which has been included in the annual report in which a woman sought to move house.  She had particular social problems and needed to move.  We dealt with that case by asking for reports from the particular local authority and on seeing them, discerned that the authority really had indulged in a box-ticking exercise.  It had not looked at her particular circumstances and made its decision based thereon.  As a result of that single case, however, the local authority in question has changed its processes to make them more clear and fairer.  In addition, the complainant did get onto the transfer list and was rehoused.  That is quite a significant part of our work.</p></speech>

While I am glad for her, it is a loss for us that she is leaving.  In my experience and observations of the Ombudsman, she has been a fearless champion of people's rights.  She has done exemplary work and certainly will be a hard act to follow.  I hope whoever succeeds her will live up to the standards she has set.</p><p>  I seek the Ombudsman's comments on the relationship between rights and resources, which is at the heart of the issues she has highlighted regarding the mobility allowance and the motorised transport grant.  If one establishes there are certain rights or a set of rights, possibly on foot of considering the circumstances of one group of people, and it then turns out that many others, in fact, have that entitlement, they actually do have it.  For example, while they might not have been lifelong sufferers of a disability, they become disabled as they get older and, therefore, qualify for such entitlements.  They have that right because one has established it as a legal right and there are two ways in which one can deal with it.  One can either level down the rights or level up the resources.  If we establish a set of rights, our absolute duty and obligation - unless we think we made a mistake in asserting that something was a right in the first place - is to find a way to match resources with the rights we have established.  I believe the Ombudsman has exposed this challenge for Members of the Oireachtas on an issue that is very important for those who are involved but also more generally.  This is something Members must do.  If something is a right, it must be a priority and Members must find the resources.</p><p>  I also believe the Ombudsman's point on the human face of the State, politics and public bodies is of huge importance.  As she is leaving, the Ombudsman may be in a position to comment on the ongoing debate about parish pump politics, clientelism and so on.  There is a debate on whether Deputies should simply become legislators who are up on high making laws and should not bother with the stuff that comes in through the clinic door.  The Ombudsman's experience and the subjects about which she is talking are proof that this is not the case.  This is not to suggest there is not a problem and there is not a tension between these two issues.  However, it appears that one must begin with the human reality because were one to ignore it, one would get oneself into serious bother.  It is human beings encountering the legal system, the structures, the procedures and so on that exposes the anomalies, the contradictions, the shortcomings and the challenges for legislators.  However, I am interested in the Ombudsman's views in this regard because this is a big philosophical debate about which way politics should go.  I certainly am of the view that Members should not abandon human beings because it is their experiences that point us in the right direction.  While one does not want to have clientelism and one should not be doing favours for some people and not others, one absolutely should be championing people's rights.</p> <p>As this is the issue or human reality that most often comes through my door and I see reference to quite a high number of complaints in the area of local authorities, I wonder whether they could say a little more about that.  The biggest issue that comes through my door is housing.  I do not know whether that is the Ombudsman's experience.  In so far as citizens have problems with local authorities, the biggest issue is housing.  Of course, much of it is merely to do with resources and officials who are managing a completely inadequate stock of housing and under resourced at every level, but then they are at the front line of the anger and frustration of citizens.  I would be interested to hear whether that is a big feature of the complaints.</p><p> One aspect of that is the anti-social behaviour issue.  That is a complex issue because the victims of anti-social behaviour must be looked after, protected, etc., but would the Ombudsman have concerns about the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009?  Even an anti-social officer in my local authority area of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown described the powers he held as draconian.  I am not a legal expert but looking at some of the powers that these officers hold, I would have thought that in some cases they run counter to international human rights in that there seems anti-social officers have the ability to make judgments where there is no recourse for those against whom judgments are made as to their anti-social status.  I wonder whether that is an issue that needs to be looked at in terms of asserting citizen's rights in local authority housing.</p><p> I commend the Ombudsman on raising the issue of the need to extend the ambit of the Ombudsman's office but, more generally, to extend rights to the area of direct provision, asylum and prisoners.  I believe that in a few years' time the scandal that will emerge from what is going on in direct provision will be on a par with the Magdalen laundries.  What is happening is shocking.  The more I hear about it, I believe there is a category of people in this country who, essentially, have been put outside the normal standards of civilisation and rights.  It is appalling.  Consigning children to a childhood in a hostel is shocking.  I commend the Ombudsman in that regard.  I wonder has she anything to say to us about what we should be doing on that issue.</p><p> As she is leaving, is there anything else Ms O'Reilly wants to say to us about what our priorities should be?  She highlighted quite a few.  Is there anything else she wishes to say to us about issues that have emerged that need to be addressed urgently?</p></speech>

There is an expression, "hiding in plain sight", and direct provision is one of those issues that is hiding in plain sight.  He has probably read - I mentioned this here previously - a number of articles about what happens in those areas, which, as he probably will be aware, are not subject to inspection.  All nursing homes and cr&egrave;ches are subject to inspection but these direct provision centres are not, and one must wonder why not.</p><p>  Interestingly, I was doing some more research on this because RTE is doing a piece on it in the not too distant future and a particular court case in Northern Ireland recently was brought to my attention.  I believe it was earlier this year but Mr. Butler can clarify this.</p></speech>

Essentially, it was a comment on the inadequacy of the circumstances and facilities for asylum seekers in Ireland.</p></speech>

Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke of rights and resources and, of course, that is the issue with which everybody is wrestling at present.  I am sure the Government, no more than anybody else, would love to give everybody the full expression of their rights, whether in relation to disability, education, housing or anything else, but there are limited resources.  However, governments do make choices and I imagine that is the rows behind closed door going on about the budget are about what choices one makes.</p><p>  I expressed concern about the mobility allowance.  I raised an issue that it was illegal and the response was that it was okay, they would get rid of it.  It was not a great outcome.  Recently, we became aware - I have spoken about this in the past couple of days - that up until now children with a diagnosis of ADHD or autism were being given the long-term illness card, which entitles one to certain services, medications, etc., and on which there is not an income limit.  Then we received a complaint from somebody who stated that they had sought to have the card and it was denied to them, and they stated that applicants are getting the card in other areas.  We looked at this and we saw that in most areas this card was virtually automatically being given out to the parents of children with this diagnosis.  When we pointed this out to the Department and asked it to rationalise the system, it rationalised it by deciding that it would not give the long-term illness card to anybody else.  Obviously, that was a fairly difficult response to deal with as well.  On a personal human level, one thinks one is doing right and then discovers doing so has inflicted damage on others.  I suppose, if I am comforting myself about it, I say that these are policy choices that are not made by me but, obviously, there were actions that were provoked by that.  That is perhaps something the committee, if it so decides, could look into.</p><p>  We also had the issue around so-called discretionary medical cards.  One will have heard much talk anecdotally about this in the Oireachtas and elsewhere.  It is elected representatives who find out what is really happening on the ground as opposed to what we are told is what is happening.  Persons are not getting medical cards when before they had got them or their medical cards are being taken from them.  We heard one set of statistics in the D&aacute;il the other day.  We heard another Deputy spoke of what he had been hearing and experiencing on the ground.  Our experience in the Office of the Ombudsman is definitely that there are cutbacks, that there is rationing taking place.  The rationing is not that the eligibility criteria have been changed but that now they are applied rigorously.  Let us say, beforehand, if the income threshold was &euro;300 and one was over that, they might look at the other elements of one's profile and the cost of one's illness, such as the amount of medication one had to take, or disability and then use their discretion and give one the card.  That appears to have not completely gone, but certainly been curtailed.  My point is - I am aware I am like a broken record on this - that the Government can choose to do what it chooses to do and it then takes its changes to the Oireachtas or the people, but what it should not do is dissemble or pretend that schemes have not changed when clearly they have.</p> <p>They should be open with people because, as I am sure all members have experienced in their constituency work, the stress that is added to already-existing stress by not knowing or not understanding and the time that is wasted by people writing, ringing or e-mailing while trying to get explanations for this, are awful.  Moreover, it does not have to be imposed on people; it is as simple as that.  It very often is political spin, which is deeply unfair to people and that is the issue.</p><p> On clientelism, I think Deputy Harrington did not realise I was obliged to go through an election campaign to become European Ombudsman.  Yes I did, and hats off to anyone who does it for a living because it was the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life.  Obviously, the way in which the system operates in Ireland is that those who are not good local representatives will not stay to legislate.  It is absolutely up to the Oireachtas to change the balance.  As to how it should go about it, I do not know and it would not be right for me to do it.  However, right from my early days in office, I always have appreciated how important are the people in these Houses for the work of my office.  One of my first initiatives was to work on a piece of work with Oireachtas Members.  I brought out a booklet to show cases that Oireachtas Members had brought directly to my office to encourage them because whatever about e-mail, regional visits and so on, the best communicators of what my office does are the Members of Parliament.  However, it will be a while before the Irish political system changes to allow pure legislators or whatever.</p><p> As for anti-social behaviour, Deputy Boyd Barrett made an interesting point.  Earlier this year, we had a discussion in the office about the number of complaints we were receiving with regard to that.  Obviously, people are the victims of anti-social behaviour but the Deputy raised a very good point about people who effectively are told to sling their hook because of the powers of those particular officers.   While I am unsure whether we have received such cases, were we to so do we obviously would consider what criteria these officials use to decide, as well as whether these people had a right to be heard, were they told about what they were doing or whether they had a right to state their case.  The right to be heard is a fundamental human right and if they did not, that would be a serious breach.  Obviously it can be difficult, given the nature of these issues, which can lead to huge tensions within a community, a street or between a few houses.  However, it is interesting that the Deputy indicated that the official in question felt his powers were almost draconian.  This may be something for my successor to investigate.</p><p> As we have discussed over recent meetings, the best thing this joint committee can do is to give real support to the Ombudsman.  That does not mean blind allegiance to or agreement with me but the most I can hope for is that whatever decisions are made by the joint committee will come about as a result of a consensus and not along party political lines.  In addition, I appreciate it sometimes can be hard because all the members have exceptionally busy lives.  They are pulled this way and that and sometimes might not get much political credit for the work they do in this joint committee.  However, it is really important that they see things through to the end and that they continue to exert pressure.  I was very pleased when the Chairman recounted how the joint committee has brought in a Secretary General again and how it has persisted in pursuing the matter because it can be easy for such things to tail off and be lost.  When the Ombudsman presents a report to the members present, it is an enormous deal for us because if it does not work here it has huge implications both for the particular investigation and in respect of the trickle-down effect.  This is because public bodies watch what happens here and if they see there was a ho-hum result or if someone was not made accountable, then really the question will be why should they bother respecting our recommendations in future.  This is the reason it is so important.</p></speech>
