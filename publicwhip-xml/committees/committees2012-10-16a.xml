    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600003#C00100"><p>We have two groups today, the first being the Irish Dairy Board.  I welcome Mr. Vincent Buckley, chairman, Mr. Joe O'Flynn, managing director of consumer foods division, Ms Anne Randles, secretary, and Mr. Bernard Condon, director of dairy trade and ingredients.</p><p>  Before we commence I must go through the issue of privilege.  I bring to the delegates' attention that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible you should not criticise or make charges against any persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable. </p><p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I call on Mr. Buckley to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Buckley" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600004#D00100"><p>I am accompanied by Ms Anne Randels, Mr. Joe O'Flynn and Mr. Bernard Condon who will help me to answer queries on my presentation and other questions on the Irish Dairy Board.</p><p>  Our core purpose is to build a profitable route to market for Irish dairy products.  Ours is a co-operative owned by our member suppliers, with industry and farmer representatives at board level.  We are the exporting arm of the dairy industry.  The board was established in 1961 as a semi-State company and became a co-operative in 1973.  We have a turnover of &euro;2 billion.  It is a multinational company, with over 3,300 employees, of whom 150 are in Ireland, while the rest are based mainly in the United Kingdom, elsewhere in the European Union and the United States.  We are the owner of the Kerrygold brand, Ireland's only international food brand.  Our business is undergoing a significant transformation in preparation for the removal of milk quotas in 2015 and to meet our Food Harvest 2020 targets, as members will see as the presentation progresses.  We are responsible for marketing Ireland's unique selling point - its world class milk which cannot be matched anywhere in the global market.  We take great pleasure in promoting a premium food and offer a product that is Irish, pure, tasty and natural.</p><p>  The next slide shows the level of business done by the company.  We export 270,000 tonnes annually, which means that every day 34 containers of food leave our shores or 12,000 containers per annum.  Members can see a representative range of our products on the same slide.  We have three business platforms - consumer foods, dairy trade and ingredients, and distribution.  Consumer foods account for roughly 40% of our turnover.  We have subsidiaries in Germany and the United Kingdom which are critical to our business there.  Consumer foods represent the branded part of our business.  Dairy trade and ingredients are non-branded.  They represent the value-added ingredients and formulation side of our business.  The distribution company is one the Irish Dairy Board acquired 30 years ago.  There is a distribution-wide business in the United States.  </p><p>  The next slide shows that we have three branded product categories, namely, butter and blends, cheese and milk powders.  I shall make a brief comment on each of them.  Kerrygold is the No. 1 butter brand in Germany, the No. 1 imported brand in the USA and has a retail selling price, RSP, figure of &euro;500 million globally.  Kerrygold Extra is one of our most successful campaigns which was launched in Germany in 2009.  The product has exceeded our expectations.  </p><p>  On our cheese sector, Pilgrims Choice cheddar is ranked No. 2 in the UK market.  Dubliner cheese is also one of our brands which is doing very well in the United States.  I have been told that it is enjoying double digit market growth.  Another lesser known brand was launched in conjunction with Tesco in recent times.  Our milk powders are mainly for sale in African markets.      </p><p>  I shall outline how well our brands are performing.  Recent statistics show that in 2010 there was 7% volume growth and 21% value growth.  In 2011 there was 5% volume growth and 19% value growth.  In 2012 we have set ourselves a target of 7% volume growth.</p><p>  The next slide indicates the footprint of our export markets.  We export to 80 markets around the world and were honoured to have been awarded the title of exporter of the year in 2010.  Members can see from the graph that our markets are well positioned all over the world.  Our focus for the period 2012 to 2015 is on supporting our commitment to Food Harvest 2020 using the four pillars of operational excellence, value added growth, market expansion, and talent placement and development.  We believe our business strategy is working across the board, as is clear from our Food Harvest 2020 implementation update.  We are confident that our core markets will continue to deliver strong growth, with significant volumes across our branded range, in the coming years.  We are developing new marketing and distribution channels in new markets, for example, in Algeria and Russia.  Last year the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, visited both regions with our team as part of a trade mission and was very successful.  The Middle East and north African markets are important to us and there is a great opportunity to develop new market routes for our branded powder products in sub-Saharan Africa in countries such as Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola and Nigeria.  Members can question my colleagues on this subject later.</p><p>  As part of our strategy for developing markets and expanding the demand for milk powder, in the past 18 months we have placed 15 new personnel in market positions in places such as China, the Middle East, north Africa, Russia and Nigeria.  We have also embarked on an acquisitions programme.  In the past year we have acquired three new businesses - Thiel Cheese and Meadow Ingredients in the USA and The Cheese Warehouse in the United Kingdom.  We believe the latter acquisition will give us a figure of roughly 5,000 tonnes and a direct route to market.  Our growth targets can be achieved by having offices and sales teams positioned in certain markets around the world.  They can also be achieved through having joint ventures, local partnerships, agents, local distribution systems and acquisitions.  We realise every market does not have the same fit and that each market has its requirements in gaining a footprint.  I have outlined how we will strive to achieve our objectives in these markets. </p><p>  With regard to value being added through research and development and premium returns, we are investing in new product development, the acquisition of consumer insights and marketing.  In order to achieve valued added growth, we must identify customer needs through market research.  In recent times we have increased our marketing spend.  An additional &euro;7 million was allocated in 2012, while &euro;1.5 million has been spent on our innovation initiatives, including developing our consumer insight capability.  As members can see from my presentation, in 2011 we launched 40 new products between the two categories of consumer foods and dairy trade and ingredients.  We are enhancing value through co-opetition in respect of Kerrygold Cashel Blue.</p><p>  As part of the Food Harvest 2020 process, we have three business models.  Lean and efficient manufacturing is an important business model that we introduced at three of our UK sites and which resulted in substantial savings.  The process has been rolled out across other areas of our business.  We are updated at our monthly meetings and know that the lean and efficient business model has resulted in substantial savings.  There are a number of projects in train with our members to integrate the supply chain more efficiently.  The business transformation or right-sizing business model is crucial to allow us to achieve our goals.  We have completed a programme of non-core asset disposal.  We have also completed a &euro;65 million capital investment programme in our UK subsidiaries and are actively involved in a market and acquisitions programme.  We are busy at board level.  We have strengthened our financial capability with a new innovative funding facility that was put in place last year, of which members are probably aware.  We refinanced the business which provided for growth and funding for our members in the short to medium term.</p><p>  As marketeers, we work closely with our members and processors.  Many meetings have taken place between both parties to ensure production possibilities are married with market requirements.  It is important that we balance production growth and market opportunities.</p> <p>We have categorised the sales opportunities.  The management team has identified the product type that needs to be manufactured and whether it should go through the branded, ingredients or food service channel.  Will substantial growth be achieved through either incremental sales in our present businesses, new customers and new routes to markets?  What challenges do we face beyond 2015?  I will not go into them in great detail, but we see the following challenges: matching sales with production growth; investment will be challenging; substantial investment will be required in plant, personnel, research and development, marketing and acquisitions, to mention just a few.  We also see a need to focus on value added products and increased flexibility in manufacturing to respond to market needs.  It is vital that processing facilities are flexible to produce the quantities we may need at various times.  It goes without saying the base product must be globally competitive.  It is vital also that the home environment be conducive to the Irish Dairy Board competing in the global marketplace.   Market volatility is a given and managing that volatility will prove challenging.  We will develop the sustainability platform, but we recognise that ensuring a comprehensive and cohesive national sustainability platform for Irish dairying to drive Dairy Ireland's unique selling points is crucial.</p><p> How can the Government work with us to deliver on our commitment to Food Harvest 2020?  Support for investment in processing to meet market needs post the quota environment is vital.  Members may be aware of a document launched by the IFA with the help of the processing industry.  I see the Chairman has a copy and perhaps other members of the committee have seen it also.  Funding of the industry is vital and farmers must invest significantly at farm level.  However, it will be very difficult for the farmers of Ireland to fund the processing industry.  Therefore, we believe incentives need to be given, as outlined in the booklet to ensure investors will invest in the industry and make it possible for it to develop.  We have set out the basis for funding which is urgently needed by the industry.  It is not within the scope of farmers and the industry to fund investment.</p><p> There needs to be a pro-business support commitment across all Government agencies from national policy formulation to implementation.  A pro-business approach is vital.  </p><p> We stress the importance of Government supported specific trade missions to emerging markets.  In many cases, it will require a government to government approach.  We wish to impress on members the importance of these missions and the fact that they should be acutely aware of the importance of Government support in that area.  </p><p> The Irish Dairy Board is on target to deliver on its commitments under Food Harvest 2020.  The transformation of our business is ongoing to meet the new challenges.  We are working in close collaboration with our members and developing new products to market through the various channels.  Our chief executive is abroad on business dealing specifically with that issue.  It is important that we continue to invest in new innovative products to meet the needs of our global markets, our sales team and place more people in the market.  That is something we have been doing and will continue to do.  We are committed to operating in a sustainable fashion and promoting sustainable production both at farm and company level.  We recognise the importance of the dairy industry to the economy and the benefits it can bring to it in term of generating revenue.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  My colleagues will answer questions raised and discuss the issues involved.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600005#E00300"><p>I welcome the delegation.  We have been given a very comprehensive overview of the work of the Irish Dairy Board.  Mr. Buckley or his team might tell us the percentage of the dairy products produced in the country for which his company accounts.  Second, we are getting a new dictionary.  The word "chillax" was listed in the new dictionary issued last week.  I also note the new term used in the presentation - "co-opetition".  Will Mr. Buckley explain what it means?</p><p>  Innovation, new product development, sophistication and meeting consumer demand are key in creating a substantial level of sales.  This requires research, development and science.  I take it that much of the change in the products the Irish Dairy Board produces is based on scientific input.  Is Mr. Buckley satisfied that, as a nation, we are investing enough in the scientific element of product development in order that we have the best quality innovative products to place on the market?  I note that he believes the Government should invest in increasing capacity.  Is he satisfied, if the capacity is available and the investment in the scientific element of product development is made, that he can achieve market share and profitably on world markets for everything we can produce post the ending of quotas?  That would add significantly to national wealth.  I know that he has outlined his strategy, but will he elaborate further on this point?</p><p>  I understand that under state aid rules, there are limits to the amount the Government can give to industries in certain regions.  How can it help, either directly or indirectly, in increasing capacity?  Is there other assistance available in different regions to increase capacity?  In other words, if one invests in different regions, can the Government under state aid rules provide for different levels of assistance?  Can assistance be given indirectly, for example, through the provision of basic infrastructure and so on that would be critical in the development of capacity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600005#E00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Buckley and thank him for his presentation, in the course of which he mentioned managing market volatility.  Will he elaborate further on that point?  Is he referring to competition from emerging developing countries or is the issue wider than this?  With the milk quota system due to come to an end in 2015, is he concerned about the free market determining the level of supply?</p> <p>Many of us with small or medium-sized farms have concerns about the ending of quotas and larger producers coming to the top, which could prove detrimental to smaller producers.  It could have long-term effects.</p><p> It was mentioned that investment was required in research and development, marketing acquisitions, plant and personnel.  Is there a linkage with the board's research and development with Government support or the support of other agencies within the wider agricultural community?</p><p> Mr. Buckley has mentioned areas into which the board is trying to break such as China, Russia and so on.  China is a huge market which offers huge potential if a breakthrough can be made.  Is Mr. Buckley optimistic about the possibility of expanding into these areas?  An area of whcih there has been no mention is South America.  Mr. Buckley might elaborate in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600006#F00200"><p>Following on from the point made by Deputy Ferris, there is a large white population in the middle of central Asia.  Iran is one of the countries to which we have traditionally exported beef, for example.  I wonder if any attempt has been made to export to or develop markets in Iran, across the Levant and into the newer states of central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan which has an increasing middle class.  Similarly, while Brazil and Argentina are countries which produce a lot of beef, I am not aware that they produce the same amount of milk products.  Is any attempt being made to develop markets in South America, other than Chile which has been referred to?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600006#F00300"><p>I am sure I speak for every member when I say the work the Irish Dairy Board has been doing and continues to do is impressive.  I know the jewel in the crown is Germany, but I am curious to know if the shamrock has been abandoned as a brand?  I am aware there was a court case in Germany, but is the shamrock used elsewhere?</p><p>  In the context of the key branded product categories, I assume - they might expand on this point - the delegates spend a considerable amount of time on testing various packaging.  The Kerrygold butter brand has been hugely successful.  I do not believe it has ever been changed since it was first introduced.  I was an emigrant in London in the late 1960s and early 1970s when I saw it with great pride.  It has been kept, but in the case of the cheese and milk powder products, I am curious to know how the particular colourings were arrived at and whether they have made an impact in selling Ireland, or is the objective just to blend in with other food products?</p><p>  On investing in new products and finding new markets, are the delegates involved in co-ownership arrangements in any of the markets in which they are involved, or how do they get into these markets?  I presume they market test their products and then launch them, but do they have local partners into which they buy or share with?  I ask that question because I note they are moving into sub-Saharan Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola and Nigeria.  There is a company in Zambia called Zambeef Products - I am not sure if the delegates are familiar with it - which is headed up by a Limerick man, Mr. Francis Grogan, who worked either with Bord Bia or the Irish Dairy Board before emigrating to Zambia.  I know this because I was a member of a delegation which visited Zambia in 2006 when we were introduced to him.  I declare an interest in the sense that following that visit I bought a small number of shares in the company which I watch assiduously.  They have not gone through the roof because in recent years the Zambian kwacha has been devalued, but I believe the business is now one of the leading food companies in Zambia and that it has started to expand into Nigeria and other African countries.  It has its own manufacturing and distribution networks.  It produces chicken and beef products.  I do not believe it produces dairy products, mainly because of the type of animal it has, but I do know it is now involved at a local level in retail outlets located across Zambia.  I raise this issue, first, because I want to bring it to the attention of the delegates and, second, to highlight the Irish connection.  </p><p>  In terms of having a marketing strategy and trying to break into new markets, obviously the delegates are looking at Africa.  We all talk about China, but Africa is increasingly becoming more developed.  It is developing a larger middle class with more consumer spending power.  The delegates have identified Nigeria in particular in that regard.  That is the reason I have focused on that aspect, but in terms of marketing, how do the delegates decide on the packaging for their products?  Do they change it often and do they retain it once it proves successful?  The food industry is so competitive and the major food companies, Nestl&eacute;, Kelloggs and others, are constantly changing their packaging.  I know it is expensive to do this, but I am curious to know the delegates' policy position in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1129" speakername="Susan O'Keeffe" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600006#F00400"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentation and continued work.  They say in their summary that the board is on target to deliver on its commitments.  Are they on target to delivering on them, regardless of what is mentioned in the previous box in which it is stated it needs various things to be done?  Mr. Buckley mentioned the provision of support for investment in processing.  Is that a requirement of the board for it to succeed, or does he believe it will succeed in any case?</p><p>  Mr. Buckley spoke about emerging markets.  What is his view on China which has been mentioned a great deal?  Has he identified particular markets?</p><p>  On the Kerrygold brand, it has always amazed me that another brand of similar quality has not emerged.  It has been in use for a very long time, but is there scope for another brand?  Is Kerrygold a brand that could be used in the promotion of Irish meat, even though it belongs to the Irish Dairy Board?  What is Mr. Buckley's policy in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600006#F00500"><p>I thank Mr. Buckley for his in-depth and informative presentation.  I will make two brief points.  In the section, Looking to the Future Together, he refers to funding support for market-led research and development and innovation.  Does this suggest he has not received support up to now or that the support provided is not adequate?  He might expand on this, while being mindful of the good news announced this day last week by the Kerry Group.  Its expansion is very much in the area of research and development.</p><p>  In summarising Mr. Buckley referred to investment in new innovative products, the board's sales teams and so on, but investment requires money.  He might expand on his discussions with the banking and lending institutions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1169" speakername="Mary Ann O'Brien" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600006#F00600"><p>I thank Mr. Buckley for an excellent presentation.  Coming from a small sector of the food industry, I have always admired the brand.  One can go into a supermarket in the middle of nowhere in Florida and see that pound of butter on the shelf, which is no mean feat.</p><p>  One of the delegates might provide greater clarity on the vision for the board's turnover in 2015, 2018 and 2020 with reference to the Harvest 2020 targets.  To develop one of Deputy Martin Heydon's questions, does that turnover have a reliance on capital expenditure?  </p><p>  Deputy Martin Heydon is looking to the board to open a research and development centre of excellence in Ireland, he hopes in the Naas area.  Why not?  I heard Kerry Group representatives being interviewed on radio a few nights ago and it was not just because they loved Ireland that they located here.  It was done from a business perspective.</p> <p>In dreaming the dream is there any chance or aspiration that the Irish Dairy Board might build such a centre in Ireland?  </p><p> Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the concept of "co-opetition".  Will the delegates expand on what is meant by it?  I may be moving into the territory of Mr. Aidan Cotter of Bord Bia who is due to appear before the joint committee later this afternoon and to whom I greatly look forward to hearing.  However, I reiterate the Irish Dairy Board has enjoyed such amazing success and has such an amazing reach worldwide.  Imagine if it really engaged in "co-opetition" by mixing the meat and dairy sectors and even the private Kerrygold brand.  Imagine if such a mix was possible because, as the professors from Harvard told members one day, when Mr. Cotter had organised a briefing on the Food Harvest 2020 and Pathways for Growth reports, although Ireland is a tiny speck, it is the grass-fed cattle centre of the world.  Who else has grass-fed cattle and milk production in such abundance?  What if this new word in the dictionary, "co-opetition", could be used and we really were to work together?  I would love to hear the delegates expand on these thoughts.  </p><p> As the board is so important to the country, I would like to hear a little more about its risk assessment policy.  What if certain things go wrong in its sector or, imagining the unthinkable, if something were to go wrong in respect of Irish food safety?  What level of support does the Irish Dairy Board receive from the European Union?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600007#G00200"><p>I will make two points.  Senator Susan O'Keeffe made a point on targets.  I consider the targets set and "co-opetition" to be linked because unless one has "co-opetition" in developing production capacity and achieving growth, internally and externally, as the board's chief executive officer observed when Food Harvest 2020 was announced, there is not much point in producing more to stand still.  This must be done with a view to increasing wealth and export value as opposed to simply growing production because putting all of the money into investment initiatives - regardless of whether it is in the production of stainless steel or anything else - will be a futile exercise unless it brings added value to the sector and the country.  This is the challenge.  I refer to Senator susan O'Keeffe's other point.  The last two slides on the challenges and looking to the future summarise the real challenge to match growth with production, to manage volatility and to receive support from the Government in restrained economic circumstances.  One should be mindful of the position on tax relief.  In many cases, one hears people simplistically calling for the abolition of tax allowances or breaks when, in fact, they are meant to be jobs and growth stimuli.  Consequently, when such allowances are being proposed, one must be careful that this is the end target and that what is proposed is a tax relief investment policy, as opposed to a tax evasion scheme.  One should bear this in mind.  I invite Mr. Buckley and his colleagues to respond to these questions.</p></speech>

To do justice to them, it would be appropriate to ask the members of our management team to begin to answer them.  They should pick out the questions they consider to be specific to their particular area because that is the best way we can get across the information on the business.  Consequently, with the permission of the Chairman, I will ask Ms Randles to begin to answer some of them.  My colleagues will note the questions that have not been answered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Randles" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600007#G00400"><p>I will take the questions in the order in which they were asked.  I apologise if we miss out on a few, but I will answer a few, after which my other colleagues will come in on some of the other areas.  </p><p>  On the first question from Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v on the exports of the Irish Dairy Board, we showed a slide to demonstrate that we account for 60% of total dairy exports.  We are a significant exporter of Irish cheese; probably 80% of total Irish cheese exports pass through the Irish Dairy Board.  A significant proportion, perhaps 70%, of total butter exports also goes through it.  As members can see, it really is synonymous with the Kerrygold brand.  While the Irish Dairy Board is less involved on the milk powder side, more than half of milk powder exports still go through it.  That is the general profile of our exporting pattern.  We are not involved in some areas, the most obvious one probably being the infant formula business outside Ireland.  There is a much greater focus on consumer products such as butter and cheese, as well as the dairy ingredients side of these two businesses.  The board certainly is the majority exporter, significantly more so in the case of butter and cheese.</p><p>  The Deputy asked whether, if there were to be the necessary capacity and research and development, we could find markets for the additional products.  The message we wish to convey to members is that we certainly can.  We believe strongly that we are on target to meet our commitments, which we perceive to be developing the markets for the additional milk that will be produced, as well as the additional dairy products.  It is an important focus for us in respect of our strategic plan and we believe we are on track in developing these markets.  To be specific, they are probably more the emerging markets, that is, the new areas in which demand is growing most.  As to whether there are markets for the products we produce, yes there are.  I believe representatives of IBEC appeared before the joint committee last week and gave these figures also.  The basic fundamentals of the dairy markets are positive.  The message is positive in that overall, globally, growth in demand for dairy products is exceeding supply.  In that sense, this is a demand-driven market for us and we believe we can capture these markets for Irish dairy products.  While there is greater growth potential through the brand in our core markets, equally we must develop the new markets in the emerging areas.  That is the major focus of our strategy, as the chairman mentioned to the joint committee.</p><p>  There was a question on China and whether there is potential there.  There is, undoubtedly, potential there for Irish dairy exports.  Perhaps China is known more as a market for whole milk powder.  As matters stand, Ireland exports a considerable amount of whey.  As for there being potential to grow the market, we perceive it more to be on the branded product side.  The main problem is that, unlike New Zealand, Ireland does not have a free trade agreement with China.  This puts us at a competitive disadvantage, in that New Zealand has preferential market access which, obviously, puts all non-New Zealand product at a disadvantage.  </p><p>  A question was asked about South America.  Our focus is on where there is real growth in demand.  We identified this much more in Africa than in South America which, to a large extent, already is supplied from within.  Brazil is an obvious case in point, as it is a significant producer of dairy products and more or less self-sufficient.  Collectively, were we to take together all of these countries as a region, it is self-sufficient unlike, for example, Africa and Asia, which is the reason the target must be centred on these continents, as opposed to South America.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.22" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Flynn" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600007#G00500"><p>I will add to that point made on growth potential.  Clearly, we have a commitment to build our sales in our existing network within the European Union and North America.  We see considerable growth potential.  That said, if one considers where most of the basic dairy consumption growth is taking place, it is in emerging markets and being driven by population growth, GDP growth, the westernisation of eating habits and the introduction of dairy products as part of a nutritional programme at school level.  China is a particular example in this regard.  It is a case in point as its per capita consumption is still very low, at only approximately 30 kg per head.  When one considers that the world average is approximately 100 kg per head and that the European figure is closer to 300 kg, there is huge potential in this regard.</p> <p>As for other regions, while central Asia presents a political challenge in securing market access, Iran, Iraq and other countries in the region offer long-term potential because, as has been noted, they have a tradition of consuming dairy products.</p><p> On the concept of "co-opetition" and how we define it, I should probably ask Mr. Aidan Cotter to comment.  The Irish Dairy Board views this as collaborating with like-minded players to develop stronger market positions for Ireland Inc.  To cite one example, Kerrygold is working with Cashel Blue cheese in the United States market.  Cashel Blue is an excellent product that is artisan in character and complements Kerrygold in that provenance and Irish personality are two central parts of the company's brand values.  The natural piece - the honesty, if one likes - built into these brand values is of major importance in building our position. </p><p> Senator Paschal Mooney asked a question on packaging.  To take the Kerrygold brand, we have completely revamped the logo and packaging in the past two years as part of an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary change.  Part of the challenge in any exercise of this nature is the need to maintain continuity in terms of brand recognition, given that a consumer will spend five seconds scanning a shelf in passing.  The gold foil is symbolic to the extent that it was the starting point of the Kerrygold brand.  We have held this position, although we have had many imitators.  It is extremely important to retain the identity of the brand.</p><p> The other colours, for example, in our powder brands have as much to do with having a visual impact in markets in which literacy levels may not be high.  Obtaining ready recognition for one's product is extremely important.  That is one observation on the issue.</p></speech>

The company has undertaken considerable consumer research.  The use of green is interesting in the sense that it is an identity that is of major importance to Ireland Inc.  The work done in building the Kerrygold brand has been extremely relevant in that regard.  The work Bord Bia is doing on the Origin Green programme is important in terms of Ireland taking ownership of that green space which we can justifiably claim.</p><p>  A number of speakers raised issues about investment in research and development.  We all recognise that the level of investment in research and development in Ireland is probably not adequate.  The announcement of investment by the Kerry Group last week was a major plus for the country and the industry.  The Irish Dairy Board is a sales and marketing organisation; it is not involved in primary processing.  The focus of our innovation thrust is identifying market needs and ramping up investment in developing consumer insights and better understanding category management and shopper behaviour in order that we can better identify areas to which investment needs to be directed.  </p><p>  In terms of primary research, some excellent work is being done in Ireland.  The capability in Teagasc and the universities is world class.  The industry is seeking to ensure a greater focus on market need rather than basic research at this stage.  From our perspective, it is essential to build this capability to gain a better understanding of consumers and ingredient users.</p><p>  As to whether we have abandoned the shamrock, the Senator is correct that this matter was the subject of a court case in the 1970s.  We lost the case.</p></speech>

As a business, we have the capability, working in close collaboration with our members, to deal with growth of this magnitude.  Growth in turnover will be influenced to a significant extent by the speed of the increase in production.  We certainly believe a 50% increase in our Irish turnover within a period of five years is realistic.  Approximately 60% of our turnover is generated overseas and we have strong ambitions in terms of this growth.  </p><p>  Mr. Condon may wish to respond on the issue of volatility.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Condon" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600008#H00800"><p>There is no doubt that volatility is a key issue.  Since 2007 the levels of price fluctuations in dairy products were previously unknown.  They are being driven by a number of factors.  In Europe the reduction, if not abolition, of many of the market protection mechanisms has left us more open to global trade and its impact.  Outside this, a considerable amount of milk is being produced in regions or areas in which we may believe it should not be produced.  Known as "marginal production regions", these areas are heavily dependent on irrigation and piped water.  Any minor weather issue impacts disproportionately on their production, meaning that minor fluctuations in supply and demand can have a disproportionate effect on pricing.  This trend is being exacerbated by hedge funds which have identified this volatility as a route to higher margins and become involved in trading dairy products on future markets.  The speed of information transfer has also had an impact.</p><p>  Volatility has become a major issue.  Before 2007 the variation in dairy price was minimal, whereas fluctuations in the price of the products we sell can range in any given year from 30% to 50%.  That is the world in which we live and it is difficult for us and farmers to build a business against that background.  To try to mitigate this volatility, we have become involved in futures trading and now trade on the CME stock exchange in the United States and the Eurex exchange in Europe.  The more product for which we can have a brand, the lower the impact of the general dairy trade volatility.  We are acting on this issue.</p><p>  Strategic relationships with customers that work from a milk price forwards or work off fixed milk prices would help us to manage volatility.  It is important to note, however, that volatility is a double-edged sword.  If we mitigate volatility in terms of the downside, we also do so in terms of the upside.  This must be recognised throughout the dairy industry.</p><p>  We are very interested in South America, not specifically Argentina and Brazil, the markets of which for dairy goods are in surplus, but Venezuela, Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica which are very large markets.</p> <p>We have an office in Mexico and we are expecting to grow our business into that region quite significantly.  We are planning to open an office in, as we call them, the "Stans", by which we mean Iran and the surrounding region, which is a very big butter importing region.  With the expected growth in butter production in Ireland, it will become a more important region for us.</p><p> To supplement the answers on the China question, I am involved in the dairy trade and ingredients side, which is the non-branded element.  For our product portfolio, China is a relatively limited opportunity, primarily because of the free trade agreement between New Zealand and China, which makes us uncompetitive for exporting into that market.  If we were looking globally at where we see the opportunities, sub-Saharan Africa would have to be top of the list.</p><p> On the question of turnover, the Irish business currently turns over approximately &euro;800 million but that is the Irish business alone, which is the Irish dairy product part of our total business.  We would see that growing at a minimum to &euro;1.2 billion by 2018 to 2020, although we would actually expect a little more than that.</p><p> We are not directly involved in manufacturing so we cannot comment directly on the assistance that individual manufacturers might require to increase their processing capacity.  What we can say is that over the milk flush in any given year, there is no excess capacity on the island so every single litre of incremental milk production from 2015 will have to be manufactured in enhanced or new plants.  It is a very real investment requirement if we are to grow the business.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe O'Flynn" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600009#J00300"><p>I will come back to that.  How we go into markets is determined to a significant extent by the state of development of the market.  In other words, if there is a formal retail structure established, one may be dealing directly with the retail trade.  With many of the markets in sub-Saharan Africa, in the first instance one is dealing with distributors because it is a much less formal market.  In many cases one does not have any significant retail structure and in some cases one does not even have a chill chain for products.  This, in turn, influences the type of product that goes in there.</p><p>  If we look at markets like the DRC or Angola, we have a partnership with an in-market distributor.  As we evolve, going forward, we are looking at investment in terms of existing businesses within those markets, depending on the state of their development.  Initially, it can be at arm's length through a distributor but, as the relationship evolves, we are looking ultimately to evolve to a situation where we are liaising directly with retail trade itself as it evolves.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.34" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Buckley" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600009#J00400"><p>I will wrap up on some of the questions that were briefly touched on.  Senator O'Keeffe asked what the State can do to help.  We have included that in our slide on the Government working with us.  We would be very concerned to have a pro-business attitude in the country, that exporting is made as easy as possible, that there are no obstacles being put in the way and that support for research and development is ongoing.</p><p>  I agreed with the Chairman when I commented on the investment that is needed in the processing sector.  While that investment may not come by way of direct investment from the Government because I recognise the difficult financial situation and the need to balance the books at Government level, tax support would be seen as a stimulus to that industry and would create employment.  The Chairman noted that creating employment and making this 50% growth possible will bring in revenue for the country, so we see it as a stimulus that is badly required.  I have been asked to make that point today.  It is not possible for the processing industry or for farmers to fully fund that sector, a point of which I ask the committee to be conscious.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris raised the issue of volatility, which has been discussed.  He also raised the issue of quotas and the survival of small farmers.  The point would be 100% correct if quotas remained in place and we had guaranteed support for the volume that was being produced under quota.  Unfortunately, in recent years we have had the worst of all worlds.  We had a quota regime and, within that, we were asked to sell milk virtually at world market prices.  Even within the quota regime, the number of farmers in milk has been declining.  Hopefully, this will not continue at the same fast pace, but I take on board the Deputy's point.  If there was price support, quotas would protect farm incomes to a certain point.</p><p>  Reference was made to central Asia, including Iran.  We need to be conscious at our end that our resources are scarce and we cannot be all things in all markets.  We must identify the markets that will deliver best for us.  When our strategy is drawn up and looked at, perhaps the committee can point out opportunities to me here or there.  However, resources can be limited.</p><p>  The issue of risk assessment was raised.  All I can say is that we have a very active internal audit committee which has drawn up for the board a risk assessment policy in terms of business continuity should something happen within the business.  We cannot cater for every eventuality but, in so far as we can, there is a policy in place to minimise any potential risk that might arise.</p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe asked about the requirement for funding in the processing sector and how plans are working in this regard.  We are well on target to meet our plans and the requirements of farmers and the processing industry.  The snag is that, in developing our plans, we require the processing industry to deliver increased product at the end of the day.  We hope that funding at that level will not be a hindrance in terms of growth.  We are focused on meeting our 2020 objectives in terms of our requirements as marketers and we are conscious of the fact there may be a hiccup at processing level in terms of the finance commitment that is needed.</p><p>  I hope we have covered most if not all of the issues raised.  There were a lot of questions and if somebody feels we should come back-----</p></speech>

In regard to that last question, given what we wanted to tease out with him was how to arrive at the challenges and commitments of Food Harvest 2020, I would like to hear a bit more.  If he is saying the Irish Dairy Board is on target to deliver but there is actually a big "but", maybe we should draw that out because part of our remit is to examine the "but", along with all the good things the board is doing that will have it on target.</p><p>  I asked whether the Kerrygold was finished in regard to whether it has capacity over new products.  I also asked if it could be used for Irish beef and my colleague also asked about the idea of the co-opting of the Kerrygold brand in another guise altogether.  Specifically, we are here to know whether we are going to reach Food Harvest 2020 targets.  It is the opportunity to tell us that we are, but the witnesses could perhaps give us more detail.</p></speech>

Certainly, we are on plan to meet our targets but we need to realise we are only a year and half into the 2020 process, which will be an eight to ten year process.  We are happy that if we challenge ourselves, we are at the right place at this time, one and a half years into the process.  However, we clearly recognise there are significant challenges, which I have outlined under certain headings, and these will need commitment and support on a broader scale.  We believe we can meet the challenges but, at the same time, we would not underestimate them.</p> <p>As a marketing body we are not looking for State aid for marketing.  What we are asking for is support in terms of ensuring a pro-business approach and dealing with regulatory obstacles.  We seek the full support of the Government in terms of trade missions, which are vital, marketing and research and development, which is crucial for the future.</p><p> I am highlighting those issues and I will ask my colleagues to address the other issues or to add further to what I have said in response to Senator Susan O&rsquo;Keeffe.</p></speech>

They solicited feedback from their farmers on the likely level of increase in milk production.  All the indications are that the targets set out will be achieved.  We are confident that will be the case.  Our role thereafter is to figure out what products the milk will go into and we will have a role also in deciding the products concerned and establishing a route to market for them.  We are happy that we are on track in that regard and that the targets will be achieved.  The outstanding issue relates to investment by the co-operatives in processing capacity.  We cannot comment directly on that because it is their business as opposed to ours.</p></speech>

It all hinges on that.  Let us be honest; that is the key.  The question also arises of who will pay for it.  The CEO of the Irish Dairy Board said a couple of years ago that the investment cost of increasing capacity would be &euro;850 million.</p><p>  In the context of volatility, reference was made to hedge funds and Government support.  This might not be possible, but is there merit in a global sense in discontinuing the practice of allowing food commodities to be traded in hedge funds?  I ask the question innocently.  Food security worldwide is of the utmost importance.  Mr. Gill from Bloxham&rsquo;s has always decried the fact that such a valuable resource could be traded through hedge funds.  It is sinful that this is the case because, whatever way it works in terms of short selling, it does not make any sense to allow food commodities to be part of the hedge fund system.  There is an argument to be made in that regard from a food security point of view, whether the discussion is held at WTO level or in another forum.

On the question of why only Kerrygold has leverage potential and whether it could be used for meat, I will make an observation: developing an international brand is horrendously expensive.  In the first instance we must leverage the capability of whatever brands we have to the maximum extent.  Consumers consider Kerrygold predominantly as a butter brand but we see potential to leverage that across dairy products.  That is a step-by-step process.  It would be a huge stretch to extend the brand into meat.  I do not say it is impossible but it would not be on the short-term horizon.</p></speech>

We do research on a reasonably regular basis on stretch potential.  It does not figure in terms of the consumer's perception of the fit between where Kerrygold is as they see it and the marketing of meat.  Who knows what will happen in the longer term, but it will not happen in the short term.</p><p>  We have brands other than Kerrygold.  Dubliner is an extremely successful brand for us.  Pilgrim&rsquo;s Choice is the number-two Cheddar brand in the United Kingdom and is showing double-digit growth this year.  We are investing heavily in those brands because we see them as essential in terms of building a route to market for Irish products.  Brand is very much a central plank in our strategy for the future.</p></speech>

Bord Bia has developed the Origin Green label and there might be synergy between the two.  Senator O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s question might be better directed at Bord Bia.

It appears that is not necessarily the case, but the cost of expanding it is a challenge way beyond what one would envisage is the best way to proceed.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Padraig Brennan, who in addition to being our senior business analyst has taken the lead in developing and implementing our sustainability strategy.</p><p>  The importance of the food and drink sector to the economy has rarely been more evident than in recent years.  It has delivered strong export growth at a time when economies and other business sectors across Europe and beyond have struggled to overcome sustained recessionary pressures.  The value of food and drink exports has increased by 25% to &euro;1.8 billion during the 2010-2011 period.  This was two and a half times the rate of growth recorded in overall merchandise exports.  In 2011, the sector accounted for 25% of the increase in the country's total export revenue.</p><p>  Growth has been driven by a high return from meat, dairy, beverages and seafood.  Exports of prepared foods have felt the brunt of the renewed search for value by consumers.  Despite this, however, over the two year period the value of exports in that category has still grown by 10%.  In addition to a strong overall performance, an increasing diversification of our export base has been evident in 2011.  The value of exports to continental European markets increased by 16%, or &euro;400 million, to &euro;3 billion, with particularly effective performances in the Netherlands, Germany and France, all countries in strong positions to weather the economic challenges.  The value of exports to markets outside Europe grew by 20%, or &euro;350 million, reaching almost &euro;2.2 billion.  In fact, exports to Asia grew by one third and to China by one half, with particularly strong performances evident in dairy, meat and seafood.  Despite these developments, the UK remains our principal export market, accounting for 41% of the total of &euro;3.6 billion.  The value of our exports in 2012 is being affected by the continuing volatility in markets - about which we have heard a great deal this afternoon - with dairy product prices still some 25% off the March 2011 peak, as mentioned by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO.  However, this volatility has been softened by more favourable exchange rates and relatively strong global demand for meat products.  Exports are also being affected by the adverse weather conditions, poor grass growth and the rising costs of inputs, with which farmers across all enterprises have to contend.  The situation is most acute in the pigmeat sector, whose exports will rise by 10% this year, but the sharp rise in feed costs have left producers facing an exceptionally challenging financial situation.</p><p>  Despite a slowdown in export values this year, and we do not foresee any growth this year, the underlying trend for Irish food and drink exports remains strongly positive.  Recent research from Rabobank suggests that the recent strong surge in global corn and cereal prices is set to have a further upward impact on meat and dairy commodity prices as global output eases in response to higher input prices.  These developments will boost Irish exports into 2013 and beyond in an era of high grain prices.  Ireland's grass-based meat and dairy enterprises offers a potential competitive advantage relative to other suppliers.</p><p>  In spite of the overall weakness in the global economy, the growth in Irish food and drink exports over recent years has been helped by favourable global market conditions, strong commodity prices and stability in key currency exchange rates.  However, markets have also witnessed significant volatility caused increasingly by unexpected weather events in different regions.  In fact, the FAO and OECD regard unpredictable weather conditions as the single biggest reason for the volatility we have been experiencing since 2007.  This is set to continue but, nevertheless, the long-term prospects for agricultural commodity remain positive with the latest agricultural outlook of the FAO and OECD suggesting the nominal prices for the decade to 2021 will be 10% to 30% ahead of the average prices in the last decade, with the strongest increases expected in meat and dairy and oils, and we are strong in meat and dairy. </p><p>  Underscoring such projections are two indisputable facts, an accelerating world population, which members can see in the slide overhead, and a global agricultural base that will struggle to keep pace with the growth in demand.  The general increase in the demand for food, which will rise by 40% in 2013, and the growing sophistication in taste of consumers in developing economies must be seen as representing major long-term opportunities for Ireland.  In the chart, members can see the map of global buying power has shifted rapidly over the decades from the United States, the EU and Japan to focus on China and India in the decades ahead.</p><p>  The development strategy presented in Food Harvest 2020 clearly articulated the ambition evident among all stakeholders in the sector and achieving predicted growth of 42% in the value of food and drink exports - to reach &euro;12 billion - undoubtedly requires a co-ordinated effort by all those involved if it is to be delivered.  Having gone more than one fifth of the way towards reaching the target, the sector has shown it has both the ambition and the expertise required, and it remains well on track.  Bord Bia's work in supporting industry build exports is illustrated by initiatives such as Marketplace 2012, when we brought 500 buyers from around the world to the Dublin Convention Centre in February; and the 4,500 business meetings with 160 Irish food companies.  Images of that are on the overhead slide.  Working through our Shanghai office, we facilitated a trade mission led by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, with five sectorial itineraries across 11 cities and visiting some 13 food factories in China.  In fact, exports to China are continuing to grow.  Having grown by 50% last year, they have grown by over 40% in the first six months of this year.  We also continued to work with 70 leading high-end supermarket and food service customers across Europe on behalf of the beef industry.  We work with the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Foreign Affairs and Trade to achieve access to key potential markets for the industry in the United States, China and Japan.  Bord Bia's own commitment to supporting the growth objectives of Food Harvest 2020 is expressed in Pathways for Growth, the inter-disciplinary five year development programme initiated in 2010, which is based on the report of the same name, also by Professor David E. Bell and Mary Shelman of the Harvard Business School and launched at our leadership summit in 2010.  At annual follow up summits in 2011 and 2012, Bord Bia has, following consultation with leaders across the industry, rolled out work programmes for each of the main areas identified in the regional report.  We have published three updates on our progress, as can be seen in the slide overhead.  </p><p>  We have focused our efforts on the five areas outlined in the slide and I will mention each of them rapidly.  Under the entrepreneurship programme, a collaboration between Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc led to the launch of Food Works in March 2012, a mentoring and support programme for entrepreneurs.  Food Works provides a clear pathway for the development of the next generation of scalable, export-driven food companies.  It is envisaged that 15 entrepreneurs will enter the first phase every year and, by the end of 2015, a pool of 45 dynamic start-ups will be up and running.</p> <p>At least 20 of these are expected to be high potential companies.</p><p> The Bord Bia education programme, which commenced in 2009, has developed considerably over the intervening years.  Every year the Bord Bia marketing fellowship allows 25 graduates with industry experience to complete overseas assignments for Irish companies as part of their MSc in marketing practice with the UCD Michael Smurfit School of Business.  The food export graduate programme involves an 18-month placement of graduates in Irish companies in association with IBEC.  The food industry strategic growth programme allows industry professionals to enhance their long-term career opportunities through leadership-defining projects.</p><p> A key goal of the education programme is to retain graduates in the industry, developing the next generation of executive talent.  Feedback from companies indicates direct and long-term sales benefits from participation in the marketing fellowship programme.  While the programme is primarily about nurturing talent, its second year has, to date, generated sales of &euro;7.9 million with &euro;20 million anticipated by 2014.  Similar returns are envisaged through the third and fourth programmes.</p><p> Our insight and innovation team has expanded in the past 12 months, allowing it to significantly increase the flow of services to Irish companies.  Over this time, it has also piloted two crowd-sourcing projects with industry clients, leveraging online communities to seek out deep consumer understanding and insight.  In addition, the team has hosted five inspiration expeditions, which help inspire and motivate companies through exposure to new product and service ideas in other markets.  Investigation of innovation opportunities for the Irish dairy industry in less developed markets began in 2011, with ethnographic research in South Korea, Indonesia and Vietnam capturing by living with families the lifestyle, food culture and dairy consumption habits of consumers.  Research projects conducted over the past year have delivered insight into broad consumer trends in areas of interest to Irish industry, including European sports nutrition, the future of health and wellness and understanding evening meal consumption.</p><p> Co-opetition, a word introduced in the early 1990s by professors at Yale and Harvard, is the concept whereby companies that compete in some areas can collaborate in others.  We introduced this in the Pathways for Growth programme in 2010.  While Ireland is a significant player in the world market as the largest net exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere and accounts for 10% of the world&rsquo;s output of infant formula, its annual food and drinks turnover is &euro;9 billion, a mere fraction of the turnover of some of the largest food and drink companies in the world.  We need to have scale in the marketplace and achieve economies.  Co-opetition is designed to get companies to work together at different stages of the supply chain from costs right to the marketplace.  Irish food and drink companies increasingly recognise the value of strategic engagement with each other to secure new markets, manage larger contracts and reduce overheads.  We have engaged with more than 110 Irish food and drinks companies and developed, assisted or supported 20 individual co-opetition projects in the past year.  These covered areas such as promotion, procurement, market access, logistics and mentoring.</p><p> In June 2012, Bord Bia launched Origin Green, a national sustainability development programme that is designed to help Ireland become a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  The programme recognises that sustainability is increasingly becoming a major component of the commercial strategies of leading retailers, food service companies and food manufacturers.  Most have set out clear strategies and targets to enhance the sustainability of their supply chain over the coming decade.  They view sustainability as helping them boost the efficiency of their supply chain while also driving brand reputation and securing supplies over the longer term.</p><p> Retailers are looking for suppliers that can align with their commercial strategies and offer them a point of difference.  Bord Bia research with 20 leading customers across Europe highlighted the significant opportunities that exist if the Irish food and drink sector can demonstrate its commitment to delivering continual improvement in terms of sustainability.  Origin Green aims to effectively add proof and assurance to our sustainability claims while providing the evidence for which our export customers are looking.</p><p> Successfully delivering Origin Green will help the industry create a point of differentiation with key customers that will strengthen business relationships and improve the market position of Irish food and drink products.  There is also a strong correlation between the measures needed to improve environmental sustainability and those needed to reduce production costs and improve profitability at both farm and manufacturing level.  The Origin Green programme builds on existing work being undertaken at primary production level and it is intended that a target of 75% of Irish food and drink exports will be sourced from signed-up members to the programme before the end of 2014.  Origin Green is a voluntary business-to-business programme built upon a commitment from participating food manufacturers to develop a sustainability plan, in conjunction with Bord Bia.  Firms will sign up to a new sustainability charter and set out clear targets in key areas such as emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility, CSR, activities.</p><p> Once approved, successful members will be entitled to use the Origin Green logo as part of their trade marketing, communications and customer relations.  Each year, participants will be required to submit independently verified progress reports.  Such verification is critical to ensuring marketplace credibility.  Bord Bia has retained the SGS Group, the world&rsquo;s leading inspection, verification, testing and certification company with 70,000 employees and almost 1,400 offices and laboratories worldwide to act as the independent verifier for Origin Green.</p><p> Bord Bia will promote, communicate and develop trade awareness of the Origin Green programme among buyers, international media and relevant stakeholders in key export markets.  An international targeted communications programme is under way to build awareness of Origin Green and Ireland as a source of sustainably produced food.  In September, Bord Bia hosted 31 journalists from across Europe on a dedicated two-day sustainability itinerary.  At the end of this week some 15 Irish food and drink companies will participate at SIAL Paris, the world&rsquo;s largest food and drink trade show, under Bord Bia&rsquo;s Origin Green banner for the first time.</p><p> The response from the food and drink industry to date has been very positive with some 70 companies registered to participate in the programme.  Between them they represent more than 50% of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports.  Over the past week, the first five companies have received formal approval to become full members of Origin Green with a further 15 expected between now and the end of the year.</p><p> Origin Green will also act as the means of communicating the sustainability programmes being rolled out at farm level through Bord Bia&rsquo;s quality assurance programmes.  Since May 2011, over 29,000 members, 91%, of Bord Bia&rsquo;s beef quality assurance scheme have participated in a sustainability - a carbon footprint - survey, developed by Bord Bia in conjunction with Teagasc, as part of their regular farm audit.  Ireland is the first country to assess the environmental performance of farms on a national scale, making it a world leader in this regard.  The audit results provide a unique selling point for Irish beef in key export markets.  From a farmer&rsquo;s perspective, reducing carbon footprint improves efficiency and thereby enhances profitability.</p><p> Similar farm level programmes are planned across the entire range of primary agricultural production.  A pilot programme for the dairy industry was initiated in 2011 and a national scheme, equivalent to that operational in the beef sector, will be implemented in 2012 and 2013.  Work is under way to complete a pilot programme for Irish poultry with other meats, grain and horticulture to be included in this programme over the coming 12 months.  The development of Origin Green to build Ireland's brand reputation around green credentials is one of the four key strategic priorities for Bord Bia over the next three years.  In addition, we will be focusing on enhancing competitiveness, promoting exports and building a vibrant domestic market for the agrifood sector.</p><p> The export prospects for the Irish food and drink sector remain positive over the medium to long term with price levels for agricultural commodities set to increase further.  However, volatility in the international marketplace is likely to pose ongoing challenges.  The Irish food and drink sector is well placed to avail of opportunities as they emerge in developing markets while it has also shown a strong ability to further enhance its position in developed markets across Europe, which leave it well placed to deliver on the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.  Bord Bia&rsquo;s pathways for growth programme, developed in conjunction with industry, will work to equip the industry with the necessary talent, market insight and marketing ability in pursuit of these targets.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and the members of the committee for affording me the opportunity of addressing them today.  My colleague, Mr. Padraig Brennan, and I are happy to address any questions.  Before we do, I would like to show a short audio-visual clip featuring Saoirse Ronan who worked for us pro bono to promote the Origin Green programme to our stakeholders.</p></speech>

I do not really have questions to pose.  I have been a customer of Mr. Cotter since 1993 and would not be where I am today were it not for Bord Bia.  I could spend an hour telling members what it is like working with it.  I was in a great deal of trouble in 2008 and I am aware that whether one's situation is good or bad and regardless of the nature of one's needs, Bord Bia is a vibrant, expansive and ever-changing organisation.  It is run like a cut-throat business by Mr. Cotter and I cannot find enough superlatives to describe what it does.  Mr. Cotter has provided the committee with an extremely condensed version of what he does.  It would be great if the various members of the committee - if there was room for all of us - could be invited to attend next year's Pathways for Growth food and drink leadership summit.  There has been a long, step-by-step process and it is amazing to consider the amount of work Mr. Cotter and his wonderful team have done.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.68" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600013#N00700"><p>I endorse everything Senator Mary Ann O'Brien said.  I am familiar with the outstandingly impressive work done by Bord Bia.  I am curious about the new players in the Irish market and the engagement Bord Bia has had with them.  I refer, for example, to Aldi and Lidl.  What has Bord Bia done to encourage them to increase the number of Irish food products on sale in their stores?  I would pose a similar question to Tesco, the dominant player in the market.</p><p>  In the context of the promotional film we have been shown, it is obvious that the type of thing to which Mr. Cotter refers is not advertised on television.  I accept that television advertising is extremely expensive.  Newspaper reports indicate that small artisan food producers seem to be able to have their products stocked in the unlikeliest of places, for example, in stores such as Harrods of London, etc.  Is it part of Bord Bia's work to assist such producers in this regard?  At the weekend it was reported that a company in Sligo was selling Irish seaweed products into China.  These may be cosmetics, but I am pretty sure they are food products.</p><p>  Mr. Cotter referred to the position globally.  There has been a great deal of discussion in recent weeks about weather patterns and how they may affect food prices.  Is this a positive or a negative for the consumer?  Mr. Cotter seems to suggest the volatility in weather patterns has led to an increase in food prices and that this is a good development.</p></speech>

It has been stated Irish food and drink companies increasingly recognise the value of strategic engagement with each other.  Are such companies co-operating or collaborating with each other, particularly in the context of research and development?  The successful delivery of Origin Green will help key players in the industry to strengthen each other.  What will be the effect of genetically modified, GM, material in this regard?  A move towards GM potato production is taking place in this country which is practically GM-free and uncontaminated by pollen as a result.  Will the introduction of GM methods have an impact on how we market our produce?</p></speech>

I appreciate that it was only possible for them to provide a condensed amount of information on the activities in which Bord Bia was involved.</p><p>  In the context of the sustainability charter, are our guests satisfied that the targets they have set are appropriate?  Do they expect these targets to change in the coming years?  What do they expect of food producers and companies which have yet to sign up to the charter?  I accept that everyone cannot sign up from day one, but what is our guests' prediction in respect of those to whom I refer?</p><p>  Like Senator Paschal Mooney, I am curious about Bord Bia's role in the case of small artisan producers.  While I accept that such producers will never be major exporters, they are very important to local communities in terms of the employment they create.  In some instances, they also provide encouragement for farmers in terms of diversification.  What is Mr. Cotter's view?</p></speech>

Bord Bia may not have a role in the recognition and development of such areas of origin, but I ask if it views such recognition as being beneficial for marketing purposes.  It may be helpful to link food products with internationally known tourist areas such as the Wicklow Mountains, the Burren and Lough Corrib for its fish products.</p></speech>

I refer to the announcements made by Kerry Group and others last week, but it should be noted that Olhausen, a small company over 100 years old, closed down.  It was not an export brand and depended entirely on the domestic market.  Equity in the food chain is an issue which has come before the committee and has been mentioned by the Agriculture Commissioner in the context of CAP reform.  While I do not know the details and the reasons for the demise of the Olhausen company, we have to be concerned that retail practices here may have had a profound or negative impact on it.  Does Bord Bia attempt to engage with the major distributors and retailers in order to secure fair prices for all those involved at every stage of the food chain?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.74" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Cotter" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2012101600014#O00300"><p>Senator Paschal Mooney has asked if Bord Bia engages with some of the more recent entrants into the Irish retail market.  He mentioned Aldi, Lidl and Tesco in this regard.  We engage with these retailers.  Our members use the Bord Bia quality mark which is promoted widely by retailers, with which we work closely.  This year we have been working with Tesco on a supplier development programme involving 16 Irish food companies and are working at three levels.  One of these companies is focusing on expanding beyond its local area, another is expanding nationally within the Tesco retail chain, while the third is moving from selling nationally to selling to Tesco in the United Kingdom.  Working with Tesco, the third largest food retailer in the world, to advance the interests of these Irish food companies has proved very successful.  It is an important potential stepping stone into the international marketplace for Irish companies.  Aldi and Lidl are very significant players in international and European markets.  While they are discount retailers, many Irish suppliers regard them as very stable customers in terms of returns and doing business with them.  We regard them as important outlets for Irish food and drink products and do everything possible to work with them to increase the penetration rates of Irish food products.</p><p>  Senators Paschal Mooney and Susan O'Keeffe asked about artisan foods.  We regard artisan foods as one of the great success stories of the Irish food and drink industry.  In many ways, such companies provide a halo across the whole food and drink industry because of their high quality products, the premium position they occupy and the passion they show in the production and distribution of their products.  I suggest the greatest profile for artisan foods is provided by the Bloom gardening and food festival held in the Phoenix Park every June over the bank holiday weekend.  A total of 55 artisan producers show their products during a very successful five-day period.  Artisan food producers have ambitions.  The Senator referred to their presence in Harrods and Selfridges in London.  Bord Bia carried out a significant promotion campaign for Irish specialty food producers in Selfridges earlier this year, most of which were artisan food producers.  It was a very successful promotion and a very suitable campaign for these small businesses to show their wares, earn an income and seek future business.</p><p>  Bord Bia administers small business grants for businesses with a turnover of between &euro;100,000 and &euro;3.5 million.  In the current year it has grant-aided approximately 190 small businesses.  These are very important grants for businesses which are innovative and creating new products for new markets.  We work closely with small businesses.  I refer to our website, bordbiavantage.ie, which contains information for anyone wishing to start a business on how to develop financial management systems and so on.  It provides signposts for businesses to guide them towards the further assistance available.</p><p>  Senator Paschal Mooney asked about global weather patterns.  Unpredictable weather conditions are the single most important factor behind the volatility in the marketplace.  However, long-term food prices are driven upwards in meeting the requirements of an expanding global population which is growing by 80 million every year.  The middle class category is growing by 150 million a year and this class has shifting dietary habits, as we heard.  On the other hand, there is the inability of the global marketplace to maintain supply to match that demand.  </p><p>  The Chairman asked about a fair return for producers.  We have witnessed the end of the era of cheap food.  Retailers and others will have to pay more for the volume of food products they require, while producers will have to be rewarded sufficiently.  We have entered a new era in food production where the opportunities for the food industry are perhaps unparalleled.  </p><p>  Deputy Martin Ferris asked about co-operation and collaboration.  This is happening in many areas along the supply chain.  For example, groups of growers are coming together to combine their purchases of inputs in order that they have greater bargaining power to reduce their input costs by comparison with larger players.  I showed a slide which the Deputy may not have seen.  It showed the level of collaboration between the Irish Dairy Board and Cashel Blue following the launch of the co-operation project in 2010.  It is also evident in what we call the China hub launched in April during the visit to China of the national delegation led by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.  We have expanded our office facility in Shanghai to include representatives of six other food companies, four of which are in the seafood sector.  They share the same facility.  There are meat companies which collaborate with each other because they operate in different sectors.  They are sharing knowledge and resources and working together as one in the marketplace.  </p><p>  There was a question about Origin Green and the impact of GM foods.</p> <p>What we have seen in recent time is the scientific trials that are being undertaken by Teagasc under the approval of the EPA.  We would be confident that the safeguards that are in place during these scientific trials will be sufficient to ensure there is no risk to the reputation of Irish food and drink.  As we all know, scientific trials like this take place and have been taking place for a very long time right across the European Union without an apparent impact on their food industries.  They are scientific trials.  As there is no production of GM foods in Ireland, there is no threat in that regard at present.</p><p> Senator Susan O'Keeffe asked about the sustainability charter and the targets set in it.  We have sought that 75% of our food and drink exports would come from Origin Green members by 2014.  In so far as this is a voluntary programme, 100% would come from such members by 2016.  We have found at farm level where we are rolling out a sustainability survey, very significant acceptance of this among farmers.  We have done a carbon footprint of 29,000 farms to date.  There is no other country in the world that has been conducting carbon footprint on farms on what is, in effect, a national scale and a process of measurement feedback and continuous improvement.  All of these farms must sign a permission for Bord Bia to access the AIM database operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine so that we can access online the number of animals that have entered and left that farm and the number of animals that are on the farm, which is a key input into accessing the carbon footprint.  The uptake by Irish farmers has been extremely encouraging and we expect that to be replicated right across the primary production sector.  We are quite confident this will happen.</p><p> At the processing level we have 70 companies with an excess of 50% of our food and drink exports already signed up.  SGS Ireland was only appointed as a third party verifier in September.  Next week at SIAL all of the companies operating under our stand with the Origin Green logo are signed up members of the Origin Green programme.  We are confident, without much work on our part, the companies are very enthusiastic about this programme.  They recognise that this is an opportunity to set Irish food and drink apart.  We have always been recognised for our green credentials.  We are a warm, friendly and welcoming people.  The caretakers, custodians and protectors as they are described in this video, who look after our farms have always done so through the generations.  We are putting metrics and objective measurement around this and can then go out into the marketplace and sell it.  This is perhaps one of the most important initiatives taken by the industry in recent times.  This can project us in a fashion that differentiates us from everyone else in the marketplace.</p><p> Deputy McNamara asked about protected designation of origin and protected geographical indicators.  We have limited uptake of these designations of origin in this county.  That relates to the fact that they are more traditional, more accepted and recognised as a part of the southern European countries, particularly areas such as Italy, France, Spain and Portugal.  We would like to see more of these designations of origins, recognising the high quality products that our artisans are producing.  There is work under way by our Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and we provide any support that we can to promote this.  We would welcome an increased penetration of these designations because they offer a major endorsement to the artisan producers for their products.</p><p> The Chairman referred to Olhausen, which is a very old and long-established company in the Irish food industry.  It was a member of our quality assurance scheme and we were very concerned when it got into difficulty.  It is clearly a very competitive marketplace.  Retailers and food service operators are dealing with consumers who are shopping around from brands towards private labels.  There is significant pressure from the consumer on one side and the retailers on the other and the distribution of power is not always perceived to have the equitable share that it might rightly have.  The market decides in the world we live in.  As I said the era of cheap food is at an end.  Producers will have more power as we go forward and the world struggles to keep pace with the growth in demand.</p></speech>

Does he base that on the fact that we are coming to the end of subsidies for what we are producing?</p></speech>

In the global marketplace and World Trade Organisation the requirements are that subsidies that are in place should not act as an incentive or a disincentive to production.  What we have in place is largely recognised as something that is there to protect the family farms we have in Europe in comparison with the very large ranch-style farming that we see in areas such as South America.  The small family farm in Europe would find it very difficult to compete with the large ranch farms.  This is a choice that Europe makes to protect the traditional established system of farming we have had.  I think it is important that it is maintained and that the policy of channelling supports towards productive farmers is important for us being able to achieve the targets set out in Food Harvest 2020.</p></speech>

The survival of the family farm goes beyond economics and is essential for the maintenance of the social fabric of our society.  It is our job as legislators, whether in government or in opposition, to try to ensure we get the best possible deal to ensure the survival of the family farm.</p><p>  As I see it, Europe is in crisis, we are in economic difficulties, and austerity is raging.  People have less and less money in their pockets.  Unless there is a support mechanism for farmers to produce food at an affordable level, we will be entering very dangerous territory.  It was mentioned that hedge funds were investing in food production.  That will present difficulties.  It would mean that human survival would be controlled by the market.</p></speech>

That is an appealing part of what we offer as a food and drink producer.  It shows Irish farmers through the generations.  I think it is something, in addition to the clean, green environment, that we must continue to strive to protect.  It is the people themselves in the family farm system that completes the real picture that we can sell internationally.</p></speech>

We only got the video clip prior to the meeting.  It is available and I will ensure that all members have it.  I regret that we did not have a chance to view it prior to the meeting.</p> <p>It will be all the more interesting to hear it as well as see it.  I thank Mr. Cotter and Mr. Brennan for appearing before the committee.  Today we had delegations from both the Irish Dairy Board and Bord Bia.  Agriculture is dependent on these two bodies to drive the sales and marketing of Irish food production capacity.  Production, processing and marketing are the three keys to the industry.</p><p> Senator O'Brien gave Bord Bia a ringing endorsement of its value to her company and other similar companies, both large and small. </p><p> The committee would appreciate being kept abreast of update No. 3 of Pathways for Growth.  If the committee secretariat were informed of the proposed date of the presentation they could inform members who may wish to attend it.</p><p> I thank the members for attending and giving of their time.

This meeting is for the purpose of the scrutiny of EU proposals COM (2011) 778 and COM (2011) 779 by officials from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  I welcome Mr. Pat Houlihan, Ms Marie Dempsey and Mr. John Moynihan from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  They are here to brief the committee on COM (2011) 778, a proposed directive on the statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts, and COM (2011) 779, a proposed regulation regarding the statutory audit of public interest entities.  The committee deems these proposals significant and therefore worth further scrutiny.

If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

The EU Commission proposals on audit arise from the financial crisis.  There are two draft instruments, a directive on statutory audits of annual consolidated accounts and a regulation on statutory audit of public interest entities.  The overall objective is to restore confidence in EU audits through enhanced audit quality.</p> <p>I may give a short preamble before we get to the slides.  In some sense, this summarises the first three bullet points.  Credit institutions were the institutions worst affected by the financial crisis and in the aftermath of the crisis, the EU and other jurisdictions addressed the situation as it pertained to the intrinsic activities of these institutions - liquidity, solvency and, in many cases, recapitalisation.  In the case of the European Union, the second wave of the activity in the wake of the crisis relates to audit.  Hence the proposals we are examining here today.</p><p> It was a source of surprise to many that many entities, particularly credit institutions, began to send out major distress signals a short time after receiving clean audit reports at the time of the financial crisis.  While I do not apologise for auditors, certain factors, such as the so-called expectation gap contributed to this.  An expectation gap is where there is an expectation of something from the audit process that the process itself does not deliver.  There are those who would argue that the expectation exceeds the legal expectations of the audit.  Therefore, there is a gap.  These proposals intend to address this in part by closing or eliminating the gap.  Impairment of loans may also have been a factor, arising from the strict application of international financial reporting standards, IFRS. </p><p> Another set of factors run parallel to the crisis as much as being intrinsic to it.  These are issues that have been on the European Commission's radar for some time, such as features of the audit market, where at the upper end the so-called "big four" have a vast global monopoly.  The sense that this impacts on competition is manifest.  The Commission has also expressed a concern on many occasions with regard to what will happen if one of the "big four" fails, as we will be in a situation where there is practically no competition in the market place, not to mention dealing with the fall-out from such a situation.  These considerations are of abiding concern to the Commission.  Another concern is the length of tenure of many audit contracts, some of which span generations.  It is almost like having a sitting tenant in one's house.  This is a concern with regard to true independence.  Unsurprisingly, these kinds of considerations crop up in the proposals the Commission brought forward late last year to address the audit system and those entities and elements which comprise it.</p><p> It might be helpful here to go over the various players involved in the audit system.  I have already referred to the "big four", which are a key element of the auditor part of the equation and which have global reach.  They are constituted as networks.  To the man in the street, this is a bit like McDonald's or a car dealership, which has a presence in all member states or globally.  This is not an attempt to denigrate any of the entities mentioned, the audit firms or the others.  Down the line from the top echelon, there is a clear second tier set of audit firms.  These would be distinguished in terms of size and capabilities from those under them, but their reach does not extend up to the level of the "big four".  The third tier would be audit firms and individual auditors.</p><p> There are an estimated 3,500 practising auditors in Ireland and public interest entities are audited by nine of the cohort of audit firms.  Therefore, only a small number of audit firms audit public interest entities.  The entitlement to audit comes from membership of a recognised accountancy body.  There are six of these bodies in Ireland and they derive their recognised status from the public oversight authority.  In Ireland, this authority is known as the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA.  Together, IAASA and the layers I have mentioned constitute a kind of pyramid with IAASA at the top.  This is the kind of structure with which we are dealing and some of the proposals address the totality or various strands of that structure.</p><p> The proposal for the draft directive is to amend Directive 2006/43 on statutory audits of annual accounts and consolidated accounts.  The particular focus of the proposal is on the audit of non-publicly accountable entities.  This is distinct from the regulation, which expressly addresses that cohort.  One of the key areas covered is independence.  This concerns independence of the auditor from the firm.  Other forms of independence are concerned also.  The oversight body is not, as of the present draft, permitted to have audit practitioners.  Also - we will come to this point later - the public oversight body is being asked to assume certain functions which up to now have been carried out by the recognised bodies themselves, in terms of regulating audit firms and auditors.</p><p> We will discuss the issue of liberalisation of ownership rules of audit firms later, as it is an issue that is the subject of criticism from certain quarters.  One of the effects of liberalisation is, for example, to enable firms to have an inflow of capital.  Up to now, a majority of members in an audit firm were required to be auditors, but now it is proposed to change this.  Other proposals are proportionate audit for medium sized companies and where member states require an audit for entities, small companies can conduct the audit as well.  This is of interest to the lower end of the audit market.  There will be enhancement of cross-border activity, thereby allowing audit firms to perform audits in other member states either on a temporary or permanent basis.  I already touched on the issue of the reallocation of functions currently carried out by auditor bodies to the public oversight system.  As of now, only two of those functions are deemed as appropriate to be retained by these recognised bodies, namely, approval and registration.</p><p> The final and key proposal of the directive is the extension of the definition of public interest entities.  In the directive this one purports to amend, there is a relatively clear and concise definition of public interest entities.  The core of these would be listed and systemic entities, such as credit institutions, insurance undertakings and the like.  Now there is a proposal to extend significantly the coverage of public interest entities.  This means that those in the category of public interest entities are subject to the rigours of the regulation, which is obviously more demanding than the directive.  This is an area about which Ireland has some "hesitations", a mild way of expressing its position.</p><p> The regulation sets out specific requirements with regard to the statutory audit of public interest entities.  As I mentioned, the core element of these would be credit institutions, insurance undertakings and listed companies.  However, there is a long list of other categories.  I will list these later in the presentation when we get to the point of the issues arising from this.  There are new requirements with regard to the appointment of the auditor and there is a significant role for the audit committee.  The regulation deals with the performance of the audit and audit reporting, including to prudential regulators.  Articles Nos. 14 to 18 and so on include various provisions and requirements with regard to the performance of audit and reporting to prudential regulators.  In Ireland's case, this would be the Central Bank for companies that are credit institutions or under the regulatory remit of the Central Bank. </p> <p> The next key area in the regulation is the new EU co-operation framework.  Article 45 provides for investigations and so on.  If something goes awry with a company that has a number of operations in various member states, there will be a need for co-operation and collaboration among the relevant authorities in those member states to investigate what exactly has gone on.  Significant elements of such a system are already in place under the 2006 directive.  This will enhance them.  The European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, has a kind of co-ordinating role in this regard.  I will deal with that agency later in this presentation.</p><p> The next key area is transparency reporting by auditors of public interest entities.  If one is auditing a public interest entity, considerable disclosures are required.  One has to put a great deal of information on one's website about one's audit firm and about what one is auditing.   That facilitates the oversight of how those who audit these entities are constituted and provides details on other relevant matters such as the incomes of audit firms.  There would be a public interest in having this information.</p><p> One of the core elements of the proposed new structure is the enhanced role of the audit committee, which is involved in the appointment of auditors, as I have said, and in many other areas relating to audits.  This is one of the strengths of the proposals.  At least it directs itself at the process.  Arguably, some of the others could not get to the core of the thing, whereas this one does.</p><p> The next key area is the prohibition on the provision of non-audit services.  Essentially, these proposals are seeking to restrict the provision by auditors of audit-related services, and in certain cases to prohibit the provision of non-audit services, with a view to ensuring the independence of those auditors.  There are three categories of service - audit services, audit-related services and non-audit services.  The last of those categories is being placed pretty well on the black list.  Audit services are fine and a percentage stipulation of 10% applies in the case of audit-related services.  This provision is being introduced to ensure auditors are independent.  The Commission seems to share the feeling some people have, which is that auditors that have been supplying audit-related services and non-audit services in addition to audit services are being unduly influenced by the non-audit aspect of the revenues they are obtaining.  That is why the Commission is seeking to curtail these activities.  It is an interesting attempt to ensure there is independence.  It is difficult to be absolutely certain that these ancillary activities are having an influence in the manner that has been suggested.  That is the proposal the Commission has made.</p><p> I have summarised the two measures - the directive and the draft regulation - so I will move on to the discussions of these matters at European Council working group level in Brussels.  At a later stage, I will set out where those discussions are and where the Parliament is on the issue.  As I usually represent the Department at the European Council working group discussions, I will comment on the matters that have arisen at that forum.  The question of whether there is a proper legal basis for the proposed regulation is being examined by the Council and Commission legal services.  Many of the bigger member states, in particular, have hesitations and doubts about the proportionality of the use of a directive in this instance.  They claim the criteria that normally apply when the Commission introduces a regulation might not be present on this occasion.  It is an interesting debate.  At one of the recent meetings of the committee in Brussels, the Council legal services issued an informal adjudication to the effect that the criteria are probably met.  That is not the end of the matter; I think it will be considered again at some future time.</p><p> The second matter that has arisen in this context - the question of the subsidiarity and proportionality of these measures - borders on the matter I have just set out.  Many people would prefer if some of the measures in the proposed regulation could be relocated to the directive.  Some of the bigger member states get a bit jittery when something is included in a regulation because that means it has direct application, as the committee is aware.  They feel it might be a heavy instrument to bring to bear in these cases.  They have not been awfully happy with it for that reason.  The other thing is that there are 72 draft articles in the regulation, whereas the directive is a much more sparse document.  Perhaps some member states want to balance the two documents.  I am not too sure.</p><p> Ireland shares the misgivings of many member states about the proposed expansion of the scope of the definition of &quot;public interest entities&quot;.  Article 1.2(<i>d</i>) of the draft directive, which is where the proposed expansion is provided for, would expand the definition to include investment firms, payment institutions, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, electronic money institutions and alternative investment funds.  We have expressed concerns about this rather expanded definition of &quot;public interest entities&quot; compared with the original directive.  We believe the clarity needed to pinpoint exactly what entities will be covered by the definition is missing from the directive.  The Department has established a contact group of relevant interested parties, and we keep them abreast of developments.</p></speech>

I am going through some matters of general concern.  Ireland is one of a number of countries that are concerned about this matter.  We are trying to elucidate the content of this bag of assorted items.  We want to see what we are dealing with in the bag and decide whether we like what is included in it.  I suspect we do not.  I estimate that the number of public interest entities in this country under the existing definition is approximately 250.  I suspect that this enhanced version could increase that number by a significant amount.  That is definitely a point of concern for Ireland.</p><p>  The next general concern that has been expressed at the committee in Brussels relates to the proposal for further liberalisation of the ownership rules of audit firms.  Ireland is not unduly concerned about this aspect of the proposal.  It is unclear whether some member states prefer the <i>status quo</i> because they are not keen to depart from the idea that an audit firm must be what it says on the tin - that its governing body must consist of auditors, etc.  That is one of the issues that have arisen, but it is not an issue for Ireland, as such.</p><p>  The next issue that has arisen relates to the role of the competent authority in the public oversight of statutory auditors and audit firms.  We have an issue with the extent to which it is allowed to delegate its tasks to professional bodies.  I briefly adverted earlier to the fact that the current proposal envisages approval and registration only.  We would like to think we have a fairly effective system.  I described its pyramidal structure at the outset.  The recognised bodies regulate their members.  IAASA, which is at the top of the pyramid, supervises how the process is carried out.  In addition, if those functions are moved upwards, as is proposed, there will be budgetary implications for our Department.  IAASA receives 40% of its funding from Exchequer resources and 60% of its funding through contributions from audit firms.  If IAASA's core function is to do most or all of this stuff, people will want the Department or the Exchequer to defray all of that cost.</p> <p>For practical reasons the bodies have a long tradition of regulation that works pretty effectively and we are happy enough to see that continue.  A number of other member states have a difficulty with this one as well, so that would be something Ireland-----</p></speech>

Reference is made to the implementation of international accounting standards at member state level rather than EU level - these are accounting standards drawn up by an independent body.  In the former directive, there was a provision which provided for the adoption of these standards at EU level and the proposal in the current articulation of the directive is that member states would adopt them themselves.  People feel it is better from the point of view of homogeneity of application that they are adopted at central EU level, which is one of the issues.</p><p>  On the content of the audit report, some feel it is too detailed.  Paradoxically, a specific comment made by delegations is that the audit report is being limited to four pages or 10,000 characters, which seems a bit arbitrary.  For example, if one is in the middle of saying something important, the guillotine comes down and one is obliged to stop at that point, and many member states are unhappy with this.</p><p>  I described earlier some aspects of the role of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  In addition to facilitation and co-operation with the national authorities in terms of investigations and so on, this body is intended also to advise, give guidelines and issue standards in the audit area generally.  However, the details are not clear as to how exactly this will work in practice and member states are unhappy and need more clarity.  Another concern is that this body is essentially operating in the financial markets area.  Up to now, the audit system operated in its own silo and a body in Brussels, called EGAOB, looked after its activities.  Now, it is proposed to remove that link, to link in the audit aspect from the regulation in particular and to give the remit to this group, ESMA.  However, only three member states have audit entities that are linked in and affiliated to ESMA so there is an issue in terms of what ESMA is supposed to be doing, how it will reach out and what link can be created between ESMA and the audit fraternity in all of the member states.</p><p>  With regard to current proposals, consideration has been ongoing at the EU Council level for practically a year now.  It is a slow process and has gone along fairly sedately so far.  While the current Cypriot Presidency has the ambition to perhaps achieve a general approach on the Council side, we feel it probably will not achieve that.  It will certainly come over into Ireland's Presidency and it is just a question of how many of the parts will come over to us to be dealt with - quite a number, I suspect.  The proposals are being considered by two committees of the European Parliament - JURI, which deals with justice issues, and ECON, which is our departmental equivalent in the Parliament.  They are progressing it but, again, it is uncertain as to when their deliberations will be finalised.  One of the dates that has been suggested is 27 February of next year, so that pitches it a good distance out in terms of the Parliament coming to some finality on it.</p><p>  It is very hard to forecast how this will play out but the indications are that Cyprus may just move it along to a particular point and then hand it over to Ireland to try to achieve a general approach, which is the agreement of the Council component in the "trilogue".  For its part, the Parliament will then attempt to get its consensus on it, and the two parties will then lock horns, as it were, and attempt to come to a mutual agreement that will result in adoption.  It is very difficult to say how long that process will take.  The one thing I would predict with a fair degree of certainty is that Ireland will be intrinsically and fundamentally involved in carrying the process along in the new year. </p></speech>

It was useful to tease through the information.  I call Deputy Calleary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.103" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012101600006#E00600"><p>I thank the officials for attending and for providing all of that detail.  This is a sham, quite frankly.  It will not do anything.  While Mr. Houlihan mentioned an effective system of current oversight authorities and their long tradition, it is that effective system and long tradition that have us where we are today.  We were depending on the auditors' systems as a system of robust audit on bank accounts.  Shareholders around this country who have been cleaned out in regard to bank shares and other shares were dependent on those same auditors when they put their life savings into bank shares.  It is too late for them, unfortunately, and many people are in very serious situations because they were let down by what they thought were independent and effective auditors.  That was their expectation gap and they are now paying for that gap.</p><p>  What we want now is something robust, new and challenging that changes the goalposts completely in favour of some system of independent financial guarantee on the state of any company.  Unfortunately, the jist of what I am getting from the witnesses' negotiations is that it will be all right on the night.  However, there is a big row about the legal basis of the proposal for a regulation and there are people having a row as to whether we should have a regulation or a directive.</p><p>  One of the most striking comments Mr. Houlihan made was in clarifying he was not comparing audit companies to car salesmen or to takeaways.  I know Mr. Houlihan is trying to do a job here but this directive will do nothing to restore public confidence in the audit system.  The lack of urgency with which the negotiations are proceeding at EU level is not good enough.  It is reflective of a leadr&aacute;nach kind of response to a situation that has caused devastation for companies and for hundreds of thousands and probably millions of people across the EU.</p><p>  This will not be completed during the Cypriot Presidency and Mr. Houlihan said Ireland will play a major part in bringing it aboard.  Has he specific aims to bring this aboard before the end of our Presidency next June or will it pass on to the next Presidency and then pass on to the Presidency after that?  What sanctions are being discussed?  There are many fine academic proposals here but what sanctions are being discussed for the breaching of any of these regulations?  There was an issue at Council working party level about the mandatory rotation of audit firms.  Is that being queried or contested by some companies?</p><p>  No offence to Mr. Houlihan, who is working with all he has.  However, frankly, these regulations will not stop us from coming back in 20 years to another crisis of confidence in the system.  I referred to the expectation gap.  Everybody was assured that these big name companies - I will not bother mentioning their names - were giving guarantees about the financial stability not just of our banks but of big PLCs, but they did not deliver.  Mr. Houlihan spoke about the audit chain in companies and banks being difficult to judge.  That is exactly it.  We depended on auditors in PLCs to report properly on impaired loans but the whole chain collapsed.  What this directive needs to do is ensure that chain is robust enough and strengthened enough for it not to happen again.  I am afraid nothing in what Mr. Houlihan has outlined would give me any confidence we are actually going to fix our audit system.</p></speech>

We need an awful lot more discussion and debate on this because we have to work through the detail of it.  We all have to accept the whole system of auditing in Ireland is a mess and needs to be reformed.  We must not repeat the mistakes of the past.  There is no doubt failures in auditing played a big part in what happened in the banking sector and in some of the property companies as well.  There is and has been for a long time an unhealthy relationship between auditing companies and their commercial masters, especially banks.</p> <p>The mindset is that the auditors are there to keep the clients happy rather than doing what they should be doing, which is ensuring that sharp practices or accountancy tricks are not being carried out either by financial institutions or other companies.  Unfortunately, the reality is that the necessary safeguards and checks and balances were not in place.</p><p> Accountability is one issue; we want to see improvements in accountability in this area, but liability is also crucially important.  It seems to be very much missing from the EU legislative proposals before us.  We must ensure that when audit companies stand over the accounts of big financial institutions, corporations and banks that it is a true and fair view of a company&rsquo;s position.  Currently, they are not legally liable for the accounts on which they sign off.  I wish to comment on a recent report by the Financial Reporting Council on international standards in auditing in Ireland and the United Kingdom.  It identified an anomaly in the legislation in this country where company law qualifies the idea of a true and fair view with the addition of the words &ldquo;in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework&rdquo;.  The Nyberg report outlined that the auditors clearly fulfilled this narrow function according to existing rules and regulations.  They did not, however, generally report excesses over prudential sector lending limits to the Financial Regulator.  We are talking about lending.  When it comes to the banks speculating and lending one would imagine that the auditors would be well placed to spot dangers in this area but, unfortunately, that did not happen.  There was a system breakdown both at that level and in terms of reporting back to the Financial Regulator.  Our view is clear; while we would support improvements in accountability we must also address gaps in legislation which do not allow for audit companies to be liable for the accounts they stand over.  I would welcome a response from Mr. Houlihan on the point.</p></speech>

Less than ten years ago we had five but the situation with Enron reduced the number by one.  Nothing in the proposals encourages more companies to come forward and take on the mantle.  We must broaden the base of existing audit companies.  We found that each of the four audit companies was involved in some way or another with the banks in this country.  The sad fact is that there is nothing in the proposals that would encourage other companies to be able to compete at a major level.  If we do not have competition at that level, everyone gets stale and we get the negative reports we have been getting in recent years on the banking sector in various locations.  I hope we will include something in the legislation to encourage smaller and medium audit companies to develop.  We need competition.  We do not want to have only the big four companies.</p><p>  I am fascinated by the fact that the big four audit companies have their fingers in many pies in terms of the non-audit services they provide.  It is evident at Government level also.  They are employed as consultants to compile various reports and assessments.  What are the implications for them with regard to the provision of non-audit services and audit-related services?  I suspect the companies would not be happy with the regulation that is proposed by the EU.</p><p>  Reference is made in the proposals to the liberalisation of the ownership rules of audit firms.  We do not seem to have a problem with the issue.  Could Mr. Houlihan indicate why we should not have a problem in that regard?  I am fascinated by the stances taken on various aspects of the proposals.  We should question the ones where it is suggested that we do not have a problem because they are the ones that got us into trouble previously.  Reference has been made to appropriate legislation.  I would like a response in that regard.</p><p>  Could Mr. Houlihan identify the three member states of ESMA, the European Securities and Markets Authority?  They may be shining lights and we might learn something from them but if they are not then we might learn from them about faults.</p><p>  I am interested in the length of time we will have before we deal with the proposals as legislation.  An issue such as this should not be presented to us quickly.  This is a measure we will put in place for the next 20 years or 30 years and we must be able to confidently assure the public that the people who will examine banks, major corporations and companies are trustworthy.  The problem currently is that I do not trust any of the big four companies although they are big employers in this country.  I am sceptical about everything they say because they have not proved to us that they are worthy of our trust following on from their failures that have resulted in the current position for this country in terms of signing off on bank accounts in recent years.</p></speech>

As someone who operated as an auditor for many years the first point we should discuss is the role of the auditor.  The role of the auditor is to report on a true and fair view of the set of accounts and also to identify any fraud if they discover it in the process of carrying out their audit.  The role of the auditor is not to find fraud.  Various checks and balances are carried out in the process of doing an audit.  Various analyses are carried out.  If one finds something then one digs a bit more in order to find third party evidence.  It is not the role of the auditor to go into a company and find fraud but if fraud is discovered then the auditor must report it.  It is important to clarify the position.  If one has a company that is working against one and is hiding fraud at a deep level it can be difficult to find it, as we have discovered to our detriment in recent years.  It is important to clarify the point in the context of the report.  It is a good idea to have a mandatory requirement to change auditors every three to five years.  That change would be welcome.  However, I am concerned that because we have only four large auditing firms that companies would only be going from one to the other.  Everyone knows everyone else in such small circles.  That could be an issue to examine.</p><p>  On the issue of having more small to medium sized audit firms taking on big audits, they are not in a position to do it.  First, one must have a large number of people, which costs a lot of money.  In addition, employees will not stay in smaller firms as they want to work in the big four.  They want to travel and to get experience.  That is where they aspire to be, as that is where they will get the most experience.  Small to medium sized organisations do not have the capability to carry out some of the big audits and they would not be sufficiently independent.  I qualified as an auditor in 1996 and since then a significant amount of change and new regulation was introduced and the responsibilities on auditors have become onerous to say the least.</p></speech>

An important element of that is the ownership of the organisation and the liberalisation of ownership would have an influence over the corporate direction of some of the organisations.  There is an old saying that if one wants to find out what a person thinks then one should find out who they work for, to a certain extent, as that would have an influence.</p> <p> Another issue is members are approaching this from an extremely difficult position.  Many of the problems faced by all Members in this present D&aacute;il stem from an era in which auditors partook in the groupthink and herding with other institutions within the financial make-up of the State.  If we are to proceed with this, cognisance must be taken of this almost being the foremost issue to be resolved, rather than merely taking the view that matters are not too bad as they are.  Does the Government have its own plans to regulate this sector in the near future?  I acknowledge there is almost a lack of confidence in Irish society in dealing with such issues ourselves.  The view is perhaps such issues should be migrated to a European level.  While I believe that where business and functions take place on a transnational basis, there should be some level of transnational regulation, as a State we should not decide we do not have a responsibility to develop better systems of regulation in this area in the future.  In addition, Sweden was mentioned as having misgivings with elements of this proposal and that some countries considered it to be disproportionate and perhaps an invasion of national responsibilities.  Mr. Houlihan might tease out and reflect back to members some reasons other countries have indicated that.</p></speech>

The Department has expressed a concern regarding proportionality in respect of small and medium-sized businesses.  It is a big issue that while the same rules really should not apply in this regard, they do.  Aside from small businesses, other companies, which in reality operate as charities, sporting organisations and so on, are also hit by audits each year.  In the context of what an audit actually does, it is hardly fair that such organisations operating on a not-for-profit basis are obliged to pay &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 on an annual basis for an audit that at their level does not really achieve much.  Can this issue be addressed in this regulation or is it more of an issue that must be considered on a national basis?</p><p>  Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins touched on my other point, which is that people's perceptions of what auditors should do and what the actual job of an auditor entails are very different.  These proposals do not deal with that perception either and it is imperative to broaden out what we expect or what we would wish an auditor to do.  Can this be dealt with at a European Union level or, again, is this a matter that must be pursued nationally?  In an audit, one can assess a company's accounts for two years and even though one might know the company will be in trouble in the following year, one really cannot comment on that as one is simply performing an audit on the accounts.  There is no assurance and this directive does not ask for that.  My question is whether it should have sought it.</p></speech>

If one believes the company has going concern issues, one must report that in the audit report.  There are several different things one can do in the audit report.</p></speech>

Moreover, it does not really comment on the management of the company.  The problem over the years is that for a lot of the major entities, the non-executive directors have not really done their jobs.  A grey area existed as to what is their job and while it is to be a voice and to watch over matters on behalf of external stakeholders, that does not really happen either.  I seek Mr. Houlihan's comments in this regard.  Can we go further with it at this point?  I acknowledge he has a lot to take on and invite him to do his best to tease his way through it.  He is welcome to revert to the committee with notes and information subsequently.  I imagine we will go further with this issue and will make direct proposals to the Commission and, consequently, we can append any information Mr. Houlihan provides at a later stage.</p></speech>

First, I must come clean with an omission of my own.  Somehow or other, mandatory rotation seemed to slip through the cracks.  I probably delayed members for so long that I scuttled my finishing line.  In any event, the proposal on mandatory rotation in the regulation is that it should occur every six years and were one to have a joint audit, one could add a further three years to that.  As I stated, the European Parliament has not yet made up its mind on this subject.  However, on foot of exploratory contacts, the indications are it may be thinking of a longer period.  However, I perceive it to be one of the key elements of the proposal.</p><p>  Obviously, in the kind of time I understood to have available to me, I could not get into the meat and the detailed substance of the proposal.  However, I certainly direct those members who have commented on perceived superficiality in terms of the audit process itself to Title III, Article 31 of the regulation.  Were one to read on from there, one would find there is quite a lot of substance and meat in there that, if these measures are acted upon, will allow people to gain far greater assurance in the future than may be the case at present.</p><p>  I will attempt to summarise and address the comments made by the various speakers.  If I miss a point or a speaker, members should feel free to come back, assuming they have the time to so do.  It is not discourtesy but my handwriting is poor and my notes are jagged.  I will do the best I can but members should come back to me if I missed something.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary drew attention to the absence of mandatory rotation and I believe I have just covered that point.  I also mentioned what in substance is contained at Title III of the regulation, if one wades through it.  We would need another session to go through that and for our part, we would be happy to participate if a further session was needed, as well as to go through the meat of it and pick out what we might wish to discuss the next time.  As I took this meeting to be a form of general run-through, I did not want to bog it down.</p></speech>

I think the joint committee will take this matter further as there is a lot to it.</p></speech>

I am no apologist for audit firms or the like.  The Department has policy responsibility for this area and neither fears nor favours any of the operators therein and we do not show any favouritism.  Consequently, I am speaking in a neutral way here but none of the various reports on the financial crisis has been able to finger audit failure.  A critique has even been made by the European Parliament of the impact assessment performed by the European Commission on these proposals and it pointed out that while audit was indicated or semi-alleged to have been a contributor in this regard, it was not actually pinpointed that it was.  I reiterate I am not being an apologist but having dealt with these issues over a number of years, my feeling is the Commission has had these ideas in its head for a long time and to an extent, the financial crisis has given it the opportunity to air these matters, put them out there, get them considered and so on.  There is an element of this and I reiterate I am not aware of any absolutely open-and-shut case of an audit being single-handedly responsible for the failure of credit institutions.</p><p>  I must state the main failed credit institutions here were regulated by the Central Bank and it is not clear on whose side fault lies.  While I do not apportion fault to anyone, they were supervised.  Any prudential individual would not rely on a single strand such as audit.  I imagine such individuals would have a second strand to their bow and would supervise and act as a prudential supervisor.  This in no way is pointing a finger at the Central Bank but in some senses, it is a rebalancing of the equation.  That is about as much as I would say for it.</p><p>  In addition, there is an internal audit function in all these institutions.  They also have responsibilities and it is not clear that they fulfilled or discharged their responsibilities.  I am just throwing this out there.</p></speech>

That is what the Nyberg report stated, namely, it was not simply in respect of auditing.  Consequently, members' comments should be put into that context.  I believe there was a failure in respect of auditing because of the unhealthy relationship that exists between the bigger auditing companies and the bigger banks in this country.</p></speech>

There was a disproportionate sense in which these institutions were lending to particular niches of the economy and we know what occurred.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary called for more robust and challenging proposals.  I see these as reasonably robust and challenging but if Deputy Calleary has any suggestions that could make them more robust and challenging at this point in the negotiation process, we could see if we could champion them.  Arguably, they are fairly robust and challenging.  If we have another outing we could roam over them to see what people think and we may get to put the mirror up to them or see them in the looking glass such that we can see them properly.  People's attitudes may change.</p><p>  Senator Cullinane called for more discussion and debate.

Senator Cullinane referred to the true and fair view.  I was not absolutely clear about it but it is incumbent to give an opinion in respect of the true and fair issue for auditors.  He then referred to the Financial Reporting Council anomaly, as he termed it.  I gather what he had in mind may have been an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  Is that correct?  Two issues arose in the article.  My colleague John Moynihan is an accountant and he can correct, add to or subtract from what I have to say after I have made my comments.  There appear to be two issues.  One relates to deferred recognition of impaired loans.  Auditing standards have a trigger point in terms of when one can begin to recognise loans that will become impaired.  Apparently there was a practice some time back among credit institutions and perhaps other entitles of smoothing out the flows in their accounts in terms of recognising early or recognising later, according to when it suited, such that the overall appearance was of a smooth set of accounts.  The international standard maker moved to amend that.  In this instance it would appear that the trigger should have been pulled earlier than it was but, as I understand it, there is a set time for the trigger to be activated and in many of these cases that point would not have come.  This meant that loans that would become bad loans were there for people to see but the mechanism of the accounting standard was not triggered or the criteria were not met and therefore the process could not have been activated at that point.</p><p>  The second issue is the conjunction of the true and fair view with accounting standards.  Mr. Moynihan may wish to expand on this.  From my quick reading of the article yesterday I understand the author was suggesting that auditors were standing behind certain covers put in front of them.  The reality is that accounting standards are intrinsic to the production of accounts.  Accounting standards are underpinned by Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002.  Any individual standard adopted would be under that rubric and would have been vetted by many institutions in the EU and by member states.  Mr. Moynihan and I attend meetings at which these things are finally adopted.  They go through a rigorous process and they have a legal status.  One must take account of these standards.  The true and fair view is arrived at by the application of these standards.  There is no sense in which auditors were attempting to seek refuge behind something in this instance.  As far as we are aware that was not the case.  If the committee requires further clarity Mr. Moynihan will be pleased to supply it.</p><p>  Reference was made to the issue of the Central Bank supervisor - that certain reporting should have gone to the supervisor, but this did not happen in cases in which it should have happened and so on.</p></speech>

They may not have been wrong.  It is possible for a set of accounts to be right at a given point but to be overtaken by events subsequently.  Further, auditors can be sued by the shareholders.  It may not be easy to do so successfully but it is there, it can be done and it has been done.  In addition, the premise that those accounts were wrong is not necessarily valid, or at least it has not been demonstrated.</p></speech>

One is attempting to look into the future.  The going concern determination is in place to underpin the basis of valuations used in accounts.  It is not an absolute guarantee.  If it is not deemed appropriate to use the going concern determination or if the going concern is in doubt, the reaction would be to value a company's assets in the balance sheet on a break-up basis.  That is a fairly drastic next step to take.  One would be very brave to take that step with a financial institution because one could set off a run on the bank and on other banks, something one would hope to avoid.</p></speech>

I am told that it just does not happen owing to size, scale, resources and capabilities.</p></speech>

That is why they became the big four or big five.  Surely there should be mergers of audit firms to be on a par with them.

I have met representatives of the second tier firms also and asked is this a way forward.  I have not been met with rapturous applause for making the suggestion.  There is a different league involved.  Perhaps they are happy in their niche.  I am told that often when audits are offered, second tier firms do not bid for them.</p></speech>

That is part of what underpins the Commission's concern about only having four entities.  It is wondering what exactly will happen if one of them goes.  Equally, one could argue Arthur Andersen went and the number reduced from five to four and the world did not fall asunder.  What will probably happen is that it will merely aggrandise and the employees will be cannibalised by the remaining big three.  I accept it is not healthy, but it is difficult to know what to do.  The UK Office of Fair Trading is examining whether the audit market is open, fair and unbiased, etc.  Following that evaluation, it is due to come forward with a preliminary announcement some time in November.  That may be part of the reason the dossier is moving a little more slowly than it might otherwise do because people may want to be informed what the UK competition body has to state in the matter to see whether there is a suspicion of malpractice or that there is something going on that is not quite appropriate.</p></speech>

Even in the case of a credit union - we have all seen what happened in credit unions - one would see many medium-sized auditing firms carrying out such audits, but they are extremely onerous.  Even as time passes, the big four are doing more because they have the expertise which is gathered in continuously carrying out audits in the same environment.  That would be a big issue.</p></speech>

One would imagine that if second tier firms were to specialise in dealing with certain matters and were then to seek to amalgamate and merge, it might help, but that has not happened.  Nobody can force them to do it.  It is as simple as that.</p><p>  Deputy Anthony Lawlor referred to the liberalisation of ownership rules and wondered why we did not have a problem.  We do not have a problem because there are checks and balances to ensure nothing inappropriate can occur.  There are independence criteria that would always be applied to an entity that one audits as between the auditor and the audit entity; one certainly would not have Coca Cola buying into one of the big four and then being audited by that firm.  That simply could not happen.  We do not have a strong view on the matter.  If it enables these entities to capitalise themselves - if that is what they want to do - there are enough checks and balances built in to prevent the scenario about which the Deputy is thinking from occurring.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about three member states and the ESMA.  I must admit I do not know the names, but Luxembourg may be one of them.  To be honest with the Deputy, I am not sure what the significance is.  The ESMA is in the finance area, to put it in very broad terms, and I am not sure what significance should be attached to the fact that these three member states have an audit that is linked.  What will have to happen in order that other member states can agree that the ESMA can have the role the Commission wishes to apportion to it is that a genuine link will have to be made between the undertaking of audits in the member states and the ESMA in order that there will not be one body operating in the financial sector making rules and regulations and giving edicts to audit entities in terms of the governance structures in place.  That is our take on the point at issue.</p><p>  The Deputy commented on the length of time involved.  In one sense, there are mixed views.  We need to get it right - I think the Deputy himself made this point - because it could be with us for a long time and we do not want to hurry on it, but, equally, we do not want to delay because one loses impetus.</p><p>  Let me reassure the Deputy on Ireland's prospective stewardship of these dossiers.  We will be keen, if at all possible, to bring them to a conclusion and adoption.  The indications are not all that hopeful at this stage, but we will work hard.  We have had approximately 12 meetings of the working group to move matters along.  I can assure the committee that we will give it everything we have in this regard.</p><p>  Deputy &Aacute;ine Collins who rode to our rescue in one sense - I am being jocular - placed the emphasis on the apportioned role of the auditor as distinct from the role others might imagine an auditor should play and had some useful statements to make.  On mandatory rotation every three to five years, it will be interesting to see how this plays out.  Obviously, there will be many big players involved and it could come down to a tight contest in terms of what period will be picked.  I imagine that the voting rights of member states will be called into play on this issue because it is a tie-breaker in dealing with the entire dossier.  The Deputy clarified the point on medium-sized auditors.</p><p>  Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to the liberalisation of ownership rules.  I am not sure there is such liberalisation.  I have already referred to this issue.  I do not think there is a risk.  If somebody points out to us where it is, we will certainly seek to ameliorate it.  </p><p>  As I cannot read my writing, I am not sure whether there was another question.  Was another question put at the end?</p></speech>

The 2006 audit directive that the proposed directive is seeking to amend put in place a quasi-homogenous audit Community-wide in order that, whether one was in Ireland, Italy, France or Spain, the rules and regulations that applied were homogenous.   Up to now we did not see the need to put in place particular provisions in Ireland that were not to be found in the directive.  If people make representations and a strong case, obviously, we are always open to consider them.  The directive was posited on having in place a quasi-homogenous audit throughout the Community.  The directive is less binding to the extent that with a directive a member state will perceive itself as having a degree of discretion.</p> <p>With a regulation, however, it has direct effect and what the regulation says is what has to be done.  If the regulation is followed through, in its present complexion, with its 72 articles, we will have comparable, if not identical situations throughout the community.  It is a reasonable piece of work, in my view.  I am not sure if there are other areas that need to be covered but if people point any out to us, we will certainly seek to do that.  It is pretty comprehensive and if the regulation comes into force then no member state will have any option but to implement it.  That is exactly how the Commission wants it to happen.  The Commission said that it found some discrepancies in how member states implemented the 2006 directive.  Ireland was not called to account on that score, so we must have done it reasonably well, but other countries were called to account.  That forms part of the rationale for bringing forward a regulation in this case, so that there will be no crevices or gaps in any given member state.  It will be a community-wide system, applied by everybody in the same way.  </p></speech>

That link has not been made.  However, if we meet the committee again in the future and someone digs something up in the meantime that fingers an auditor or a firm of auditors, we would like to hear about it, discuss it and determine where the flaw or fault lay.  As of now, however, nothing like that has been identified.</p><p>  One thing that I have not mentioned so far, that is currently in train, is quality assurance.  I do not know if all members of the committee are familiar with that term, although I know at least one member is.  Embedded in the regulation is an obligation to have quality assurance for public interest entities, in particular, which is operated by the oversight authority in each member state, which is the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, in our case.  We are progressing along the route of instituting a quality assurance system which IAASA will operate, having recruited ten or 11 highly-qualified people to do so.  Effectively this will be an inspection system whereby the audit of public interest entities will be invigilated and inspected, not by the body to which the auditor or accountant belongs, but by IAASA.  In essence, IAASA will call to practitioners, ask for the files on audits, examine them, question the practitioners about them and so forth.  That is one of the most important elements of the regulation in terms of improving the whole area of auditing and hopefully we, as a country, will have our quality assurance system in place sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

This meeting has proved that it is a worthwhile exercise to go through some directives in detail.

The American Chamber of Commerce Ireland would like to thank the committee and its chairperson for the invitation to discuss the Irish-US economic relationship and specifically to discuss the critical role of US companies here.  As our report on the Irish-US economic relationship launched on 4 October shows, the positive impact on Ireland of the strong economic relationship with the United States of America is, quite simply, stunning and encouraging.  Even since the global crisis started the economic relationship between Ireland and the US has grown even stronger and this investment is still growing in 2012.  This year and last year have seen strong, net job growth from US investment.  This investment continues to play a vital role in Ireland.  The latest figures from our report show that US investment in Ireland soared by nearly 20% in 2011.  At $188 billion, it now is five times greater than it was ten years ago.  To put this into perspective, US investment in Ireland is well in excess of that in Germany, at $107 billion, or France, at $89 billion.</p> <p>It is also significantly ahead of China, at $54 billion, and India, at $24 billion.  It is heartening that there has not been a shift in the geographical preferences of US foreign direct investment, which remains directed towards Europe in general and Ireland in particular.  The strongest statistics illustrating the importance of this relationship to Ireland is that with a total output of $58 billion, US business in Ireland now accounts for almost one quarter of our GDP.</p><p> Especially welcome in this report is the news of stabilisation and a modest growth in employment in the manufacturing sector.  The sector has seen positive growth between 2009 and 2011 and overall 12,000 net jobs have been added by US companies in Ireland since 2000.  This leaves the total direct employment number at a record high of 107,000 or approximately 6% of the workforce.  It is vital to the sustainability of a strong economic relationship between the two countries that it remains very much a two-way relationship.  Irish companies in the US have a total investment of &euro;25 billion and employment levels remain strong.  Such companies are estimated to employ 120,000 employees in their operations and last year they generated $42 billion in US sales through their US operations.</p><p> Ireland's position in Europe is central to our ability to attract investment.  Our report finds much to be optimistic about in Europe's future ability to attract investment to our shores as it remains one of the largest economies in the world.  Europe continues to account for 30% of global consumption.  It is for access to this wealthy market that US companies are in Ireland.</p><p> The report predicts benefits accruing from Ireland's close proximity to what the report refers to as "the best business opportunities on the planet", specifically the growing markets of eastern Europe, the Middle East, north Africa and Russia and her satellites, a geographical area whose combined output is greater than that of China.  The report advises that Ireland needs to continue to manage its cost base and be conscious that other jurisdictions are becoming more competitive from a taxation perspective.  In addition, the number of technology-capable countries competing for investment has dramatically increased.  At the same time, the US has done much to reduce costs domestically and has become more competitive.</p><p> The report states that Ireland must ensure our niche in the global value chains of US multinationals.  While Ireland's to-do list is long, rising to a challenge is something at which the country excels.  In partnership with the US, our economic relationship is expected to remain robust and mutually beneficial.  It is important to remind ourselves that since the start of 2012, US companies have publicly announced investment worth $2 billion which will create more than 6,000 new jobs in what could be seen as a healthy diversity of industries, business activities and regional spread.  Investment by these firms has been instrumental in helping to create and develop a world-class labour force, critical in dispensing technology and innovation capabilities across the economy and key in expanding the global reach of indigenous firms.  The past two years have been the strongest two-year period of inflows from the US on record, with a surge in capital and confidence by US investors in Ireland.  This investment has bestowed macroeconomic benefits not only on the country in general but also in respect of building our research and development and, increasingly, commercialisation capacity.</p><p> This report is one of the American Chamber of Commerce's contributions to building up Ireland's reputation as an attractive business location for investment.  It will be used to grab the attention of would-be investors in order that they fully examine the reasons their peers are here and continue to invest.  This year's report concludes that despite a number of stiff headwinds, the ties that bind Ireland and the US remain sound and, while showing some cyclical strains, remain structurally strong.</p></speech>

It goes without saying that the relationship between Ireland and the US is of great importance, as is the success of Ireland in attracting foreign direct investment and of US companies operating here.  This relationship must be strengthened and developed.  It is startling to note that 107,000 people are employed by US firms, while Irish firms employ 120,000 people in the US.  I hope the balance will improve.  The reason the figure is so startling is that we tend to believe the relationship is much more proportionate to the sizes of the respective countries.</p><p>  I could focus my entire contribution on the positive relationships between Ireland and the US where much that is good is taking place.  However, one aspect of my role is to highlight issues that could be resolved by the Legislature.  Between January and August last year, exports to the US amounted to &euro;14 billion.  Over the same period this year, the value of exports to the US declined by &euro;2 billion.  The issue of the so-called &quot;patents cliff&quot; has given rise to much discussion here because approximately 60% of our exports are in pharmaceuticals and chemicals.  Is there any relationship between the reduction in exports to the US this year and the patents cliff and, if not, can the delegation assist in identifying the reasons for the decline?</p><p>  All the main parties in the D&aacute;il, including Sinn F&eacute;in, support Government policy on corporation tax, which has been important in attracting US investment.  However, the State does not focus sufficiently on improving other potential competitive advantages.  I am concerned that we may become a bargain basement tax location rather than a country that trades on competitive advantages such as high levels of productivity, low energy costs and good access to export markets, all of which are important for companies.  We know how Ireland's tax policies play on the economic front, including with the American Chamber of Commerce.  However, as we approach the presidential election in the US, we must bear in mind that they also play on the political front.  I note startling figures indicating that &euro;27.8 billion of profits were generated by US companies operating in Ireland and &euro;28 billion in royalties were repatriated.  The so-called double Irish taxation system and other issues have also arisen.  <i>The Irish Times</i> recently reported that the effective corporation tax rate here is 4% when one takes account of the various activities companies engage in - logically, from their perspective - to reduce their tax liabilities.  In highlighting these issues, I stress that they are only one aspect of an enterprise relationship with the US that is, for the most part, successful, positive and growing.  I ask the delegation to respond.</p></speech>

We all agree that the cornerstone of Irish industrial policy for the past five decades has been our corporation tax.  We always reinforce the point that the jewel in the crown of Ireland's offering remains our 12.5% corporation taxation rate and overall corporate taxation policy.  This is what gets us to the table when companies are considering world investment decisions.  Any uncertainty or greyness around our corporation tax can be very damaging in terms of retention and growth of US investment.</p><p>  Mr. Cotter referred to assets held by US companies in Ireland.  Consistently for the past seven years, including this year and last year, 70% of all of new investment in this country has come from companies that are already based here.  The opportunity for future investments - the badge of honour or advantage we have - is the 600 global companies that are located here.  </p><p>  As the statistics speak for themselves, I do not propose to repeat what Mr. Cotter said about jobs, investment and so forth.  On the US side, we are mindful of highly damaging commentary that is made about Ireland's tax status - for example, when the country is labelled as a tax haven.  While there some cases of aggressive tax practices, they all come within the ambit of approved taxation policies.</p> <p> Ireland is in the highest international tier, according to the OECD and has tax treaties with 60 countries, including the United States of America.  There is an onus on industry, the Government and all of those speaking to the international media to ensure that Ireland is not branded as a tax haven.  We are in full compliance and we must all remember that having a highly compliant, transparent and open taxation system remains a big jewel in our crown.  We are all aware of the forthcoming US presidential election and tax codes always features in election debates.  However, all of our multinational companies are global and need bases outside the United States of America.  Europe is our biggest market and will be for the foreseeable future.  In that context, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are the top three destinations for US investment flows into Europe, while approximately 50% of all US investment still flows into Europe.  Therefore, we need to ensure that Ireland continues to be positioned as a global location for foreign direct investment and what keeps us at that table is our corporate tax rate of 12.5%</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.181" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter O'Neill" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012101600013#M00300"><p>Most companies, when deciding to make investments, look at the long term rather than the short term and critical in that is the question of certainty.  In fairness to successive Governments, they have been very consistent on this issue and have recognised that it is a cornerstone of our economic policy and will stay that way.  My own experience and that of other CEOs I have spoken to indicates that the competition for foreign direct investment is intensifying all of the time.  Not only are some countries improving their game, others which did not have the capacity to compete in the past are moving up the value chain as well.  If there was any hint of uncertainty around our corporate tax rate, other countries would play on that to our disadvantage.  That is why it is very important that we are rock solid on that issue.</p><p>  Apart from the tax rate which, as Ms Richardson said, is the key foundation, there are other policies that we also need to work on.  The mandates of a lot of companies in Ireland have been changing and evolving in recent years.  For example, the whole issue of research and development and the attractiveness of doing it in Ireland is critically important.  Indeed, last week we had the announcement from an Irish company, Kerry Group, that it has decided to locate a research and development facility in Ireland.  That is a very important issue, as is the issue of talent and the ability to attract skilled workers, which we would be very happy to discuss further.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.183" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cotter" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012101600013#M00500"><p>I will finish on the issue of tax and then go on to that question.   In terms of the history of Irish tax policy, the corporate tax rates were even lower at one stage but Ireland did not attract the same level of investment as it does now.  Today we have a combination of a strong competitive position, particularly with the talent that we have here, and a very good business proposition, with the certainty surrounding the 12.5% rate.  There are other locations that have lower rates but we are not advocating any change.  We want certainty, which is a very valuable commodity.</p><p>  Regarding the patents cliff in the pharmaceutical sector, the Deputy has a very perceptive insight into the industry and this is an issue that has been predicted for some time.  The large pharmaceutical companies have had a gap in their research and development platforms for some time.  It was always known that at the end of the last decade or the beginning of this one, their product portfolio would look a little weaker and hence, they have been acquiring a lot of companies.  I do not know if the committee is aware of the life sciences task force, established by the IDA and Forf&aacute;s, which is very interesting. </p><p>  In recent years we have seen a strengthening of the pharmaceutical sector although there is no doubt that a transformation is under way.  Companies are making major decisions about their product mix.  Some, whose products are going off patent, are still interested in competing in those markets, while others are not.  In terms of the number of companies in the sector, new ones have come into Ireland in recent years, like Amgen and Mylan.  The sector looks quite dynamic and there will be some churn there, but that is no different from any other sector which has transformed over recent decades.  Companies are doing very different things now to what they were doing ten or 20 years ago.  That is something that we will all have to watch.  It is heartening, however, that from a policy perspective, this change is well understood and is under constant examination to determine how we can strengthen those companies in the longer term.  </p><p>  In terms of the aforementioned value chain, some of the pharmaceutical companies, such as MSD, for example, are looking at other opportunities in their business, beyond manufacturing.  Some are considering research and development opportunities and indeed, research and development activity is expanding quite healthily in Ireland.  Other issues like centralised services, European headquarters, IT development, finance and so forth are being considered and the companies in question are expanding in many different ways within the sector.  That is all playing to the strengths of Ireland as a location for international businesses to set up and run their regional headquarters.  There is a lot to be optimistic about and the sector is definitely one to watch.  </p></speech>

We must also determine whether Irish companies are doing more business through their subsidiaries in the United States.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question directly as to whether there has been a fundamental change.  However, one thing that is clear is that the sector is quite active in terms of employment and business opportunities, which is healthy and very important for the wider economy.</p></speech>

In the context of the US presidential campaign, I am conscious of much commentary around the notion of bringing jobs back home.  I have also heard it argued that the environment in the US is better for setting up businesses now, with improved competitiveness, reduced energy prices and so forth.  The witnesses made the point that a European base will always be important but is there a trend towards establishing bases in the United States in preference to Europe?  Are the aforementioned arguments having an effect?</p><p>  I also wish to raise the issue of skills, to which Mr. O'Neill referred earlier.  There has been regular commentary from the chamber on the skills needs of its member companies and on our education system and I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that area.</p></speech>

Europe will still remain a very significant part of business for US companies.  For the United States, Europe represents over 50% of world economic activity.  It is a strong market place and US companies will still want to do business here for the foreseeable future.  The last two years have seen the strongest investment flow to Ireland on record, based on the fact that not only do we have a very good business proposition but also great experience built up within the operations and great talent, in terms of leadership.  Those people are at the most senior level within their organisations, which provides us with great opportunities.  We will always have to respond to competitive challenges and there is no doubt that the mid-to-lower end of manufacturing and the energy-rich industries in the US will become more competitive over the next decade, mainly because of changes in the labour market and lower energy prices in the US.  We must be sensitive to that and address it.  It is interesting that in many of our member companies, one hears commentary around skills gaps in the United States, which still exist.  That is critical and will play to our advantage if we can address it.  Ireland is often mentioned in the same breath as Singapore.  Ireland is to Europe what Singapore is to Asia and we must capitalise on that and build on the investment that has come in.</p></speech>

We have been vocal about the need to be cognisant of these signals.</p><p> In regard to the changing mandates of companies located here, we are all trying to move up the value chain.  While this is great in terms of the quality of the jobs offered, it also means they will increasingly be skills based.  The demographic changes that will take place in Europe in the coming 15 to 20 years offer Ireland an opportunity to become an attractive hub if we have the right quality of people available.  It is a question of putting in place long-term educational policies to reform everything from the junior cycle programme to third level, balanced with shorter term tactical actions because, obviously, we will not see the college outcomes of junior cycle programme reform for another eight years.</p></speech>

I visited that country recently to attend a global conference of American chambers.  Inward investment is high on the US agenda.  Ireland was the tenth largest investor in the United States, which is a very positive position.  In respect of the general public relations game about investment in Ireland and international messaging, part of the chamber&rsquo;s job is to promote awareness that the flow of investment moves in two directions.  This two-way relationship benefits both nations.</p></speech>

The &euro;30 billion that came into the country was greater than the amount US companies invested in Asia, including China, and this year 6,200 jobs will be created if one counts the five announcements made today.  Some 70% of this investment has come from the existing base of countries.  We should focus on retaining existing investments.</p><p>  The Economist Intelligence Unit issued its annual report on foreign direct investment at the end of March.  More than 315 US multinationals operating in the United States, Europe and Asia were surveyed and the report projects further investment of &euro;7.7 billion and that 20,000 new jobs will be created by US companies by 2014.  The projections are positive in a global context and Ireland remains well positioned thanks to our existing base and IDA Ireland&rsquo;s focus on attracting newer companies for sales, marketing and support functions in Europe.  </p><p>  In regard to retaining investment, our corporation tax rate is critical, but the biggest issue concerns our skills base.  Mr. O&rsquo;Neill has been proactive on this issue during his presidency of the chamber.  There is a big pull on global talent, particularly in the short term, and while good policies are being developed for the medium and longer term, we face an immediate need to recruit persons with particular skills in Ireland.  We produce a work activation survey on 6 July every year to correspond with our 4 July event.  On that date more than 2,500 positions were vacant across multiple sectors of industry and 53% of these positions will have to be filled from outside the country.  That figure was higher a couple of years ago and, while we would like it to decrease further, companies are indicating the need for certain tactical positions and actions to be taken to address immediate skill requirements.</p></speech>

It is a question of deciding where we go from here.  More recently we have seen considerable investment by Internet companies.  Perhaps we need to do more to attract start-up and smaller entrepreneurial companies.  The other clusters have already achieved good penetration rates, but there is a limit to the number of additional companies which can be attracted to Ireland.</p></speech>

Many of our member companies have developed linkages with Irish start-up companies.

Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are investigating this area with a view to identifying opportunities.  In general, it is necessary to find out what is driving the multinationals.  One of the trends in the past ten years has been consolidation of supply chains.  Irish companies must ask whether they are fit for the purpose of supplying multinational companies on a global basis rather than just locally.  In some cases they will need to upgrade their skills and technology.  There is a greater understanding of this issue and I hope the current programme Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland are running will identify opportunities.</p><p>  Multinationals are increasingly drawn into Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s programme of investment in research and development.  Current trends such as the convergence of sectors suggest there will be better opportunities for collaboration in the research and development space as we progress from research to development and commercialisation.  Irish companies can take advantage of these opportunities to become involved with multinationals at that level.  The investments Irish companies are making in research and development through Enterprise Ireland should allow for a confluence of entrepreneurship.  The university-led programmes around the centres for science, engineering and technology will need that injection of entrepreneurship if we are to make their research outputs more commercially applicable.</p> <p>We will see more development opportunities and jobs.  Perhaps in ten or 20 years we will be talking not about indigenous or foreign companies but about Irish-based companies.  That is probably where we would want to go to in the conversation, namely, to have a mix of ownership and management which would be world class in their fields.</p></speech>

We heard the Sinn F&eacute;in representative, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, eloquently supporting the 12.5% corporation tax rate.  That is refreshing and important because, as was said, confidence in the future is critical before any company will invest.</p><p>  One of the points I find very satisfying is the transfer of management skills.  In the 1980s many of the chief executives of multinationals in Ireland were American ex-pats whereas we now have Mr. O'Neill and all of this Irish management.  We were an agriculture-based country but we were dragged into economic development by the multinationals, in my opinion.  Much of my personal life is tied up with all of this.</p><p>  I have two questions.  First, page 81 of the report states:<blockquote>...there is a better-than-fair chance that a transatlantic free trade agreement between the EU and the United States could be up for serious discussion after the US presidential elections, with both Republican candidate Mitt Romney and President Obama in favour ... of such of an agreement.  As a bridge to both the US and Europe, Ireland would benefit from a trade agreement that would deepen the commercial ties between both parties.</blockquote>What role can the American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland and fellow American chambers of commerce in other EU countries play in promoting such an agreement from here on?</p><p>  Second, the report states at page 86: &quot;Ireland's &#8220;to do list&#8221; is long; put another way, the race to remain globally competitive never ends.&quot;  We take that for granted.  If the witnesses could pick one, which would they say is the most important item on the &quot;to do&quot; list?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Joanne Richardson" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012101600015#O00300"><p>I will take the first part.  To pick up on two points, and Mr. Cotter and Mr. O'Neill will back me up on this, there is wide recognition and appreciation among all of our members around the country of the importance of cross-party support for our 12.5% rate.  This has come very much to the fore since the troika came in and, in the last year and a half, has almost become a national strategic issue for us all, publicly, politically and in business.  There is wide recognition and appreciation of that.</p><p>  The second point is also well put.  Nearly every US company in Ireland is now run by an Irish person and many of them now have global mandates.  We have many global vice presidents where the company or the facility here in Ireland has become a global centre of excellence.  That is why, in recent years, we have seen so much reinvestment by companies here.</p><p>  On the transatlantic trade agreement, we are aware this will probably come to the fore after the elections.  We have already had discussions with Mr. Tom Donohue, the chief executive and president of the US Chamber of Commerce, who is a very great friend to Ireland and has been to Ireland many times.  There have also been discussions among the AmChams in Europe, where there are 39 or 40 AmChams.  There is an infrastructure in place through our AmChams in Europe and our connections with our US chamber colleagues.  Locally, the support of the Irish presidency of American Chamber of Commerce in Ireland will be to get behind and be vocally and physically supportive of pushing that trade agreement forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Cotter" time="15:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2012101600015#O00400"><p>On the trade deal, it is estimated the current tariffs that exist broadly between the US and the EU are between 3% and 4%, although they vary depending on the products and sectors.  There is an opportunity in this regard.  The main challenges are the non-tariff barriers such as bureaucracy, getting regulation on both sides working together and being cognisant of both sides when rules are being made so we create a move towards a more internal market.  There have been estimates from the US Chamber of Commerce and a group called the Business Roundtable in Washington that this could add between 1% and 2% to GDP growth in both economies, which is not an insignificant amount.</p><p>  With regard to the wish list, we are currently starting a process we undertake every autumn of meeting multinationals.  In the next couple of days we will meet approximately 150 CEOs of multinationals, having started this morning in Dublin.  Central to our approach to meetings with Ministers in the last couple of months is that, while we understand what needs to be done in terms of the fiscal adjustment and the targets that are set out, there is great concern about the costs of employment, which goes back to a number of points we have made today.  One of the strong pillars of what we have in regard to foreign direct investment is the experience, leadership and talent we have in our people.  These people are highly mobile, however, and it is a fragile resource.  We need to be very conscious of this when we look at the costs of employment either directly, in terms of marginal income tax or the income tax burden, or indirectly, in terms of changes in the social welfare code that might apply in regard to sick leave and so on.  We ask Deputies and Senators to be cognisant of this in the upcoming preparations for the budget and in any proposals being considered.</p></speech>

We met with approximately 50 CEOs this morning in the first of our forums.  Top of their agenda is this whole question of attraction and retention of talent and, therefore, of personal taxation.  In fact, one example quoted this morning came from a company which is trying to persuade a particular key individual to move from the US to here.  Given a marginal tax rate of 35% in the US versus 52% here, it is a difficult sell if one is trying to persuade a key individual.  As Mr. Cotter said, while recognising the overall fiscal challenge over the next number of years, we need to be very careful that we do not impose any further burden.</p></speech>

My personal opinion is that we should be taxing higher pay, although that may not be my party's view.  The cuts are so devastating that it might be fairer to tax people on higher incomes.  That is where I come from.  Is that really a matter of life and death?</p></speech>

A strategic choice we are laying out here is the investment platform that is strongly based on track record, which is one of the pillars used by the IDA when it sells Ireland.  That track record is built on experience but it is a fragile resource.  We need to be strategic about this, understanding there are trade-offs.  We are just asking the Government, Deputies and Senators to consider this point, knowing there are tough choices to be made.  Our proposition goes no further.</p></speech>

I apologise as, while I saw some of the presentation on screen, I was caught up with another meeting.</p><p>  I will be brief.  It is great to see the fluid and flexible nature of the business relationship and the enthusiasm to bring it along and to encourage more foreign direct investment into this country, hopefully to our mutual benefit.  We know that is business and that business requires reciprocal benefits on each side.  In all manner and means, we are very geared towards that here and I know it is something the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in particular, pursues doggedly.</p> <p>At a certain level we have agreements and arrangements but in the context of Irish citizens in the United States who do not have permits and are not there legally, would it be worth considering that American citizens should get work permits for this country?  A reciprocal arrangement could be set up to our mutual benefit.  I am surprised that approach has not been pursued.  For example, we issue 50,000 working visas to the US and it does the same for us in exchange.  A similar arrangement is in operation with Australia.  Citizens immediately know a programme exists of which they can avail.</p><p> Senator Clune referred to skills shortages in the ICT sector.  At times there are difficulties obtaining work permits, although I accept there is a high success rate.  Unfortunately, it seems that key personnel fail to transfer.  I accept the skilled workers we want are not confined to the US but we could take it to the next level and allow US citizens to come to this country to work, if that is what they want, rather than always going there to ask for help.  We are a small open economy and the United States is a good friend.  If we take such an approach on a reciprocal basis perhaps it would be more appealing to the US Government and the various interests in that country.  It would also mean that American citizens could follow their investment money.</p></speech>

We support the principle that we must make it easier and more attractive for people to come to this country.  It is not just an Irish phenomenon; there is a worldwide shortage of ICT skills.  Anything we could do to make this country a more attractive and easier location to attract talent is well worth considering.</p></speech>

There are company-specific issues around visas.  There is an <i>ad hoc</i> route via the IDA for individuals.  However, what was taking four months a year and a half ago is taking six to nine months once the person has been identified and the company has carried out its due diligence and offered them a job.  What happens in the world we live in is that with such a delay either the project is gone or the person is gone.  Companies have real life examples of where investment has been lost.  We have officially made representation on the issue.  One aspect is the processing of visas and the other side on which we have more work to do ourselves is opening up the visa system and welcoming people with certain skills into the country on a green card system to build a pool of skills.  We must build such a pool in the short term.</p></speech>

What are the comparative effective tax rates between both countries?  Am I correct in saying the Netherlands receives the greatest level of FDI as per the report?  It has one of the highest marginal tax rates in the world.  I wish to get a better understanding of the issue.  We are having an important debate coming up to the budget.  We hear it said that if we touch the marginal tax rate in this country we will affect the level of investment and jobs created.  It is important for us to be able to provide an evidence base for our policy.  Is there research of the job versus the marginal tax ratio internationally?</p></speech>

We have dealt with problems for member companies last year such as the US gap and changes in accounting rules.  The engagement was slower than would normally be the case with Irish companies, which come straight to us with a problem much more quickly.  I am conscious that there might be issues with which help is required.  The companies could engage with the committee on a more regular basis.

We also have to deal with the work of the D&aacute;il select sub-committees in regard to the Estimates and legislation.  In this regard, the forthcoming climate change Bill will be a major challenge to each and every one of us.

It is appalling we had to hear of it in this way.  This appeared in the newspapers yesterday and the radio stations had the story this morning.  Town councillors in our constituencies, many of whom have served for 25 and 30 years, telephoned members from all parties wanting to know what was happening.  It is not good enough.  What is our committee for?</p></speech>

I am exceptionally disappointed about this when the proposals are of such a fundamental nature and will have a major impact on democracy, particularly at local level.

Article 3.1 of that directive provides a generic definition of packaging and criteria on what can be viewed as packaging.  Annexe 1 of the directive provides an illustrative list of the application of these criteria.  The aim of the directive is to facilitate the implementation and enforcement of the packaging legislative framework and to create a level playing field for package producers across the EU internal market.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has advised that the list is nothing more than illustrative.  The legal definition provided in the directive determines what is packaging and that definition has not been amended.  The Commission has produced the illustrative list to give greater clarity on foot of requests from industry sources.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 221 is a proposal for a Council decision on the adoption of the 2012-15 high-flux reactor supplementary research programme, to be implemented by the joint research centre of the European Atomic Energy Community, EURATOM.  An agreement was signed between EURATOM and the Netherlands in 1961 for the Commission to use the experimental high-flux reactor, which is located at EURATOM's joint research centre in Petten in the Netherlands.  The operation of the high-flux reactor has been supported by a series of supplementary research programmes funded by Belgium, France and the Netherlands.  This proposal seeks to put in place a further supplementary research programme for the period 2012 to 2015, with funding from the same countries.  Ireland supports the supplementary research programme as it benefits from the medical isotope production of the reactor and regards as positive research into improving nuclear safety standards.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2012) 242 is a proposal for a Council directive laying down basic safety standards for protection against the dangers arising from exposure to ionising radiation.  Even exposure to low levels of ionising radiation can cause ill-effects to health, including in particular cancer later in life.  The overall objective of the initiative is to ensure a high level of protection to workers, members of the public and patients against the potentially serious health consequences arising from exposure to ionising radiation, while also protecting the environment.  This directive also seeks to simplify existing legislation by consolidating the five concurrent directives that exist at present.  This proposal first appeared in Commission document COM (2011) 593 in September 2011.  Due to the highly technical nature of the proposal, a technical working group made amendments to it before it was signed off by the college of Commissioners.  Ireland does not have a nuclear industry but it recognises the right of other member states to determine their own energy mix, including nuclear energy.  In that context, Ireland's position is that the nuclear power industries of member states should operate to the highest international standards of safety and environmental protection.  The joint committee has sought and received information from the Department on its considered views on the unamended proposal and has received an undertaking that it will be kept informed of all developments.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  I propose that we suspend the meeting to allow the witnesses who are appearing before the committee to take their seats.  When they have done so we will consider the topic of maintaining and enforcing regulations in the building sector.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Aidan O'Connor, a member of the Building Regulations Advisory Body and principal adviser in the architecture and building standards section of the housing and planning division of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government; and Mr. Paris Beausang, from the architecture and building standards section.</p><p>  I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by this committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>I also advise them that the opening statement and any other documents they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  </p><p> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in any such way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p> Before commencing with the presentation I wish to say a few words.  I thank Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Beausang for attending the committee today in what is a period of interregnum for the BRAB.  The old board has completed its term of office and the new one has yet to be appointed so the witnesses are very much manning the stations on their own.  The BRAB advises the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on matters relating to building regulations, and it is how these regulations are formulated and proposed and the basis on which advice is given to the Minister we wish to discuss today.  In particular, I am interested to hear if the body anticipates developments in the sector and how the regulations can be framed to prevent rather than react to problems as they arise.  This is not always possible but perhaps the witnesses might explain to us what efforts are being made in order to address that in so far as is practicable. </p><p> The building sector has been hit with a number of serious problems in recent years.  The pyrite problem and Priory Hall immediately come to mind.  One might reasonably ask how these situations came about and how it happened, when regulations were in place, that these buildings were built with such obvious defects.  They have had horrifying consequences for the people who have to bear the brunt of the problem.  What other hidden or potential risks exist, and how can we best plan in order to avoid them?  Those two cases stand out in our minds.  This happened many miles from where I live but one could not help being touched by the misery inflicted on hard-working, honest to God people who, in respect of Priory Hall, are now paying mortgages for properties they vacated more than a year ago.  That is gut-wrenching.  How was this allowed to happen?  Although universal standards exist to be applied, all of a sudden it has ended up in this way.  The witnesses might begin by addressing those points.</p></speech>

The Building Regulations Advisory Body, or BRAB, was set up under section 14 of the Building Control Act and advises the Minister on related building regulations.

The next BRAB will convene in the coming weeks and will have suitable experts, taken from among people who have responded to the Government's call for expressions of interest from those interested in serving on State boards.

The Act sets out clear legal standards that have to be met in the building regulations.  It states the regulations simply; the builder must comply with health and safety standards for the building.  It goes on to provide detailed guidance in the technical guidance documents, sometimes referred to as TGDs, which tell builders how, if they build in accordance with those documents, they are compliant.  Builders rely on those very strongly.  The burden of responsibility for compliance rests first and foremost on the developers under section 8(3)(<i>a</i>).  Designers come under section 8(1)(<i>b</i>) and building owners under section 8(3)(<i>a</i>).  The Act covers that.  The statutory responsibility is for professionals who design according to the regulations and the responsibility for enforcing compliance rests with the building regulation local authority, over 37 local authorities in the country.  There is a cascade of responsibilities.  The role of the Minister is to provide regulations.  In our daily role we work within the building standards section so we are working on those regulations and on their proposed revision.</p><p>  BRAB would have had a role in initiating a fresh look at building regulations and asking what should happen.  Two studies were made by committees within the body which looked at the regulations and how they could be brought forward.  There was a larger, more general study and a small detailed submission and these became the advice on revision to the Minister.  To clarify, the Minister does not have any role in the enforcement activity - that is delegated to local authorities.  That issue is sometimes misunderstood.  Developers and owners are responsible first and foremost because they initiate the work and compliance rests clearly on them.  In this regard the Act enables a local authority to issue an enforcement notice which is issued under the Building Control Act. </p><p>  I refer to Priory Hall.  It is interesting to remember that the action was taken under the Fire Safety Act, another piece of legislation, which took priority over the work the building control was developing in Dublin City Council.  I can return to that.  </p><p>  Defects have to be remediated.  There are statutory requirements which become the measure by which one can state the correct way to deal with a matter if there is a dispute on site or in the course of construction.  The requirement becomes the reference whereby the issue can be resolved on site.  If it does not get resolved there the result might be legal action, as we outlined in detail, and the matter can end up in the High Court, as we know.  However, there are other issues which could be dealt with beforehand.  The Act gives local authorities powers to scrutinise proposals, inspect work in progress, serve enforcement notices for non-compliance under the Building Control Act, institute proceedings for breaches of regulations and seek High Court injunctions for non-compliance.  If there is failure to comply there is a fine of &euro;5,000 on summary prosecution which can rise to &euro;50,000, and imprisonment.  One can be both fined and imprisoned, in a first case for six months and in a second for up to two years.</p><p>  A target has been set for inspection rates of between 12% and 15%.  This is more like an audit inspection approach for any building that has a valid commencement notice.  That notice triggers the action to be taken and whether there will be an inspection on site.  Statistics show that, in general, there is an average inspection rate of about 24% on all buildings taken into account.  It is up to the local authorities to apply their endeavours in this regard.  The Building Control Act also provides for a statutory process in regard to fire safety certificates and disability access.  Both are dealt with as separate items.  It was on the fire safety certificate side that action was taken in the case of Priory Hall.  That highlights most of the points. </p><p>  In the proposed new regulations, we are to commence section 6(2)(<i>a</i>)(i) of the Building Control Act 1990, a section that was never enacted.  It requires the submission to building control authorities of certificates of compliance that certify whether a building is in compliance with the regulations.  That obviously did not happen in the cases mentioned.  What  happened was that others filled that gap with opinions of compliance.  We can go into that in further detail.  The proposals aim to change the regulations by requiring the submission of drawings and documentation that demonstrate compliance with the building regulations.  There is a statutory form of the certificate of compliance.  We have worked this through with the stakeholders, we have an agreement and the Minister is bringing that forward.  The statutory forms will have regulations governing how they are used.  There is a code of practice lying behind this.  There is also an engagement with the City and County Managers Association, with a view to taking a regionalised shared services approach model to the administration of building control.  We will then have standardised approaches and common protocols.</p> <p>The reason for this is to try to ensure some kind of nationwide consistency.  Experience with disability access certificates, DACs, reinforces our belief in the need for that because if something is not adequately described or defined, then people can be very free in their interpretation of what is intended.</p><p> The proposed regulations were released for public consultation earlier in the year.  We received over 500 submissions in respect of them, which was a record.  Normally, we would receive approximately 20 or 30 submissions in connection with matters of this nature.  The Department reviewed these submissions and consulted directly with the key stakeholders who put some of them forward.  We then developed a stakeholder group in order to advance the detail.  We also established a study group which was tasked with defining the code of practice relating to how the legislation will be applied.</p><p> To put it in its simplest form, it involves a chain of responsibility.  The designer will take responsibility for the design being compliant and the contractor will take responsibility for building what is envisaged in compliance with the regulations.  The latter will be able to rely on the former's drawings and specifications in order to ensure compliance.  There will also be a separate assigned certifier who will be a competent professional charged with overseeing projects and ensuring that the requisite standards are applied.  Effectively, this person will act as an independent assessor in respect of those standards.  The reference in this regard will be the code of practice.  An inspection programme will be established by the certifier and this will be in place for the entirety of the project.  Certificates and ancillary certificates will be supplied in order to support all of the relevant detail.  Effectively, there will be a large file in respect of each job.  The detail to which I refer will be submitted to local authorities by electronic means.  This is how we see the system being strengthened.</p><p> Everybody knows the history of what occurred at Priory Hall so I will not go into it.  However, what happened there was treated as a fire safety issue.  There is an ongoing resolution process in respect of Priory Hall, which is being conducted by Mr. Justice Joseph Finnegan and in which the parties are still actively involved.  This process arose in the context of the adjournment of an appeal which Dublin City Council brought in respect of obtaining an order from the High Court regarding the payment of costs.  The Department understands that the appeal is due for mention before the Supreme Court on 18 October next.  Given that the matter is before the courts, it would not be appropriate for us to comment on it.  I will state that some work appears to be going on and that this is being led by Mr. Justice Finnegan.  We hope this represents an opportunity to develop matters.</p></speech>

In respect of Priory Hall, the regulations were bypassed.  How did that come to pass?</p></speech>

The errors, mistakes, oversights or whatever were due to the way Priory Hall was built.  The omission of the fire-stopping insulation within the cavity walls is the issue that really brought everything into focus.</p></speech>

Those who were involved in construction during the boom or who are constructing one-off dwellings at present will inform one that a great many regulations apply.  People make conscientious efforts to comply with those regulations, not on foot of bureaucratic direction but because they are obliged to do so.  Compliance with the regulations is in everyone's best interests.  At what stage did someone visit Priory Hall in order to discover whether the regulations were being adhered to?  What examinations were carried out and what reports were compiled on foot of such examinations?  When the problem became obvious, what efforts were made to identify the companies, etc., from which the materials used at Priory Hall were sourced and to test those materials?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-16a.272" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Connor" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2012101600006#G00500"><p>To clarify, the Department does not have a role in the context of inspecting sites.  At that time people could apply to obtain the first-time buyers' grant or to access whatever schemes were available.  An inspection was carried out by one of the Department's inspectorates and this focused on floor area compliance.  Under the definition which then existed, the floor area defined the threshold relating to whether one's property would be exempt from stamp duty.  The inspection to which I refer was carried out on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners.  At that stage there was a tax exemption scheme in place and, effectively, this was for first-time buyers.  An inspector from the Department visited the site but that was to examine the position with regard to floor areas.  His inspection was not for building control purposes.  The certificate issued in respect of the floor area inspection stipulates that it is not for such purposes.  The reason for this is that building control is clearly defined as being the responsibility of local authorities.  The Minister and the local authorities must, in a way, act separately and respect each other's areas of responsibility.</p><p>  Defects were first noticed internally as a result of exploratory that was work carried out.  Effectively, this was at completion and occupation stage.  Dublin City Council discovered a number of issues and obliged the contractor to return to review these.  It became concerned with the lack of fire stopping in the cavity walls.  The internal structure in those units is timber frame but the outer skin is brick.  Some parts at the top of the building have timber cladding.  For the most part, however, there is an outer skin of brick.  There were concerns about how this skin was fixed to the building.  Where apartments are separate from each other, there would have to be fire stopping in place around each of them and concerns also arose in respect of this matter.  To put it very simply, Part B of the building control regulations requires compartmentalisation.  The latter is taken very seriously by anyone who is involved in construction because compartmentalisation must be maintained in order that a fire in one unit will not spread to others.  If there is a fire in a structure that is properly compartmentalised, then the emergency services can focus on saving those who are in the unit in which the fire breaks out.</p><p>  The absence of a fire-stopping material in the cavity walls at Priory Hall became a serious issue.  The way in which the external wall was fixed to the internal walls of the structure also gave rise to questions.  The former is supposed to be attached to the latter at the points at which the structure is strongest.  A procedure exists in this regard.  The Department was instrumental in having the timber frame construction consortium report carried out in 2002 - it was published in 2003 - which indicated that any such construction applying to multiple units would have to be done according to the manufacturer's requirements and specifications.  The latter are quite detailed.  I am only offering an opinion here but I must state that if fire stopping material was absent, then it was not done in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements and specifications.</p></speech>

What was the level of interaction between the Department and the local authority?  Why were the defects not noticed until construction had been completed?  It is reasonable to assume that most of the people who purchased units in Priory Hall obtained mortgages.  One of the conditions with regard to drawing down a mortgage is that an engineer or some appropriately qualified individual must sign off in respect of the various phases of construction of the property to be purchased.</p> <p>With so many people signing off, such as the local authority, the Department or the engineers employed by the lending banks, why were defects only noticed post-construction?</p></speech>

These are performance standards.  The manufacturers must demonstrate that their materials are compliant.  The Chairman refers to extracting material from a quarry.  This is covered by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation because the quarry is a business, effectively.  However, quarries are required to test materials because they are a business selling a product.  It comes down to a point of sale issue.  They are selling a material which, although it is a component part, is part of the building structure.  It is not like a window or other manufactured item but the quarried stone is being used.  The specification would be No. 804 which the Department set as a standard and many local authorities followed that standard.  The NRA also uses that standard.  It was regarded as a premium labelling for stone and it is to do with the size of the stone.  The number 804 became the shorthand for high-quality stone - in other words, such stone did not contain an imperfection or any form of defect.  Builders relied on that standard.  Sometimes builders used other standards of stone such as three-inch down.  No. 804 was often the standard specified when writing specifications and this would be expected to be a clean stone that can be compacted and laid to compacted level.  A concrete floor could then be laid on top of that and this floor often floats on top of it.  The problem with the pyrite was that the pyrite contaminant was sold with stone like that.</p></speech>

I refer to the certificates of compliance.  Those, in the main, relate to compliance with the building regulations and with the planning permission that may have been granted for the development.  Who polices the certification of compliance with the building regulations on behalf of the Department?  Is it the case that the Department is dependent on insurance companies to inform it of the lack of regard for those same regulations as certified by certain individuals?  It is ironic that we are talking about this on a day when the reform of local government is spoken about, and "spoken about" is the operative phrase.  Each local authority has a planning enforcement officer but the local authorities do not have sufficient funding to allow these officers to police planning in the desired right and proper manner.  This has been to our detriment in the past and it needs to be addressed in the future, if that role is to be taken seriously.  These professionals certify buildings to be compliant with planning regulations.  They also carry out other functions such as fire safety.  If it is the case that local authorities in the past and to date are dependent on independent persons to vouch for this compliance, that is a sorry state that needs to be addressed.  What is the opinion of the Department in that regard?</p></speech>

I mentioned section 6 of the Act.  A requirement for statutory certificates of compliance is one of the reforms we are introducing.

It was an opinion of compliance used for conveyancing purposes.

I just said it was an arrangement between the legal professions and the other professions to achieve conveyancing.  What we are proposing now is the implementation of that part of the Act which should have been implemented before.  The certificates will now be statutory.  We have done a lot of work to explain how they work and who has to have input into the process.  Effectively, this proposal sets a chain of responsibility in any work carried out and at every level.  There has to be a chain of responsibility so that one can depend on the specifications being correct, for example.  An opinion of compliance, in my opinion, was checking whether a building was built in that way.  Very responsible professionals would say "Yes" or "No".</p></speech>

I refer to the local authority planning enforcement officers who have not been sufficiently resourced either in the past, present or future, going on what I have read today.

There are plenty more examples.  One of the common denominators is that the people who are left holding the mortgage are the people who purchased.  Clearly, there is a lack of protection.  If we do not learn from this problem and do not respond by putting suitable protections in place, we will repeat it.  Does the board accept that the fault lies with the fact that anyone can open up a builders' yard and start building?  Does it accept there is a need for builders to have a licence, which they can lose if they breach regulations?  Other than that solution I do not see how, even with all of the building and planning regulations, we will get to grips with the problem.  I would like to hear the board's views on my suggestion.</p><p>  Kildare is a sizeable county that has continued to develop, and its population has trebled between the early 1970s and now.  My experience of such development has been that the local authority - and I do not think the scenario is different anywhere else - acts in its own interest and it looks at what it will assume responsibility for in the end.  For example, the board stated that between 12% and 15% of buildings are to be inspected.  Apartment blocks are not taken in charge by local authorities.  They do not ensure they have the same level of oversight for apartment blocks as they do for houses because shared spaces will ultimately be taken in charge by the local authorities.  If they do prioritise, in my experience, it tends to be the apartments that will be taken in charge by the local authority at some point in the future that get the kind of scrutiny that one hopes all buildings would receive.  Has the board examined the inspection mix?  There is less of a legacy of building apartments here and, possibly, less competence in building them.  They have come to the fore in terms of being more likely to be demolished and so on.</p><p>  Was a red flag flown at any point with regard to the exposure and risk associated with the fact that section 6(2)(<i>a</i>)(i) was not part of the regime?  Many people will be exposed by virtue of the fact that opinions of competence are a lower tier and are not the same measurement as something that is statutorily based.  Does that have consequences for people who have already gone through the approval process and own their houses but discover deficiencies?  Is there a get-out-of-jail-free clause as a result of the lower standard being applied?</p><p>  Technical guidance was provided when the pyrite problem was identified.  Does the board automatically provide regulations in such cases?  How do problems and lower standards reach the board's radar?  There are 37 local authorities.  Mr. O'Connor talked about common protocols but each local authority is a law unto itself and has a differing range of staff.  Counties whose populations have grown in recent years have lower staffing levels than counties with more static population growth.  The planning section was one section that needed to grow but there was a staff embargo.  Will the board state that there are deficiencies in some local authorities in terms of staffing levels?</p></speech>

She mentioned the consumer protection aspect of the Priory Hall and Longford cases.  We are concerned about the lack of consumer protection under which people operated, and there is no excuse for that.  The regulations do not excuse such behaviour; the board is quite clear about that.  Unfortunately, when one undertakes the legal process, everything is stalled until the matter is resolved.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about a register of licensed builders.  We will introduce a register of contractors, which is another reform mechanism that I should have mentioned earlier.  We have brought forward regulations but the Minister has yet to sign them.  We have introduced a code of practice, which may be a growing document.  There will be a period of implementation for the regulations when they are introduced.  We have already started the process of examining how we can register contractors and are talking to the industry.</p></speech>

In order words, we will examine the contractors and their standards.  We have also done this with the professions through the Building Control Act.  It will be something like that.  It will be based on competencies, training and evidence that their skill sets are brought up to date.  To be fair to the industry, some work has been done.  HomeBond produced guidance documentation in the form of a "Right on the Site" folder and provides regular updates.  When the board introduced regulation HomeBond provided copies to its members.  Part of the industry disseminated information.  HomeBond did it to reduce the number of claims but it also provided a good service.  There are other issues that I will not go into now.  There will be a register of builders.</p><p>    The Deputy mentioned large population changes and how this has transformed Kildare.  That was the effect of Dublin's urbanisation and commuter traffic and of people settling in the region.  It was an inevitable part of urbanisation.</p> <p>Did it get enough priority?  I think the Deputy highlighted the issue.</p><p> Deputy Catherine Murphy raised questions on the local authority process of taking in charge.  It would not be good enough that local authorities that prioritise only the areas that they will be taking in charge and must pay for, such as the resurfacing of the road.  The issue is wider than that.  The taking in charge would be the responsibility of the local area engineer and the depots would take on the job of repairs.  They want to get it right at that point.  They follow a manual, the site work, and external works document produced by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

I do not accept priority should be given to the areas that will be taken into public control.  That is looking at the issue in cost terms.  Cost is a good driver in focusing people's attention, but the council is dealing with regulations so they should take a sample across the range.</p><p>  Deputy Murphy asked about the mix of inspections.  I think that may be part of the problem.  The council provided figures to the local government section of the Department to establish whether they met the 15% rate of inspection; however, when one looks into it further, what they inspected was never defined.  There was a lack of definition of inspections.  One would need to trawl through the various sections of the local authority to see what each did.  The fire officer may have looked at one element while the building control section might have considered the needs of people with disabilities, but they never followed a comprehensive list.  We are still without that basic data.  We are making an effort to try to get the data and separate it so that one knows the mix covered in the inspections.  I know it seems the Deputy has asked a simple question, but it is vitally important to know what was actually looked at.  Often inspections are recorded by either number or by date but not by what was inspected.</p></speech>

If I am correct, inspections were carried out on the estates that will ultimately end up as the responsibility of the local authority, but apartment blocks were not in that category.  One will see where I am coming from.  There would be a higher incidence of apartments not being inspected than houses.</p></speech>

It is not a sectoral rule.  We were encouraged by the planning section which was seeking higher densities to build apartments.  The planning section considered that one way of dealing with higher densities was to build apartment blocks.  Many issues should have been dealt with then.  Unfortunately, they were not.  The multi-unit developments legislation tried to deal with apartments when it became clear that builders were setting up their own companies to manage the building, rather than residents, companies.  That has now been changed.  It is a requirement that the management company be taken over by the residents and occupiers of the building.</p><p>  There should have been a red flag system.  As far as I am aware I do not think there was a red flag procedure.  We are required to conduct a market surveillance for Europe and we are setting up a red flag procedure.  When we become aware of a material that is known to be problematic, we red-flag it to local authorities.  We have done that on a number of different materials, such as plaster board, hollow steel sections and so on.</p></speech>

When one reads the documentation, there were often five to seven different opinions.  Let me give an example.  In one report it stated, "On the day I saw it, it was all finished and it seemed to be okay."  The person did not see anything and was not able to see what had been done.  That was one form of compliance.  That should have been a red flag in itself.  Should it have been a red flag to the legal profession?</p><p>  There were several levels of opinion on compliance.  Some stated that the person who designed it, supervised it, inspected it and listed the number of inspections would provide the most comprehensive system of inspections.  I believe many people did do that with the best of intentions.  I am not casting aspersions on them but some took a lighter approach.  When it operated in the way it operated how could one really enforce the regulations with that mechanism?  That is the reason we are bringing in enforcement regulations.</p><p>  The original reason I was invited to appear before the joint committee is that the chairman of the BRAB could not make it and I am taking his place.  The board's role was to advise the Minister on the issues that it considered should be regulated as well as processes such as the production line issues that the Department does.  There is also the updating of the regulations - Part A, Part B, Part C and so on.  There is a great deal of updating of Part L dealing with energy efficiencies.</p><p>  The opinions on compliance were not part of the building control Acts but were often perceived to be.  In many ways the consumer drew comfort from them as a protection.  One would want to look at the different forms to see which of them one would be happy with.  We are replacing that provision on new construction with the statutory certificates of compliance, which are quite detailed forms that must be signed off and a final certificate provided at the end.  There are staged signing offs with a final certification at the end.  That will have to be accompanied by supporting documentation with ancillary certificates.  All the manufacturers' warranties will be included.  </p><p>  The local authorities are not responsible for certifying compliance.  The person who does the work has to show that it is compliant with the regulations.  The manufacturers of a product have to show the product they are selling is compliant.  It is not the role of the local authority to be the arbiter.  If persons seek to have a definition of their product they can go the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, or the Irish Agr&eacute;ment Board, which is part of NSAI, to seek a certificate to state exactly what the product is suitable for.  We are reliant on the person putting the item up for sale to do that.  The standards procedures are in place and the manufacturer must establish that its products meet the standards.  The local authority or the Government does not become involved in that.</p></speech>

It subsequently emerged that the electrical wiring work on the estate was substandard and dangerous and gas fittings did not include isolation handles to enable people to switch off the gas supply in the event of a fire.  If a fire had broken out, it would have developed into a raging inferno, not only because the brickwork did not have fire insulation but also owing to other serious defects in the construction.  These dangerous defects were not highlighted in the certification process.</p><p>  The comment in the report that much could be done to improve the system from a regulatory perspective is the understatement of the century.  A vast amount of work must be done to improve the system.  May members raise questions about the new building regulations?</p></speech>

The self-certification system in operation is not statutory or mandatory.  This type of light-touch regulation is the reason we have problems at Priory Hall and on other similar estates.  What inspections will be carried out under the new building control regulations?  While I welcome the decision to make them mandatory, what will be the nature of the inspections?  Will a random sample of works be inspected?</p><p>  I do not believe the figure for inspection rates - 12% to 15% - is correct.  From my time in Dublin City Council, I believe the inspection rate was closer to 5%.  I will leave that issue to one side as it is in the past, although we must learn from past mistakes.  In Northern Ireland, where all sites are inspected, cases such as Priory Hall or those involving the many other problems we are experiencing do not arise.  Will we adopt a system similar to that in place in the North or will we retain the self-certification model?  If we choose the latter, is there a danger we will repeat the mistakes of the past if there is another boom in ten or 15 years?</p></speech>

While I do not dispute that was the case, one needs to go through the process and each person who completed the installation.  For example, an issue arises if a person installed the gas fittings and had Bord G&aacute;is supply gas.  The architect certified for design and construction and issued a certificate of compliance at the end of the work.  Issues also arise in this regard, but I do not want to comment on them as cases may arise in the future.  There is an issue to be answered.

It will make the choice.  The code of practice underpinning this documentation, which is akin to a checklist, will highlight what the local authority should do.  We are seeking an assigned certifier.  A person who operates as an assigned certifier must be competent, as listed in the Building Control and Multi-Unit Developments Acts, which refer to the competence of certain professionals.  The certifier may certify the work being carried out by the contractor which he or she is supervising.  Under the code of practice, the certifier will have a list of inspections, on which he or she should follow through.  If a problem arises or the certifier is refused permission to inspect an item, this must be flagged, which could result in the certifier having to resign from the position rather than certifying the work.  In such circumstances, the local authority is immediately alerted and a replacement certifier must be found.  Under the new system, certification will mean precisely that.</p><p>  The Deputy has indicated the new system still amounts to self-certification.  One must consider the principle we followed in developing the system, namely, that one must take responsibility for the area of work in which one is engaged.  This applies to the architect, engineer, surveyor, electrical contractor, gas installer, timber frame installer and all other suppliers of services, all of whom must take responsibility for the services they provide.  Self-certification requires people to put their name on the line.  It will not involve words being used in a way that can be misinterpreted.  It is not the case that it offers some level of comfort.</p></speech>

For example, where a person is on site and sees something, perhaps in someone else's work or a pre-assembled item, he or she will need to have documentation to back it up.  A series of documents will be required.  One does not want people to provide a bundle of material.  Instead, we want to have a clear certificate indicating who signed off on the work, his or her competence, the work in which he or she was involved and the areas he or she supervised and for which he or she takes responsibility.  The assigned certifier and builder take responsibility at the completion stage when they both sign a common certificate.  There is, therefore, no excuse in terms of who is responsible.</p><p>  Who was responsible for the poor electrical installation at Priory Hall?</p> <p>We know there were people who then said it was okay.  They were irresponsible but we then try to find out who was responsible for it.  There must be a level of responsibility in any procedure, and this is where we are requiring it.  In referring to self-certification Deputy Kenny seems to imply that is an easier form, but it is not; it will be meticulous.  The code of practice in that will spell that out.  A checklist of the inspection regimes required will be prepared in advance of construction starting.  Some of them will be periodic and others will be at milestone stages - that is, at certain stages of construction.</p></speech>

I am sorry I missed the earlier part of it but I was following the debate elsewhere.</p><p>  Mr. O'Connor spoke about regulation, compliance and certification.  He said the objective was to strengthen the system, but how does he equate that with the exclusion of architectural technicians from the list of professional people who are entitled to certify?  Is that a weakness in the Act?  Building regulation compliance is not about aesthetics; that is only part of it.  It is about the technical aspects in terms of the quality and quantity of what goes into the building.  Is it a weakness in the Act that these people have been left off the list of professionals who are entitled to certify, and does he believe that should be put right?</p><p>  Mr. O'Connor said that the people who take responsibility for certification are signing away their careers.  Is it not a correct assumption to make that the careers of architectural technicians have been signed away with this legislation?  I would like to hear Mr. O'Connor's opinion on that.  It is about the quality and the calibre of the people who carry out the inspections.</p></speech>

A limited number of professions are registered under the Building Control Act.  Engineers are regulated under an engineering Act of 1969; therefore, they were registered beforehand.  In terms of the registration of professionals, some of that followed from European directives.  There was scope to register within the Building Control Act.  I might add that that was before my time.  They have been registered.  A great deal of work went into that over a long period.</p><p>  A number of options were offered to people not on the register.  They could apply to be on the register of architects, building surveyors or engineers.  They could apply to those institutes for membership, and quite a number of people have taken up that offer.  Initially, their position was to question the reason they could not be recognised.  Some were without training but became very technically proficient through experience.  This is not a reflection on their proficiency; it is about having an identifiable form of competency.  The issue is competency.</p><p>  The architectural technicians and architectural technologists are not being excluded.  They have options to make their application to one of those recognised bodies, and there are many routes they can take.  They can go to an independent body such as UCD, which operates a professional course for registration, or register with the architect's, building control or engineer's institutes.  Some of them have done that, and some of the people who met us-----</p></speech>

"Charter" does not necessarily equate with a chartered engineer in Engineers Ireland.  We are getting into a complex area of comparable degrees.  I am not underestimating their contribution.  I have the highest regard for people who come through the architectural technician courses in the various institutes of technology.  They come out with outstanding results.  It is a degree status.  It is not at the same level as a chartered engineer, a registered architect or a registered building surveyor.  Those who have brought it to that level and who have undertaken those examinations have joined those various bodies and are now practising.</p><p>  The people the Deputy mentioned who are on the BRAB have dual membership within one of the professional bodies as well as their relationship with the CIAT.  We met with representatives of the CIAT and went into a good deal of detail.  I thought we explained the position but they took umbrage when the matter was referred to the Minister to be signed.  What did they think was the process?  It was going to lead to that.  We have met with those people.  People in those positions can apply to the recognised bodies to become an applicant in one of those bodies.  Some opt for the architectural body and others opt for the building surveyor body, while some opt for the engineering one.  Engineers usually opt for the engineering body, and it is chartered engineers in that case.  The chartered engineer is at a very reputable and responsible level.  It is a matter of trying to establish levels of responsibility.  We use the levels of responsibility recognised and allowed under the various Acts.</p><p>  For clarity purposes, the multi-unit developments, MUDs, legislation brought before the Houses by the Minister for Justice and Equality examined what can define people who should be suitable for signing off on the various aspects of the MUDs Act and came down in favour of the Building Control Act and the supporting engineers Act, which is a separate one but is often in parallel.  It defined that as well, and we define it in these regulations.  It is not to prevent the fine work being done.  I stated that there were ancillary certificates and if we take the role of an architectural technologist, for example, in facade design or something in a contemporary building, they might be terrific at that.  They will be signing off on that because someone else who does not have that level of knowledge will not be able to sign off on it.  They will require a sign off in terms of a subsidiary or ancillary certificate.</p></speech>

It is rather strange that these people who are highly qualified are not allowed to work in Cavan but can work in Derry or Tyrone in the North of Ireland, in other words, they can work in Britain and in Europe.  They have highly recognised degrees yet that is not recognised here, and the witnesses are removing them from the list.  That adds further to the theory that in dealing with the architects Mr. O'Connor's organisation is more into structure and aesthetics while the chartered technicians are more into quantity, quality and what goes into the building, which would seem to indicate that the witnesses are all show and no substance.</p></speech>

One only has to look at their core curriculum to see that.  I cannot accept the assertion the Deputy is making.  We have not divided them off.  As the Building Control Act had a recognition of registers they are now seeking to get their grouping registered, but that is a separate process.</p> <p>There is an existing register and we are using that.  If they wish to suggest other measures as to how they should be recognised or to seek equal recognition with other professions, there is a way to do so, but that is a registration issue, not a building control issue.  We are going with the building control tools we have.  It is not fair to state that we are dismissing them.  We have worked with them and view them as having an important role to play, albeit a subsidiary role.  We want to have someone who will oversee all of that and state that this is how the certification system works.</p></speech>

I anticipate they will find particular work in this respect.  This is much more demanding, in that one must now have drawings that show building control compliance when one starts a job and not as one works through the job.  One will be obliged to submit building-control-compliant drawings at one's commencement notice.  This will mean much more work upfront.  From a technological point of view, there will be much more work, as everything must be defined.  It will not simply be a wall of whatever kind.  Everything will be specified in detail - the form of construction, the form of insulation, the form of firestop, etc.  Detail will be required.</p></speech>

However, I wish to flag a problem I have in this regard to the board, which may be aware of it, namely, the lack of accountability at local authority level.  Perhaps all that will change with today's announcement.  I refer to my experiences in respect of individual jobs involving people who have approached me.  Such people received housing grants but a complete mess was made of the work even though the council was meant to oversee it.  In one case, it did by looking in the window, turning around and walking away again.  Ultimately, the person who received the grant could not use a wheelchair in the house and while that person has tried to get another grant, it still is all up in a heap.  On a slightly larger scale - that is, as large as it gets where I come from in west County Roscommon - a couple of years after an estate of approximately 40 houses was built, it became obvious there was a problem.  In one case, there was a crack that was approximately six inches wide at the top of the building and another that was approximately one inch wide at the bottom, which had been filled in with Polyfilla to cover them up.  I approached the council to inquire whether it had been keeping an eye on what was going on.  The response I received was yes, someone had been sent out to have a look at it.  To this day, I have not actually managed to talk to the person in question and do not know whether he or she ever existed.  While I was told that someone went out to the site, the council could never arrange for me to talk to that person.  This has happened numerous times because people approach elected representatives about it and I am sure every member present has been approached.  Mr. O'Connor has stated the new regime will not be self-certification or anything like that but ultimately, when something is done wrongly, who will enforce it?  At present, local authorities will not even act as enforcers in respect of money they are spending themselves.</p></speech>

Such enforcement takes place on the basis of a number of inspections and identification of the issues.  There will now be records kept of inspections.  There will be a requirement for a local authority to make sure the system is robust.  This is the common protocol and measures of which I spoke will fall to us to set out in conjunction with the city and county managers' organisation.  The identification of the type of inspection should also be recorded.  Consequently, it will not be enough to state that one looked through the window, as that does not constitute an inspection and should not be allowed to be so.  It should be the case that one went out and saw the crack on the gable, which is in fact six inches wide at the top, that it now has been identified and that the contractor must now rectify that mistake to avoid appearing in court with an enforcement order.  This is what must happen now.  It must be consequential and cannot be comfortable, cushy or cosy.  It must be quite professional, detached and exact, and local authorities must record what they are doing.</p><p>  The submission system and abuse clustering I have described will require the use of technology.  We are moving to a stage at which hand-held devices can now be used.  Our own inspectors who were involved with the unfinished estates were able to get the GPS locations of the sites and so on.  Consequently, one can locate the site one is talking about precisely on the map and one can then enter information at the location at which one is conducting the inspection.  All such new technology facilitates a better understanding of what someone does.  Basically, when one considers what are the problems and how to manage them  - this is a management issue for local authorities - it is clear that managers for building control should be defining what jobs they intend to inspect.  They should be examining all jobs in some form and should then focus on some which may be problematic or the scale of which might be sufficiently large to warrant regular full inspections.  Moreover, they must do this with the resources they have unless managers reassign resources.  The question of what resources are available is a management decision on the part of city and county managers.  A few pilots are being examined whereby a local authority could consider its resources in their entirety.  It could identify the availability of taking in charge staff, as was mentioned earlier by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  If one pools one's resources and one has a single major job that must be vetted thoroughly, one should be able to pull in resources from adjoining counties.  One certainly will have protocols already set out as to what happens when something gets red-flagged.  Such a red-flagging system is absolutely required.</p></speech>

In respect of the BRAB's role as an advisory body, I note there is a representative of HomeBond on the board.  The joint committee had no success in getting representatives of HomeBond to appear before it.  It refused to discuss the impact of its decisions on those affected by pyrite.  I wonder at the wisdom of having people on the board who may be in a position to influence its decisions in respect of the advice it gives.</p> <p>Would we not be better moving to an independent board which could have regulatory teeth?</p><p> With regard to the 1990 Act, the burden of responsibility for compliance rests with the developers, the designers and the owners but the building control officers in the local authorities are not compelled to check it out.  Even if they were, would they have the competences to identify whether there is an actual problem with a building?  Would Mr. O&rsquo;Connor see that as the crux of the problem?  In Edenderry there is a pyrite problem in an estate.  If there had been a building control officer with the relevant competences checking at every stage, would it have prevented the problem?</p><p> Does Mr. O&rsquo;Connor believe the level of the fines that can be imposed is sufficient?  It seems to me that a fine of &euro;5,000 to &euro;50,000 is very small for a matter as serious as this.  A home is the largest investment one will make in one&rsquo;s life.  To think some people are watching their homes collapsing around them due to deficient building materials is appalling.  There is a consumer protection issue in this and I see the BRAB as fulfilling such a role.  Does the board come up with changes to the building regulations?  Which other bodies make suggestions in this regard?</p></speech>

When they become members, the theory is they leave their hats behind them and advise on that basis.  Of course, there will always be a certain amount of interest but we try and ensure they park them.</p><p>  HomeBond has been an active participant on that board for many years.  It brought in its own insurance scheme, information on sites and a manual for home builders.  It did much good work in bringing forward the technical skills within the construction industry.  It was the main dominant agent in the sector over the past 15 years.  Another insurance company, Premier, came in but just acted as an insurance company.</p><p>  HomeBond would have put forward a technical person, not a member of its board.  The withdrawal of the HomeBond guarantee regarding pyrite-affected homes was decided by the HomeBond board because of its concern for the insurance on the ten-year guarantee that it had offered.  One could ask why it was not resourced enough to carry the risk.  It was not because it was a guarantee scheme, not an insurance scheme.  It has since switched to being an insurance scheme which, I accept, is of little help to those people it has denied access to by standing back from declaring it does not take responsibility in pyrite cases.  I am sure there are various opinions on that but I do not accept HomeBond should be allowed to stand back.  I have said so directly.</p><p>  Having technical people on the board, as we see it, is beneficial.  Sometimes, they may speak on behalf of their own organisation but this makes it a lively and valuable board.  We, as departmental officials, attend it as we offer the facility of administering it.  It should be remembered the board is doing this work voluntarily and the only person who is paid is the chairperson, who gets a small allowance.  HomeBond made the decision to exclude the pyrite cases but its representative was already on the BRAB for five years.</p></speech>

Many Members have highlighted many issues here during the past 12 months.  How can Mr. O'Connor say that there are some technical people on the board representing HomeBond when these people have no credibility left whatsoever in respect of this committee or among many of the public throughout the country who have had adverse experiences?  I have had experiences and I represent the constituency of Sligo-North Leitrim.  There is a scheme of houses in Strandhill and the people there have been affected.  I imagine there are similar cases in every constituency and in many towns and villages throughout the country.  These people are swanning about and are showing contempt not only to this Oireachtas committee but also to many other people in various parts of the country.  They have not been prepared to engage with people and will not engage with the local authorities in respect of issues that have been highlighted in recent years.  Will Mr. O'Connor comment in this regard?  How can he claim that these people have a representative as a technical person?  I believe these people have no credibility left to represent or to be involved in anything.  As a result of this meeting we should demand that these people are asked to a meeting here as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

That board has now ceased.  We should be clear on that.  He does not occupy that board position anymore.  I am suggesting that when he occupied it, he made a significant contribution, as did the person before him, to the workings of the board at a technical level.  I am referring to two separate entities.  There is no explanation or excuse for what the board did by withdrawing the guarantee.  It was disgraceful.  That does not mean that a person who worked for the board was behaving in that manner and he did not behave in that manner, but he was curtailed by its decision.  That board has now ceased.

Let us suppose one goes to a hospital for an operation.  If there is a mistake then there is recourse legally on the practitioners.</p></speech>
