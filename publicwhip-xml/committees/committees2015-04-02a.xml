There is no other matter on the agenda from previous meetings, but we will deal with that at our next meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015040200002#A00400"><p>There are two issues we should consider.  One of them arises from our previous meeting where considerable concern was expressed by a number of people, including the Chairman, about No. 16 Hanover Quay and the manner in which the sale was conducted.</p><p>Further concern was expressed both by the Chairman and Deputy Deasy about the manner in which the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>matter was handled.  Perhaps the committee could consider doing something in the same manner as it did with the Howth issue and visit to see for itself the strategic development of the old docklands area.  We should see for ourselves, in particular.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015040200002#A00500"><p>Yes, we can agree on that.</p><p>I will ask the clerk to the committee to set up a date in order that we can visit both the general area and the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015040200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman.  I have been appalled by the accounts of the Ian Bailey case, which went on for 64 days.  On day 62 of the hearing, it was brought to the attention of the court that for the most part the material came under the Statute of Limitations and was not relevant to the case.  This was a waste of jury time and the bill for the State's legal representatives will be approximately &euro;5 million.  It would seem the normal practice is that matters in relation to the Statute of Limitations are dealt with before the trail starts or at the very beginning of the trial.  The Courts Service and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor have to answer why so much time and taxpayer's money was spent on this case.  I believe there are a number of similar questions on other cases as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015040200002#B00300"><p>At one stage we asked the Garda Commissioner about the cost of the investigation into the Bailey case.  There was an issue in respect of that case and others and we agreed to invite the Office of the Chief State Solicitor to come before the committee to deal with some aspects of the administration of that office.  If members are agreeable, we can include that item when the Office of the Chief State Solicitor comes before us.  I will ask the clerk to investigate if the Courts Service could come in on the same day and we could deal with the general issues that have been raised.</p></speech>

Many more appeals cases are being heard because of the new court and for that reason it is worth examining.</p></speech>

I do not want the issue that Deputy Costello has raised to drift.  We should set a date as soon as possible, on a Tuesday or Wednesday, to visit the <i>Jeanie Johnston</i>and that general area.  We should look at the work agenda to see how we can speed up the process of the hearings in order that this can be included at an early date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

I will deal with what we achieved in two areas, Irish development aid and the trade opportunity that Vietnam presents.</p> <p>  The people would be proud of the work of the ambassador, H.E. Mr. Damien Cole, and his staff.  It is important we publicise the work they do and what they have achieved.  Irish aid has been spent in areas that provides relief not only in the medium term but also in the long term.  We visited schools and health care facilities and saw the road infrastructure that was built by Irish taxpayers' money.  This is playing a significant role in humanitarian terms.</p> <p>  From the perspective of opportunities in trade, and Deputy Deasy will speak in more detail on this, when we think of south-east Asia, we think of China, which is a major market, but Vietnam has a population of 91 million in a region of 600 million people and it has a growing middle class.  The growing economy represents great opportunities, particularly from a food perspective.  What came across to us is the need for more State agency personnel on the ground to promote trade, especially in agricultural products.  The market is very competitive but there is significant potential for trade.  If one thing is to come from our report, it is the need for the relevant bodies in Ireland to work with the bodies in Vietnam to ensure they are properly staffed and resourced in what is a very tough global market economy.  With the proper investment in manpower on the ground, we would have a much better opportunity of trading into these countries.</p> <p>  I thank the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all those who participated on the trip.  We had a very full programme over a number of days.  From the taxpayer's perspective, we can be proud of the way Irish aid is being spent.  As with all aid programmes, it must be kept under constant review as the country is beginning to thrive, but there is massive social poverty and deprivation.</p> <p>  There are opportunities to trade and we should concentrate on dairy products.  We should ensure we reap the rewards of the product we sell to them.  During our visit we met the Vietnamese Minister for planning and investment and Deputy Deasy raised with him that Ireland is open for business and that we would like to do business with them.  It was a very worthwhile trip and taxpayers can be reassured that money is spent prudently. The aid programme must be kept under constant review and there are significant opportunities for us there.</p> <p>  I apologise that I must leave the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015040200002#B01600"><p>I will develop the trade element.  The three of us have an interest in agriculture, particularly the export of dairy products.  The current value of Irish dairy exports is &euro;1.6 billion, but the market for liquid milk and milk ingredient products in Vietnam is worth $6 billion.  That market has not been tapped into by Ireland in any great shape or form.  It became an inescapable fact that much work needs to be done in this area.  A lot has happened since we returned home.  The draft report has been compiled and will issue to members in due course.  We came to the conclusion that we need more personnel from Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland on the ground in Vietnam.  With the ending of milk quotas and the free trade agreement being hammered out between the European Commission and the Vietnamese, this is timely.  We have had conversations with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine since our return.  He has spoken to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and agreement has been reached to fund additional personnel in emerging markets.  The Minister has agreed in principle to use some of that money to fund an individual from Bord Bia in Vietnam to promote the food and dairy industries specifically.</p><p>From that standpoint, the work we did with the embassy will bear some fruit.  It became inescapable after being there just for a few days the kind of market that has begun to open in Vietnam, with a lower middle class income range emerging there.  It is important we spread our risk effectively when it comes to the dairy industry outside China.  The free trade agreement that will be hammered out between the European Commission and Vietnam does not just affect Vietnam but also acts as a gateway to the Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, countries, with a population of approximately 630 million people.  The Kerry Group has been working in Vietnam and will make an announcement when it comes to a very tiny slice of the milk industry there.  It has a collaboration with an indigenous company and that is really the first kind of enterprise that has taken hold in Vietnam with an Irish-owned company.</p><p> Bord Bia's presence is in Shanghai in China and the comment or criticism from people we met in business circles dealing with food is that all our bets seem to be placed in China.  As a result of what is happening in south-east Asia, the idea is that we need to create a presence outside China.  In many respects, Vietnam is the engine in south-east Asia and those people believe strongly that the presence should be in Vietnam.  There is also an issue with regard to where the embassy is located.  The commercial hub of Vietnam is Saigon or Ho Chi Minh City and not Hanoi.  That is also significant.</p><p> There is some precedent in the agricultural sector.  The pork market was opened and exports began in 2014.  Work has been done within the Department in that regard.  When it comes to the initial step, the timing is right for that funding of an individual or individuals in Vietnam.  As we learned, the most significant groundwork for contacts within official and government circles has been done over the past ten years.  It has taken that long for our officials in the embassy to create a very substantial and solid contact network within government circles.  The timing is right for these kinds of initiatives because of contacts made over the past ten years.</p><p> I will not be mealy-mouthed about the fact that we have helped programmes through Irish Aid over the past ten years and, as a result, this has allowed us access to government circles.  That has proved very productive with respect to government officials and politicians understanding Ireland a little better.  We should capitalise on that, and there is a need for us to use those contacts in an area like food and dairy.  That is the conclusion everyone reached, including us, the embassy and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  Since our return, that issue has been solidified, and I believe it will result in additional personnel from Bord Bia being funded to go to Vietnam.  For that reason, it was a positive trip.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015040200002#C00200"><p>Deputy Deasy has certainly described the trip very well.  I visited Vietnam as Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development in 2013.  It is the only country outside Africa that is a partner country for Irish Aid.  After the Vietnam war - or the war with America, as it is called there - Ireland was very quick to provide assistance and a presence on the ground to help in dealing with a de-mining programme and decommissioning weapons.  Mines still regularly kill many people in Vietnam.  We also deal with minorities.  Another benefit of the Irish Aid activity is that approximately 24 Vietnamese people come each year to Ireland to study in the Smurfit business school and do a masters in business administration.  Others come within other categories, and there is a very strong business link with what Irish Aid has done in lifting the country and providing some of the brightest in Vietnam with good quality business education in Ireland.</p> <p>  To some extent, this goes back to the first Irish semi-State body that invested in Vietnam, which was ESB International.  That was under the leadership of Mr. Paddy Moriarty, brother of broadcaster M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh, but unfortunately Paddy is now deceased.  He was the first to bring Vietnamese students to Ireland and he even brought them to his own home in Kerry.  One of those bright students he brought to Ireland is now the Deputy Prime Minister of Vietnam.  He regards himself as the Irish man in the cabinet.  We have a very strong link with Vietnam at the highest level at which we can do business.  ESB International, as an Irish company, is still very much involved with Vietnam.</p> <p>  We have much to go on and our relationship is very strong.  Irish Aid has been strong for a while and last year we finalised an adoption agreement with Vietnam as well.  Its Minister for justice came here and our Minister went over there.  That agreement has worked out satisfactorily.  As Deputy Deasy stated, with the lifting of the milk quota there is an obvious area for Irish business to engage.  There has always been engagement with New Zealand or Holland and not this corner of the world because quotas have been in operation for 30 years.  I fully agree with Bord Bia and the Kerry Group being involved in that respect.</p> <p>  There should be a full-scale trade mission going from Ireland to Vietnam.  Deputy Deasy's comments are correct and there seems to be a perception of putting so many eggs in the China basket, which has taken much attention and time, along with numerous ministerial visits and trade missions.  That is desirable but there are 93 million people in Vietnam, which is growing at a fast rate in Asia, and that presents many opportunities.  There is an incredibly good relationship between the countries, so the opportunities exist.  We should certainly expand on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/965" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015040200002#C00300"><p>I welcome the report.  I will ask the clerk to change the foreword to reflect the fact that Deputy Deasy and others contributed in the way they did.  I ask that we do some form of press presentation.  We can send out a press release and flag the success of the delegation and what has transpired since it returned.  In light of the fact we give &euro;12.25 million in aid, it is important for us to have the right structures to monitor that spend.  As has been proven in Vietnam, the structures are there and are being used by other countries which are delivering aid in Vietnam.  From a trade perspective, I cannot agree more with Deputies Deasy and Costello in that having a presence in the country is very important.  It can take many years for a business to build a relationship with a partner in parts of Asia and that requires a lot of investment.  The Government should invest, first and foremost, and put its foot forward because having a presence in Vietnam is essential.  This is especially relevant when we consider the Chinese economy, which has many advance factories built in Vietnam.</p><p>The Chinese are looking at that market and their presence there.  All that is based on the cost of labour.  It is important, therefore, for us to be in the middle of that economic activity.  Having people on the ground means they might look at the markets other European countries are exploiting such as Taiwan.  We have raised this previously with various Departments that have appeared before us.</p><p> I am delighted the Deputy managed to visit some schools and industry and that he met some project leaders on the ground, which was very important.  As was the case in other visits, time was taken to look at the disability and research sectors.  I support Deputy Costello's view on trade missions.  It is important we have a full trade mission to Vietnam.  I thank Deputy Deasy and the other members of the delegation for their work there and their work since they returned.  We should continue to highlight the aid programme and the strong possibilities for trade as we do our work.</p><p> I recommend we accept the report and publish it with the various corrections that are needed in terms of other inputs.  We should then draft a press release and send it.</p></speech>

That will be part of the report we compile.  It is important because this involves a great deal of money.  That should be included as well.</p></speech>

We are concentrating on trade and that is fine, but the essential part of this for the past ten years has been the money we put into Irish Aid and the systems within the Vietnamese Government's structures of accounting for that.

This morning we will be focusing on issues related to the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period prior to 2008 in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  In our first session we will hear from a representative of Jones Lang LaSalle, Mr. John Moran.  Jones Lang LaSalle is an international professional services and investment management firm which offers specialised real estate services, with annual fee revenue of $4.7 billion and gross revenue of $5.4 billion.  It has more than 230 corporate offices and operates in 80 countries.  It has a global workforce of approximately 58,000.  It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  Jones Lang LaSalle Ireland was established in 1964 and provides a full service offering across all aspects of Irish real estate.  The company employs 80 people and provides services for occupiers, tenants, developers, landlords, owners, banks and institutions.  Services offered include valuation, sales, letting, acquisition, rent reviews, rating, consultancy advice, research and property management.  Mr. Moran is an international director of Jones Lang LaSalle and managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle Ireland.  He is a qualified chartered valuation surveyor and has been in practice for 29 years.  He joined Jones Lang LaSalle in 1986 and has had various roles within the company.  He was appointed managing director in January 2009 and is still the lead director for the investment department.  His day-to-day role, alongside running the business, is advising on the acquisition and disposal of investment properties on behalf of pension funds, life assurance companies, financial institutions, receivers, private investors, property companies and high net worth individuals.  He is very welcome.</p><p>Before we begin, I advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking them to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Moran to make his opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.38" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015040200002#B00100"><p>I have provided the committee with a detailed opening statement which I will run through again this morning.  I was asked to comment on issues relating to the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period up to 2008 in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  I will deal with the size and nature of the real estate market in Ireland and I will give a brief overview of Jones Lang LaSalle and the nature of the services that we provide.  I will give broad details of our client base, the sources and extent of funding to the commercial real estate market, the composition of investors in that market, its interrelationship with international markets and investors, and the understanding of risk at the time.<br/><br/>My comments relate to the commercial property market though I will occasionally reference the residential market, particularly as it affected land levies.  The Irish retail real estate market is made up of various components.  There is the residential market, the development land and agricultural market, the investment market and the various occupier markets such as offices, retail, industrial, hotels and licensed and leisure premises.  <br/><br/>Up to 2008 the commercial real estate market was growing strongly.  There were increased levels of purchasing, leasing and construction activity.  Ireland's economy was performing well with GDP and employment driving the expansion.  It is worth remembering that, at that time, we were the fastest growing economy in western Europe, the second wealthiest economy on a <i>per capita</i>basis measured by GDP and we had the fastest growing population in Europe.  During that period unemployment averaged just over 4%, which was effectively full employment.  That is important because the real strength in occupier and investor demand is what was supporting the property market.  That demand was driving activity levels and increases in values and the capital values of Irish commercial investment property increased by 72% in the five-year period up to 30 September 2007, the date we define as the peak of the market in terms of value appreciation.  Property yields were at record levels, which was a reflection of both the strong investor demand and the availability of significant amounts of debt.  The graph on page 1 of my submission shows the 72% appreciation in capital value from Q1 2002 to Q3 2007.<br/><br/>This all translated itself into particularly strong transactional activity.  Between 2004 and 2008, &euro;8 billion worth of commercial investment property was sold in Ireland.  The peak year for investment volumes was 2006, with &euro;3.6 billion traded in 12 months.  For context, this compares to the previous record of &euro;1.2 billion in 2005 and an average of &euro;768 million per annum between 2001 and 2004, and they were record levels in comparison with what had happened in the 30 or 40 years preceding that.  In addition to domestic spending, there was also considerable Irish investment activity overseas, particularly in the UK and continental Europe.  The graph shows the spending patterns of Irish investment in Ireland over the six-year period.  All sectors of the market were active, with demand outstripping supply.  Demand was not solely focused on prime assets, with secondary and tertiary assets also trading.  There was evidence of demand across all size categories and activity was taking place in all locations across the country.<br/><br/>The investment market was characterised by large amounts of money seeking product.  Demand was exceptionally strong, with the vast majority of transactions involving domestic purchasers.  Values really intensified in 2005 and 2006 and so did attitudes towards investment, with investors seeking to move more aggressively up the risk curve and undertake either development in their own right or in conjunction with developers as joint ventures in search of better returns.<br/><br/>Alongside a very strong investment market there were also exceptionally strong occupier markets.  The letting market for offices averaged 2.3 million sq. ft. per annum between 2004 and 2008, totalling 11.6 million sq. ft. over the five years.  This is significantly higher than the 8.8 million sq. ft. in the last five years 2010 to 2014.  The record years for office take-up in Dublin remain 2006 and 2007.  Demand was focused on core, city centre locations, accounting for approximately 60% of take-up per annum.  Traditional banking, financial and professional service companies were driving demand during this period, with a new wave of the technology sector just starting to take off.  Page 3 shows graphically how office take-up compares from 2002 to 2014 and members will see that the peaks were 2005, 2006 and 2007.  In response to that demand there was a response from developers in supplying office construction, with 8.8 million sq. ft. constructed between 2004 and 2008.  This represented a 33% increase on the total stock levels at the end of 2003.<br/><br/>The retail market was also performing strongly, with improvements in the economy boosting consumer sentiment and spending.  A number of international chains and domestic retailers were entering the market and trading well.  As demand continued, vacancy in core schemes and high streets was tightening, with limited choice for occupiers.  The market responded to this with a surge in retail development.  Between 2004 and 2008, total shopping stock in Ireland increased from 13.7 million sq. ft. to 22.4 million sq. ft., an increase of almost 9 million sq. ft. and a lot of this was in provincial locations.  By the end of 2008 Ireland had the second highest shopping stock <i>per capita</i>in Europe.<br/><br/>Other sectors performed relatively steadily in comparison to retail and offices.  Industrial activity was relatively subdued until 2006, when again there was record occupier take-up of 2.9 million sq. ft.  Industrial land values saw significant growth due to a scarcity of supply in areas where people wanted to locate, generally in the south west of the city and in north west Dublin.  Occupiers were predominantly general distribution companies which, as is often the case in the Irish distribution and industrial market, are generally purchasers rather than renters.<br/><br/>The values of commercial property adjusted to this strong demand with significant increases over a short period of time.  Rents experienced similar growth, with prime office rents increasing from &euro;40 to &euro;60 per sq. ft. and retail rents such as on Grafton Street increasing by more than 100%.  Industrial premises also saw rental growth but not at the same pace.  The highest rent levels ever achieved in the market remain 2006 and 2007, which is graphically illustrated on page 5.<br/><br/>In response to very strong occupier markets and investment markets, development land also saw an enormous increase in activity.  The land market always responds to occupier markets and as activity and pricing grew significantly across all sectors this was also mirrored in development land.  Between 2004 and 2006, the number of deals in Ireland increased significantly, reaching over 250 transactions in 2006.  The market was characterised by strong demand from developers and investors, who were chasing product and competitively bidding on all assets that came onto the market.  In 2006, the highest sale price for a development site was achieved, which was &euro;155 million per acre.  This compares to the current top values of approximately between &euro;35 million and &euro;37 million per acre.  There was a push for higher densities by the planning authorities but, in the absence of clear guidelines, many developers factored very ambitious densities into their land pricing.  The underlying strength of the residential market and residential values also contributed enormously to the high levels of land value that pertained.<br/><br/>I was asked to comment on what JLL do in this market so I will run through the details very quickly.  The Chairman has already given members the global overview of the company.  In Dublin we have a full service offering, with expertise across all sectors and processes involved in buying, selling and managing real estate.  This involves investment sales and acquisitions, leasing activity for both landlord and tenant, property and asset management, planning and building services, valuation advisory services, land and research.<br/><br/>Our main area of focus is commercial property across all sectors, namely, office, retail, industrial, land and hotels.  We have undertaken some residential work for clients, but this is not a core specialism.  Our client base varies significantly, but historically our largest client profile is institutional, such as pension funds, life assurance companies and banks.  We have also acted for developers and occupiers and provide a broad service to everybody in the real estate industry.  </p>  <p>           From our perspective the advice we give to clients is strategic and consultancy-based.  Given that we act for both landlords and tenants and vendors and purchasers, our aims and objectives vary, depending on the instructions, but in any deal we do or any piece of work we perform our duty of care is to the client.  As we act for buyers, sellers, occupiers and landlords, we have no vested interest in the performance of the market.  We prefer to see a steady performing rising market at the rate of inflation rather than the dramatic booms and busts recently experienced.  </p> <p> Our firm's staff have the necessary academic and professional qualifications to work in the property sector.  Most of our staff are members of all relevant professional bodies, including the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland.  Various other professional organisations are represented within the office.  Being a member of a professional body means that one must adhere to a strict standard and ethic on a daily basis.  It is noteworthy that yesterday, for the eighth consecutive year, Jones Lang LaSalle was announced as being one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute.</p> <p> I will deal next with the sources and extent of funding in the commercial real estate market in Ireland.  It should be noted that we are not directly involved in the funding element of commercial real estate transactions.  Our expertise is in real estate and the details of funding acquisitions and developments are left for discussions between our clients and funding institutions directly.  While we might introduce parties and provide some background information, specific details of terms and agreements did not involve Jones Lang LaSalle and were not shared with us.  Our view of funding conditions relates to what our clients told us and what was common knowledge in Ireland at the time.  </p> <p> Between 2004 and 2008 the largest sources of funding for the commercial real estate market were domestic banks, the UK representatives which had offices here and a couple of European banks.  I do not think I need to name them as everybody knows who they are.  Each bank had a differing exposure and concentration across all sectors.  We were sure at the time that there was a lot of funding available in the marketplace.  We were not involved in final loan-to-value calculations between our clients and the banks, but we are aware that loans were available at high value ratios.  Funding was also available for almost every type of property transaction, whether for a pure investment purchase or a speculative development.  Initially, a significant proportion of the lending was non-recourse, that is, the asset was the only security that the bank held.  With the benefit of hindsight, the practice of borrowers giving personal guarantees to secure debt became increasingly common in 2006 and 2007 and led to significant cross-collateralisation of debt.  Any further detail of funding and lending during this time would be more accurate coming directly from the banks, lenders and borrowers.  Aside from the banks, the market was also awash with a lot of equity, which leads me on to my penultimate comments on the composition of investors in the Irish commercial real estate market.</p> <p> The major players in Ireland were domestic and accounted for approximately 90% of all investment volumes between 2005 and 2007.  They were a mix of private syndicates, private high net worth individuals, institutions and developers.  The largest proportion of transactions were undertaken by private Irish individuals or syndicates.  These purchasers were backed by funding from banks, with very limited, if any, pure cash purchases.  There were also a number of purchasers who were backed by equity.  The broad investor profile comes from four sets of investor: private syndicates that used pooled equity and debt; private high net worth individuals who used a mix of equity and debt; and institutions such as pension funds and life assurance companies which purchased with 100% equity.  The developers were the final cohort and used equity and significant amounts of debt.  Over time it became less certain how much actual cash was employed as opposed to equity release lending.  Overseas investors had a limited presence in Ireland during this time, as pricing had intensified significantly and Irish real estate was regarded as too expensive for international investors.  Up until the current cycle, the Irish market had traditionally been domestic in nature, with a very limited international input, other than occupiers.  It was regarded as an expensive market in the period to 2008 and, as a consequence, there was limited overseas investment in Ireland during this time.  I have graphically demonstrated on page 8 of my submission how yields tightened between 2003 and 2006.  They compressed from 6% to 3.7% for offices.  At these levels, international investors were priced out of the market, with more competitive yields available in other European countries.</p> <p> A noteworthy feature of the time was that Irish purchasers were not just focused on domestic assets.  Significant levels of Irish money were spent across Europe and the world.  In particular, it was reported in 2006 that Irish investors had invested approximately &euro;3.5 billion in the United Kingdom and a further &euro;2 billion in the rest of Europe and the USA.</p> <p> As a real estate advisory firm, it is our job to advise clients on real estate issues.  It is, therefore, imperative that we understand levels and impact of risk.  Prior to the banking crisis, we were advising our clients on the nature and impacts of the property market and how it was performing.  Any advice was informed and reinforced with key primary research data.  We collect and monitor research for each property sector, with some of our data sets dating back to the early 1970s.  We believe our advice was strategic, using our expert opinion to assess, for example, saleability and letting ability at the time.  We would provide details for clients on end-use values based on current market levels, providing strategic advice on sentiment and general market performance.  Any valuation we provided for clients was carried out in accordance with the RICS Red Book Guidance Notes and based on evidence of historical market values.  It is very important to understand valuation reports are not forward-looking documents; they are a snapshot in time based on current market evidence.  It is not within our scope or remit as real estate advisers to put any application to these numbers, particularly in order to generate future projections, unless we are asked to do so.  Our clients take our advice and it is their responsibility to apply our recommendations to their models to generate cash flows, repayment models and profit and loss projections for themselves.  From this, they can formulate their own inputs and assumptions, but that is not a process in which we are involved.  The responsibility for this lies with the property owners and, we assume, their bankers.</p> <p> I will give an example of how this worked on an almost daily basis.  There were numerous development sites sold in Dublin at the time.  We would have given numbers to our clients and appraised the value of sites.  We would have said to our clients that they could bid X for them.  Any number of times developers or clients came back and said, "I am going to bid X plus 20% or X plus 50%."  We had no input into these decisions and, frankly, were always unsure as to how they had come to these conclusions.  </p> <p> The strong demand from investors and occupiers essentially was what dictated market performance during this period and drove market activity.  It is important to note that a functioning property market is not driven purely by value.  Capital values are often used as an indicator to show how a market is performing.  Value can be affected by a variety of factors.  As well as value, to determine what is a functioning property market we also consider depth.  A more reliable method for assessing whether a market is functioning properly is focusing on demand and supply, using market transactions and depth.  Having  lived through the horrendous recession in recent years we all run the risk of forgetting what the market was actually like in 2005 and 2006.  There was enormous depth to it.  Any asset for sale had a number of bidding investors in competition with one another.  As 2007 and 2008 developed, we saw that there were risks in the market.  The warning signs were a shallowing of the depth of bidders in the market, a shallowing of the depth of occupiers and the fact that house prices had started to wobble.  We noticed that the number of bidders during the sales process had started to decrease significantly.  As a consequence, we advised most of our client base not to participate in the market on the buy-side and, where appropriate, we advised clients to sell.  We did this in 2005, which at the end of 2006 had proved to be the wrong decision.  Anyone who did not buy at the end of 2005 had lost the opportunity to participate in an additional 40% capital growth.  It was only in 2008 that this decision proved to be correct.  I can assure the committee that it was not a populist decision and we were not very popular for doing it.  </p> <p> We think our client investors were aware of risks at the time.  The market in Ireland is relatively transparent and it would have been impossible not to have been aware of some of these signs, as transaction processes are open.  </p>  <p>         There is reasonable availability for sharing information and data.  Data is a big issue in the Irish real estate market and I will happily talk about it later if necessary.</p> <p> Jones Lang produced a transparency index in 2006.  We were ranked the 15th most transparent market in the world which is a "high" transparency category.  We are now in the top ten in the world because there have been improvements in transparency over recent years.</p> <p> Other participants in the marketplace, such as investors, developers and the banks had the benefit of professional advice, or had significant in-house expertise to assist in their decision-making processes.  By 2008, there was a recognition within the property industry that market conditions were over-heating, however, I do not believe that most market participants realised the extent of bank lending to the property market, and second, that we would ever witness the collapse in value that subsequently occurred, which was due to an extraordinary confluence of global macro-economic events, combined with an over-reliance on debt in the property market.</p></speech>

I would be lying if I said we did.  At that time we felt that values had appreciated so significantly they were bound to have a correction at some stage.  We never envisaged the adjustment that took place afterwards.  A normal valuation correction that one would expect in a market that had six years of exceptional growth is between 5% and 15% for investment property, perhaps 30% for development land.  We told our clients there was no way this would continue forever and if they wanted to take a profit they should get out now.  By no means did we foresee what was around the corner.</p></speech>

A valuation report can quite comfortably on occasion run to 100 pages.  It details significant comparable evidence.  We do a huge amount of analysis to arrive at our opinions.

It is important that it is done on a specific date because property is not a static asset.  It changes so it is only a snapshot in time.  It is our best assessment of the open market value that would be agreed by a willing seller and willing buyer acting without compulsion.  That is the definition contained within the Red Book.  </p>  <p>         It has to be based on an appraisal of evidence of current sale prices, current rental values, current property yields and real transactions in the marketplace at the time.  It must use the most up-to-date and relevant evidence for the specific property involved.  We then take that evidence into account.  We adapt it for location, the size of the property and the type of the property.  In an investment, we will analyse the length of the lease and look at the strength of the covenant.  We ask whether it has the ability to pay the rent and the potential for future rental growth.  We determine whether the property itself is over rented or under rented.  All those components are taken into account, and that will deal with most investment values.</p> <p> Development land values are slightly different.  We use an approach called the residual valuation approach.  What we do is estimate what the completed value of the development will be, less the cost to bring it there, and that generally gives the residual value, which should be the land value.  We test that against market evidence, which is based on the value per square foot and per acre being paid for sites.  That is the general process.</p></speech>

Without being flippant, obviously when somebody buys for a price in excess of the valuation price, they see something significant in the property that is more valuable to them than perhaps anybody else in the marketplace.  It can happen particularly with land value.  Perhaps people assume buildings can be constructed on the site at a higher density than one assumed in the valuation.  Perhaps they have assumed a lower building cost than the valuer has assumed.  Land value <i>per se</i>is volatile and can move around with investment value.  One would be disappointed if one&rsquo;s valuations were being exceeded all the time in sales.<br/><br/>One thing that is important to understand, though, is that valuation is backwards looking; it is not forward looking.  Values are based on the most recent previous evidence.  Therefore, if a buyer wants to make a market by paying more, he is entitled to do so.  It is vitally important that it be understood that we are not market makers.</p></speech>

That would be in general property advice that we would be giving to people.  Where we would have been talking to them about pricing and the prospects for their assets, or otherwise, we would have given forward-looking advice but a valuation does not give forward-looking advice; it is set at the specific date and time.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran referred to a valuation at a particular point in time but he is aware of risks coming down the line.  Does that not affect the valuation being set?  Does the valuer not have to take that into account in some way, even if it is just looking at future rent yields?</p></speech>

It is really important to understand that.  A valuation is set at the particular time.  In calculating the investment yield, will we look at the prospects for the future rental growth and for the property and will we look at the duration of the receipt of income?  Absolutely, we will, and we will take that yield and start to adjust that yield, but what tends to happen in real estate, in particular, is that it is a lagging indicator.  Generally, what happens is that by the time one makes the projections, the transaction will have happened already, and this will have set a new benchmark.  One has to take into account the evidence one has and also make judgment calls on how one believes the property will perform.  However, that will relate purely to the yield one has chosen.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran said in page 5 of his submission that, "The practice of borrowers giving personal guarantees to secure debt became increasingly common in 2006 / 2007, and led to significant cross-collaboration of debt".  What would his relationship be with the funding of a transaction?  He said he introduces parties.</p></speech>

We do not introduce parties per se to banks or otherwise; that is not part of our role.  We have no involvement in the debt markets whatsoever.  Obviously, we would know what would be going on when somebody is buying a piece of property.  We understand and realise that they go to the banks to seek their funding.  What became very clear &ndash; some of this is with the benefit of hindsight &ndash; is that personal guarantees became quite common in 2006 and 2007, in particular.  What that really meant was that the banks started making their lending decisions based primarily on the apparent net worth of the borrower rather than the real underlying value of the security.  That is one of the issues that we have.  Those personal guarantees meant that the lending practices started to look away from the actual real estate itself and relied-----</p></speech>

In page 5 of his statement, under the heading &ldquo;Sources and extent of funding of the commercial real estate market in Ireland&rdquo;, Mr. Moran uses the phrase, &ldquo;Whilst we may introduce parties&rdquo;.   I think this is what Deputy Murphy was referring to.  Mr.  Moran is on the record as saying he is introducing parties.  Perhaps he could clarify that.</p></speech>

There was a variety of people.  There were private syndicators, private wealth managers, stockbroking firms and the private banking arms of the banks, which effectively pooled together private investors to pool together their equity to allow them to buy larger assets.  Those assets would have been out of an individual's reach in terms of their size and scale so the syndicates pooled the equity, put debt in behind it to support those types of transactions and then proceeded to acquire.  </p>  <p>         They pooled together the equity, put debt in behind it to support that type of transactions and then proceeded to acquire.  Coincidentally, that started in the financial services centre in the mid-1990s, where a lot of syndicated deals were put together to benefit from what were quite attractive tax allowances and then continued into 2000 onwards.  We do not involve ourselves in syndicates and never put together any syndicates.  Our job, with regard to any private syndicate, was to advise it on trying to find opportunities for it.  If the syndicate was successful in buying, it then was to do the due diligence for the syndicate on that transaction.</p></speech>

I will move on to risks and indicators because my time is vanishing for some reason.  Jones Lang LaSalle became increasingly aware of risks in the Irish commercial property market.

Throughout that entire period, no approach was made to us by anybody from the Government as to what were our views on the market.  Again, with the benefit of hindsight, we found that to be slightly unusual.  We expressed our concerns on risks with our client base, because we have our duty of care to that base.  In or about March 2007, my research team stated publicly that we were cautious about the market and that the market required a significant amount of caution at the time.

In September 2007, it was valued at &euro;345 million and at the time, <i>The Irish Times</i>stated it would be the second major shopping mall in the town and had raised questions about whether the local population was large enough to sustain both.  In February 2015, it was being valued at &euro;60 million.  What has happened there?  That is not a small overvaluation but is a significant change in value.  Even in 2007, Mr. Moran's company would have been aware that there were risks in the market, as was<i>The Irish Times</i>itself.  While people were aware this actually might not have been sustainable as a development, it was valued at &euro;345 million but then, in 2015, it has been valued again at &euro;60 million.</p></speech>

At the time in 2007, Athlone Town Centre was being leased up to international occupiers such as Zara, H&amp;M and Marks &amp;amp; Spencer's.  These were the type of companies that were going into it.  At the time, shopping centre yields probably were trailing in at approximately 3% or 4% capitalisation rates so the valuation probably was sustainable at that moment in time.

Ireland's economy was performing well, with GDP and employment growth driving the expansion. </blockquote>  <p>Quite a number of witnesses who came in here as well as various reports on the banking crisis have stated that, in fact, it was a credit-fuelled bubble as a result of inordinate amounts of money lent by banks and financial institutions that drove the growth.  How does Mr. Moran reconcile his view that it was economic fundamentals with that?</p></speech>

If one looks at CSO forecasts, which I happen to have in front of me, the forecast for 2006 was 6% economic growth and the forecast for 2007 was 5%.  The forecast was due to tail off in 2008 at 3% to 4% per annum.  We took all our economic commentary from a variety of sources.  We looked at ESRI reports.  We looked at Central Bank reports.  At no stage were what I would regard as the pillars of economic commentary, which would be Government-backed organisations or alternatively organisations such as the ratings agencies or otherwise, saying that we were about to witness the cataclysmic crash that we did.  We were aware that there was a lot of credit in the marketplace, but it is the oft-used word, that there was an expectation to which I referred earlier, that there would be a soft landing, and that the soft landing would result in an adjustment of prices but never to the extent that actually happened.</p></speech>

It is therefore imperative that we understand levels and impact of risk.<br /><br />Prior to the banking crisis, we were advising our clients on the nature and impacts of the property market and how it was performing.  Any advice was informed and reinforced with key primary research data.  We collect and monitor research for each property sector, with some datasets going back to the early 1970s.<br /><br />Any valuations ... were based on evidence of historical market values.  Valuation reports are not forward-looking.</blockquote>  <p>Let us take that on the one hand, and then on the other hand we take an article by a UCD academic called Morgan Kelly in December 2006 in which he stated:</p><blockquote>Offering no evidence except wishful thinking, estate agents and politicians assure us that we have nothing to worry about: the Irish housing market can look forward to a soft landing ... If the experiences of economies similar to ours are anything to go by, we may be looking at large and prolonged falls in real house prices of the order of 40-50 per cent and a collapse of house-building activity.</blockquote>  <p>Professor Kelly goes on then to instance research in the property sector in many countries from the 1970s on.  His conclusion, by comment consent turned out to be absolutely correct.  Mr. Moran said he had done the same research, or that he was basing his prognosis on historical research as well.  How does he reconcile-----</p></speech>

I have made it abundantly clear that we are not experts in the residential property market.  What Morgan Kelly was talking about was the housing market.  Our research relates to property data relating to what happened in the commercial real estate market, namely, how many offices are occupied in a year, how many retail units are occupied in a year, and what pricing has taken place.  We also said in Q1 2007 that we had concerns over the state of the residential market.  At the time we actually saw developers seeking change of use from residential to commercial opportunities.  Effectively, we anticipated price drops.  I think I have said that.  We anticipated price drops of between 5% and 15%.  We certainly did not anticipate price drops of 70% for commercial property and 90% for development land.</p></speech>

If one is talking about a housing estate for example, the value will be calculated on what the developer thinks he will be able to get for the houses, the end value of the houses less the cost of getting him there will lead one to the residual portion of the land.  I have no doubt developers made significant mistakes in that regard.  They were over optimistic in their assumptions.  They assumed increasing prices, which we felt were unsustainable.  They assumed higher densities than we felt they could probably get and therefore they started bidding the market up accordingly.  As a consequence, each time a developer bought a site, he set a new level so the price went up by another 10% and that became the next benchmark for the market to look at.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran was at the coalface.  He saw the size of the deals that were going down and the huge increase in price for commercial properties.  Where did he think the money came from if not from the banks?</p></speech>

I do not deny that for one moment.  It is very important to make clear that as practitioners we did not know how much equity was going into the deals.  We did not know whether equity releases were going into the deals.  We were never privy to or involved in any of the negotiations around the terms of those transactions.  We did not know what personal guarantees were being given.  What became very apparent afterwards, again this is with the benefit of hindsight, is that we did not know the level of lending.  We did not know the geographical concentration of it, nor did we know the level of lending to specific borrowers.  That is information to which real estates advisers would never be privy.</p></speech>

At these levels, international purchasers were priced out of the market, with more competitive yields available in other European countries".  Do I understand that European capitalists became wary of what was going on because they felt that prices were far too high in Ireland and they went elsewhere?  Is that how to read this?  If that is the case should alarm bells have sounded?</p></speech>

There is no tradition of foreign ownership of Irish real estate going right back to the 1970s when commercial real estate started to get really developed in Ireland.  The proportion of foreign owners in the Irish market has always been exceptionally low but that has changed significantly in the past three years.</p></speech>

If you want to take a profit perhaps you should think of exiting now".  </p>  <p>          As I said at the outset we were proven wrong for two consecutive years because values continued to rise in 2005, 2006 and the first three quarters of 2007.  I can assure the Deputy that a number of our clients were less than happy with the advice they received from us.</p></speech>

In a book authored by Shane Ross and Nick Webb, on page 161 they say:</p><blockquote>Looking back at that period, you could have advised a developer to pay tens of millions for a field in the middle of nowhere based on valuations that turned out to be nonsensical, but it did not damage your career.  NAMA paid hefty salaries to people who had been at the coalface of the crash.  NAMA was there to take up the slack and all previous errors were forgotten.  It was a bailout for the professional classes.</blockquote>  <p>Is that fair or unfair?  Is it an assessment Mr. Moran would agree or disagree with?</p></speech>

As I have said and I repeat, we do not make the market.  We give opinions and developers, owners, investors make their own decisions.  We do not take their decisions for them.  We do not know what their endgame actually is.  Did people get it wrong?  Absolutely.  There is no doubt that was the case, but we do not turn around and say, "You should do this at X".  People have their own teams, they are professionally advised and take their own choices.  I have never turned around to somebody in my entire career and said, "You should go and buy that for X."  I would say, "We think it is worth X" and it is up to them then to decide what they want to do with it or otherwise.</p></speech>

The syndicates were put together, as I said, by people who specialised in putting them together so you had specialist companies that were putting syndicates together.  There were private wealth managers, the stockbroking houses and the private banking arms of the banks putting them together.  The profile was people putting in relatively small - I use the word carefully - amounts of equity so they could participate in significantly larger projects.  It would not have been unusual for clubs of ten to 20 people to be put together that would put a certain amount of equity into a transaction which would enable them to buy a property that was significantly larger than if they were trying to buy it themselves.</p></speech>

Whose side are the boys on?  I ask that in reference to a predecessor of Mr. Moran who, in 2006, made this statement:  "Amazingly, the fundamental that is missed by those looking at the property market is that the price of land is high because the price that people are prepared to pay for houses is high, not vice versa."  The suggestion there is that young people trying to purchase a home wanted to pay the by any standard inordinate prices that were demanded to put a roof over their head.</p>  <p>  Mr. Moran's predecessor finishes by saying, "there is the Chinese proverb which counsels 'be careful what you wish lest your dream come true'".  It seems to me that a Government which engineers a fall in house prices in order to pick up first time buyers' votes may not alone be confusing action with progress but may also live to repent at leisure.  Is the suggestion by this particular estate agent, that house prices should be kept at the inflated levels they rose to up to 2006, in the interest of young people buying their homes?  Does Mr. Moran agree or disagree with this view?</p></speech>

We are on no side, that is the reality of the situation.  We act for buyers and sellers all the time.  I think I said at the outset and I passionately believe this - we need a functioning property market.  People forget that property is effectively land, which is a factor of production, which is necessary for economic activity to take place.  As a practitioner I would much rather see a property market that has increasing values in line with whatever the prevailing inflation rates are at the time.  I have no interest in participating in booms and busts, I have no interest in keeping values artificially high.  I have to run a business and I can assure the committee running a business in the cyclical industry that is property is not very pleasant.  We would rather see slow, steady growth.</p>  <p>  As I said, property is a factor of production.  Without it people do not have roofs over their heads.  They do not have shops to shop in or offices to work in.  It is a necessary function of a functioning economy.  I believe that slow, steady growth rather than this boom and bust cycle we have seen time and time again is far preferable.</p></speech>

Then it was prepared, as I understand it, by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with input from spatial planners from Denmark or other such expertise that was procured by the State at the time.  I ask the Chair for a little latitude here.  The strategy stated that towns such as Sligo, for example, would have to prepare an infrastructure for a population of 100,000 by 2020 and, obviously, that was mirrored in other towns, villages and cities throughout the country.  To what extent was this analysis wrong?  Why was it wrong?  To what extent did it fuel the policy agenda of the day that led to the property boom?</p></speech>

It enabled towns as gateway towns and it was pro-development to the extent that people were anticipating that population growth.  Where the issue arose is it was very difficult.  If the Senator will recall, we had a rapidly growing population at the time.  We had quite significant immigration and there was a view afoot that the population was going to continue to expand and that we were going to have to provide both residential and commercial accommodation to all these new population centres.  Hindsight proves that we were completely wrong.  Did it assist in fuelling development in locations where perhaps development was not sustainable otherwise?  Absolutely.</p>  <p>  One point I will make, and which I feel quite strongly about, is there has been a lot of blame delivered at the doors of the banks, estate agents, developers and various other stakeholders.  The town planners in this country are also equally as culpable for fuelling the development boom.  Planning policies were extraordinarily lax.  They were difficult and virtually impossible, and incoherent in a number of respects.  Certainly, in a chase for rates income and in a chase for each town wanting to out-develop each other, they led to completely and totally unsustainable development.</p></speech>

We thought that values would fall by 5% to 15%, not by, as I stated, 70%.  We were aware of all the economic commentary that was in the marketplace but what nobody, certainly, in Dublin anyway, was aware of was what was happening globally.  We were not aware that Lehman Brothers was about to collapse.  We were not aware that there was going to be a credit crunch.  We, certainly, were not aware that the banks had over-lent in every aspect of real estate which led to the cataclysmic events that we have endured.  What we have just been through in the property market is unprecedented.  It has never happened before.  We knew there was an adjustment coming, but certainly not of the magnitude that we have currently undertaken.</p></speech>

That is the job of the bank, not us.  What we would have been aware of, through general market knowledge and anecdotal pieces of people to people, was the level of types of loan-to-value ratios that were available in the market at the time and they could have been, I am sure, in certain circumstances, up to 90%, and in other circumstances there were exceeded by that.  That, to us, is an exceptionally high level of loan-to-value ratio.<br/><br/>If I compare it to today, which might be a useful benchmark, a very high-quality investment property in Dublin today will get a loan-to-value ratio of perhaps 65% at the outside.

In terms of international investors, was that a particular cause of concern?  Mr. Moran indicated already that Jones Lang LaSalle gave advice to some of its investors to dispose of assets.  In terms of international investors, how did the company express that concern?</p></speech>

I think one has to understand as well that the real estate market in Ireland is actually quite small.  We have 40 million sq. ft. of modern office space in Dublin, compared to 400 million sq. ft. in London, for example.  International real estate investors generally seek markets where there is scale.  In the period 2002-07 it was the first time ever that the Irish market had shown any signs of scale.  There are a number of international investors who will not invest in a market unless it trades at least &euro;2 billion a year, so it simply was not on their radar screen.</p></speech>

Dublin, at the time, was at No. 3 in the regional growth index.  That was around 2004-05.  It was predicated on things like employment growth, GDP growth, increase in consumer spending, and increase in consumer sentiment.  As an investment location, because the yields were so tight, we simply did not feature.</p></speech>

Why does Mr. Moran think that is?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015040200002#L01000"><p>I think the component of volatility that really impacts, and it relates to both commercial and residential, is land.  Land is exceptionally volatile in value and that is because it is open to so many various different interpretations.  If there is a one-acre site, for example, and I think I can build 12 houses on that site, I know I can sell them for a certain amount.  I know what it will cost to build them.  I know what my services and financing costs will be.  That tells me what I can afford to pay for the land.  However, if somebody beside me thinks that he can build 50 apartments on it, he knows that the end value will be significantly higher.  His construction costs may be slightly higher but he can afford to pay a lot more for it.</p>  <p>  That pertains through commercial land as well.  If I think on an office site I can build a 100,000 sq. ft. of offices to deal with a company of 700 or 800 people and the person beside me thinks he can build 200,000 sq. ft. of offices, different values will arise.  That is where the real volatility around value arises.  The other aspect of it is in a scenario where there were high loan-to-value ratios.  The level of equity that was being put into the transactions was relatively low so when one is operating in a market where values fall by 70% to 75%, everybody's equity gets wiped and I think that is why we are in the situation that we are in where, obviously, loan levels then become unsustainable because the natural buffer that one would expect to be in a normal piece of lending was not adhered to.</p></speech>

The scale of this was unprecedented.  If there had been a fire sale there would have been buyers for it, there is no doubt about that.  The same people who had been buying over the previous three to four years would have been active participants but they simply would have paid less.  I think, in hindsight, the benefit of holding the assets for as long as we possibly could was probably a wise thing.  Also I do not think - and the members of the committee would be better qualified than me to say this - that the State could have taken the hit, unless we dealt with in the way that we did.  It is arguable that the State has not been able to take the hit.  The scale of this is that &euro;74 billion worth of loans were transferred into NAMA, or &euro;74 billion worth of face value.  That does not take into account the other hundreds of billions that the banks had on their balance sheets that were not put into NAMA.  It is mind-blowing in its magnitude.</p></speech>

As a firm, we had been involved with the IFSC since its inception.  I doubt without the tax benefits, either the capital allowances or the double rent allowances, it would have been successful because it was a location the people simply did not want to go to.  Those tax breaks became a little less attractive after 2002 when the cap was brought in on the amount of income that could be used against them so they did not feature as much.  I believe that the other array of tax allowances that were provided for holiday villages and all the various other hotels, in particular, led to a proliferation of development in some fairly obscure locations where there was obviously no end user demand.  So I think latterly those types of allowances were ineffective and led to overdevelopment.  Also the preponderance of the Government to say at the time that the allowance would be gone at the end of the following year and then suddenly extending it again exacerbated and fuelled developers trying to take advantage of those allowances.</p></speech>

We need people to buy all these distressed assets which are now being re-sold back into the market place.  Therefore, in order to widen the potential buyer pool I think REITs were a good idea.  I also think they will play a role in future development.  They are allowed to develop 35% of their portfolios so they will become important providers of space which should help us to respond to the supply side issues that we have in the marketplace at the moment for both residential and office accommodation.</p></speech>

I was looking at <i>The Irish Times</i>piece that Mr. Moran had in 2008 looking forward to 2009, when the podcast went off.  I am not being paid by <i>The Irish Times</i>to do that deliberately.  It is the second time it has happened, so my apologies.</p><p>Mr. Moran has said that in 2005 he suggested to his clients to sell and not buy at that point in time.  Clearly they ignored his advice, given that levels of investment by Irish investors increased dramatically in the 2005-06 peak year, and 2007.  Why does Mr. Moran believe that they ignored his advice?</p></speech>

We, as a firm, did not have an enormous involvement in the private investor market.  We were considered, and probably still are, the institutional firm in town, for want of a better expression.  </p>  <p>         Most of them adhered to our advice.  Some 90% of the buying activity at that time was private investor led.  Quite frankly, it was stoked by a lot of people.  Private syndicators were making a great deal of money out of it so it was in their interests to try to continue to push property acquisition and investment as an asset class.</p></speech>

In that context, some 121 transactions accounted for the &euro;3.6 billion.  Of these, 39 involved amounts of less than &euro;2 million so one would assume that they related to private individuals.  A further 23 involved amounts of between &euro;2 million and &euro;4 million, so they probably also related to private individuals.  Above that, some 20 involved amounts greater than &euro;40 million and I would say 90% of these were probably syndicated transactions.  Out of the total of 121, one could probably argue that 40 or 50 were syndicated transactions.</p></speech>

First, and believe it or not, with &euro;3.6 million being traded, there simply was not enough opportunity in terms of supply in the Irish market in 2006.  There was still a lot of cash washing around the system at the time so people were starting to seek better returns.  There were better returns available in other countries, so people opted for them.  People were also perhaps seeking to "de-risk" their strategies to some degree and said, "I do not need complete exposure of my property investment strategy to Ireland and I would like to take some exposure in London or elsewhere".  In that context, people invested money in all sorts of God-forsaken places.  There was an element of that involved and a certain proportion of it was fuelled by the same syndicators to whom I referred earlier and who needed to continue to build their businesses.  As well as being active in Ireland, most of those syndicators were also active overseas.</p></speech>

That update also highlighted the risk of investing in commercial property.  Was Mr. Moran aware of the update to which I refer, which, I believe, was written by Marie Hunt?

The point I am making, therefore, is that it is fair to say property agents such as Jones Lang LaSalle were directly involved in maximising the value of particular sites, this site in particular which was over &euro;400 million.</p></speech>

It must be understood the property market is primarily about supply and demand.  It is about the general state of the economy.  The market, buyers in particular, was not populated by people who did not take advice, who did not have internal advisers or who did not take external advice.  People made mistakes and if they paid too much money for a property, they did so with their eyes wide open.</p></speech>

Reading back, he says the property market was supported by the economy.  In our case, it was driving the economy.  It accounted for some 25% of GDP when it should have been only 8%, 9% or 10%.  He says it peaked on 30 September 2007, but it is now generally acknowledged that it peaked around July 2006.  Jones Lang LaSalle is one of the main estate agents and puts itself forward as such.  However, the ordinary person would have to ask this question.  How can it state the property market peaked 14 months after the time we now know that it peaked, in July 2006?</p></speech>

I did say values tend to lag in the market, so activity levels had started to fall off.  That is why I said there were two reasons for looking at the property market.  We look at the property market in terms of value appreciation, but we also look at the depth of and activity in bidding.  I contend that the depth of and activity in bidding had started to wane towards the end of 2006, but that is a matter of opinion.</p></speech>

Much of the investment taking place is with equity rather than debt.  The general financial circumstances of the global market - it is not often we use the term "global market" in Ireland's case - are that there are significant amounts of equity seeking homes and a yield in the absence of decent returns elsewhere.  </p>  <p>         The occupier market and the general economic fundamentals support a reasonably performing property market.  Should these factors change, should there be an economic shock or significantly increased interest rates, for example, values will decline.  Are we at the bubble stage?  Not just yet.  Am I concerned that we might be getting there?  Quite possibly.</p></speech>

If we compare ourselves with other economies in Europe, some countries centrally fund their data collection and these data are available to everybody to assist them in making business decisions.  In this country data are opaque and not necessarily always shared.  The industry generally would welcome far better data provisions.  It is not just down to the availability of a commercial property register or the residential property price register; it goes much further than this, into some of the issues on which I have touched, including concentration of risk for banks and the geographics and borrowers to which they are lending.  To use a favoured expression currently, the information we can access needs to be far more granular than it is to allow us to undertake a proper, rigorous analysis.</p></speech>

The vacancy rate for what we describe as grade A accommodation, the best space in the best location in the city, is sub 3%.  I understand there is only one building of over 100,000 sq. ft. available in Dublin city at this time.  It is a serious issue which has led to very significant increases in office rents.  We do a lot of work for foreign occupiers and it is now a major concern in terms of our FDI competitiveness.  People look around Dublin and think certain postal districts compete against each other.  Our experience, however, is that Dublin, when trying to attract foreign investment, is competing against Birmingham and Berlin.  We are at a stage where our rent prices are getting to the level of being unsustainable.  A rental price in the order of &euro;50 to &euro;55 per square foot is sustainable in Dublin, given that it is an international capital and the amount of technology companies based here.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, real estate is a little like a super tanker - it takes a long time to stop it and a long time to start it.

We are looking at a different landscape in terms of the ownership of very important commercial property in Dublin and around the country.  What impact might this huge shift in the ownership dynamic have in a context where the investment decisions these firms make are typically not long-term ones?</p></speech>

Any property recovery has three phases and we are only starting to enter the third phase.  We then have the private equity houses or other investors that come in to take it out.  People think these companies are all vultures and have been coming here to steal all of our assets and everything else, but I regard their involvement as probably the greatest amount of foreign direct investment we have ever seen in this country in capital terms.  That is what it is - people investing their money.  Yes, they are here to make money, but they are also investing.</p></speech>

The consumer price index between 2000 and 2007 was running at about 30%.

One way or the other they were ahead of where inflation was.  Should it have been a warning signal - yes absolutely.  There was a lot of catch up going on.

There would be an announcement that the tax incentive for building these schemes was going to be finished by 18 months or by six months time.  There would be a surge of development activity responding to that.  Then in the next budget the tax incentive would be rolled over again, so instead of finishing it and completing it, which I believe would have been the preferable thing to do, it just caused people to think "There is that tax incentive, I'll utilise that again".  If one drives around parts of the midlands or parts of the west, there are developments that have no reason to be there, other than they were tax based.</p></speech>

Quoting again from the book by Deputy Shane Ross and Nick Webb:</p><blockquote>Jones Lang Lasalle was able to keep afloat through hefty fees from NAMA [after the crash].  In September 2011, John Moran said that the company's work for NAMA was relatively good for us in 2010.  He was putting it mildly.  The former firm was the biggest recipient of valuation fees from NAMA, as noted above [in the figures given].  That figure represented only a portion of Jones Lang Lasalle's income from NAMA.  The company also earned &euro;2.8 million for portfolio management fees over the same period.  </blockquote>  <p>Is it unfair that someone thinks estate agents in general, including Jones Lang Lasalle, cleaned up in the bubble and prices were going well and were cushioned in the crash while many ordinary people who suffered had no such lifeline?  Is that unfair or fair?</p></speech>

Our revenue halved and we did not earn &euro;2.8 million in portfolio fees from NAMA.  That is inaccurate.  We do not segregate where we earn our money from and we report normally.  Our accounts are publicly available.  No one who wrote that book consulted with us about the level of fee income we earned.  Like every other agent in Dublin, we earned fees from NAMA.  We are not advisers to them and NAMA takes its own advice and has its own team.  At the moment, our role is now is to implement what it asks us to do.</p></speech>

The benefits of having professional owners of real estate, as opposed to one of private investors, can be beneficial in that they give the opportunity to provide professional management.  Rapid rent increases in residential accommodation, which we witnessed, are wrong.  If I were creating Government policy, which I am not, I would look to change leasing structures in residential investment to have something that is fairer for both landlords and tenants.</p></speech>

That is fairer for everyone and creates a more sustainable model.

There is a key lesson to learn about regulation of bank lending.  There should always be detailed central knowledge of the volume and nature of bank lending, including risk concentration in a sector, a location or to borrowers.  Development lending should include a detailed assessment, not only of the land value, which is a snapshot in a volatile sector, but a detailed assessment of how the money will be paid back.  We did not feel that happened and there should be sensitivity analysis contained within that.  When preparing a development land valuation, one can turn around and say that if it goes right there is likely to be one outcome and if it goes wrong there is likely to be a different outcome.  That did not happen and it is still missing in the industry.</p>  <p>  All valuations for bank lending should be commissioned by the bank, paid for by the bank and with the duty of care exclusively with the bank.  The practice of borrowers commissioning bank valuations should be ceased.  </p></speech>

There have been some improvements in the past number of years but it is not at the stage it needs to be.  Banks should have more in-house qualified property professionals as a key part of decision-making or take proper external impartial advice.  There was not a property professional to be found in any of the banks between 2002 and 2007.</p>  <p>  Valuation should be more frequent on security because property is not a static asset and changes.  If zoning changes, the value can change.  Valuing it and not looking at the file for five or six years is unacceptable.  The planning system needs a serious overhaul in how it links up and how it gives clear guidance to the development community.  It does not so people make mistakes based on incorrect assumptions.  I have spoken about data sharing, which is something we would welcome</p>  <p>  The final point is the limited interaction between the regulatory side of the Government and experts in the industry.  I am open to correction but I do not think there is a property professional in the Central Bank, which I find astounding given the amount of property lending that goes on.  I would welcome the introduction of an expert panel from experienced practitioners to advise the Government on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

The CEOs of the main estate agencies, like myself, or of REITs can give really valuable insight to Government as to what is happening on the ground.  If we see overheating - and it is in nobody's interests to have an overheated market - we can tell Government we think we have a problem.  The Government can then introduce a policy to deal with it.  Where we see supply-side issues, like we see in offices and residential at the moment, we can also make that known.  We have been banging the supply-side drum for the past 24 months and saying there are simply not enough offices in this city.

If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking them to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Hunt to make her opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.450" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Hunt" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015040200002#T00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to attend to put in context the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period up to 2008.  Members have my submission so I will not read it verbatim but will highlight some of the key points.</p>  <p>  Commercial real estate breaks down into a lot of markets and sub-markets such as office, retail and industrial occupier markets, the investment market, the development land market and the hotel and licensed markets.  All these different sub-markets operate independently of one another.  Commercial real estate volumes are considerably lower than in the residential property sector but the value of commercial real estate transactions is considerably higher.  In the absence of a national census or register of commercial property it is quite difficult to do as the committee asked and precisely quantify the size of the market, though some sectoral estimates on stock figures and transaction activity are collated by firms such as ourselves.</p>  <p>  Commercial property tends to break down into three distinct elements, which are the development piece, the occupier piece and the investment piece.  What happened in Ireland in the period up to 2008 is that the three distinct sectors effectively merged and real estate developers began to develop accommodation, let it out and hold onto the property for investment purposes.  Invariably they then used it as collateral for other investments and developments.  </p>  <p>  Commercial property is, by its nature, a long-term investment.  In general, commercial property is significantly more complex than other forms of investment and much less liquid.  By virtue of the typical size of transactions it is not really a sector that is accessible to all - one needs a lot of money to be able to invest in commercial real estate.  However, the emergence of the syndicate model in Ireland in the late 1990s did enable a larger cohort of investors to get into commercial property.  </p>  <p>           CBRE is a Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 company with headquarters in Los Angeles.  It has 52,000 employees and its Irish firm is the largest property firm in Ireland.  CBRE Ireland is a multidisciplinary firm and is involved in everything to do with commercial property, be it property sales and acquisitions, leasing, investment sales, corporate services, project management, consultancy or anything else.  In the same vein, we do not act for a particular type of client.  We act for vendors, purchasers, landlords, tenants, developers, etc.  In addition, under the property industry umbrella, we act for significant numbers of third-party providers, such as accountants, solicitors, banks, receivers and so on.</p> <p> The research function at CBRE Ireland has the same platform as we have in every CBRE office across Europe, in that we have systems, databases and processes in place.  Our main role is to track transactions and market information.  We track transaction volume, land sales, hotel and pub sales, office and industrial leasing statistics and supply and demand to whatever degree we can.  We also comment on issues such as rents, yields and capital values.  All of this information is inputted into global databases and this enables us to produce pan-European publications and to compare Ireland with other jurisdictions.  It is important to stress that the research function at CBRE operates independently of the rest of the business.  Therefore, my team is not involved in transactional activity on a day-to-day basis.  We observe what happens on the ground and we are charged with giving impartial and unbiased observations and commentary based on our interpretation of market trends from the perspective of property market specialists operating in the business.</p> <p> I am not an economist.  This is quite unusual because many of those on research teams working within property come from an economic background.  I come from a surveying background.  I am a chartered surveyor by profession and I am a full member of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, I have completed all my postgraduate qualifications and I am a fellow of that society.  Over the past 20 years, I have been a regular commentator on the commercial real estate sector in Ireland and I produce a range of publications on the market and across all of the sectors.  We produce a significant number of statistical publications on the office, industrial and investment sectors, just as CBRE does worldwide.  The publication we are best known for is our bimonthly report, which is more of a newsy report that provides an update or snapshot every two months in terms of trends and transactions happening on the ground.</p> <p> The most significant challenge I have faced in my 20 years doing this job in trying to track the size and scale of activity is the scarcity of data.  Unlike in many jurisdictions across Europe where I have colleagues working, we do not have a national property register.  This has created huge issues, because it is down to private firms like ours to carry out research.  Invariably, when we publish that research, it is claimed we have a vested interest.  Therefore, our research has been a thankless job.  I believe the Government should have established a national property register or system to enable us to track the market better.  Perhaps we can discuss that later.</p> <p> The understanding of risk is related to the issue of available data.  Again, we do not have the luxury of a long-time series.  The only independent source of data on the Irish market is produced by a private company, Investment Property Databank, IPD.  I do not know whether members are familiar with the work of IPD, but since the mid-1970s, all institutionally owned properties in Ireland must value their assets quarterly.  These quarterly valuations are what make up the IPD data.  Therefore, the data are not representative of the entire market because the valuations relate purely to institutional assets.  However, the data do give us a good barometer of trends in the market.  As members can see from figure 1, the commercial real estate market in Ireland, for the period for which data are available, has demonstrated a highly cyclical pattern.  This demonstrates the fact that commercial real estate is a long-term investment.  According to this index, the average total return is 16.4% per annum which one would agree is a decent level of annual return.  However, looking at it on an annualised basis, this is hugely cyclical.  Figure 2 shows a table for the years from 2001 to 2008 where this cyclical pattern is clearly evident.  In 2002, we had a total ungeared return of 2.2%.  Four years later that was 24.4%</p> <p> Roughly, each cycle has tended to be of ten years duration.  In the period up to 2007, considering the fact that interest rates were rising and we had built a significant amount of property in the preceding years, primarily as a result of the ready availability of cheap and plentiful debt and Government tax policy in place at the time, which incentivised real estate investment and development, it was predictable that the market would turn and we would enter the downward phase of the cycle.</p> <p> If we look at what drives property, this can be broken down to four key drivers: the economic backdrop, the balance between supply and demand, funding and sentiment.  If the cycle had followed its normal or expected pattern, as we considered it would at the time, Irish commercial property values would have gradually fallen from peak levels, dipped close to or slightly into negative territory, plateaued and ultimately the cycle would have kick-started again.  For the period from 1976 for which we had data, that was the pattern and what we anticipated would happen.  We did not anticipate the extent of the crash that happened, and the extent to which Irish investors and developers were leveraged exacerbated their losses. </p> <p> I will run through each of the four drivers individually, beginning with the economic backdrop.  We are a real estate firm, not economists.  Therefore, our economic projections and assumptions, both from a micro and macro level, came from outside the organisation.  We would have paid huge credence to the ESRI, the ECB and the IMF.  Also, as an S&amp;P 500 company, we would have been very mindful of the ratings agencies, none of which downgraded their projections for Ireland until the third quarter of 2008.</p> <p> In regard to the supply-demand balance, I know the committee had someone before it in recent weeks who said the supply-demand balance does not have a bearing.  However, it is critical.  Consider the double-digit house price rises we have seen in Dublin over recent times and the 50% increase in office rents in the past 18 months.  This is due to the under-supply situation we are in.  It was obvious to us in the period up to 2007 that an imbalance was starting to come through in supply and demand.  Cheap and plentiful bank debt and Government tax policy fuelled a construction boom and encouraged the development of both residential and commercial property, much of which occurred in the wrong parts of the country.  Extensive rezoning of land for development across many different local authority areas and the absence of a national planning strategy exacerbated this trend.  In simple terms, we were building too much accommodation, much of which was in the wrong locations.  The pace of development was unsustainable and needed to be curtailed.</p> <p> As a firm, we began to warn in 2005 about the potential for over-supply and we welcomed signs that development was beginning to slow down.  Against the backdrop of development continuing to slow down and domestic economic activity remaining strong, as we believed to be the case based on the commentary being provided by the IMF and the ESRI and so forth, a soft landing was plausible in our opinion.  In fact, this was the most likely scenario according to a range of market advisers and participants at that time.</p> <p> The third factor, one critical to the committee's deliberations, is funding.  In the context of property, when we worried about funding, all we ever considered was whether interest rates were going up or down.  The likelihood of a global banking crisis removing debt from the equation completely did not enter our thinking.  We believed that the banks were stress-testing borrowers.  A scenario where the global banking system would completely implode and where domestic debt funding would completely disappear, which exacerbated the pace and severity of collapse experienced in the Irish commercial property market, just was not envisaged.</p> <p> The fourth influencer, probably the most difficult to measure, is sentiment.  Herd instinct plays a part in the property market and the market is heavily influenced by sentiment.  We took our role seriously and understood that commentary, positive or negative, can influence sentiment to a large degree and that this could influence activity levels and, ultimately, pricing.  As an organisation, CBRE is very mindful of its role.  Any commentary or observations made about the market were made objectively and without influence.  Consider the client base we had and have today.  Talking the market up or talking it down was not on our agenda, because we had clients on every side.  </p>  <p>           We believe our commentary always has been open, honest, based on the information available to us and based on our perspective as property specialists.  From our perspective, as I stated the information up to 2007 suggested that a soft landing was the most likely pattern.  We found that a property market tends to follow the same pattern and we refer frequently to a chart, shown as figure 3 in our presentation, which comes from a book written more than 100 years ago by a man called Homer Hoyt.  It follows a study of 100 years of land values in Chicago, in which eight different cycles were followed and monitored, including the gold rush, the arrival of trains and so on.  Hoyt came to the conclusion that a property cycle always tends to follow the same pattern.  CBRE used that graphic a lot in presentations to clients to demonstrate the cyclicality of the market and in turn, to demonstrate risk to some degree.  As members can see, figure 3 typically follows the same pattern but what took everybody by surprise in the crash in 2008 is that it did not follow the normal pattern.  Effectively, we jumped from stage 7, where the real estate market was peaking, to stage 12, where the banks reversed their boom policy on loans overnight.  We skipped all the other stages and that led to the crash being significantly more severe.  Certainly for the period for which data were available, we had never experienced anything of that magnitude.</p> <p> Moving on to some of the analysis we do locally, we maintain property databases and again, these follow the same definitions and methodologies as does CBRE worldwide.  We have been tracking what Irish people were spending on investment property and we track every single transaction over &euro;1 million in value.  We can then put that into a global system and look at it on a pan-European basis.  According to our research, Irish investors invested more than &euro;46.35 billion in income-producing assets with a value of more than &euro;1 million in the period between 2001 and 2008.  Were one to add properties that were below &euro;1 million in value, that figure would probably be closer to &euro;50 billion.  I should state that more than 50% of this investment during the aforementioned period occurred in the United Kingdom and 23% in Ireland.  The volume increased year-on-year from 2003 to 2006, peaking at more than &euro;11 billion in 2006.  Unusually, 100% of investment expenditure in Ireland in the period between 2001 and 2008 was by domestic investors.  At the peak in 2006, 30% of Irish investment occurred in Ireland, with 55% in that year occurring in the United Kingdom.</p> <p> To put into context how severe was the crash, in 2006 at peak, there were more than 98 transactions of more than &euro;1 million in the Irish market while two years later in 2008, there were only 26 transactions totalling  less than &euro;500 million.  These data were publicly available and were produced in all CBRE research publications at the time.  Anybody who went looking for it could have found it and I suppose it marries the data that were coming out in respect of the amount of lending that was going on.  I have just looked at the peak of the market in the year 2006 to give members a flavour but according to this research, 36% of the investment spend in Ireland was attributable to developers, 26% to syndicates, 20% to private investors, 10% to institutions and the remainder to a combination of different investment funds, pension funds, occupiers, etc.  Outside of Ireland, the proportions were quite similar.  It also is important to note in respect of the types of assets people were buying that Irish investors tended to have a preference for office and retail properties.</p> <p> As for development land, we also maintain a database tracking all development land in which we stripped out all agricultural sales and counted everything else.  As members can see, according to that research, which is shown in figure 5, a total of almost &euro;12.5 billion was invested in just shy of 1,000 individual development land transactions between 2001 and 2008.  It is significant to point out that while much of the focus on commercial property tends to be on the land piece, four times that amount was being spent on investment property when one adds it up cumulatively.  It also is important to note that while they will not be included in these numbers, members might remember that in the period between 2001 and 2008, there was a notable increase in the volume of hotel and pub sales in the Irish market, many of which effectively were land sales.  One could also include petrol stations in that regard.  The volume of expenditure is dramatic and increased more than ninefold between 2001 and 2006, according to our data, when more than &euro;4 billion was invested in development land.  In addition to the increases in land values in the period, there was a notable increase in transaction volumes recorded with 59 in 2001, rising to 260 individual transactions in 2006.</p> <p> In both figure 4 and figure 5, I will point members to the year 2006 because that was the peak of the market based on transactional information.  Towards the end of 2006 and early 2007, it was obvious that transactional activity had started to slow down.  Members will have seen this in excerpts from various reports from that time.  In respect of funding specifically in respect of the various transactions I have demonstrated to members on these charts, CBRE was involved in some capacity in many of these transactions, be they in Ireland or overseas.  We were also involved in many of the transactions involving Irish buyers overseas and we carried out valuations for lending purposes for many of the purchasers and indeed all the Irish lending institutions.  However, we were not privy to detailed information on how these specific transactions were being funded.  Anecdotally, we were aware that a large proportion of transactions were debt-funded compared with other countries.  We knew that from talking to colleagues in other jurisdictions.  We also were aware of commentary on increases in property lending by the Irish banks and individual financial institutions.  However, we were not privy to the specifics of how particular transactions were being funded, how banks were financing themselves and we certainly were not aware of the extent of cross-collateralisation that was occurring.  Perhaps na&iuml;vely, we presumed that a central register of commercial lending activity tracking borrowers' exposures across different lending institutions existed.  We were not aware of particular banks' exposure to specific individual borrowers.  As I stated at the outset, we are not banking experts and so we had regard to assertions from the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and others that the banks were sufficiently well capitalised and robust.  We were cognisant of ratings given to Ireland by ratings agencies such as Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.  Based on this, we believed that the Irish banks were well funded and appropriately regulated and that the borrowers were being sufficiently stress-tested.  We had no reason to suggest otherwise and we did not have specialist training or insight or any knowledge that would have enabled us to question this.</p> <p> As for lessons for the future, in the period up to 2008, to my knowledge we were not contacted by the Government, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance or the Financial Regulator at any stage for our view on property market trends from our perspective or to ask us for any of the data we were collecting on transactional activity or property market performance.  In general, Government intervention in the property market was largely done without any engagement whatsoever with the property industry and certainly not with firms such as ours.  In the future, we recommend engagement with such organisations that have access to reliable information on trends and transactions, as well as the ability to cross reference this with other jurisdictions and geographies because we believe this would give a valuable perspective to decision-makers and those in authority.  It is encouraging that in its recent Construction 2020 report, the Government has acknowledged the need to improve data collection and analysis to ensure that the real estate sector in the future is evidence-based and underpinned by the best available data.  Had reliable, honest, timely and accurate data been collected historically and reviewed in the context of a national planning framework, the scale of the downturn in the most recent cycle may have been somewhat less severe.  That is my submission in which I have made every effort to address the specific items the joint committee has asked me to address.  I will be happy to take any specific questions.</p></speech>

I believe that at the previous meeting, I may have taken her name in vain when I was talking about the financial stability update in 2007.  It was of course authored by Ms Maria Woods and not by Ms Hunt.  In her statement, Ms Hunt mentions that 100% of the investment spending in Ireland in commercial property for the period between 2001 and 2008 was comprised of domestic investors.  Would this be normal for a domestic market?</p></speech>

In the case of Ireland, there were probably several reasons for this, the main one being that many investors simply deemed Ireland to be too small, that the size of opportunities that were brought to the market were quite small.  In the current market, we have lots of portfolios changing hands that are sizeable and this is attractive to investors.  </p>  <p>         At that time, however, we were selling individual assets and they were just deemed to be too small.</p> <p> We also had a much higher stamp duty regime in Ireland.  For example, one could have invested in the United Kingdom and paid a stamp duty rate of 4% relative to 9% that had prevailed in Ireland, so that was off-putting.  Also, pricing was more expensive so if we looked at yields or cap rates relative to other jurisdictions, Dublin stood out because it was more expensive so obviously investors were not going to invest on that basis.</p></speech>

When someone is in the upward part of a cycle and using leverage, it enhances their returns but the opposite of that is also true.  When the market crashes, they are severely exposed but unlike other forms of investment, they can borrow.  That is what I am saying.</p></speech>

It was a market that was easy to understand and from a banking perspective also it was quite similar, so it was the natural progression for people to go into.  Also, there was much more produce available compared to the small Irish market.  If we consider the types of assets the Irish investors bought, as I said, they tended to buy office and retail properties in preference and they tended to buy very high quality so they bought Bond Street retail properties and West End offices.  They did a little bit of investment in regional UK but most of it was focused in central London.</p></speech>

The first would be on the transactional side, and clearly the Senator can see from figures four and five that the transactional activity had begun to show signs of slowing down from late 2006.  If one reads any report from that time, there was comment to suggest transactional activity was down year-on-year.  The peak from a transactional point of view was 2006.  Because of the way it is compiled, IPD does lag the market so it was some time later that it began to come through in those sorts of indices.  Again, if the Senator reads all of our reports from 2007 onwards, in every single sector we were pointing out concerns that the market was in the downward phase of the cycle.</p></speech>

Again I would need to go back and check but we track right across Europe, every single capital city.  We track a quarter-on-quarter increase and a year-on=-year increase, so if there was something glaring, it would have stood out.  When significant increases of that magnitude occur year-on-year, if one goes to other markets at the same point in time, there will probably be a similar trend because of capital flows.</p></speech>

When there is trebling from one year to another, Ms Hunt said IPD tends to have a lag.  Surely the lag should have been obvious by the time the UBS report was produced 15 to 18 months later and surely it should have been available for CBRE as a research group?</p></speech>

I think some of them are here for the long haul and some of them did not understand the Irish market, but now that they have come and seen it on the ground, they are much more comfortable and may well stay.  Some of them are moving up the risk curve now.  They are not investing in the types of assets they initially came to buy and are now moving into the development sphere.

She denounced them.  In February 2010, it was stated:</p><blockquote>According to Marie Hunt, Director of Research at CB Richard Ellis, &ldquo;This has come as a huge surprise to the industry.  We understood that the Government had decided not to implement this measure.  While no one is disputing the fact that tenants in many sectors of the property market have come under huge pressure in recent months and many are struggling to meet rent payments, the reality is that this move will not do anything to improve the plight of retailers and office occupiers who are currently in such difficulties.  </blockquote>  <p>Could Ms. Hunt explain why she was so opposed to the change in the upward-only rent reviews?</p></speech>

Therefore, if somebody comes in overnight and says the contract is to be torn up and one is no longer entitled to those upward-only rent reviews, it undermines confidence.  In the period 2009 to 2012, we had a huge amount of uncertainty about this issue and on whether the reviews were going to be amended or not.  If one looks at transactional activity, one sees virtually no transactions happened as a result.  The minute it was announced in the budget in December 2011 that this was taken off the table for constitutional reasons, international investors began to engage and, indeed, NAMA began to release assets to the market.  Nobody was going to buy anything in Ireland, regardless of what price it was, if there was uncertainty about the income flow or the potential of that income to grow over time.</p></speech>

We now have a map of Europe with dots for every jurisdiction.  I am trying to remember the numbers off the top of my head but, roughly speaking, it is about 50-50 at this point.  Quite a bit of that is coming from the US because there are US firms which are now domiciled in Ireland.  The Irish piece would also be split 50-50, between Irish REITs and Irish investors.  For example, the money going into the REITs is invariably not Irish but they are Irish entities.  They are listed on the Stock Exchange.  We would tend to count them, but separate that figure out because it is Irish but the money is coming in internationally.</p></speech>

It is probably 35% now.  Something we have seen with global capital flows over the past 12 months is that there is money coming into European real estate from lots of different jurisdictions.  Our sense is that, going forward, the jurisdictions might change and we might get more Asian money coming into the Irish market, particularly from Asian investors who are now familiar with London and are seeing good opportunities in the Irish market.  We could attract some of that money to Ireland.</p></speech>

It is primarily equity and it is coming from lots of different jurisdictions.  Invariably it is coming from types of investors who have not historically invested in real estate.  What is particularly attractive about real estate at the moment is the unique interest rate environment we are in.  Ten-year bond rates have sub-1% rates and real estate is throwing off 5% or 6%.  Comparatively, real estate looks attractive.  There is then the ability to leverage on it.  Real estate right across Europe is booming at the moment.  We are at a unique juncture because of the low interest rate environment.</p></speech>

At that particular point in time, when we look at who was doing the sale and leasebacks, invariably some of it was coming from the domestic banks.  I do not think it was a conscious decision to get out because the market looked like it was turning.  I think it was simply an effort to generate more liquidity which, in turn, they rolled out into more lending.  I do not think it was a conscious decision.  Some people will speculate and say it was the banks getting out of the Irish market because they could see what was coming down the tracks.  I think it is clear that that is not correct and that it was simply a decision to get out of real estate and to get equity in and to concentrate on their core business.</p></speech>

On the first page, underneath "OVERVIEW OF THE IRISH CRE MARKET", Ms Hunt states, "In Ireland's case, in the period up to 2008, these three distinct elements effectively merged....".  I am wondering what the significance of the three pieces coming together means for the property market in terms of a change and the dangers associated with that.</p></speech>

There are developers who provide the product, occupiers who occupy it and professional investors who come in and buy the income-producing asset to throw off returns.  In Ireland, because there was an availability of debt, many developers built the stock, got it let up, and then held onto it for their own personal investment.  That would be quite unusual.  We would have been asked consistently why there were not more shopping centres trading in Ireland given the amount we were building.  In most other markets, they would be built, let up and then sold on.  In Ireland, they were built, let up and then the developer held onto it as a personal investment and invariably used it to borrow and develop again.  That was quite unusual and that was what I was pointing out.</p></speech>

We were spending a huge amount of money in other jurisdictions but there was nobody investing here.</p>  <p>  That is not to say we did not have firms looking at Ireland from time to time if a particularly attractive asset became available for sale but they were usually out-bid by the local buyer, who was invariably bank-funded or debt-funded.  The pricing looked expensive relative to other cities.  The stamp duty was more than twice what it was in the UK, for example.

When a valuation is instructed, a professional valuer, working under the red book, can only value using the market value definition so they have to have regard to comparable evidence.  They would come to us to get the comparable evidence because we were tracking every single transaction.  It worked in that way.</p>  <p>  I understood the Deputy's question was, after the event, when the valuation is complete and submitted, did they then go back and cross-check and see, compared to subsequent transactions, whether that was fair.  My answer is, when a valuation is done, it is done, it is submitted to the client, the file is closed and one moves on.  One does not pick up the file and retrospectively check the valuations unless the client subsequently comes back and asks one to revisit that valuation for whatever purposes.</p></speech>

Is there not something of a contradiction?</p></speech>

When we are asked to do the valuation, the price has already been paid.  They have bought a piece of land and they need a valuation subsequently.  Again, I am not a valuer.  They go back and get a valuation instructed and that valuation is fed into the bank, and that is the end of that job.  One does not retrospectively open the file and go back and check the valuations after the event based on transactions that happened subsequently.  One's valuation is based on market evidence at that point in time based on recent historic comparables - transactions that have already happened.</p></speech>

Why would it not have been unusual?  Surely, a record year such as 2005, and a trebling of that the following year, would have provoked some thought?</p></speech>

I am saying, when one has a big jump in one country, invariably, if one looks across lots of different countries, it would not be unusual to see a similar pattern emerging because it is a global market.  Capital flows are global.  If it was a trebling in Ireland and that trend was not coming through in any other jurisdiction, it would have raised alarm bells, but if the entire market in lots of different countries was growing at a similar rate, it certainly would not have.</p></speech>

The previous witness was at pains on several occasions to point out that from the end of 2005 his company was recommending to some of its clients to disengage from the commercial property sector in Ireland.  Was there any such efforts by CBRE in terms of its clients in the Irish commercial property market?</p></speech>

It would not have been my job because I am not directly dealing with clients and not involved in transaction activity.

With the benefit of hindsight, and given what Jones Lang LaSalle's represented stated earlier and what Ms Hunt stated in her own testimony here in terms of relying on houses such as the IMF and ESRI, is there a need in the bigger firms, such as her own, Jones Lang LaSalle, DTZ, for more self-generated research as opposed to reliance on determining research from the average of all those houses that she and Mr. Moran mentioned earlier?</p></speech>

We all use different definitions.  There is huge duplication of effort.  We would love a central clearing system where we all supply our data into one source, it is cleansed and we get the aggregate back because it would avoid us engaging in a huge amount of duplication of effort.  As I said, invariably, when we issue our research, regardless of what we say, we are deemed to have a vested interest and it is thrown back at us.  It has been a completely thankless task.</p>  <p>  The UK market is miles ahead of us, in terms of the amount and the quality of data available, yet their investment property forum recently stated that if they are to prepare for the next property slowdown, they need access to better quality data and that should go across the lending institutions, the regulations, etc.  They say that, and they are light years ahead of us in terms of the quality and access to data that is available there.</p></speech>

There have been, I suppose, some efforts to improve it recently.  We have had provisions such as the property price register on the residential side which is hugely helpful.  We have the residential property price index now.  Both need some modifications to improve them even further, but they are a step in the right direction.</p>  <p>  We have a commercial lease database, created by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, but it is not really fit for purpose.  It does not really help us, from a transactional point of view.  What we need is a central clearing house where all the big firms supply their transactional information into one clearing house and the aggregate is brought back.  There are models for that right across Europe.  My colleagues in Paris tell me that they have a very good system working, for example, in the Paris region.  It would be quite easy to do.  It would avoid all of the major firms counting the same numbers and coming up with slightly different results because of definitions.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

Ironically, the syndicate model came out of Government tax policy.  When the first tax schemes were developed in the late 1990s, the syndicate model emerged and we began to see wealth management firms putting the syndicate model in place.  They were invariably to avail of tax reliefs in the first instance.  </p>  <p>         What happened is that some of those tax reliefs were subsequently removed or ring-fenced.  The syndicate model worked well because it was deemed that ordinary individuals who maybe did not have &euro;1 million to buy a commercial property in their own right could put money into a fund and through a pooled fund of money could get access to commercial real estate.  Otherwise it would have been too big a leap for them in their own personal capacity to get into commercial property. </p></speech>

Individuals could involve themselves at very minimal risk because of the numbers of people in a syndicate.  They could get involved in a small way in what happened to be a big syndicate and were therefore driving a market without any identifiable direct impact on themselves.</p></speech>

There was then a situation where lending became much more readily available and there was the emergence of the syndicate model.  So it brought a whole new pool of investors into commercial property that did not really know a lot about property.  It widened the cohort and it brought a lot of new players into the market.  We are now back at a situation where we are a more institutional market again so it is almost as if the cycle is coming through but it was very much fuelled by the debt situation, the availability of debt, the cost of that debt and, I suppose, access to opportunities overseas as well.</p></speech>

There was no listed vehicle so if they wanted to get into commercial property the only route they had was through an Irish Life fund or one of the various retail funds.</p></speech>

I would be interested in Ms Hunt's observations, as a major player in Ireland, on our ability to attract investment to the country, the issue of the availability of office accommodation, and the rent per square foot in Ireland vis-&agrave;-vis our competitors.  Has Ms Hunt any observations to make on those issues now?</p></speech>

We have continued to see FDI flowing in largely because of our corporate tax rate but I suppose what is unusual about Ireland is that for five years we built nothing so we now have this scenario where we have a huge surge of FDI flowing in and effectively very little office stock for them to locate in.   There is office availability but it is dotted in different places and most of these occupiers tend to want to be in Dublin 2 or Dublin 4 and the big issue is the scarcity of grade A stock, i.e., brand new stock that could be physically moved into in the morning.  The vacancy rate at the moment is about 2%.  Rents troughed out at about &euro;27.50 per square foot.  They are at &euro;47.50 or &euro;50 per square foot today.</p></speech>

I seem to recall that the Paris model that I have heard quite a bit about is solely funded by the Exchequer.  I do not think there is independent influence at all.

I am sure that all of the major top five firms that are spending time and efforts collating data would be delighted to pool it into one central source.</p></speech>

"Irish CRE generated average ungeared total returns of over 16.4% per annum in the period 1976 to 2006 (proving that commercial real estate is a long-term investment)".  A percentage of 16.4% was sustained for 30 years which leaves me wondering did we bailout the wrong sector.  We had a hugely valuable commercial investment for 30 years.</p></speech>

When one invests in commercial real estate one must be prepared for the long-haul.  It is not something one invests in only to divest in two or three years but over the long-term property performs well.  The difficulty we had in the Irish scenario is that the banks were funding on a short-term basis to effectively fund a long-term investment.  Possibly that contributed to the issue that we had.</p></speech>

This is just IPD data so this is just a barometer of the market.  It is a barometer only of institutionally-owned property and is not the market as a whole.

Is the model, which has been built over 100 years, far too slow?  Figure 3 shows that when real estate peaks at stage 7 it takes five more stages before the banks reverse their boom policy on loans.  That means what happened in Ireland was a quicker reaction than the 100-year study.</p></speech>

What we always would have said, in presenting this, is what one never knows is how quickly one will move around that cycle or how long one will be at any particular stage because in real estate things happen.  It could be a geopolitical issue or a financial issues that will trigger the crash or downturn in each case but it usually follows this pattern.  I think what would normally happen is that the market would begin to slow down, business in general would start to decline which one would see in the stock market and then, in reaction to that, the banks would make a move.</p></speech>

To some degree, one could say,  the single currency aided this because all of a sudden one could compare pricing in other jurisdictions.  People could see that there was better pricing to be had.  Also, the stamp duty regime here was extremely expensive so it was cheaper to go to other locations.  People like investing in property but there was very limited opportunity in Ireland to buy so by going to other jurisdictions they had access to product.</p></speech>

She stated that government intervention in the property market was largely done in the absence of any engagement whatsoever with the property industry.  Our evidence would be that the property industry never stops lobbying and tops the list seeking tax breaks, along with farmers.  In fact, the property industry received three tax breaks in 2011.  Let us remember the Galway tent and all of those kinds of things.</p></speech>

When some changes were brought in it was only after the event that it was realised they had unintended consequences and they were subsequently repealed.  The point we are making is, had there been intervention with property experts, initially, we might have been able to point out that if one removes a mortgage interest rate the likely impact is that rents might start to go up.  There was no engagement in testing the unintended consequences of some of these interventions.  Some of them were brought in and subsequently brought back out again when it was found that they were not working.</p></speech>

The extent of lending in Ireland certainly exacerbated the Irish scenario.  It was the global banking crisis that pulled the rug under, in terms of overnight funding disappearing so we could not get funding internationally but we could not get it domestically either and that was the position.</p></speech>

I think the penny had dropped with developers that we were building too much.  We were beginning to see that being reigned in.  The economic backdrop was strong.

Ms Hunt's company was commissioned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in June 2005 to make an independent valuation of the site and the figure it came up with was &euro;240 million.  In 2006 a consortium came together under the name Becbay Limited and purchased the site for &euro;412 million.  When CBRE was commissioned to come up with a valuation report for the banks in respect of Becbay Limited's offer, the company came in with exactly the same valuation of &euro;412 million for the site.  This is part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Ms Hunt is saying she would have seen the market as having peaked, yet here we have a transaction that was the mother of all transactions.  Did it feed into her overview?  She wrote in her review in January 2007, "It is now the duty of the development community in Ireland to adopt a realistic approach and put the brakes on the quantum of annual housing completions to avoid oversupply occurring in the medium term."

Having access to accurate and timely market information on trends and transactions is vital to CBRE in being able to accurately assess the commercial real estate market and provide the best qualitative and quantitative information to our clients.</blockquote>  <p>On 31 July 2006 Ms Hunt was quoted on the <i>businessworld.ie</i>website as saying:</p><blockquote>The second hand housing market is showing signs of price stabilisation but some new home buyers are getting nervous because of interest rate movements.  This is more indicative of a steady transition to more stable conditions than a sign of a crash or bubble bursting.</blockquote>  <p>On 17 April 2007 CBRE released a press statement that was highly critical of RTE's programme &quot;Future Shock&quot;, calling it &quot;irresponsible journalism&quot; and stating we should not be entertaining &quot;negative speculation and unfounded, worst-case doom and gloom scenarios when all that is being experienced is a levelling in the extraordinary pace of growth we previously experienced&quot;.  It went on to state the programme &quot;should be dismissed as fiction and a soft landing for the housing market is still possible and is the most likely scenario&quot;.  Ms Hunt stated at the time:</p><blockquote>It is simply technically incorrect to assume that Irish house prices will decline significantly simply on the basis that this has occurred in other economies where the fundamentals were so different.  It is also irresponsible to suggest that the &quot;negative equity&quot; scenario that occurred in the late 1980s in the UK could occur in Ireland...</blockquote>  <p>Did CBRE get it so wrong because the international research platform it had used was flawed?  If there were other reasons, what were they?</p></speech>

We were not selling houses, but our reaction to "Future Shock" was as strong as it was because the tenor of the programme was based on a number of "What if?" hypothetical scenarios.  We had already acknowledged in our reports that transactional activity had started to slow down, that development volumes were slowing down and that we were moving into the downward phase of the cycle, but we felt it was irresponsible to scaremonger, for want of a better word, by putting forth hypothetical scenarios.</p>  <p>  Three individual scenarios were posited on the RTE programme.  One was that Ireland was going to see a complete collapse of foreign direct investment, with no further multinational investment and many of the existing multinationals leaving.  We were very active in that space - it was a core part of our business - and did not see that scenario playing out and it did not happen.  The second scenario was that we were going to have a major collapse of construction activity in the economy.  That did happen, but it happened as an outcome of the downturn that occurred; it was not the reason house prices fell.  The third scenario was that there would be a very significant increase in interest rates.  While I would say the "Future Shock" programme was right in that it predicted there would be a crash, it did not predict there would be a global financial crisis which would lead to a crash.</p></speech>

That site was bought by a syndicate of rich people and Ms Hunt's company had organised the sale.  After the syndicate had held on to the site for four years, CBRE sold it on its behalf for a speculative gain of &euro;53 or &euro;54 million.  That speculative gain probably added &euro;100,000 to the price of each of the apartments built on the site, which would have had serious implications for first-time buyers.  It might well be the case that ten years of a 40 year mortgage will be spent paying for that speculative gain.  Does CBRE have a moral criterion or compass as to the social or ill effects of that level of speculation and profit seeking during the bubble which was facilitated by the company in a professional sense, with the associated stresses for young people and so on?  </p>  <p>               Did that enter into CBRE's considerations?</p></speech>

We are in the business of selling land.  That is our job.  We do not have a moral responsibility.  Land speculation happens in every single boom.  It is not down to firms such as ourselves to fix that because only government can do so.  It has been an issue since 1972, when the Kenny report was published.  We need to put a system in place that shares the benefit of rezoning decisions and speculation with the wider community and not just for the benefit of the owner of the land.  It is about time such a structure was put in place.  However, the political will has not been there to do so.  The only time we saw one step towards that was in the early 2000s when the rate of capital gains tax on land was effectively halved and that brought a lot of supply of land onto the market.  There was a threat that it was going to go up to 60% two or three years hence and that never happened.  There was a step towards doing something about it and then it was reined in, for whatever reason.  However, we are now at a critical juncture.  We are in the midst of a public consultation about site value tax and I think the opportunity might be there to revisit this issue.</p></speech>

I refer to several references in her submission to the necessity for a commercial property database.  The committee will consider this proposal when we come to make our recommendations.  I refer Ms Hunt to the commercial lease database which is in existence.  I ask her to expand on how that informed her work in the periods before 2009 and post-2009.  Has it made a difference to how she does her job?  Does she think there are weaknesses in the current structure?  For instance, we discussed the property database earlier.</p></speech>

I am trying to follow CBRE methodologies and definitions and that database does not give me the information I need.  It is like the example of knowing that house X sold for whatever price but not knowing whether it is a three-bed, four-bed or whether it has a garden.  On the commercial lease database it is completely irrelevant for me to know that CBRE are paying whatever rent if I do not know what size of a lease, what size of a take they have in terms of square foot, what is the length of the lease, the terms and conditions of that lease, if there is a user clause, etc.  None of that detail is available.  In some cases it might be.  I think there is also a reluctance on the part of certain people with a remit to give information to provide it to the database.  The form is cumbersome in that it needs three different entities, the actual landlord, the tenant and the solicitor, who all have to fill in a section of the report and nobody is quite sure who has the ultimate responsibility to send it in to the PSRA.  There is a lot of uncertainty about it.  It has not been user-friendly when I have logged on and tried to use it and it certainly has not given me results that I have been able to analyse in any meaningful way.</p></speech>

Colm McCarthy carried out research in the period 2000 to 2007 on rental data.  During that period the consumer price index rose by 13% while rental income rose by 240%.

I mean by prime is that when we are comparing apples with apples.  That was a prime unit on Grafton Street at that point in time and we tracked that headline rent over time.  It was a period in time when a significant number of UK multiples were coming in to the Irish market and invariably they all wanted to be on Grafton Street so there was more demand than supply.  It is a limited street so they were paying higher and higher rents.  It got to the point when we were at &euro;10,000 per square metre zone A  we were not dissimilar to the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es.  At that point we began to realise the benefit of being part of an organisation like CBRE is that one can compare and contrast apples with apples across different jurisdictions and it was obvious to us that this was overly expensive.  However, people were willing to pay that.  It is like the valuation argument in that once one or two tenants come in, they pay a very high rent and that becomes the new market rent for that street.  It is self-perpetuating.</p></speech>

If I remember correctly there was probably a two or three year period when they stayed quite flat at that level because that was obviously the peak.  They then began to taper off and they came back towards &euro;7,500, &euro;8,000 zone A.  Then they dropped like a stone and they fell all the way down to &euro;4,000 again.</p></speech>

Ms Hunt mentioned that the programme covered three issues she disagreed with, foreign direct investment, FDI, the construction downturn and interest rates.

In her statement, which described the programme as irresponsible journalism, dramatic and incorrect predictions, technically incorrect and so on and so forth - there is quite a bit of interesting language in the statement - she addressed her concerns only to the housing market.</p></speech>

Would that first-time buyer in April 2007 have been better off taking on board the sentiment expressed by "Future Shock" or the sentiment expressed by CBRE in Ms Hunt&rsquo;s press release?</p></speech>

We based it on the fundamentals of the market and the economic backdrop as we understood them.  We were also mindful of the huge cohort of people who had just bought a house.  If one's building is on fire, one needs to get everybody out in an orderly manner.  One does not want everybody panicking.  We had already said the market was beginning to slow down, things were levelling off.</p></speech>

Ms Hunt went on to say in her statement that would-be first-time buyers who had heeded equally dramatic and incorrect predictions in the past had lost out significantly, which would suggest she was saying they could lose out again.  I am struggling to understand why, from the point of view of CBRE, which is not involved in the housing market and has no expertise in that area or in respect of the stress testing by the Central Bank for negative equity that the press release mentions, it came out as one of the most vocal critics of "Future Shock", which predicted correctly a property crash, negative equity and problems in the housing and banking sector.  What was the driving force behind issuing such a strong press statement?</p></speech>

We felt very strongly that affecting sentiment or panicking people based on hypothetical scenarios that might ultimately arise was irresponsible.  That was the justification for our reaction.  In retrospect, what we now know is that they were right in the programme but they were not predicting a crash on the back of a global banking crisis.  They were predicting it for reasons that ultimately did not materialise.</p></speech>

As I said, hindsight is a great thing and we now know that the programme was correct.  The programme did not, however, say there is going to be a global financial crisis and debt funding in Ireland will disappear completely and as a result house prices will be halved.</p></speech>

The crash was going to happen regardless because of the increased prices in commercial property and housing property and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst.  The drying up of debt brought that on and some suggest that was to the benefit of the Irish State because investors would have continued to invest if that did not happen.  Ms Hunt seems to hold the contrary view that the reason for the crash was a global financial credit crunch.</p></speech>

That is the point I am making.  What exacerbated it was the global financial crisis because that was what completely removed debt from the market.

Is there any further information that Ms Hunt would like to put before the committee?  This might include examples of good practice here in Ireland or international ones that could be developed here.  The committee&rsquo;s work is as much about looking into the future and coming up with recommendations as it is about examining the past.</p></speech>

The first lesson is that having a property market that is wholly dependent on domestic investors and developers and primarily debt-funded by a small cohort of domestic banks is not sustainable and I hope we have moved away from those days.  In terms of Government intervention, there should be consultation with the industry before implementing policies to tease out the unintended consequences.  We have mentioned data on numerous occasions.  We need comprehensive data from an independent source and interaction with firms such as ours, which are tracking useful information because if we have that we might be able to spot trends and possible threats at an earlier juncture.</p>  <p>  I have been watching closely work done by the Investment Property Forum in the United Kingdom, UK.  It is a cohort of people involved in the property industry and they are doing a piece of research examining the next commercial real estate crash in the UK and how that might affect financial viability.  It has come up with some very interesting suggestions which we could possibly adopt here, one of which is giving consideration to setting up a central lending register whereby if borrower A goes to bank A the bank knows that borrower is also exposed to other banks-----</p></speech>

Having such a system in place might be quite useful.  The final recommendation is to go back to having no property specialists or chartered surveyors working in the banking industry, and no qualification that crosses the divide.  In my training as a chartered surveyor, I had no training whatsoever in banking and people doing banking and financial qualifications have no specialist training in commercial property.  </p>  <p>         They could well end up in a bank where their primary business is lending into commercial real estate without really understanding it.  As the committee will find from today, it is quite a complex area.  That could be a recommendation for the future, namely, that we put some sort of banking qualification in place where one can get training if one will be working in purely the area of providing funding to commercial real estate, which is quite specialist.  </p></speech>

I am aware that this committee has been monitoring the ongoing negotiations for a considerable period and that it has heard from many experts and interested parties.  It has clearly recognised the vital role it plays in understanding and communicating what will undeniably be a complex agreement when it emerges.  The committee heard just last week from EU trade Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m about the current state of play of the negotiations.  As an independent institution, I have no position for or against TTIP but what I would like to share today is my view of the current state of the transparency of the negotiations, and it was clear from questioning of the commissioner last week that this is a critical issue also for the committee.</p> <p>  Neither side of the debate around this issue disputes that its consequences will be significant for all of us and it is therefore vital that the public is made fully aware of what is involved in these talks and preferably long before the time comes for EU parliaments and the EU Parliament to vote in the event of a draft agreement being reached.  This has been my focus since I launched an inquiry into this matter in July of last year.  The TTIP inquiry was part of a series of strategic inquiries I opened proactively in the second half of 2014.  Others covered the EU's Cohesion Fund policy, the transparency commitments of the European Medicines Agency, the independence and balance of the expert groups that advise on EU legislation and issues around the forced return of irregular migrants.</p> <p>  As the committee knows, TTIP is heralded as a potential game-changer, the biggest bilateral free trade agreement in history, a deal of geostrategic importance and one that may set the standard for future regional and global trade agreements.  In its most ambitious form, the TTIP agreement could result in a transatlantic single market, with binding rules in a wide range of areas.  Given the potential impact of TTIP on the lives of 500 million European citizens, I decided to focus my attention on how this trade deal is being negotiated, while recognising the special democratic responsibility of elected representatives at European and national levels in scrutinising the negotiations on behalf of their constituents.  I should point out how active MEPs have been in seeking to assert their rights of scrutiny and I commend this committee on its increasing involvement and vigilance also in this regard.</p> <p>  Transparency is vital in this area, no matter what view is taken of TTIP.  Transparency promotes public trust and shows that there is nothing to hide.  Some TTIP champions are concerned that the debate has been marred by misinformation and that people should decide based on the facts.  It stands to reason, therefore, that the public should be given the facts by giving them access to the documents that contain them.  Transparency makes for informed debate and an informed debate is vital if these talks are to enjoy legitimacy.  Transparency also makes good practical sense.  An informed debate should lead to a better agreement in substance.  As the European Commission has made more and more documents available, the TTIP debate has been increasingly focused on the substance of the agreement.  This is as it should be.  The more transparent the negotiations are, the more the public, stakeholders and experts will be able to provide meaningful input.</p> <p>  Proactive transparency makes even better practical sense.  I have been calling on the Commission to make as much information and as many documents as possible available proactively.  We should not wait for people to ask for them, and if we are to give access to a document, it should be done sooner rather than later.  The public wants to see these documents.  Citizens are increasingly aware that TTIP could produce rules that impact on them in a manner analogous to how legislation impacts on them.  They are keenly aware of the impact this agreement will have.  I am not, of course, calling for absolute transparency.  The Commission needs to create a context in which it can negotiate effectively with the US on TTIP, so as to deliver the best possible deal for the Union and its citizens.  This may mean that the Commission can legitimately keep confidential certain information and documents, at least during certain stages of the negotiations.  However, exceptions to the general principle of disclosure must be properly explained and justified.</p> <p>  The Commission has responded well to my inquiry.  A great and increasing number of fact sheets, position papers, meeting agendas and other items are now freely available online and it is clear that the new Commission has correctly intuited that without the maximum possible transparency, the struggle to complete and ratify the trade deal will be immeasurably more difficult.  Transparency is not an abstract ideal; it is a simple business imperative.  I have commended the efforts it has made to make these talks transparent and accessible and I acknowledge that we are moving out of an era when traditional methods of conducting international trade negotiations are characterised by confidentiality and limited public participation.  Well over a year into the TTIP negotiations, for example, the Council had not publicly disclosed the negotiating mandate, or the document on the basis of which it had asked the Commission to negotiate this agreement on our behalf.  It did so only after pressure from many actors, including my office, and long after it was freely available in leaked form through Google.  The Commission knows better than most that the traditional approach is ill-equipped to generate the legitimacy needed in such high stakes talks.  As the committee is well aware, we live in an era where public expectations of transparency are high and where social media and other information technologies do not just fuel that expectation but also either through leaks, inspired searching, or illegal hacking can break down the secrecy barriers in a manner never before experienced.  It is a modern reality and a new player in trade talks that has to be accommodated.</p> <p>  I remain convinced that more can be done in the coming months to increase public awareness of the content and implications of TTIP, and particularly when consolidated texts of EU and US positions come close to being finalised.  I have therefore urged the Commission to explore with the US what more can be done in this area.  The EU and US need to examine together what can be made available.  A critical point will be reached when draft consolidated texts on various parts of the agreement become available.  I must say, however, at this point that while much of our focus has been correctly on the Commission, it is actually leading by example on this matter.  The inquiry I carried out concerned not only transparency but also public participation in the process.  Linked to this is the issue of lobbying around TTIP.  Overwhelmingly, the public have called for the EU to be more transparent about its contacts with business representatives when it comes to TTIP.  Rightly or wrongly, there is a perception that this deal is primarily for large private interests and that they have privileged access when it comes to shaping the deal.  I have not seen any evidence of this but I did make a number of suggestions to the Commission to promote balanced and transparent public participation.  I called for increased transparency around meetings that Commission officials hold on TTIP with business organisations, lobby groups and non-government organisations.  Also of importance is the content of what interest representatives discuss with the Commission and the documents they exchange with it.  These should, as far as possible, be made public.</p> <p>  I met Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m in Brussels in February to discuss the need for more transparency in the negotiations.  We agreed that this is another example of how the EU is moving away from its technocratic past and toward a much more political space.  That is to be welcomed, as the major decisions being made in Brussels on behalf of Europe should be the outcome of a political process, which in turn should be the outcome of the political preferences of the voters.  Whether the Commission will win the hearts and minds of Europeans on TTIP is yet to be seen.</p> <p>  In concluding, I will briefly comment on the general issue of lobbying at the EU level.  As we know, lobbying in Brussels is now a multi-million euro business, and multi-billion euro legislative issues are at stake.  Lobbying is of course a vital and essential part of our democracy, our freedoms and our right as citizens to make representations to those empowered to make decisions that will affect individual lives, as well as those of businesses big and small.</p><p> As citizens, we also have the right and should have the freedom to be made aware of who is lobbying and to trust that it is done in a transparent and regulated way.  A failure to allow the citizen to see how outcomes emerge is a denial of the fundamental right of participation.  That is why I have also focused on issues such as whistleblowing in EU institutions, conflicts of interest and lobbying transparency in general.  The Oireachtas has recently agreed a new lobbyist register, which I very much welcome.  It is commendable that the Irish Parliament is showing leadership in Europe in this area.  At EU level, the transparency register is not yet mandatory and is only a co-operation agreement between the Commission and Parliament.  I have called on the Council of Ministers to participate also and to meet only registered lobbyists.  The EU administration continues to struggle to secure the high levels of popular legitimacy it desires.  It must continue to strive to achieve the gold standard of integrity, transparency and accountability.  My job is to help it in that task.</p></speech>

As she said, TTIP is of great concern to the committee.  Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr&ouml;m was before the committee just last week and we had a good and robust debate.  We had previously published a political contribution which we sent to the European Commission last June, which is nine months ago.  We received a response last week.  In our contribution we outlined some of the concerns Members across the Houses have in relation to issues such as the need for it to be a mixed agreement.  Many of us are concerned about the potential impact on agriculture, in particular the beef industry.  However, we note that some other parts of the agriculture sector, including the dairy industry, stand to gain.  With the removal of the milk quota this week, there is potential for our dairy farmers to gain greatly from TTIP.</p> <p>  Of great concern for many of us in the Houses is the investor dispute settlement mechanism and how we deal with it.  I am interested to know whether the Ombudsman considers that there has been sufficient discussion about that in the public sphere.  We have noticed the improvement in transparency around the negotiations and that is thanks not just to parliaments like ours publishing political contributions but also organisations and institutions like the Ombudsman's.  She is right that there will be a difficulty for the Commission in getting people to buy into TTIP unless there is greater transparency, so we all welcome that.</p> <p>  In terms of lobbying, I thank the Ombudsman for her comments on how this Parliament is leading in relation to our lobbying work.  It is legislation my party thought it was essential to introduce.  It is one of the things we set out to achieve at the beginning of our term of office and I am glad to see it is concluded.</p></speech>

It was a tremendous achievement.  I was in Brussels when Ms O'Reilly was lobbying to be elected to one of the few really elected democratic appointments in Europe.  Commissioners are appointed by Governments although MEPs are elected.  From the point of view of the prestigious position Ms O'Reilly has, it was a marvellous achievement and came on the back of tremendous work as Ombudsman in Ireland.  She had a great record and we miss her presence here.  We are delighted that she went to another field in which she can show her merit.</p> <p>  I have no question that what she is doing is commendable.  She is taking an interest without being pushed to do it.  She sees the need to get involved in this particular transatlantic agreement.  I am delighted that she is aware of the questioning here with the Commissioner.  She will be very aware of the interest here, which primarily relates to agriculture and the beef trade.  That is what it boils down to.  We want to ensure that there is a level playing pitch.  We hope the Ombudsman can ensure that when an agreement is reached, the highest standards are adhered to and that there will be fairness in relation to hormones in beef in America and the whole question of genetically modified foods.  The last day we were here the Commissioner said there was agreement with Canada.  I had not been aware of the details of that agreement and I am not sure how much detail was given in relation to the Canadian-EU agreement, but the point was made here that there was two-tier export from Canada.  One tier relates to non-treated or hormonal cattle and the other ones are excluded.  I asked what kind of supervision we had in relation to ensuring that what is exported from Canada complies with the requirements of the European Union.  The Ombudsman knows the standards that are there.  I come from an organic farm background.  My wife and son are involved in farming and I know how many inspections take place.  From an organic point of view, everything is inspected on a regular basis.  One cannot spread nitrogen on the land and has drug restrictions.  That is all great, but we cannot compete with the big ranchers in the USA who can produce beef more cheaply.</p> <p>  That is a fundamental aspect of the whole agreement and I am delighted the Ombudsman is there to keep an eye on ensuring things are done openly and transparently.  It is very useful from the point of view of Ireland, the Government and the committees of the Houses.  I have great confidence in the Ombudsman's ability and strength of character to ensure that the details come out in the best interests of each member state.</p></speech>

It is a great honour for Ireland and represents a recognition of the work she completed here.  I wish her well and thank her for engaging with the committee.</p> <p>  I am minded to recall a body of work we did here at the committee in the aftermath of losing the first Lisbon referendum.  We were trying to establish why the Irish people had chosen on that occasion not to support what appeared to be a treaty that was in Ireland's best interests.  One of the issues that was debated ties into what the Ombudsman has spoken about today, which is the notion of a democratic deficit within the institutions of the European Union.  I have always felt that there is no democratic deficit, but if there is a perception of one, it is as important as the reality.  There are all sorts of means by which people are elected or appointed and there is a trace back which is based on democratic principles.  The work the Ombudsman can do and is already doing to ensure greater transparency is the strongest way to remove the notion of a democratic deficit.  If the output at the end of the day appears and is fair and it is clear how decisions are arrived at, it is going to take away any question marks over the people who have made those decisions.  How they came to be in the position is irrelevant if they are seen to work in the best interests of all the citizens of Europe.  There is a very important strand to what the Ombudsman does in terms of increasing or improving the recognition of what the institutions do and giving people a better belief that the institutions are there for them rather than for the preservation of the institutions in themselves.  That is really good work.</p> <p>  The fact that the Ombudsman has decided to carry out the investigation on TTIP is important from an Irish perspective as Senator Leyden has said.  It affects every community, whether through small businesses, multinationals, traded services and, in particular, the agriculture sector.  Ireland is one of those countries where almost everything in TTIP has a relevance for almost every community.  That is because we are so dependent on agriculture and foreign direct investment.  It has a chance to open up the institutions to the Irish public and hopefully improve the Irish electorate's understanding of how decisions are taken and how they impact.  We will have to see whether it is of benefit but we can at least consider how it will impact on the lives of those affected.  That is the first point.</p> <p>  The second point deals with the lobbying issue.  In general, lobbying is poorly understood.  Perhaps there is good reason for that given the history in the State and, elsewhere across all political parties, including my own, as to how decisions were taken and whether they were appropriately connected to certain individuals.</p><p>It is really important that the European Ombudsman continue that work and to try to improve the way in which lobbying is managed and understood.  She will not need me to tell her that there is a perception that where a lobbyist is involved, something corrupt is going on.  She rightly says lobbying is an important part of how business is done in Europe and elsewhere and that appropriate structures need to be put in place.  I was quite surprised to hear that there was not a European register.  Is any country more advanced than Ireland in registering lobbyists?  The system is very advanced in the United States.  Perhaps the Ombudsman might give more detail of what is in place in this area in Europe and indicate when more appropriate structures might come into being to deal with the perception that lobbying is all bad.</p></speech>

I should have read my documentation in advance of coming to the meeting, but I did not so.  Therefore, I will ask baby questions.  </p> <p>  Whom does the Ombudsman represent?  Is it MEPs, the European Parliament or national parliaments?  How does she represent 28 countries in Europe?  </p> <p>  The Ombudsman spoke about the TTIP trade agreement between Europe and America.  Did she decide to carry out the investigation to achieve transparency in the debate?  In a general sense, can she pick a topic to investigate or is she asked to do so by a particular organisation or structured grouping?  In other words, who can call on her services?  I would have thought an ombudsman would look at the pros and cons of an argument, or the fairness of something, and decide one way or another.  Does she initiate the work or is there a pathway to her office?</p> <p>  There are 500 million people in Europe and 28 countries with different levels of parliamentary democracy.  To whom does the Ombudsman make her reports?  Are they invariably sent to those who initiate action by her or are they sent to the Parliament?  </p> <p>  I am sorry for the baby questions, but, as I said, I did not have time to read the documentation provided.</p></speech>

I agree with her on the importance of transparency as it produces more informed debate and better agreement.  She spoke about allowing access to certain documents while needing to keep others confidential.  Who decides and how do they decide which documents can be shown and which are kept confidential?</p> <p>  The United States, as the other stakeholder, has its positioning papers.  What access is there to these documents?  Is there a breakdown of the interested sectors such as the environment, agriculture, transport, etc?  I understand that, for example, the head of the agriculture sector would have to give agreement, as would the European Council.  Will the Ombudsman tell us exactly what information can be provided?  The United States has a much larger lobbying industry.  Do we have any access to the meetings that have been held on the TTIP negotiations?</p> <p>  Do cases cross the Ombudsman's desk of citizens impacted on by European law which has not yet been transposed into national law by national parliaments?  I understand there was a case in Italy in the 1990s when there were delays in transposing EU law into national law and a citizen felt it should not impact on them until such time as it had been transposed.</p></speech>

Can the Ombudsman give us a flavour of her office, its structures, the reporting mechanisms and the number of staff she has?  Will she give us a short overview of how the office works?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.857" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015040200002#D00500"><p>I will begin with the baby questions.  I asked lots of baby questions when I set out to be elected the year before last.  </p> <p>  The European Ombudsman works in the same way as the national Ombudsman in Ireland.  A person is elected or appointed and becomes an independent officer.  The Ombudsman has recommendatory powers.  I am not a judge and nobody has to do what I say.  In most ombudsman's offices, particularly in western Europe, the large majority of recommendations are accepted.  In this country the figure is over 90%, while elsewhere in Europe it is 82% or 83%.</p> <p>  Access to the Ombudsman is free and the process is the same as that in Ireland.  A citizen can complain to me about something related to an EU institution.  For example, if a person runs a business in Ireland and has a contract with the Commission and something goes wrong in being paid or there are delays in payment, he or she must first go to the Commission.  If it is not sorted out there, he or she comes to me.  I look at the records, ask the parties for their comments and then make a recommendation.  I will either not uphold the complaint or uphold the complaint and suggest a remedy.  I can also ask the Commission to make changes in its general processes.</p> <p>  I was asked about how I decided on initiatives such as the TTIP investigation.  The office is a small one, with some 65 officials split between Strasbourg and Brussels.  When I came into it, I decided that I wanted to make it more relevant, more useful and more visible.  I have the power, as does the Ombudsman in Ireland, of own initiative.  In other words, I do not have to wait for a complaint to come across my desk.  I can look at a case in which there is a suggestion, for example, that there may be a systemic problem.  I do not just decide by myself.  In the past year I have probably met 60 groups, including NGOs, business groups, parliamentarians and MEPS, and went before various committees.  I drew up a list of issues on which I could make a useful intervention.  I followed three criteria, one of which was that an issue should be of significant public importance.  The second was that it should be doable - there would be no sense in me promising to climb a mountain if nothing was going to happen at the end of the process.  The third criterion was that I could add something useful that others could not.  In other words, if the Court of Auditors was working on something, or the European Court of Justice or MEPs, it would be a waste of resources for me to become involved.</p> <p>  I started work in October 2013 when the TTIP was already up and running as an issue.  As we had received quite a few complaints related to transparency - that is how they refer to freedom of information - I decided that I would open an own initiative investigation into it.  We decided we would engage in a small public consultation process and I wanted the people who would engage with me in it to define their terms.  If they said they were not seeing enough or something was not transparent enough, I wanted to know what they meant.  What would be a reasonable level of transparency in the context of negotiations?  Once we had received our response and carried out our own investigation of Commission records, I made recommendations to the Commission in a number of areas.</p><p>I have to say that the work was helped by the change of Commission, not that this is a reflection on the last one.  The new Commission had been observing how the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP negotiations were going and, to their surprise, observed the level of civil society interest in this.  I think the Commissioners were quite taken aback, particularly by the level of engagement around investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS and the opposition to it.  The new Commission had a simple choice to make - to remain as secretive as the last one or to open up a bit.  They clearly made a decision to open up.  I read back over the transcript of this committee's questioning of Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m last week and listened to the interview with her on &quot;This Week&quot;.  She clearly sees that transparency is vital if people want to get this across the line.<br/><br/>I report to the European Parliament and that is it.  I do not take instructions from anybody else, nor can the Parliament tell me what to investigate.  Just as I worked very well, I hope, with the Irish Parliament when I was national Ombudsman, I do my best to work very co-operatively with the European Parliament.  That was how I decided to open up investigations on key areas.  Whistleblowing was a big one, TTIP another.  The expert groups are groups of independent, industry and other experts that are chosen primarily by the Commission to advise it on legislation.  It is very important that those groupings are seen to be balanced and so on.<br/><br/>On the question of whether there is sufficient discussion around ISDS, the Commission itself was surprised by the huge volume of responses it got to its public consultation, it was something like 165,000.  A lot of them were automated - they got something like 30,000 individual responses.  I have read and listened closely to what Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m has said to that and I think she is trying to deconstruct the model that is used globally and create an EU-friendly model.  There has been a lot of disquiet about the way in which judges in international ISDS arbitration have a revolving door, in that one minute they are judges and the next they are corporate lawyers.  It is not always transparent as to how they are appointed and so on.  Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m is struggling between trying to balance out what might be perceived as the need for this sort of mechanism to calm the fears of potential investors, against the very palpable concern about how these disputes are litigated.<br/><br/>On agriculture, I understand how big an issue this is, particularly for this country and presumably also for other EU member states for whom agriculture is very important.  One of the big issues around this discussion is the dropping of standards.  Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m and her US counterpart have been at pains to say this is not in fact the case, and that it is about making regulation easier and better, not dropping standards such as those Senator Leyden discussed.  This is where committees such as this one and individual representatives such as the Deputies and Senators come into play.  While I can do my bit to try to get the records out, public representatives can read and interpret them and mediate them to their constituents.  There will be massive spin on both sides regarding this but my piece is simply to make as sure as I can that people have sufficient records and documentation.  They are easily accessible now on the Commission website and the Commission is making strenuous efforts to make them as user-friendly as possible.  <br/><br/>Somebody mentioned the US documents and this is the tricky part of the puzzle.  Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m can with great authority and excellent <i>bona fides</i>say that she will do her bit to make things as transparent as possible.  She sees it as a business imperative anyway and is not just doing it for the sake of the abstract good of transparency.  The US has a different view and it is entirely legitimate for them to have this.  There are two stakeholder groups comprising consumer groups and other bodies, one in the US and one in the EU.  They get access to what is called a reading room - they can go in, look at documents that ordinary citizens could not see and take notes.  However it is never quite clear to me what exactly they are supposed to do with that information afterwards because they cannot make it public.I understand the US is creating some availability through its embassies for elected representatives to see these documents, although I am not completely clear on this.<br/><br/>I have made the point that the critical moment will be when the consolidated texts come.  At present the EU is putting forward its position, as is the US, on things like agriculture, pharmaceuticals, financial services and so on.  When some sort of draft agreement hovers into view and there is a consolidated text, the issue of whether that will be made public or made available to public representatives will arise.  The view of the US is slightly more hard line than that of the EU and, in the past, the EU has made assurances that it will not release any documents from the US if the US says not to.  What I say is that once a document becomes an EU document, it is subject to the transparency law of the EU, which is Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001, the equivalent of our Freedom of Information Act.  It is not enough for the US to say no - it has to give a legitimate reason or rationale as to why it is saying no and then a decision has to be taken.<br/><br/>For the moment, there is a lot available on the Commission website - any number of fact sheets and position papers.  What happens when it gets to more critical points, when the two sides come closer together, is what concerns me.  Most people will not be interested in reading a lot of this stuff because it is complicated and that is why it is important that committees such as this one, individual Deputies, civil society and business groupings who have the capacity and interest to read the documents do so and mediate them to them people.  It is unclear whether the individual parliaments are going to vote on this as well.</p></speech>

Here, agriculture could be a big thing, workers' standards, all sorts of things.  The more information is got out there now as opposed to it all coming in a big bang, the better.</p> <p>  Regarding lobbying in the US and EU, I took part in a joint committee hearing about lobbying at the European Parliament last week.  There was a presentation given by a Trinity College Dublin professor who has done a lot of empirical research on lobbying.  He graded the EU countries and institutions on lobbying and we fell in the middle grade.  This would be before the transparency register was set up.  Depending on what happens with that, we could move into a higher register.  As Deputy Byrne said, different countries have different cultures and views of these things.  In some countries they are known as the anti-corruption register while other countries do not have them at all.  We do have them and this Commission has taken a much harder line on people even voluntarily signing up for it.  It is made much easier if people do so.</p><p>There is a further incentive in that Commissioners and their <i>cabinets</i>only meet with people who are on the transparency register.  The issue, again, is how these matters are enforced and whether the information available is accurate.  The United States is very evolved in terms of its lobbying and is at a very high level in this regard.  However, there is also the other issue in that country of political funding and all of that, which drives a lot of the political play there.<br/><br/>In regard to how one obtains the documents, it would probably be done online.  It might be worth making contact with the US Embassy here to see what access can be given within this State to US documents.<br/><br/>On the transposition of EU law, that is probably more an issue for the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions, which deals with what is happening in member states.  My remit relates to the EU institutions and the European Court of Justice.</p></speech>

We have a letter from Mr. Maro&scaron; &Scaron;efovi, Vice President of the European Commission, in which he points out that while the Commission considered the Peru and Colombia agreements to be EU-only agreements, the Council designated them as mixed agreements.  Mr. &Scaron;efovi further notes that it is likely the Council will also consider the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, as a mixed agreement.  That is what he is telling national parliaments and we all hope it will be the case.</p></speech>

Against a background of extensive regulation and monitoring of those regulations, there is a desire to do away with that and have a more standard form.  Taking the pharmaceutical industry in Ireland as an example, in order to get a plant up and running, it is necessary to go through various very sophisticated preparatory procedures with the American Food and Drug Administration, FDA.  A friend of mine who runs such a plant, which I will not name, tells me there is more dread of inspections by the Irish Medicines Board, IMB, than by the FDA.  One assumes, then, that the IMB has a higher level of standards applying to the production of drugs compared with the FDA.  Ms O'Reilly referred to the dropping of standards.  How do we monitor what is going on in the negotiations, which seem to have led to a situation where instead of the lowering of standards to make it easier to trade, we have instead achieved the implementation of the highest possible standard?  Is there a role for Oireachtas committees to examine these matters as part of their EU scrutiny remit?  Is there a mechanism whereby one might identify which standard will be adopted in pharmaceutical production, for instance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.864" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Emily O'Reilly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015040200002#F00400"><p>Theoretically, there should be such a mechanism.  I take the Deputy's point about the Irish Medicines Board and the varying standards.  Of course, there is also the European Medicines Agency, which licenses drugs that are being marketed generally in Europe.  The pharmaceuticals issue is one of the big-ticket items in the negotiations on the TTIP and there is understandable concern everywhere about what will emerge at the end.  It is important for people who take an interest in these matters to monitor what the Commission is producing in order to secure access from the US to its documents and records.  There are several very active civil society groups, very often peopled by scientists and industry players - people who know, one hopes, what they are talking about - which are monitoring these issues very carefully.</p> <p>  Somebody made the point recently that despite all the material on the Commission's website, very few people are reading it.  In a way it does not matter how many people read it; it is more a question of ensuring the right people read it.  Therefore, it is very important that if this committee, for example, is taking an interest in this matter, that members read the material or get people they know who are experts in this area to read and explain it, as most of us would require it to be explained, and then feed that into their deliberations.  It is very important that this starts to happen now because by the time it gets to the end game, it will be too late.  A lot of the material is very complicated and it also depends on who is mediating what is there.  There could, for instance, be a section of a pharmaceutical joint protocol which states that X, Y and Z are agreed.  However, one side might say, "This is great, it means such and such", while the other might say, "No, actually it means something else".  Nothing is ever simple but what is important is not the numbers of people looking at this but that there is sufficient information out there for the people who are informed to be able to advise people like the committee members.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the great interest of the committee in the matter, which builds on the foundational work of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements towards achieving a truly reconciled, peaceful, stable and prosperous island of Ireland.  I greatly value the work of the committee and the role of the Chairman in the provision of parliamentary oversight of this important area.  This is my first opportunity to appear before the committee to consider these matters.</p><p>Shortly after I took office in the summer of last year, it became apparent to me that the Northern Ireland Executive was at a political impasse, for a variety of reasons.  The immediate context was the failure to find agreement on reform of the welfare system and on a budget.  These difficulties arose in a context where there  were a number of other political issues outstanding from the inconclusive but nevertheless important Haass talks of 2013, dealing with the legacy of the past, parades and flags.  There had been some political consideration of the Haass issues between January and July 2014, until the party leaders talks were suspended as part of the so-called &quot;graduated response&quot; by Unionists to a parading decision in north Belfast.  The North-South Ministerial Council which had been scheduled for the first week of July was subsequently also postponed.</p><p>By September last year, the clear message from a number of the parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, SDLP, and the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, was that all-party talks, with the direct involvement of both Governments, were required if the political impasse was to be broken and the Northern Ireland political institutions stabilised.  It appeared to me that there was potential for a range of issues to be unlocked if they were addressed in a holistic manner which recognised the sometimes implicit, and sometimes explicit, links between them.  For this reason, when the First Minister Peter Robinson wrote an opinion editorial article in the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>in September calling for Government intervention, our firm position was that the resulting talks must embrace a  broader agenda than just welfare and budgetary matters, as important as these were to the Northern Ireland Executive and to the British Government.  In particular, the talks presented an important opportunity to address the inconclusive Haass issues, especially the legacy of the past, and outstanding commitments from previous agreements.</p><p>This committee needs no lessons in the damaging consequences of a failure to address the legacy of the past.  It has visited the North on a number of occasions and meets with key stakeholders on a regular basis.  Incidentally, for any future visits, my officials in Armagh and Belfast would be very happy to assist with the arrangements in any way possible.  I know the Chairman will avail of that opportunity and I encourage him to do so.  During the week last October that the political talks began in Belfast this committee heard a very stark account by the Northern Ireland Community Relations Council of the mood on the ground across communities in Northern Ireland.  At that time, the committee expressed grave concerns at the lack of progress in community relations in Northern Ireland and urged both Governments, as guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, to engage proactively to consolidate reconciliation on the ground<b>.</b>The Irish Government entered the talks with this goal in mind.  Together with the British Government, we proposed that talks should start with the twin aims of advancing the reconciliation agenda and economic renewal.</p><p>These are some of the considerations that informed our position throughout the 11 weeks of talks in Belfast.  The talks were intensive and, at times, very challenging.</p><p>This was only natural in discussions that addressed what we believe a truly reconciled and prosperous Northern Ireland should look like.  There were many voices which did not believe that the talks could deliver an agreement, but Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political leaders, with the support of the two governments, ultimately demonstrated the will and the sense of compromise needed to overcome such challenges. </p><p> The Stormont House Agreement covers a broad range of political, social and economic issues and has the potential to advance significantly its twin aims of reconciliation and economic renewal.  Very importantly, the Agreement establishes a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past.  These mechanisms have the potential to transform how we address the legacy of the past, by providing us with new and better tools to carry out investigations, to share stories, to retrieve lost information and, above all, to heal wounds.</p><p> The Agreement sets out a plan for financial and budgetary reform.  It proposes a way forward on flags, identity, culture and tradition through the setting up of a commission.  It envisages the devolution of responsibility for parades to the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It establishes a programme of institutional reform at Stormont and progresses a number of outstanding aspects from the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.</p><p> The Agreement also made provision for important steps in North-South co-operation, some of which have already been taken.  In line with the Agreement, a report on new sectoral priorities for North-South co-operation was brought to the North-South Ministerial Council institutional meeting on 25 February in Belfast.  This will also be a standing agenda item for future institutional meetings within the North-South Ministerial Council.  It was also agreed at that meeting that the relevant Ministers from both the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive will meet in May in the north west to discuss a future strategic approach to that region. </p><p> Due to the priority being attached to the talks during the autumn, I was unfortunately not in a position to come before this committee to discuss the outcomes of the two plenary meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council which I attended last year.  The first of these was on 3 October in Dublin Castle and the second on 5 December in Armagh.  Consistent with the last number of years, the challenging economic environment provided an important context for our discussions at these meetings, as well as efforts that are being made to co-operate to support economic recovery, the creation of jobs, the best use of public funds and the most effective delivery of services for citizens.  Another key discussion point was the opportunity for greater collaboration in drawing down EU funding.  Other important discussions included the north west and child protection and e-safety.  I will be happy to return before the committee following the next plenary meeting, which is scheduled to take place in June, to discuss North-South matters in greater detail.</p><p> The Stormont House Agreement is an important achievement, but its true value will be measured by our success in its implementation.  In many ways the months we spent negotiating the Agreement were only the beginning of the work.  Our focus in the period ahead will be to ensure that its potential is fully realised.  In this regard, the Stormont House Agreement stands out from some previous agreements in having a very clear, formalised structure to guide its implementation.  This includes quarterly review and implementation meetings, six-monthly published progress reports and a collectively agreed implementation timetable that gives us a detailed timeframe to plan our work. </p><p> The first two implementation and review meetings have already taken place.  I attended the second review meeting last week in Belfast.  It was a useful opportunity to take stock of the progress we have made over the last three months.  Implementing the Agreement requires intensive, complex work but we are making steady progress across a range of areas, not least in setting up the framework on the past.  Officials from Dublin, Belfast and London meet regularly to take forward this work, while Northern Ireland&rsquo;s party leaders meet weekly to consider their responsibilities under the Agreement.</p><p> The implementation process is not without challenges; such a process never is.  In recent weeks, the party leaders have faced their first challenge in this regard, in respect of welfare.  In my contacts with them, I have encouraged all parties to stand back and consider the overall potential benefit for the people of Northern Ireland offered by the Stormont House Agreement and to ensure that its potential is fully achieved.  I know that work is ongoing by the party leaders in Northern Ireland to resolve the welfare issue.  I understand that a measure of progress is being made, albeit not as rapidly as we might all wish.  It is very important that the current impasse on welfare does not negatively affect the implementation timetable in other areas and issues.</p><p> The success of the Agreement is contingent upon the faithful implementation of the totality of its provisions.  During the months of January and February, the five parties in the Northern Ireland Executive did very good work in advancing the implementation across a number of strands of the Agreement.  Our collective objective must be to build on that good work of partnership and to maintain forward momentum.  </p><p> In the period ahead, the Agreement will shape the Government&rsquo;s approach to Northern Ireland and will dictate much of our work on the matter of that agenda.  The Houses of the Oireachtas will have an important role to play regarding the implementation, as legislation will likely be required to set up some of the mechanisms to deal with the legacy of the past as contained in the Agreement.  The Department of Justice and Equality will take a lead the first instance in preparing such legislation.   </p><p> The Irish Government remains fully committed to playing our part in furthering genuine reconciliation and accelerating economic renewal across the island of Ireland.  This is our ambition and I believe the Stormont House Agreement provides us with the map to achieve this.  I wish to acknowledge the Chairman's work in this regard and the work of the committee.  I continue to urge the committee to ensure a positive and active programme in the form of relations between this committee and its colleagues in the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive and the people of Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

At the outset of his presentation he refers to the involvement of both governments and the necessity for them to have a hands-on approach in what are at times delicate situations surrounding the implementation of the Agreement.  The Minister is involved in putting in place an implementation plan for the outstanding issues and that is very welcome.  If there is a down-side to all of this, it is that there is no Unionist participation in this committee.  It would be very beneficial to everyone if they did take part.  Unfortunately, they have not done it as of yet.  I also compliment the chairperson and other chairpersons for the work they have done in respect of outreach into communities in the Six Counties, in particular, going into the most affected areas, be they loyalist or Nationalist or republication areas.  All of that is very important.  Last week, we had people from a UVF background here.  This is a useful exercise because it is only by dialogue and listening to people that we can help to resolve it.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about legislation which will be required to establish some of the mechanisms to deal with the legacies of the past.  Does he have a timetable for that legislation?  Will there be similar legislation in both the North and the South?  Will this committee be consulted in advance in respect of the status of the legislation?  </p> <p>  The Irish language issue, the bill of rights, the Pat Finucane inquiry and other outstanding issues have not been resolved.  These issues were not part of the talks.  Have provisions been made to deal with these issues?  Will the Dublin-Monaghan bombings be part of the mechanism to deal with the legacies of the past?  Is there a commitment from the British Government on dealing with the legacies of the past?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.878" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015040200002#D00300"><p>I thank Deputy Ferris for his comments.</p><p>This is a matter for the Department of Justice and Equality.  Work has commenced on the legislation.  I expect it will be enacted to allow for its operation in 2016.  I expect the heads of the Bill to be published later in the summer.  With regard to the consultative process, the Deputy is aware that, like all items of legislation, the Bill will go to the appropriate committee in the first instance, the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and discussion.  Given the important role of this committee, I imagine it is possible in these circumstances for contact to be made between the Chairman of this committee and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for participation.  In the circumstances, such an arrangement is appropriate.  As far as publication is concerned, I will ask the Department of Justice and Equality to notify the Chairman when the heads of the Bill will be published.</p><p> I acknowledge the comments of Deputy Ferris on community relations and the active and positive role of the committee.  There was a constructive meeting only last week, which I acknowledge.  I value it from a Government perspective and it is important in the context of the overall objective to have a climate of stability, peace and reconciliation.  With regard to outstanding commitments from previous agreements, Deputy Ferris is aware these issues were considered in the context of the Stormont House talks.  Throughout the talks, from September to Christmas Eve, we maintained the view that the best way to strengthen peace and reconciliation across the island is to implement fully the commitments undertaken in previous agreements.  Ultimately, the Stormont House Agreement did not see as much progress on some of these matters as I would have wished but nevertheless the Agreement contains important elements, including the provision of civic advisory panel and endorsement by the British Government of the principle of respect for, and recognition of, the Irish language in Northern Ireland.  Notwithstanding the content and form of the Stormont House Agreement, the Government remains committed to the full implication of previous agreements.  We will take advantage of every opportunity to move forward on this important work.  Each agenda of the North-South Ministerial Council contains a headline issue on the matter of progress.</p><p> Deputy Martin Ferris specifically mentioned the bill of rights and I wished to see the setting up of a bill of rights for Northern Ireland but there was not the appropriate level of consensus in the context of these talks.  The Agreement enshrines many of the principles the Government expects to see in any eventual bill of rights.  In it, parties commit to serving the people of Northern Ireland equally, to act in accordance with the obligations of government to promote equality and respect and to prevent discrimination, and to promote a culture of tolerance and mutual respect and mutual understanding.  There will be other opportunities to avail of in securing progress on these issues.  I acknowledge there are outstanding matters that need to be progressed.</p><p> On the matter of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, the Government supports the all-party D&aacute;il motion of July 2008 and May 2011 encouraging the British Government to allow access by an independent judicial figure to all original documents in their possession relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  I raised the issue on several occasions with the Secretary of State, including on her visit to Dublin in February.  I am assured she will consider afresh how best the British Government can respond to these D&aacute;il motions but I acknowledge we have not made the level of progress I would have wished.  I continue to raise the issue and I will keep the committee informed of any progress in this regard.</p><p> On the matter of Mr. Pat Finucane, the position of the Irish Government remains unchanged.  We continue to support the call of the Finucane family on the British Government to establish an independent public inquiry into the murder of Mr. Pat Finucane in line with commitments already made by both Governments at Weston Park in 2001.  I have reiterated the position to the Secretary of State on her visit to Dublin in February and the response on her part is in line with the response of the British Prime Minister that the de Silva report and the apology by Prime Minister Cameron to the family constituted the Government's response to the case.  I will continue to urge for full compliance with commitments already agreed and made at Weston Park.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.880" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015040200002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister for the detailed report.  On 20 January, I had the opportunity, along with other members of Fianna F&aacute;il Party, to welcome in the D&aacute;il debate the Stormont House Agreement and to compliment the Minister on his hands-on approach to this issue.  As a party, we have been critical and have highlighted the need for both Governments to take a more hands-on approach during the Haass talks.  We are glad the Minister has taken this approach and there have been dividends from it.</p><p>Regarding the historical investigations unit to be established, legislation will have to pass Westminster and having a new Government will cause some delay.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question, I note the commitment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister for Justice and Equality to bring forward any legislation we need as soon as possible.  In the D&aacute;il debate, I quoted from <i>Lethal Allies</i>, Anne Cadwallader's book:<blockquote>In between the Dublin Bombings of 1st December 1972 and the 20th January, 1973, Fermanagh-based members of the UDR and UVF carried out three bombings within an hour - Clones (County Monaghan) Belturbet (County Cavan) and Pettigo (County Donegal) - all on 28th December 1972.  Two teenagers, Geraldine O'Reilly (aged fifteen) [from Belturbet] and Paddy Stanley (aged sixteen) [from Clara, County Offaly], were killed in Belturbet. </blockquote>No one has been brought to justice for those atrocities.  I know the O'Reilly family very well and I know the family from different commemorations in Belturbet.  I am sure the Minister knows the Stanley family.  A complaint has been lodged from with the police ombudsman's office in Northern Ireland about the murders in Belturbet and I hope no blockage is put in the way of having this incident referred to the historical investigations unit when it is established.  If carnage or murders are to be investigated by the historical investigations unit when it is established, they must be cleared by the police ombudsman's office first.  The Dublin and Monaghan bombings were referred to the police ombudsman's office and accepted.  Similarly, the murder of two people in the Drogheda in December 1975 and the murder of Mr. Mone in Castleblayney in March 1976 have been accepted by the police ombudsman.  I sincerely hope that the murder of those two young teenagers  in Belturbet will be investigated.</p><p>None of us can realise the terrible trauma and suffering those families continue to go through while nobody has been brought to justice for those horrific murders.  I hope that whatever discussions or work the Minister and his officials can undertake to ensure that this atrocity is investigated is undertaken.  </p><p> I had the opportunity to meet the Secretary of State, Theresa Villiers, when she visited Dublin in February.  Along with Deputy Martin, I again highlighted the need for the British Government to respond positively to the two unanimous requests of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann regarding giving an eminent legal person access to files pertaining to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  More than 40 years have passed and the least people deserve is the truth regarding who carried out those atrocities.</p><p> Does the Minister think welfare reform is parked for the next five weeks during the course of the British general election, or has any progress been made in recent talks between the five party leaders in Northern Ireland since the beginning of this year?</p><p> Another thing that baffles me is the lack of progress on the establishment of a civic forum.  I presume this has been blocked by Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP.  It is a devolved matter and a matter for the parties.  There was a civic forum and it is a matter of re-convening it.  I have said on numerous occasions that I do not know who is threatened by a civic forum.  I visited Armagh only two weeks ago and met different groups.  A proportion of the population feels alienated from the political process.  We all know that the civic forum will not have the answers to everything but at least if it is a forum to give different groups, representative organisations and advocacy groups a platform to air their views and put forward their proposals, it can be helpful.  The Minister might let us know what a civic advisory panel will mean.  Why not establish a civic forum, perhaps in a different format from that which existed previously?  It should be established.  It would seem that the two main parties have blocked its establishment to date, which is ridiculous.</p><p> The Minister mentioned the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in June.  I presume his Department is involved in deciding the agenda for this meeting or meetings.  An issue that is of widespread concern in the Border counties both North and South is illegal trade.  There is illegal trade in diesel, petrol, tobacco products and clothing.  Gangsters and criminals have built up huge businesses through illegal trade.  We have seen damage to the environment in Counties Louth, Monaghan and Cavan and North of the Border.  There is a threat to public health, the waterways and the provenance and authenticity of our food production systems.  Our party put forward legislation calling for the establishment of a North-South statutory body to pull together An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the PSNI, the Revenue Commissioners and their counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and the EPA and its counterpart North of the Border.  It is estimated that this State loses a minium of &euro;260 million per year in revenue due to these illegal activities.  I do not expect the Minister to comment on our proposal, which we hope the Government will accept, in respect of establishing a body that will save the State money rather than being a cost to the State.  This issue could be put on the agenda of the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council and the genuine concerns of communities living in Border counties could be dealt with.  We constantly see diesel and petrol spillages on our roads, which cost local authorities a huge amount of money to clean up.  Small businesses are being put out of business due to illegal trading.  All of these issues need to be addressed and this can only be done on a North-South basis.  I know An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and our customs authorities do exceptionally good work on this side of the Border, but it is an issue that needs to be dealt with politically on an all-Ireland basis, and the necessary statutory agency needs to be established to deal with it.  I hope that this issue can be discussed at the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.882" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015040200002#F00200"><p>Deputy Smith raised a number of issues.  Welfare reform is a matter exclusively for the parties in Northern Ireland.  Meetings have taken place at a high level over recent weeks.  I take the opportunity at this committee to call on all the parties to redouble their resolve with a view towards reaching agreement on the matter, which is obviously complex as well as being important.  I would have thought it was possible to mark progress as agreed prior to Christmas on the completion of the agreement.  That did not prove possible.  Having regard to the fact that the Assembly is in recess, I understand that should agreement be reached, the Assembly will be recalled to have the final stages of the welfare Bill completed.  I cannot say with any certainty that this will happen.  I spoke to party leadership figures last week.  I keep in very close contact and I hope the outstanding difficulties can be resolved.  Again, I am happy to keep the Chairman updated.  I am sure there are members of the committee who are as well informed on this matter as I am.  I believe it is important to ensure that this does not give rise to an impasse and I am concerned at the fact that the context is the general election campaign.  Deputy Smith used the word "parked".  I hope these matters can be resolved and I would be concerned by any impasse that might develop which could have an impact on other important aspects of the agreement, so I urge everybody involved to seek a resolution, notwithstanding an acceptance on my part that there are complex and difficult issues involved.</p> <p>  In respect of the historical investigations unit, HIU, I know of Deputy Smith's deep interest in the atrocities in his constituency.  He has mentioned the Belturbet bombings and the Castleblayney atrocity on numerous occasions.  The intention is that the investigation unit will be established next year.  This will involve the passage of legislation.  It will take forward cases that were previously under the remit of the historical enquiries team as part of the PSNI and the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland.  We need to find a mechanism through which cases under the remit of the Police Ombudsman of Northern Ireland can be transferred to the HIU, but I share Deputy Smith's view that the atrocities mentioned would be covered.  It will involve legislation here and in Westminster.  I hope there is no delay, notwithstanding elections and possible reshuffles and changes.  I can reassure the committee that once agreement was reached on this issue, the resolve was there on the part of everybody to ensure that matters could be progressed.  All appropriate arrangements will be set in place to ensure there is full co-operation with the HIU.</p><p> On the issue of the civic forum, I share Deputy Smith's view.  I would have preferred a forum of the type that has been proposed in the past.  However, it is important that we welcome what was agreed in the provision under the Stormont House Agreement to set up a civic advisory panel.  The target date is June.  The panel will advise the Northern Ireland Executive on a range of social, cultural and economic issues.  Notwithstanding that, we will continue to explore other possibilities in respect of the long-proposed North-South consultative forum, as envisaged under the Good Friday Agreement.  Bodies such as this committee play a vitally important role in ensuring a direct connection with civic society.  I urge the committee to continue to do so.  It is essential that all efforts are considered to ensure the voice of civic society is heard and included on all occasions in our policy formation.  </p><p> Members have addressed the issue of illegal trading in the Houses and outside.  I take particular note of the deep interest in this matter of public representatives who reside in the Border area.  I recently attended a meeting in Dundalk where this issue was very much top of the agenda.  I acknowledge the recent report of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, which was welcome in the context of bringing these matters into the public domain.  The Government attaches huge importance to combatting organised crime of all sorts.  As Deputy Smith will acknowledge, there is a strong operational and strategic focus among the Garda authorities on the matter in this jurisdiction.  The Garda continue to work closely with the PSNI and, beyond that, with the UK national crime agency in combatting the activities of organised criminal gangs.</p><p> There has to be a particular focus on cross-Border crime, including fuel laundering and smuggling and tobacco fraud.  Based on my discussions with the Minister for Justice and Equality and in Northern Ireland, there is significant co-operation and exchange of information, ideas and intelligence in a way that was not the case in the past.  I refer to the annual cross-Border organised crime conference organised jointly by the Garda, the PSNI, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of the Minister of Justice, David Ford MLA, in the North.  We need to ensure an element of resolve regarding this issue.  I note Deputy Smith's initiative and I would be happy to talk to the appropriate agencies in that regard.  Members will be aware of the involvement of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and, in particular, the reaction of the Minister following the release of the recent report, whereby he wrote to his counterpart in Northern Ireland, Mark Durkan, highlighting the negative and adverse environmental impact of fuel laundering on both sides of the Border and the high cost of cleaning up the toxic waste produced by these operations.  He will ensure greater co-operation from an environmental perspective.</p><p> These issues are also discussed at the regular meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council, including most recently at the plenary meeting last December.  I assure members that this will also be agenda item at the forthcoming plenary meeting.  I am sure the Chairman will join me in asking that anybody with information about criminal activity make immediate and direct contact with the Garda or the PSNI.  No stone must be left unturned in bringing to heel these criminal gangs that are engaged in highly organised illegal activity, which is not only causing serious damage to the environment but is also having an impact on the Revenue Commissioners.  This is unacceptable criminal behaviour.  Anyone with information should assist in bringing these people to justice and putting them out of business, and allowing for due process under the administration of the criminal justice code.</p></speech>

I commend him and the two governments on all the work they have done.  I am particularly happy about his comments on the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in the north west in May.  Many of the issues the committee has discussed relate to infrastructure, particularly the road network, although we have visited the Narrow Water bridge project and so on.  Will the Minister outline the prospects for investment in this regard?  In all the discussions I have had with local authorities on both sides of the Border and interest groups, there has been a great wish to meet the Minister and the Taoiseach, if possible, to have these matters discussed at the council meeting.  I am sure it is a priority for the Minister, but this has been raised at many meetings of this committee and we will no doubt have other meetings about, and outreach visits to, many of these projects.</p> <p>  I refer to the legislation that was discussed earlier.  I have a particular interest in the Irish language, and another official languages Bill will be introduced during the next session of the D&aacute;il.  Language, however, is a legacy issue in the North in the context of the bill of rights mentioned by previous speakers.   While it is not easy to answer this, I would like the Minister to outline a timeframe for addressing this, because it is important given that we are introducing more legislation here in this regard.</p> <p>  We have met relatives of those affected by the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, the Pat Finucane case and the Omagh bombing, and we hear the same message - that they want to meet Ministers and the Taoiseach, because they feel these issues should be pursued further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.885" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015040200002#G00300"><p>I share the Deputy's view that infrastructural improvements and developments are vital in the context of peace, stability and prosperity.  The A5 dual carriageway is seen as a key infrastructural project and it was very much under discussion in the context of the agreement.</p><p>I was pleased the Government reaffirmed our commitment of funding to the tune of &pound;50 million in financial support towards the project.  That will benefit the north west but also the island as a whole.  We committed under the agreement to examine opportunities for further funding within the context of the forthcoming capital expenditure programme.  There is also the matter of EU funding and support.</p><p> I acknowledge the very positive role of the European Union in supporting North-South co-operation and reconciliation across a range of issues.  The PEACE and INTERREG cross-Border programme will provide funding of more than &euro;500 million to Northern Ireland and the Border counties up to 2020.  It was agreed at the North-South Ministerial Council plenary in October that Ministers on both sides of the Border would pursue further opportunities and examine how best they might maximise the drawdown of EU funding across a range of issues.  Health is another issue with which Deputy Kitt is familiar.  I refer to the North-South agreement on the provision of children's cardiac surgery on an all-island basis at Crumlin hospital.  Agreement has also been reached on the new radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin hospital.</p><p> In terms of the Narrow Water Bridge, Senator Jim D'Arcy will be aware of issues that come under the remit of Louth County Council.  I note the committee's involvement.  I assure members that the issues under discussion are very much on the Government's agenda.  The Taoiseach visited the North last week and had an opportunity to meet a number of groups.  He had a very successful engagement at a Confederation of British Industry, CBI, dinner where he outlined the progress achieved and sought further opportunities in terms of ongoing economic co-operation and ultimately the provision of jobs for people in particular in the north-west Border counties that have had higher than average levels of unemployment.</p><p> On the specific reference Deputy Kitt made to the Irish language Act, members will be aware that the provision of an Irish language Act was included in a paper tabled by the Government in the course of the Stormont House talks.  I admit a level of disappointment that the commitment did not form part of the final agreement.  However, there was an explicit endorsement in the agreement by the British Government on the principle of the recognition of the Irish language and of respect for the language in Northern Ireland.  I believe we can develop those matters further in the context of further engagement.</p></speech>

I congratulate him on the work he did leading up to the Stormont House Agreement.  It looked to be dead in the water and then the Minister rode in like the Lone Ranger and he sorted it out.  I know there were others involved but the Minister played a massive role.  I am sure after this gig he will be heading for the United Nations.</p> <p>  After so many years of the Legislative Assembly we appear to be going through a difficult patch.  Does the Minister believe the d'Hondt mechanism served its purpose and that it might be better to move to a different type of arrangement?  Is there any talk about such a change in the foreign affairs circles in which the Minister moves?  That leads me to the transfer of powers to the Assembly.  Deputy Brendan Smith referred to diesel laundering, much of which is a revenue matter.  It is a Treasury issue rather than a North-South issue in terms of dealing with markers and VAT rebates if that is necessary.  However, the issues could all be thrashed out on a North-South basis if power was more devolved.  What is the position in terms of the devolution of powers?</p> <p>  I wish to discuss 1916.  Is it intended to have 1916 commemorations in the North?  I very much welcome the fact that Deputy Pearse Doherty welcomed the programme of events announced to commemorate 1916.  I hope any commemorations in the North would not be triumphalist or be seen as exclusive, which could lead to friction.  It is important that commemorative events in the North would be inclusive and would look to the future because we must share this island.</p> <p>  Diesel laundering is a major problem.  Currently, there is a fragmentation in the criminal system.  There is an opportunity for Revenue and the Garda to take control of the situation in a way that has not been done before which deals with both sides of the Border.  Deputy Smith has long spoken on the issue, as we all have.  I have spoken to those directly involved in trying to bring the activity to an end.  Extra resources are required.  I concur with the point made by Deputy Smith that the investment would pay for itself.  Currently, the situation is akin to the police forces fighting cannons with pikes.  They must be better resourced and some of them need to be better supported.  There is a lot of information available but it is not going through the system in the way it should due to lack of resources, including legal resources.</p></speech>

I do not see an immediate appetite to change the structure as set up by the d'Hondt mechanism, the aim of which was to ensure a large degree of power sharing.  I do not think the time is right for such a change.  However, there is a provision for members to engage in voluntary opposition at any stage, should they wish.</p><p>However, I do not envisage a change to the d'Hondt system.  I believe there are strong arguments in favour of its retention into the future.</p><p> On the matter of commemorations, members will be aware of the official launch by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, earlier this week.  It is an opportunity for everybody on the island to engage and mark the commemoration of the historic events of 1916.  There will be an international element.  Many of the events are currently being developed and rolled out.  I urge everybody to avail of the opportunity to reflect not only on the events of 1916 but also on the 100 years that have elapsed, including the historic Good Friday Agreement 18 years ago.  Again, there will be an opportunity to mark that agreement and I hope this committee will be involved.  I share Senator Jim D'Arcy's view about the manner of commemoration and the need for us to be sensitive, notwithstanding the need to reflect on the Rising and how it occurred.</p><p> Senator Jim D'Arcy also mentioned the matter of devolution.  Obviously the passage of the legislation in Westminster to enable the devolution of power to set the rate of corporation tax is important.  That will bring great benefits and has the capacity to transform for the good the economic climate in Northern Ireland.  That is very welcome.</p><p> On the matter of smuggling, I do not wish to go back over issues already discussed by Deputy Smith but I agree with what Senator Jim D'Arcy said.  It is absolutely essential that co-operation continues to develop in the manner in which it has over recent years.  The two Ministers with responsibility for justice meet on a regular basis.  Both of them attended the cross-Border crime conference last October.  From my ongoing engagements with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Mr. Ford, the committee can be assured that every effort will be made to deal with this issue, notwithstanding the resource issue mentioned by Senator Jim D'Arcy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.890" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/972" speakername="Se&aacute;n Conlan" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2015040200002#J00200"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I will start with the issue of fuel laundering.  I raised it in a Topical Issue Debate about six weeks ago and I also raised it at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.  It is a serious ongoing issue.  Unfortunately, much lip-service is paid to the measures that have been taken to tackle it, but the problem has been getting worse since last October.  There is much talk about what has been done, but far more must be done.  It must be more than just words.  There must be real action.</p><p>In my constituency it is now almost a daily occurrence to see bowsers dumped at the side of the road, which was not the case a year or two years ago.  This issue must be tackled head-on.  It is not simply a Revenue Commissioners issue; at this stage it is a health issue.  Water courses are being polluted by the diesel sludge.  More action must be taken by the Irish Government and the authorities in Northern Ireland to deal with the problem.  I do not believe enough is being done at present.  There is much talk but real action is required by the Police Service of Northern Ireland, the Garda, the customs service, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for the Environment in the North to tackle this.  Politicians talk all the time about what they are going to do and what will be done, but I see what is happening on the ground.  The situation is getting worse, not better, so it must be resolved.  Real action must be taken and I hope the Minister will raise this issue at the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  He should seek reports from the officials who are dealing with the issue.  Rather than anecdotal evidence there should be real evidence of what is being done to deal with it.  That would be a major step forward.</p><p>Infrastructure was raised and the Minister mentioned the A5, but many other projects must be carried out in the north east, rather than in the north west.  From the 1920s through to the 1950s the basic road and rail infrastructure in the north east was dismantled.  It has not yet been replaced.  We are almost 20 years into the peace process but the road from Belfast to Monaghan and Cavan must be upgraded.  I hear no talk at Government level of doing anything about it.  It is the main arterial route from south Ulster into Belfast, which is the major city in the North, but nothing has been done to upgrade it.  All the talk is about the road to the north west, which is fine, but what is happening in the north east?</p><p>This applies to all of the Border roads.  Under the EU Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, PEACE I, the Border roads were reopened.  However, only a small amount of money was spent and the roads were not upgraded to modern standards.  We do not have the cross-Border road infrastructure that one would expect in a modern industrial nation.  The roads were designed in the 19th century and resurfaced after the peace process started, but they have not been widened or straightened.  It means there is a lack of connectivity between Monaghan, Armagh, Fermanagh and Tyrone which hinders economic development in the region.  Twenty years after the start of the peace process this has not been tackled.  Some type of approach should be made to the roads service in Northern Ireland and to the local authorities in the South, and extra funding should be provided, to deal with this problem.</p><p>On the issue of funding, there is much talk about a lack of resources.  I co-authored a report for the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly less than a month ago which indicates where money could be obtained to cement infrastructure development along the Border.  I wrote in the report about the European Investment Bank and how both the British and Irish Governments could access funding to improve infrastructure development in the Border region.  In fact, the report recommends that both the British and Irish Governments target the Border region specifically for infrastructure development.  It is an issue that can be dealt with over the next number of years but it must be dealt with urgently.  The region was left behind.  It is something people do not appear to realise.  Our entire infrastructure was dismantled because of political interference on both sides of the Border between the 1920s and 1960s and it has not been put back in place.  Although there is talk about some development along the Border, the macro picture has not been grasped by either Government in terms of what must be done.  To ensure people in the Border region have an input and a positive view of the future, there must be proper investment in that region simply to bring it to where it should be <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the rest of the Republic and Northern Ireland.  That is not the case at present, so this must be done.</p><p>The north-south interconnector is a topical issue at present.  I attended a landowners meeting a few nights ago which was also attended by 95% of the landowners in County Monaghan.  None of them wants the north-south interconnector to be installed over-ground and every one of them will object to that.  Unlike our friends in Mayo and in the south of Ireland, we have not been given alternative options in terms of specific underground routes.  That is shocking.  Everybody should have equality of treatment in a republic and the least we should expect, nearly ten years after this project was first mooted, is that the people in the communities affected would have real underground options brought to their attention and that there would be consultation about those options.  I represented the County Monaghan anti-pylon people during the first An Bord Plean&aacute;la hearing.  At the time I was not involved in politics at national level.  It is like groundhog day because we are back where we started.  There is still the same route that nobody wants going over-ground and through the community, but nobody seems to be listening.</p><p>This project does not have community acceptance on either side of the Border.  The communities in Armagh and Tyrone do not want it going over-ground either.  At least if we knew there were specific underground routes that were properly costed we could evaluate whether there were alternatives in that regard, but we have not been given those alternatives.</p><p>If we do not have an alternative, how can we evaluate whether the current project or plan is the best one?  No alternatives have ever been given, so I would like the Minister to raise this issue with his colleagues in Northern Ireland because it is a cross-Border project of common interest.  At the moment, however, it is being handled badly and has no community acceptance.  It needs to be revisited before a new application comes forward.  I am asking the Minister therefore to raise the issue at Cabinet level.  He should ask his ministerial colleague, Deputy Alex White, to reassess this project in light of the fact that in the west and south EirGrid seems to be coming up with new proposals and new ways of dealing with the issue that it has not come up with in the north east.  We expect equality of treatment in terms of how these projects are handled, in the same way as they are in Mayo, Roscommon or in the south.  We expect to have other technical options put before us, but it has not happened thus far.  It is exactly the same project as in 2010 when it failed at the previous oral hearing, and it is unacceptable.</p><p> Commemorations are important and we should be proud of who we are as a people.  We should know who we are and not bow down or be worried about celebrating the start of a revolution to remove the British presence from Ireland.  We decided as a people to become an independent nation, which is a matter for celebration.  It is not something to be bashful about.  I hope that in the forthcoming celebrations we will be straightforward about it.  I do not think the Americans or the British would be bashful about celebrating their own history, so we should not be bashful about celebrating ours.  I hope the commemorations will reflect the fact that 1916 was the start of a revolution to remove a foreign presence from our country.</p><p> We must always be mindful and respectful of all diverse views on this island, but at the end of the day the majority of people on this island want to live in an independent Ireland ruled by ourselves.  The 1916 Rising was the start of that process and it should be commemorated.  We have no reason to be bashful about it.  It is important for the Government to be mindful of exactly what 1916 was all about.</p><p> The final issue I want to raise concerns the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  It is a matter that has been ongoing for 40 years and is a festering sore for people in the Border region.  We have not received answers from the British Government about this, but we need answers.  Until there is a genuine, proper response from the British authorities on this matter, it will continue to be a festering sore for the families and communities affected.  I urge the Minister to raise this issue with the British authorities at every opportunity he gets.  It is important that this issue is put to bed.</p></speech>

It is one about which I believe we need to be supplied with appropriate information and documentation.  I raised the matter recently but will continue to do so.  I agree with what the Deputy has said.</p> <p>  The issue of smuggling was aired by Deputy Smith and others.  I assure Deputy Conlan that this matter is being examined across a range of approaches, including Revenue, Customs and Excise, the police and, more recently, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That issue will be on the agenda of the forthcoming North-South Ministerial Council.</p> <p>  The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, has recently been in contact with his Northern Ireland counterpart, Mark Durkan, with a view to ensuring a greater level of co-operation on environmental matters.  I share Deputy Conlan's concern in that regard.  This is not just a Border issue.  I was somewhat surprised recently to be advised by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in my own constituency about fuel outlets that I might not be minded to support in terms of purchasing fuel.  This is a nationwide issue that needs to be tackled comprehensively.  The committee can take it that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her Northern Ireland counterpart, David Ford, are very much on the one page in dealing with this matter through a close degree of co-operation among all agencies involved.</p> <p>  As he has done before, Deputy Conlan mentioned a most important issue which is the infrastructural deficit consequent on the period of instability during the Troubles over the years.  He is right to say that there needs to be a focus on how best we can ensure North-South co-operation in such a way as to maximise economic benefits in the Border areas.  Obviously it involves funding and I reiterate that over the next five years the EU has committed &euro;500 million to Northern Ireland and the Border areas.  Much of that will go towards improving infrastructure and redressing the infrastructural deficit.</p> <p>  The International Fund for Ireland will also be involved in this regard.  At the North-South Ministerial Council, reference is continually being made to plans for infrastructural improvements and other benefits.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, attended a meeting of this committee recently to discuss roads.  If this committee, including Deputy Conlan and Deputy Smith as representatives of the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, wishes to make any submission, I am sure the appropriate authorities would be open to engaging in any county or regional roads programme of the type that has been mentioned.  We must highlight the strategic cross-Border transport priorities.</p> <p>  The Chairman will understand that I am not going to become involved in the pylon issue, but this committee may wish to invite the Minister, Deputy Alex White, to attend.  I know that Deputy Conlan will avail of other parliamentary mechanisms to raise the matter, including Topical Issues and parliamentary questions.  I do not wish to comment on the matters of overgrounding or undergrounding.  I have similar issues in my constituency.  I would say, however, that this is an important project for ensuring economic benefits for that region.  As Deputy Conlan, Deputy Smith and others know, this region requires investment and improvement.  One of the first questions any potential investor will pose concerns power and power security, which are matters of some importance.  However, it would be unfair of anyone to draw me into the pylon issue with regard to undergrounding or overgrounding.</p> <p>  As regards the economic benefits of North-South co-operation, I wish to mention the input and work undertaken by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock.  He is the first Minister with specific and direct responsibility for North-South trade and economic development.  He does a fine job.  I urge committee members to keep in contact with him concerning strategic priorities and opportunities.  He spends a great deal of time working on cross-Border issues and I would like to acknowledge his great work in this regard.</p> <p>  International support for the peace process must always be acknowledged.  In this instance, in the context of implementing the Stormont House Agreement, I acknowledge the ongoing support, influence, assistance and guidance of the United States authorities.  In particular, I note the contribution of US Senator Gary Hart.</p><p>Earlier this week I had the opportunity to speak to Vice President Joe Biden in Boston and he sends his good wishes and support.  Members of this committee can be assured of the support of the United States Administration and that of other international actors.  Earlier this year I had the opportunity of meeting with my Canadian counterpart and we had a good exchange on Northern Ireland matters.  He and his colleagues in Canada maintain a deep interest in the affairs of Ireland and Northern Ireland and wish to see the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement with a consequent dividend in terms of economic and social benefit and peace and stability and all that goes with it.</p></speech>

It is much wider than that.  There is extortion and people have been badly injured.  Recently one person, Frank McCabe Jnr, was blinded and lost his eye when he was removing a derogatory poster when he was going to work at 6 a.m.  Another person was shot in the south Armagh area.  There was a mobilisation of people right across south Armagh.  Thousands of people came out to confront the people involved in that type of criminality or any type of criminality.  Deputy Adams spoke at it and said that if anyone had any fears of going to the authorities in the Six Counties or the Twenty-six counties, he was prepared to give the names or do whatever was necessary.  That was the entire community moving against this criminality.  Some of it comes from their areas and from other areas.  I know that Deputy Adams has met senior garda&iacute; in his constituency of Louth on this and I also know that he has met the PSNI about this type of criminality.  I am also glad that the Minister referred to the fact those types of activities are not confined to Border regions and are fairly widespread.  A number of years back in my own county, which is a long way away from the Border, there was similar criminality.  The only way to deal with it is for all of us to work together as elected representatives with our communities to stamp out this type of activity because it is fairly widespread.</p></speech>

On the issue of cross-Border criminality, I was part of committee A at the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly which reported on cross-Border criminality, and it was eye-opening to say the least.  We held many cross-Border meetings.  I suppose when there is a border and two jurisdictions, across Europe or across the world, there will always be people taking advantage of different excises and different issues.  I think people find it hard to believe that this is still ongoing and that resources have not been put in to tackle these issues.  Many people have complained, as I did three years ago when my engine was made unworkable because laundered diesel was put into it.  It is an ongoing issue.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance said many people are talking about petrol stretching.  In the age-old tradition, most politicians will go to the local radio or the newspapers but will not report it in the proper structured way in which it should be reported.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, said that even though there have been many complaints of fuel stretching, reports have not been made on an official basis.  We all hear anecdotal evidence but it needs to be reported in order that we can get a true picture of the situation.</p> <p>  I remember coming back from Belfast after a meeting and I decided to look at the beautiful Bernish viewpoint.  Two big white fuel oil tankers came up a small road that was not the width of a table and it was quite obvious that they were not part of a legitimate business.  One could drive at 60 miles per hour on any road through south Armagh and one would see the stations.  One does not have to be a genius to know this is going on.  It is an issue that has been raised often and we know the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is doing everything possible along with the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  The committee has discussed the Narrow Water Bridge project.  One suggestion that was made was to establish a working group of officials in parallel with the North-South Ministerial Council to help both jurisdictions to work more collaboratively on these projects.  Perhaps the same approach could be applied to an interdepartmental group working North and South to address the illegal trading issue this meeting is discussing.</p> <p>  A stocktake review of the 2010 agreement between prisoners in Maghaberry Prison and the Northern Ireland Prison Service was published in 2014.  I have been to the prison and met with dissident republicans and there are outstanding issues that need to be resolved.  I understand that officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are monitoring the situation in the prison, including progress made on the implementation of these recommendations.  Could the Minister update the committee on how much progress has been made on this?  Is it his opinion that the prison service is making real and genuine efforts to resolve the outstanding issues that seem to cause so much tension and unrest?</p> <p>  The Stormont House Agreement covers a broad range of political, social, and economic issues and it has the potential to advance significantly its twin aims of reconciliation and economic renewal.  There is an elephant in the room in terms of economic renewal.  What does the Minister see as the key priorities?  In that context, what are his views on a possible exit of the UK from the EU and the potentially serious negative impact that would have on cross-Border trade?</p> <p>  Following the recent British Irish Parliamentary Assembly plenary session in Dublin, politicians from the United Kingdom and the island of Ireland endorsed the bid to host the men's Rugby World Cup in 2023.  What are the Minister's views of the importance of this initiative and has he any suggestions on how this committee could support the bid?</p></speech>

On the last issue, I am sure the committee could lend its support.  There was a very successful launch of the bid to stage the Rugby World Cup with the full support of all the party leaders in the North and the South.  It is a very exciting opportunity and I think if the Chair were to lend his support by contacting the IRFU, it would be most helpful.</p> <p>  I get a sense from the meeting that the cross-Border smuggling issue is one of great importance to the Chair and the members of the committee.  I believe that the Minister for Justice and Equality would be happy to accept an invitation from the Chairman on behalf of the committee, notwithstanding her very busy agenda with legislation and other duties, but perhaps an update from her would be appropriate.  In any event, I will convey the very strong views of this committee to her at an early opportunity.  I know she is in direct regular contact with her counterpart, Mr. Ford.  I urge everyone to invite their constituents to provide any information to the appropriate authorities.  I know Border Deputies do this regularly.  This is a real and serious issue and I condemn the recent attacks on individuals in south Armagh which are directly linked to cross-Border smuggling.  It is unacceptable and it is important that every effort be made to deal actively with the issue.</p> <p>  The stocktake report the Chairman mentioned was published in November 2014.</p><p>It offers an opportunity to create an environment free of conflict in Maghaberry Prison.  I met interested parties, including those involved in drawing up the stocktake report.  I urge Members in this committee and beyond to continue contacting the stakeholders.  The Northern Ireland Prison Service has committed to implementing the recommendations.  I hope this will happen at an early date, but it is an issue I am monitoring closely.</p><p> On the matter of the possible departure by the UK from the EU, there would be consequences for Northern Ireland.  The preferred course of action is for the UK to remain firmly within the EU.  However, the matter is the subject of debate in the UK general election.  Let us wait and see the shape of the new Government.  I would be happy to report back to the committee.  As part of the committee's remit, I invite it to examine papers that have been published on this issue.  I assure it that our Government is keeping a close eye on the situation.</p></speech>

I am unsure of what the project is like in Laois, but the first application five years ago called for converter stations in Monaghan, Cavan and Meath.

I met the Minister, who was on his way to Toronto with his officials in economy class.  Most people would not know that.  I saw the Minister's work programme for the three days, selling Ireland and working with our friends from an economic point of view.  The work done by all Ministers was incredible.  I thank them.  This has been the way for the past five or ten years.  St. Patrick's Day is a major opportunity to sell our country.</p> <p>  As Deputy Ferris outlined, members of the loyalist community visited us last Wednesday.  There is an opportunity on Capitol Hill and in the UK for people to get into the political process.  The door is open.

I remind everybody to switch off mobile phones.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Helen McEntee.  The item on the agenda is a discussion with two representatives from Virgin Atlantic Airlines: Mr. Joe Thompson, director of network and alliances and Mr. Dave Hodges.</p><p>The purpose of the meeting is to engage with Mr. Thompson and Mr. Hodges regarding Virgin Atlantic's views on the likely impact of the possible takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG on connectivity for Irish airline passengers.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome both of them.<br/><br/>I wish to draw attention to the fact by virtue of section 17(2)<i>(l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that any submission or opening statement they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website following the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I invite Mr. Thompson to make his presentation.</p></speech>

I am director of network and alliances at Virgin Atlantic, which means that I am responsible for the airline&rsquo;s network decisions and relationships with key partner airlines, including that with Aer Lingus.  Before setting out our concerns and perspective, it is important to clarify that Virgin Atlantic neither supports nor opposes the proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus by IAG.  What we oppose and have concerns about is this acquisition going through unchecked.  There needs to be proper consideration of, and a clear and effective plan to remedy, the inevitable diminishing competition in air travel for Ireland and the harmful effects this will have for consumers travelling to and from Ireland.</p> <p>  Each year, more than 500,000 passengers travel between Ireland and long-haul destinations, connecting at a UK airport.  The predominant choice for Irish consumers, when travelling long-haul to many destinations not directly served from an Irish city, is to fly via the UK with Virgin Atlantic, British Airways or another long-haul carrier carrying them on their onward long-haul sector to their final destination.  Virgin Atlantic is proud to serve approximately 100,000 of these passengers on itineraries to and from Ireland annually.  Good air connectivity between Ireland and the UK enables this traffic to flow, in combination with an interline agreement between Aer Lingus and Virgin Atlantic, which allows customers to connect between our services.  The interline agreement enables competitive fares, good onward connection times and baggage transfer between our respective flights.  This means that customers can check in at their point of origin, be it Dublin, Cork, Shannon or Knock, and collect their baggage from the luggage carousel in Barbados, Hong Kong, Los Angeles or wherever on our network they are flying to.  Ireland is an important market for Virgin Atlantic, and more important, the competition we and others provide through long-haul connections at Heathrow, Gatwick, and Manchester airports is important to Irish consumers.</p> <p>  Virgin Atlantic is unashamedly pro-competition and it is the reason we were founded.  We have fought since that date in 1984 to give customers a real choice when it comes to long-haul air travel.  Competition drives down prices and improves service levels and that is why it matters so much to Irish consumers.  We want to be sure that they are protected from any adverse impacts of IAG&rsquo;s acquisition of Aer Lingus, and that the hard won benefits of competition earned over many years are maintained.  If an Irish family travelling on holiday to the Caribbean, or a businessperson travelling to a meeting in Hong Kong, wishes to fly with Virgin Atlantic, right now, it works.  In the same way, if they want to fly British Airways, they can.  That is choice, which is something this deal should not deny the Irish consumer in the future.  If IAG&rsquo;s proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus is allowed to progress unchecked, this choice is at risk.  IAG will have a monopoly on flights between Ireland and the UK that enable the vast majority of these connections and it will be able to withdraw from interline agreements with airlines that provide competition for connecting passengers.</p> <p>  How can competition be maintained?  We have outlined three key questions that we believe need to be asked and then answered on behalf of Irish consumers.  First, what legal guarantees have been sought from IAG that the frequency of flights and seat capacity offered by both Aer Lingus and British Airways between Ireland and the UK will be retained?  We have seen what happens when competition and capacity falls away on routes.  Typically, reductions in frequency or seat capacity leads to negative impacts on the service level provided and inflated fares, leading to higher prices for customers.  IAG has made public offers of commitments on Aer Lingus frequencies, which the committee has discussed with its representatives, but, importantly, it has made no promises about BA's services, leaving it free to reduce BA frequencies following the transaction.  Any commitments should be extended to cover British Airways as well as Aer Lingus in order that the current level of frequencies across the combined BA-Aer Lingus partnership is maintained.  There must also be consideration of how seat capacity can be maintained in order that IAG does not simply downgrade the size of aircraft deployed on these routes.</p> <p>   Second, has the Government sought assurances from IAG that it will carry on working with Aer Lingus's existing partner airlines, preserving the competition that Irish consumers benefit from today?  It would be lovely to hear that IAG had recognised this and was discussing this with the committee but in reality the value of competition to consumers in this case is probably not at the forefront of IAG's thinking.  When BA merged with BMI a few years ago, the opposite happened.  Shortly after the transaction concluded, pre-existing BMI interline arrangements were switched off, depriving consumers across the former BMI network of choice when it came to making connections.  Only regulatory intervention after some time restored that choice to a limited extent.  Commercially, it is perfectly rational for IAG to want to keep connecting passengers on its own network.  It would have no reason to offer access to its customers to its long-haul competitors.  Unchecked, this deal gives IAG the opportunity to do that and to squeeze airlines such as Virgin Atlantic out of the Irish market and funnel consumers onto its own services.  The Government and Parliament have a strong voice in this deal.  The Aer Lingus shareholding and Ireland's membership of the EU enables them to ask IAG for commitments in any proposed deal.  The EU will review the proposed transaction from a competition perspective to which they and the committee can have an input.  If interline agreements are genuinely and fully protected, consumers can be protected.</p> <p>  Third, what measures have the Government identified as necessary under a European Commission remedy to ensure competition is maintained for Irish consumers in the event that the transaction proceeds?  In answering this, it is important to go back to the two enablers of competition today.  The first is the preservation of effective competition and air connectivity between the UK and Ireland for all consumer types, including those who are time sensitive and connecting, and the second is to maintain effective interline partnerships for connecting passengers.  The first of these is partially addressed in discussing frequency or capacity commitments.  The Commission typically has applied a slot remedy in these scenarios in an attempt to encourage new competition on the routes where competitive harm has been identified.  We support that but the track record of uptake of such slots is poor and, therefore, meaningful capacity and frequency commitments from IAG as a backstop to a slot remedy are needed.  Second, to address the needs of connecting customers, there should be a requirement on IAG to enter into effective interline agreements with Aer Lingus's existing partners.  These agreements must include a special prorate agreement in order that airlines other than IAG can offer competitive fares with attractive connecting times and smooth transfers.  The Government and the European Commission must consider these important impacts on competition in its evaluation of IAG&rsquo;s proposed acquisition of Aer Lingus.  We urge the committee and the Government to act on behalf of Irish consumers in pursuing these remedies.  If they believe in maintaining a competitive environment to benefit the consumer, then they will believe in these remedies to protect them.</p> <p>  Virgin Atlantic has been serving Irish consumers since we launched in 1984.  We work hard with Aer Lingus to provide the best service to it.</p><p>I am here today to champion consumers regardless of whoever they choose to fly with.  We at Virgin Atlantic love competition; it is the reason we exist.  If the Irish consumer loses this choice, the competition that drives all airlines to keep prices low and service levels high will be lost, to the great detriment of Ireland, its businesses and its people.</p></speech>

The committee has heard from many stakeholders and interested parties and that is the reason we invited Virgin Atlantic to appear before us this morning.  Our role is to feed into the ongoing debate between Government and IAG regarding this proposal.  As Chairman, I can speak for all members when I state that our objective is to ensure the outcome of the debate will deliver the correct decision in Ireland's best interests.</p> <p>  Mr. Thompson's presentation focused on current Aer Lingus passengers who travel to the United Kingdom and connect to Virgin Atlantic flights.  In that context I understand that Delta Air Lines, Inc. owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic, which I presume gives Virgin Atlantic certain advantages.  Does Mr. Thompson see that a deal between IAG and Aer Lingus would give Aer Lingus similar advantages in that Aer Lingus would retain its identity but would leverage the benefits of an international airline group?  Are there positives for Aer Lingus in this arrangement?</p> <p>  Mr. Thompson made the point that low cost carriers, such as Ryanair, are not suitable for people seeking to make connecting flights.  I was puzzled by that assertion.  I understand from figures that more than 1 million Ryanair passengers made the decision to self-connect to other flights last year.  We are seeing more people making personal arrangements to use a carrier from the United Kingdom.   People from within the United Kingdom, Edinburgh, Glasgow Belfast and Jersey are making these arrangements as well as those flying from Dublin.  In light of that, does Mr. Thompson's assertion sound elitist? </p> <p>  Mr. Thompson has expressed concern for Irish passengers if there was a reduction in the number of Aer Lingus and BA flights between the UK and Ireland following the proposed sale.  The point made is that British Airways, BA, fly into Ireland.  Has Virgin Atlantic considered operating a service between the United Kingdom and Ireland?  Given his concern for Irish passengers connecting to Virgin Atlantic flights, would this be one way of protecting those passengers?</p> <p>  Has Virgin Atlantic or Delta Air Lines, Inc. considered making a bid for Aer Lingus?  If not, why not?  The reason that IAG was the first group to be invited to appear before the committee to engage in this series of debates was that it had made a proposal to bid for Aer Lingus.  Would a link up between Aer Lingus and IAG make Aer Lingus a greater threat to Virgin Atlantic on the transatlantic route?</p> <p>  I am not sure how the different international aviation companies object to each other but has Virgin Atlantic complained before about deals in which IAG was involved or, similarly, did IAG object to deals that Virgin Atlantic proposed?</p> <p>  I have confined myself to putting questions, and I have more, but to be fair to members, they will have the opportunity to put their questions following Mr. Thompson's response to mine.</p></speech>

The first question related to Delta Air Lines, Inc. and Virgin Atlantic.  It is important to realise there are many different types of relationships between airlines.  Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s relationship with Virgin Atlantic is twofold.  Delta Air Lines, Inc. has a minority shareholding in Virgin Atlantic and they both have a transatlantic joint venture partnership which is applicable to flights between the UK and north America.  That is a very different scenario from what is being proposed by IAG, which is the 100% acquisition of Aer Lingus.  Delta Air Lines, Inc. does not have management control of Virgin Atlantic.  Virgin Atlantic remains an independent carrier, governed by its board with Delta Air Lines, Inc.'s representatives forming the minority representation on that board and with control sitting with the Virgin group in the United Kingdom.  In terms of my role today, I am representing Virgin Atlantic on behalf of its board.</p> <p>  The second question related to Ryanair and low cost carriers and self-connecting business.  It is true that some customers make connections via the self-connect method, buying separate tickets on low cost carriers and connecting on to long-haul carriers.  In terms of both the prevalence of the uptake of that form of travel and the customer experience, it is not comparable to the more traditional model of full service carriers interlining with each other and allowing smooth connections to be made. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.918" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Thompson" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015040200002#C00500"><p>However, large numbers of passengers continue to make connections between interlining carriers.  There are important considerations that customers have to bear in mind when they make that decision.  In buying a through ticket that is enabled by an interline agreement, the carriers have obligations to one another in the event of a delay or a lost bag, which do not apply in the instance where a customer buys two separate tickets.  There is also the implication for through travel time.  If a customer buys two separate tickets, he or she must collect the bag at the connecting point and that means it will be very difficult to make an onward connection between airlines in less than approximately three hours.  In an interline agreement, the airline is able to offer connections between carriers with a connecting time of 60 to 70 minutes.  It enables a much more customer-friendly proposition which is valued by many customers.  It is the predominant way in which consumers buy connecting itineraries.</p> <p>  On the question of whether Virgin Atlantic has considered flying short-haul to Ireland, the best analogy to cite is Virgin Atlantic's experience of flying short-haul in the United Kingdom.  As a consequence of IAG acquisition of British Midland International, BMI, a few years ago, a competitive remedy was applied which made available short-haul slots for airlines to compete on routes that became a monopoly as a result of that acquisition.  As a result Virgin Atlantic started operating between Heathrow and Aberdeen and Edinburgh using these remedy slots.  We are very proud of what we achieved with that operation, including fantastic customer service and some of the best punctuality of any airline at Heathrow, but unfortunately competing with a monopoly provider is very difficult and we could not make those services economic.  We have learned from that experience and the prospect of flying short-haul services between two hubs that both belong to the competing airline is not a very attractive commercial prospect.  </p> <p>  In response to the question on whether Virgin Atlantic had considered bidding for Aer Lingus, all I will say is that we are not participating in this process as a potential partner nor are we considering the acquisition of Aer Lingus.</p> <p>  The final question was whether Virgin Atlantic raised objections to previous deals.  First, let me point out that we are not objecting to this proposed transaction.  We are agnostic as to whether the transaction goes ahead, but what is important to us is that the relevant consumer interests are taken into account by the process.  We have participated most recently in the IAG acquisition of British Midland International and I have described one of the significant outcomes of that process.</p></speech>

Clearly, I am on record as stating that it is not in the best interests of Irish consumers for the deal to go ahead.  Obviously, we are keen to take into consideration the potential for inbound tourism as well.  Given the Virgin Atlantic connections with Delta Air Lines and its recognised brand throughout the world, it provides access to Ireland via the Aer Lingus network at the moment.  This provides a significant benefit from our tourism perspective.</p><p> Can Mr. Thompson flesh out a little more the nature or character of any legal agreement that would protect the Irish consumer and ensure that these interline arrangements are maintained?  Does From Mr. Thompson believe this is something the European Commission could require as part of the deal going ahead?  Would something like this have to be agreed in advance by the selling party, that is, the Government?  Would it be required by the Commission or would it require the clearance of the Commission for the overall deal to go ahead?  The only area I wish to concentrate on is how to put in place an appropriate structure to ensure that a combined entity would have to maintain a relationship with other carriers, such as Virgin.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.922" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Thompson" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015040200002#D00200"><p>I believe the main precedent to look back on and learn from is the experience with the International Airlines Group acquisition of British Midland International.  As part of the competitive remedy the European Commission applied certain requirements.  One condition for the approval of the transaction was that British Airways, as the acquirer of British Midland International, had to engage in interline agreements with the legacy partners of British Midland International to ensure that consumers who had been able to make use of those connecting routings were able to continue to do so in future.  Therefore, there is a precedent in this regard that was applied by the European Commission.</p> <p>  I believe some lessons have been learned from that experience with regard to the extent of those interline agreements and the number of routings on which they should apply to ensure that consumer interests are protected across the breadth of destinations to which customers wish to travel.  Several factors are in place to enable connections between carriers, including commitments on minimum connecting times through to check-in of bags and passengers in order that customers can receive their onward boarding passes at their point of origin and competitive fare rates to deal with the remuneration of funds between the two parties in order to ensure competitive fares can be offered.  All of these need to be considered.  There is a precedent of sorts from the BA BMI deal, albeit one which we believe should be enhanced to ensure it is more effective.  That precedent could be learned from and the lessons applied in the case of IAG and Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

Is that the case?</p></speech>

If IAG were to come to Virgin Atlantic and offer us an interline agreement on commercial terms - that is how these things happen in the course of normal commercial business between carriers which can see an opportunity to complement one another's services - we would of course be perfectly happy to engage in those conversations.  However, that is most unlikely given that the routes on which we would be flowing customers from Ireland onto our long-haul network are parallel to routes or services that BA operates.  That is most unlikely to happen through the normal channels.  BA or IAG could give a commitment to the Irish Government in its capacity as a shareholder but the backstop of this being in legislation through the European Commission is where the precedent lies and is perhaps the most likely course of action from here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.925" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1058" speakername="Patrick O'Donovan" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015040200002#D00500"><p>I welcome the representatives of Virgin.  I wish to ask some questions on the interline agreements.  Is it fair to say there is nothing stopping IAG from entering into an interline agreement with Virgin tomorrow morning, for example?  In that case, does this have more to do with the commercial impact on Virgin than any potential impact on the travelling Irish passenger?  What is the nature of the arrangements already made?  Does Virgin have interline agreements with KLM and Air France?  Does Virgin have any interline agreements with Austrian Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines or Lufthansa?  Has Virgin any interline agreements with other entities, such as Iberia, which is now part of IAG?  If so, did they continue?</p> <p>  Mr. Thompson said that both of the hubs that were channelling most of the traffic through to Ireland were operated by Virgin's principal competitor.  That is fair enough, but there has been nothing stopping Virgin down through the years, or since 1984, from operating out of Ireland.  All of a sudden Virgin has a major interest in Ireland.  Is it not remarkable that Virgin's first public interest in Ireland comes about when someone is offering to buy the minority stake in the airline?  While Mr. Thompson may be agnostic with regard to whether Virgin is in favour of or against it, does it not smack of good timing that Virgin now has an interest in what the Irish travelling public might or might not want and yet over the past 30 years, Virgin has chosen not to service the island at all?</p></speech>

I thought that was a little unusual.</p> <p>  I am keen to tease out how it is that Virgin representatives have come before the committee today.  Has Virgin made a submission to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport in Ireland?  Could Mr. Thompson provide us with some insight into what engagement Virgin has had with the relevant Irish stakeholders?  For example, can Mr. Thompson provide us with some detail of how Virgin believes that its position might impact on the business and tourism sector in Ireland?  Can Virgin provide us with some insight on what level of engagement the company has had with stakeholders here, including political stakeholders?</p> <p>  Let us consider the plans of Virgin for the future.  Let us suppose that this offer is not accepted and any new indicative offer, if it is lodged, is not accepted either.  Does Virgin have a plan B, C or D for Aer Lingus in terms of growing a relationship with Aer Lingus in future?</p> <p>  Has Virgin any plans in respect of use of Dublin Airport?  I know from previous engagements at the committee that there is excess capacity in Dublin Airport at the moment.  Several airlines are looking at the possibility of developing a north Atlantic hub out of Dublin.  Has Virgin looked at that?</p> <p>  Mr. Thompson said he does not want the Irish travelling public to have this issue proceed unchecked.  That is a little unfair.  Mr. Thompson may or may not be aware that this committee spent weeks in advance of the Government decision engaging with everyone who had an interest in this from Irish point of view.  Mr. Thompson may wish to reflect on that.</p></speech>

Virgin Atlantic has interline agreements with a number of carriers.  However, what we have observed in recent years is those interline relationships becoming tighter.  I am keen to emphasise the importance of those interline agreements being effective in facilitating smooth connections for customers.</p><p>As I described earlier, the likelihood of IAG engaging with Virgin Atlantic to put in place an effective interline agreement between our two airlines is extremely low, given the fact that all of our long-haul services compete head-to-head with BA-operated services.</p></speech>

That is my understanding of the thrust of what Mr. Thompson said.  I asked about Austrian Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines, Lufthansa, KLM and Air France, which are the biggest groupings in Europe.  Surely Mr. Thompson can indicate whether Virgin Atlantic has ongoing interline agreements with those airlines.</p></speech>

For example, the only services that are operated by Air France and KLM into our main base at Heathrow are those from Amsterdam and Paris, which are their major hubs, and pretty much every destination that we serve from Heathrow is served directly from Amsterdam or Paris, so there is much less consumer benefit in enabling those connections versus the wealth of destinations that are served out of London today.  The breadth and depth of the schedule out of London and the popularity with Irish consumers of making connections via our UK airport not just at Heathrow but at Gatwick and Manchester, in partnership with an effective interline agreement with attractive rates, allow competitive fares to be offered and enable smooth transfers with good access to seats on one another's flights.  The important point is that not all interline agreements are created equal.  There is a big difference between an effective interline agreement and standard IATA-type interlining, which really does not enable significant passenger flows.</p></speech>

The equivalent figure for British Airways - it is driven in part by the need to connect between Heathrow and Gatwick in this case - is 65,000.  There is a big multiple in the number of customers who connect between Aer Lingus-operated flights and Virgin Atlantic-operated flights at Heathrow relative to those who connect between British Airways-operated flights and Virgin Atlantic-operated flights today.  From memory, the multiple is of the order of five or six times, and that is despite the fact that we do have a partial remedy in place to the BA-BMI transaction that allows us to make better interline connections between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic today at Heathrow than would have been the case without that remedy.  It is a partial remedy and it still only delivers a fraction of the benefits to consumers that our existing partnership with Aer Lingus provides.</p> <p>  Some other points were made as well, specifically with regard to Virgin Atlantic's interest in the Ireland market.  The reality of aviation, and specifically long-haul aviation, is that it is very difficult for an airline to operate long-haul services away from its home market and its main bases.  We have had experience of that ourselves in operating flights between Hong Kong and Sydney.  It is a very difficult thing to achieve, to operate those services away from the home base, but to imply that Virgin Atlantic has not had an interest in the Irish market over the last 30 years is absolutely not the case.  We have sold tickets very effectively in the Irish market for many years, making use of our partnership with Aer Lingus in a relationship that has worked very well for both parties, and more importantly has worked very well for Irish consumers.</p></speech>

We had Aer Lingus Regional, which is Stobart Air, before the committee.  Their representatives did not seem to have any concerns.  The company has an eight- to ten-year agreement with Aer Lingus.  In the past ten to 15 years, has Virgin Atlantic decided to provide a service to Irish people in any of the airports in Ireland in order to provide competition?  I am in business myself and I know that the more people are involved in a sector, the more competition there is.  If Virgin Atlantic is worried about Irish people, has it considered providing a service, for example, from Dublin Airport or Knock airport in order to introduce more competition to the market?  The airport at Knock was wide open for new business.  The same is true of Shannon and Cork airports.  We are worried about competition.</p></speech>

Our perspective is that we do provide a very valuable advantage to Irish consumers through the connections we are able to offer and the choice we are able to create for consumers by working in partnership with Aer Lingus on flights operated between the UK and Ireland.  It is a long-standing relationship and significant volumes of customers use the flights.  Just as we were arriving at the gate and chatting to John on the door, he described his experience of doing exactly that a few years ago to fly between Dublin and JFK in New York.  He flew with Aer Lingus and then connected onto the Virgin Atlantic-operated long-haul service.  It is a long-standing relationship and it is a very effective one.  We are very proud to serve the Irish market in that way.</p></speech>

All of that protection is in place for a customer who buys a through ticket in a way that it is not when a customer makes a through connection and journey times are shorter, because there is no requirement to collect bags and check them in again.</p></speech>

My impression is that it is akin to the people in the stand in Croke Park who know how to win the all-Ireland but if they are asked to put on the jersey they do not want to do it.  There is one way to do this in order to provide competition.  Virgin Atlantic and every other airline should be prepared to put on the jersey, as that is how one makes competition.  It is the same in any walk of life.  If I have a shop down the road and someone else also has a shop then we are in competition.  I do not know where this is coming from - perhaps it is the EU - but there is no competition in banks in this country at the moment, and I do not think the EU is overly worried about competition in airlines.  We would appreciate it more if Virgin Atlantic said it would come into the Irish market and put it up to everyone else, including Aer Lingus.  Virgin Atlantic should consider that, rather than pointing out things in the same way all of us can, like the hurler on the ditch.  I would advise Mr. Thompson to consider getting involved in the Irish market.  In case he is not aware, we have great airports in Ireland, including those in Knock, Limerick, Cork and Dublin.  Virgin Atlantic's approach should be to bring competition to the market.</p></speech>

I hope there will be more direct service to long-haul destinations for Irish consumers from Irish airports in the future, whether operated by Virgin Atlantic or by other operators, but in reviewing the transaction it is important to look at the market today and the competitive dynamics that exist and think about what action will best serve the interests of Irish consumers.</p></speech>

I recognise and applaud the efforts of the committee and others in Ireland to review the impact of the proposed transaction between IAG and Aer Lingus.  The simple and prevalent way of looking at these arrangements in the past was to think about what the aeroplanes do.  This is the most visible demonstration of how an airline operates.  Flights operate between point A and point B and much of the focus in this case has been on the overlapping routes that Aer Lingus and BA operate today between Ireland and the UK.  That fails to recognise that customers and consumers often do different things from what the airline does.  If there is not a direct service between two points, customers must make connections, and the interests of those consumers are just as important as the interests of point-to-point consumers on direct flights.  Our perspective is the interest of those consumers, with which the interests of Virgin Atlantic Airlines and many of our competitors at Heathrow are aligned.  We are here today and have expressed our concerns about how elements, and potential consequences, of the transaction are related to a group of consumers whose interests have not been reflected so far.</p> <p>  Regarding the need to deal with changing competitive dynamics in the marketplace, we do that all the time.  The airline industry is susceptible to changing external conditions and we must deal with it all the time.  We do so and will continue to do so in the course of our everyday business.  Where a transaction between a company creates consumer harm, regulators have a responsibility to act, and we are trying to highlight the interest of a group of consumers whose interests have not been reflected in the debate to date.</p></speech>

I have a certain amount of sympathy with them from a commercial standpoint, as it seems on the face of it that if the deal goes through they will be adversely affected in terms of passenger numbers.  I am sure the witnesses are aware that Aer Lingus indicated that it was to purchase two new long-haul aircraft, one of which would be used to create a direct Dublin to Los Angeles connection.  It will certainly happen if the takeover goes through.</p><p>An element of the proposed takeover that has not been touched on by anyone is the attractiveness of Dublin as a hub because of US immigration pre-clearance, which is unique to these islands in western Europe.  It is a big pull factor.  Does Mr. Thompson agree that, in the event of an IAG takeover, there will be a considerable focus by IAG on ensuring that Dublin is developed as a hub, taking more passengers out of the UK mainland airports, which may have a knock-on effect on Virgin Atlantic Airlines' services out of Manchester, and that inevitably it will boost its transatlantic services because there will be no point in taking over Aer Lingus to maintain the <i>status quo</i>?  It will heavily market Dublin, according to what it is saying.  That is at the core of where Mr. Thompson's concerns are.  It will directly affect passenger numbers currently coming out of Ireland, which is a difficulty for all of us here.  One of the attractions of the takeover is that more people, at least in theory, will come into Ireland than leave it to connect because there is an enhanced service out of Dublin as an international hub for transatlantic flights.  From a tourism and economic point of view, that has great attraction for us.  Anything that reduces the number of people leaving the country to connect in the UK is of advantage to us.  That is why I am focusing on what Virgin Atlantic Airlines has raised about the number of passengers coming out of Ireland.  Does Mr. Thompson agree that the core of his concerns is the loss of business?  I agree with Mr. Thompson that where there has been consolidation in the airline business, not just with BMI and British Airways, there has unquestionably been a reduction in route choice and an increase in air fares.  What I cannot understand, going back to what my colleague Deputy Michael Fitzmaurice said, is why Virgin Atlantic Airlines has not considered moving a transatlantic service out of Dublin.  Inevitably, what will happen is that British Airways, the main competitor of Virgin Atlantic Airlines on international long-haul routes out of the UK, will hit the business of Virgin Atlantic Airlines.  It will do so severely because of the advantage of a developing hub for international and long-haul transatlantic traffic out of Dublin and the immigration pre-clearance facility, which will be well marketed in the UK.  It will be a major pull factor.  This is the context in which I will put questions.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with Virgin Atlantic Airlines coming to say that this will damage its business.  I was surprised to hear Mr. Thompson say he was agnostic about this because, if I was in his shoes, I would not be agnostic but totally against it.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Thompson not agree that, based on experience, it is inevitable that the current interline agreement between Aer Lingus and Virgin Atlantic Airlines will disappear?  Mr. Thompson has already mentioned the experience of BMI, where the interline agreements disappeared overnight.  From a competitive point of view, why would IAG continue to tolerate the type of interline agreement that exists between Virgin Atlantic Airlines, a major competitor, and Aer Lingus?  Surely it would disappear.  Is that a concern of Mr. Thompson?</p></speech>

There is a precedent for such action in the case of British Airways and BMI that preserves those interline agreements.  As I stated earlier, some lessons can be learned from that experience to ensure that a remedy is more effective this time around.  It is correct that the interline agreement will go away in any useful form if there is no remedy to it and the transaction proceeds.</p></speech>

We are in the process of making a submission to the Commission outlining very similar arguments to what we have laid out today.</p> <p>  There was a point as to whether there is a commercial impact on Virgin Atlantic and I have been quite transparent in saying there is such an impact.  There is also a commercial impact on a number of other airlines which currently operate in partnership with Aer Lingus today who are not IAG or IAG partners.  We operate in a commercial world and airlines must deal with changing market conditions.  In such a scenario we would have to find a way to adapt to the new world in the way we adapt to a new world every day.  The important point is that Irish consumers will not have that option.  We would seek other partners and we might change the size of aircraft or timing of flights to ensure we can adapt to the new world in the way we do.  We should not have to do that as appropriate remedies should be applied.  Nevertheless, we have the ability to do that but the Irish consumer does not have that choice.  There was a point about Ireland and Dublin becoming more of a hub for flights, particularly across the Atlantic.  We would welcome that coming about and we support competition.  We have competed intensely with a number of airlines over many years, and if this comes about, we will compete with future services</p> <p>  To apply a network planner's view, one of the key enablers of a really strong hub is the size of the local market and the customers who want to travel point-to-point through flight services.  If there is a strong local market that can be supplemented with feed, one would be in a really strong position.  The size of the long-haul market from Heathrow is 27 million passengers per year, and the size of the local market from Dublin is 3 million passengers per year.  I am sure there are opportunities for expansion in long-haul services in Dublin for the right airline, and that is what every country, city and airport wants.  When it comes about, we will compete with it effectively.  It is important at this point to examine the competitive position as it is today; second-guessing what will happen in future is very difficult.  We need to examine consumer behaviour and the impact this transaction would have on those consumers and their choice.</p></speech>

The substantial issue is our national airline, our airports, the Irish economy in general and how we can attract business.  There is a related connectivity aspect and, naturally, we must consider the competitive nature of the airline business and the good of the Irish consumer.  I am very much aware of the needs of people who wish to travel to this country because of our tourism industry.</p> <p>  The witness mentioned the hub issue with regard to Dublin.  If we are talking about becoming a major hub in world aviation, one may need to take account of Shannon, Cork and Knock as well as Dublin.  The regional airports would also feed into the system.  The precedent has been set in the Persian Gulf states and we can see the success of those major hubs in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere in the oil-rich states for the Atlantic trade and connectivity with America, Europe, Australia and Asia.  We should go down that route.</p> <p>  It is good to hear the witnesses' concerns but I am in favour of an independent analysis.  Perhaps the Government should seek the opinion of aviation experts, if they exist, who would be totally independent.  Perhaps we could find three people who have been involved with the industry and who have much experience to give us an overview of what would be good for Ireland.  They could advise us on IAG possibly taking over Aer Lingus and what would be good all round.  We are a small island.  I respect the view of the witnesses but we must consider the bigger picture.  Policies are changing and we must be very careful that EU policy would not be geared towards the big players of Germany and France.  That will influence American policies and they would probably link to this.</p></speech>

That is a matter for the Irish Government in its capacity as shareholder of Aer Lingus.  I have come here to represent a perspective on behalf of a group of consumers whose voice we are not sure has been heard loudly enough through the process so far.  There was a point about inward tourism and investment and greater choice drives down prices while improving levels of service.  It creates demand and more business; it is a virtuous circle.  Constraining that process in any way can only have the opposite effect.  The opinions and concerns we are expressing today are aligned with the specific interests outlined by the Deputy.</p></speech>

For me there was a very narrow focus in terms of asking the witness to come before the committee and it was based on documentation he sent to the committee clearly outlining a potential issue for consumers.  Mr. Thompson's motivation in terms of his commercial interest is irrelevant but he has identified a problem which, if it is not properly addressed with remedies, is an issue for consumers.  That is the only reason I sought the witness here.  I thank him for doing that.  He has done a good job of outlining that and it should be clear to him, with the reaction of some of the committee members, that he has done a good job.</p> <p>  The witness has spoken about presenting a paper to the European Commission which, using his considerable aviation experience, will set out a series of remedies he believes have potential to protect those consumers.  Will the witness circulate that document to this committee when it is done, or at an appropriate time?  It would be helpful in preparation of the members' report.  As an Opposition spokesperson, my desire is to try to ensure the Government gives due consideration to those issues, and to the potential solutions, if it decides to go ahead with selling its share.  That would certainly help the people, even if the Government wants to hide from the concerns expressed by the witness.</p></speech>

The witness said he felt the consumer was not being adequately protected in the process, and taking up Deputy Kenny's point, I believe that is unfair to this committee and the work it has done, particularly given the number of meetings held on this issue.  I would like Mr. Thompson to give some insight as to what Irish stakeholders he met, such as industry leaders and political representatives, before he formulated his position in the best interests, he says, of the Irish people.

From a brief look on the Internet, I believe there are three million direct seats into Ireland from North America, by a whole host of airlines, including US Airways and Aer Lingus.  A quick search of the eastbound flights of Etihad and Emirates airlines shows more than 500,000 seats direct into Ireland.  I would have thought that if the witness was telling the committee this was such a bad deal, he would be able to tell us, based on statistics, exactly why it would be such a bad deal.</p></speech>

I may be overlapping here so forgive me.  The witness referred in one of his letters to further important examples where more than 15,000 passengers currently connect via Manchester, Gatwick or Heathrow each year from Dublin, with effective competition between British Airways and another carrier on the long-haul route of San Francisco-Vancouver-Hong Kong.  My original premise was that one of the attractions of the IAG proposal is that it would grow passenger numbers out of Dublin into the Irish economy.</p><p>Mr. Thompson addressed that in terms of economies of scale relating to Heathrow and Dublin airports, but I am sure he would agree that any increase into Dublin would be of benefit to the Irish economy.</p><p> Does Mr. Thompson have any figures for inward passengers using Virgin Atlantic's transatlantic service?  He cited a figure of 15,000 which, I presume, means outward.  Does he have any way of assessing whether there is any added value to the Irish economy via connectivity by Irish consumers going through those three airports and using his services?  Extracting the 15,000 outward, does Mr. Thompson have any inward figures for people using it in reverse, that is, Virgin Atlantic using the onward connections by Aer Lingus into Ireland?  Is it part of Virgin Atlantic's remit, as a commercial organisation, to actively encourage tourist numbers?  For example, does Virgin Atlantic work with British Tourism or F&aacute;ilte Ireland in providing attractive packages for its international passengers to visit the UK and, by extension, Ireland?</p><p> In recent years, the Irish Government has been successfully attempting to attract Far Eastern customers.  As Mr. Thompson will be aware, until recently, someone using long-haul services in the Far East or Middle East who wanted to tour Europe could get a visa for the UK but not one to come to Ireland.  In the main, however, they can do so now.  That must be of some benefit to Virgin Atlantic because it means it is providing an attractive option, primarily for the tourist market but also for business passengers.</p><p> Keeping in mind that Virgin Atlantic is providing an alternative option for consumers, I am trying to establish if there are any advantages to the Irish economy by the airline's continuing use of this service and its connection with Aer Lingus.</p></speech>

I have been with Virgin Atlantic for a number of years and in that time I have been a country manager in India and Hong Kong where our entire remit is around creating demand from those markets to visit the UK and onward connections with partner carriers.  We work closely with a number of tourist boards and tour operators to come up with joint promotions to develop and build those markets.  We want to bring customers into those markets, as well as providing choice for consumers who are travelling on outbound itineraries.</p> <p>  The mix of inward and outbound varies significantly by route.  On a route like the Caribbean or some of our more leisure-oriented destinations, travel will mainly be outbound.  However, it is a much more even flow of traffic to destinations like Los Angeles or Chicago.</p></speech>

The short answer to all this is that choice is good for all customers.  Whether they are travelling for business or leisure, to or from Ireland, preserving choice and competition creates growth, opportunity and a competitive environment that, in turn, leads to more growth.</p> <p>  Going back to the Senator's point about the opportunity for growth at the Dublin hub, I can completely understand the rationale for that and the drive behind it.  I hope it happens because that will clearly be a benefit for Irish consumers.  However, the reality is that the breadth and depth of the schedule from Dublin will not match that of other larger hubs and, therefore, there will always be a role for connecting customers.  There is a role for connecting customers in every large city because some markets simply do not have the volume of traffic to support a direct service.  The interests of those consumers who will continue to use connecting itineraries need to be looked after.</p></speech>

Mr. Thompson referred to Virgin Atlantic's reluctance to come into Ireland and stated the reasons for that from lessons learned in the UK.  My impression is that there is already competition among a number of airlines coming into or flying from Ireland.  It is about 40% Ryanair and 40% Aer Lingus.  If the IAG takeover goes ahead, therefore, the new arrangement would not have a monopoly on flights out of Ireland.  I find it difficult to understand why Mr. Thompson is reluctant to get involved in the competition.  IAG would not have the dominance of the Irish market then and Ryanair would be equal to it anyway.</p></speech>

Ryanair is a phenomenal airline and a formidable competitor for certain types of traffic, but it does not address all the needs of the market.  There are two specific customer groups that Ryanair does not address, but over which Aer Lingus and British Airways have the dominant position.  The first group is time-sensitive point-to-point customers, particularly those who value access to Heathrow, as well as the depth of schedule and proximity to central London that Heathrow offers.  That cannot be replicated by Ryanair's current schedule.</p> <p>  The second group is connecting customers.  That is because Ryanair, which is a hugely successful and impressive no-frills low-cost carrier, does not offer interline connections with other carriers.  The competition that Ryanair provides only addresses part of the market, and the interests of those other groups need to be reflected.</p></speech>

Who is Virgin Atlantic's biggest feed partner, as we are today?  We have spoken a lot about feed partners and deals, but who is Virgin Atlantic's biggest feed partner today?</p> <p>  Mr. Thompson may not be able to answer this from a commercial point of view, but what would Virgin Atlantic's options be with regard to Ireland, first, if the deal goes ahead and, second, if it does not go ahead?  He was asked a question earlier about employment and how many people Virgin Atlantic has in Ireland. Would that change?  One of the big things in earlier discussions with IAG concerned employment losses or gains.  Perhaps Mr. Thompson could address those two questions: first, about Virgin Atlantic's biggest feed partner today and, second, the options open to Virgin Atlantic if the deal goes ahead or does not.</p></speech>

Something else came up which distracted me.  On the legal guarantees IAG has offered, first it offered the five-year guarantees.  The Government has said it is looking for something longer like ten years.  Is it unusual in the airline industry to offer such guarantees?  Certainly to us, it appears to be unusual to give guarantees on the retention of slots.  Are there problems in making a guarantee like that?  From many people's perspective, they are not worth the paper they are printed on and things can change.  I am curious about Mr. Thompson's views in that regard.</p> <p>  In terms of competition, Mr. Thompson said Aer Lingus is Virgin's biggest feed partner.  Would there be any repercussions from this merger for Virgin's operations?  Mr. Thompson has not given an opinion on whether he agrees or disagrees with the merger, but is there a possibility that his own airline could lose out?  It is clear that Aer Lingus has been very successful.  Its passenger numbers are up.  There are 11 million passengers and they have been expanding.  Is it Mr. Thompson's belief that IAG is solely after the slots for long-haul services?  Certainly a combination of that is in its game plan.  Long haul is very important to IAG and it needs more long haul.  I do not know if Mr. Thompson can answer those questions but it would be interesting if he would give us an opinion.  These are some of the things we think are behind this.</p></speech>

Two forms of remedy are common.  One is commitments to give up slots on certain routes to encourage competition for other airlines to come onto those routes.  Those are often multi-year in duration but they do not have a very successful track record of being effective because it is not easy competing with a monopoly provider who is well entrenched with frequent flyers and the corporate customer base.  We have learned that from our experience operating flights on remedy slots between Heathrow and Edinburgh and Aberdeen.  Similarly, there is a precedent from the IAG acquisition of BMI where the legacy interline arrangements between the legacy partners of British Midlands were protected for a period of time.  They were only partially protected and we think it is possible to learn from that experience to apply a more effective remedy.  That is what we would call on the European Commission to do this time.  There is a clear precedent for those types of remedies to be multi-year in duration with a period to review at a point in time to observe if competitive harm has been amended via other means.</p></speech>

The regulator in England said some of the slots would have to be offloaded for competition reasons.</p></speech>

There was a period where there was a lag between the BA-BMI transaction being concluded and those slots being available for other operators to commence service in competition.  There was a period of monopoly for British Airways after the acquisition of BMI and before Virgin Atlantic commenced its domestic services.  That is one of the challenges we faced.  The barriers to entry become higher when there is a period of monopoly service provision.</p></speech>

It was a useful discussion.  As has been demonstrated by the questions asked, the members want to examine this matter thoroughly and to get the best deal for the Irish people and Irish passengers.  The witnesses have fed into that debate which has been helpful.  There may be further information to provide in relation to some of the questions.  That can be supplied to the clerk to circulate to members.</p></speech>
