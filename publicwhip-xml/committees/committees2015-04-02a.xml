This morning we will be focusing on issues related to the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period prior to 2008 in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  In our first session we will hear from a representative of Jones Lang LaSalle, Mr. John Moran.  Jones Lang LaSalle is an international professional services and investment management firm which offers specialised real estate services, with annual fee revenue of $4.7 billion and gross revenue of $5.4 billion.  It has more than 230 corporate offices and operates in 80 countries.  It has a global workforce of approximately 58,000.  It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.  Jones Lang LaSalle Ireland was established in 1964 and provides a full service offering across all aspects of Irish real estate.  The company employs 80 people and provides services for occupiers, tenants, developers, landlords, owners, banks and institutions.  Services offered include valuation, sales, letting, acquisition, rent reviews, rating, consultancy advice, research and property management.  Mr. Moran is an international director of Jones Lang LaSalle and managing director of Jones Lang LaSalle Ireland.  He is a qualified chartered valuation surveyor and has been in practice for 29 years.  He joined Jones Lang LaSalle in 1986 and has had various roles within the company.  He was appointed managing director in January 2009 and is still the lead director for the investment department.  His day-to-day role, alongside running the business, is advising on the acquisition and disposal of investment properties on behalf of pension funds, life assurance companies, financial institutions, receivers, private investors, property companies and high net worth individuals.  He is very welcome.</p><p>Before we begin, I advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking them to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Moran to make his opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015040200002#B00100"><p>I have provided the committee with a detailed opening statement which I will run through again this morning.  I was asked to comment on issues relating to the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period up to 2008 in the context of the banking crisis in Ireland.  I will deal with the size and nature of the real estate market in Ireland and I will give a brief overview of Jones Lang LaSalle and the nature of the services that we provide.  I will give broad details of our client base, the sources and extent of funding to the commercial real estate market, the composition of investors in that market, its interrelationship with international markets and investors, and the understanding of risk at the time.<br/><br/>My comments relate to the commercial property market though I will occasionally reference the residential market, particularly as it affected land levies.  The Irish retail real estate market is made up of various components.  There is the residential market, the development land and agricultural market, the investment market and the various occupier markets such as offices, retail, industrial, hotels and licensed and leisure premises.  <br/><br/>Up to 2008 the commercial real estate market was growing strongly.  There were increased levels of purchasing, leasing and construction activity.  Ireland's economy was performing well with GDP and employment driving the expansion.  It is worth remembering that, at that time, we were the fastest growing economy in western Europe, the second wealthiest economy on a <i>per capita</i>basis measured by GDP and we had the fastest growing population in Europe.  During that period unemployment averaged just over 4%, which was effectively full employment.  That is important because the real strength in occupier and investor demand is what was supporting the property market.  That demand was driving activity levels and increases in values and the capital values of Irish commercial investment property increased by 72% in the five-year period up to 30 September 2007, the date we define as the peak of the market in terms of value appreciation.  Property yields were at record levels, which was a reflection of both the strong investor demand and the availability of significant amounts of debt.  The graph on page 1 of my submission shows the 72% appreciation in capital value from Q1 2002 to Q3 2007.<br/><br/>This all translated itself into particularly strong transactional activity.  Between 2004 and 2008, &euro;8 billion worth of commercial investment property was sold in Ireland.  The peak year for investment volumes was 2006, with &euro;3.6 billion traded in 12 months.  For context, this compares to the previous record of &euro;1.2 billion in 2005 and an average of &euro;768 million per annum between 2001 and 2004, and they were record levels in comparison with what had happened in the 30 or 40 years preceding that.  In addition to domestic spending, there was also considerable Irish investment activity overseas, particularly in the UK and continental Europe.  The graph shows the spending patterns of Irish investment in Ireland over the six-year period.  All sectors of the market were active, with demand outstripping supply.  Demand was not solely focused on prime assets, with secondary and tertiary assets also trading.  There was evidence of demand across all size categories and activity was taking place in all locations across the country.<br/><br/>The investment market was characterised by large amounts of money seeking product.  Demand was exceptionally strong, with the vast majority of transactions involving domestic purchasers.  Values really intensified in 2005 and 2006 and so did attitudes towards investment, with investors seeking to move more aggressively up the risk curve and undertake either development in their own right or in conjunction with developers as joint ventures in search of better returns.<br/><br/>Alongside a very strong investment market there were also exceptionally strong occupier markets.  The letting market for offices averaged 2.3 million sq. ft. per annum between 2004 and 2008, totalling 11.6 million sq. ft. over the five years.  This is significantly higher than the 8.8 million sq. ft. in the last five years 2010 to 2014.  The record years for office take-up in Dublin remain 2006 and 2007.  Demand was focused on core, city centre locations, accounting for approximately 60% of take-up per annum.  Traditional banking, financial and professional service companies were driving demand during this period, with a new wave of the technology sector just starting to take off.  Page 3 shows graphically how office take-up compares from 2002 to 2014 and members will see that the peaks were 2005, 2006 and 2007.  In response to that demand there was a response from developers in supplying office construction, with 8.8 million sq. ft. constructed between 2004 and 2008.  This represented a 33% increase on the total stock levels at the end of 2003.<br/><br/>The retail market was also performing strongly, with improvements in the economy boosting consumer sentiment and spending.  A number of international chains and domestic retailers were entering the market and trading well.  As demand continued, vacancy in core schemes and high streets was tightening, with limited choice for occupiers.  The market responded to this with a surge in retail development.  Between 2004 and 2008, total shopping stock in Ireland increased from 13.7 million sq. ft. to 22.4 million sq. ft., an increase of almost 9 million sq. ft. and a lot of this was in provincial locations.  By the end of 2008 Ireland had the second highest shopping stock <i>per capita</i>in Europe.<br/><br/>Other sectors performed relatively steadily in comparison to retail and offices.  Industrial activity was relatively subdued until 2006, when again there was record occupier take-up of 2.9 million sq. ft.  Industrial land values saw significant growth due to a scarcity of supply in areas where people wanted to locate, generally in the south west of the city and in north west Dublin.  Occupiers were predominantly general distribution companies which, as is often the case in the Irish distribution and industrial market, are generally purchasers rather than renters.<br/><br/>The values of commercial property adjusted to this strong demand with significant increases over a short period of time.  Rents experienced similar growth, with prime office rents increasing from &euro;40 to &euro;60 per sq. ft. and retail rents such as on Grafton Street increasing by more than 100%.  Industrial premises also saw rental growth but not at the same pace.  The highest rent levels ever achieved in the market remain 2006 and 2007, which is graphically illustrated on page 5.<br/><br/>In response to very strong occupier markets and investment markets, development land also saw an enormous increase in activity.  The land market always responds to occupier markets and as activity and pricing grew significantly across all sectors this was also mirrored in development land.  Between 2004 and 2006, the number of deals in Ireland increased significantly, reaching over 250 transactions in 2006.  The market was characterised by strong demand from developers and investors, who were chasing product and competitively bidding on all assets that came onto the market.  In 2006, the highest sale price for a development site was achieved, which was &euro;155 million per acre.  This compares to the current top values of approximately between &euro;35 million and &euro;37 million per acre.  There was a push for higher densities by the planning authorities but, in the absence of clear guidelines, many developers factored very ambitious densities into their land pricing.  The underlying strength of the residential market and residential values also contributed enormously to the high levels of land value that pertained.<br/><br/>I was asked to comment on what JLL do in this market so I will run through the details very quickly.  The Chairman has already given members the global overview of the company.  In Dublin we have a full service offering, with expertise across all sectors and processes involved in buying, selling and managing real estate.  This involves investment sales and acquisitions, leasing activity for both landlord and tenant, property and asset management, planning and building services, valuation advisory services, land and research.<br/><br/>Our main area of focus is commercial property across all sectors, namely, office, retail, industrial, land and hotels.  We have undertaken some residential work for clients, but this is not a core specialism.  Our client base varies significantly, but historically our largest client profile is institutional, such as pension funds, life assurance companies and banks.  We have also acted for developers and occupiers and provide a broad service to everybody in the real estate industry.</p><p> From our perspective the advice we give to clients is strategic and consultancy-based.  Given that we act for both landlords and tenants and vendors and purchasers, our aims and objectives vary, depending on the instructions, but in any deal we do or any piece of work we perform our duty of care is to the client.  As we act for buyers, sellers, occupiers and landlords, we have no vested interest in the performance of the market.  We prefer to see a steady performing rising market at the rate of inflation rather than the dramatic booms and busts recently experienced.  </p><p> Our firm's staff have the necessary academic and professional qualifications to work in the property sector.  Most of our staff are members of all relevant professional bodies, including the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Society of Chartered Surveyors in Ireland.  Various other professional organisations are represented within the office.  Being a member of a professional body means that one must adhere to a strict standard and ethic on a daily basis.  It is noteworthy that yesterday, for the eighth consecutive year, Jones Lang LaSalle was announced as being one of the world's most ethical companies by the Ethisphere Institute.</p><p> I will deal next with the sources and extent of funding in the commercial real estate market in Ireland.  It should be noted that we are not directly involved in the funding element of commercial real estate transactions.  Our expertise is in real estate and the details of funding acquisitions and developments are left for discussions between our clients and funding institutions directly.  While we might introduce parties and provide some background information, specific details of terms and agreements did not involve Jones Lang LaSalle and were not shared with us.  Our view of funding conditions relates to what our clients told us and what was common knowledge in Ireland at the time.  </p><p> Between 2004 and 2008 the largest sources of funding for the commercial real estate market were domestic banks, the UK representatives which had offices here and a couple of European banks.  I do not think I need to name them as everybody knows who they are.  Each bank had a differing exposure and concentration across all sectors.  We were sure at the time that there was a lot of funding available in the marketplace.  We were not involved in final loan-to-value calculations between our clients and the banks, but we are aware that loans were available at high value ratios.  Funding was also available for almost every type of property transaction, whether for a pure investment purchase or a speculative development.  Initially, a significant proportion of the lending was non-recourse, that is, the asset was the only security that the bank held.  With the benefit of hindsight, the practice of borrowers giving personal guarantees to secure debt became increasingly common in 2006 and 2007 and led to significant cross-collateralisation of debt.  Any further detail of funding and lending during this time would be more accurate coming directly from the banks, lenders and borrowers.  Aside from the banks, the market was also awash with a lot of equity, which leads me on to my penultimate comments on the composition of investors in the Irish commercial real estate market.</p><p> The major players in Ireland were domestic and accounted for approximately 90% of all investment volumes between 2005 and 2007.  They were a mix of private syndicates, private high net worth individuals, institutions and developers.  The largest proportion of transactions were undertaken by private Irish individuals or syndicates.  These purchasers were backed by funding from banks, with very limited, if any, pure cash purchases.  There were also a number of purchasers who were backed by equity.  The broad investor profile comes from four sets of investor: private syndicates that used pooled equity and debt; private high net worth individuals who used a mix of equity and debt; and institutions such as pension funds and life assurance companies which purchased with 100% equity.  The developers were the final cohort and used equity and significant amounts of debt.  Over time it became less certain how much actual cash was employed as opposed to equity release lending.  Overseas investors had a limited presence in Ireland during this time, as pricing had intensified significantly and Irish real estate was regarded as too expensive for international investors.  Up until the current cycle, the Irish market had traditionally been domestic in nature, with a very limited international input, other than occupiers.  It was regarded as an expensive market in the period to 2008 and, as a consequence, there was limited overseas investment in Ireland during this time.  I have graphically demonstrated on page 8 of my submission how yields tightened between 2003 and 2006.  They compressed from 6% to 3.7% for offices.  At these levels, international investors were priced out of the market, with more competitive yields available in other European countries.</p><p> A noteworthy feature of the time was that Irish purchasers were not just focused on domestic assets.  Significant levels of Irish money were spent across Europe and the world.  In particular, it was reported in 2006 that Irish investors had invested approximately &euro;3.5 billion in the United Kingdom and a further &euro;2 billion in the rest of Europe and the USA.</p><p> As a real estate advisory firm, it is our job to advise clients on real estate issues.  It is, therefore, imperative that we understand levels and impact of risk.  Prior to the banking crisis, we were advising our clients on the nature and impacts of the property market and how it was performing.  Any advice was informed and reinforced with key primary research data.  We collect and monitor research for each property sector, with some of our data sets dating back to the early 1970s.  We believe our advice was strategic, using our expert opinion to assess, for example, saleability and letting ability at the time.  We would provide details for clients on end-use values based on current market levels, providing strategic advice on sentiment and general market performance.  Any valuation we provided for clients was carried out in accordance with the RICS Red Book Guidance Notes and based on evidence of historical market values.  It is very important to understand valuation reports are not forward-looking documents; they are a snapshot in time based on current market evidence.  It is not within our scope or remit as real estate advisers to put any application to these numbers, particularly in order to generate future projections, unless we are asked to do so.  Our clients take our advice and it is their responsibility to apply our recommendations to their models to generate cash flows, repayment models and profit and loss projections for themselves.  From this, they can formulate their own inputs and assumptions, but that is not a process in which we are involved.  The responsibility for this lies with the property owners and, we assume, their bankers.</p><p> I will give an example of how this worked on an almost daily basis.  There were numerous development sites sold in Dublin at the time.  We would have given numbers to our clients and appraised the value of sites.  We would have said to our clients that they could bid X for them.  Any number of times developers or clients came back and said, "I am going to bid X plus 20% or X plus 50%."  We had no input into these decisions and, frankly, were always unsure as to how they had come to these conclusions.  </p><p> The strong demand from investors and occupiers essentially was what dictated market performance during this period and drove market activity.  It is important to note that a functioning property market is not driven purely by value.  Capital values are often used as an indicator to show how a market is performing.  Value can be affected by a variety of factors.  As well as value, to determine what is a functioning property market we also consider depth.  A more reliable method for assessing whether a market is functioning properly is focusing on demand and supply, using market transactions and depth.  Having  lived through the horrendous recession in recent years we all run the risk of forgetting what the market was actually like in 2005 and 2006.  There was enormous depth to it.  Any asset for sale had a number of bidding investors in competition with one another.  As 2007 and 2008 developed, we saw that there were risks in the market.  The warning signs were a shallowing of the depth of bidders in the market, a shallowing of the depth of occupiers and the fact that house prices had started to wobble.  We noticed that the number of bidders during the sales process had started to decrease significantly.  As a consequence, we advised most of our client base not to participate in the market on the buy-side and, where appropriate, we advised clients to sell.  We did this in 2005, which at the end of 2006 had proved to be the wrong decision.  Anyone who did not buy at the end of 2005 had lost the opportunity to participate in an additional 40% capital growth.  It was only in 2008 that this decision proved to be correct.  I can assure the committee that it was not a populist decision and we were not very popular for doing it.  </p><p> We think our client investors were aware of risks at the time.  The market in Ireland is relatively transparent and it would have been impossible not to have been aware of some of these signs, as transaction processes are open.</p><p>There is reasonable availability for sharing information and data.  Data is a big issue in the Irish real estate market and I will happily talk about it later if necessary.</p><p> Jones Lang produced a transparency index in 2006.  We were ranked the 15th most transparent market in the world which is a "high" transparency category.  We are now in the top ten in the world because there have been improvements in transparency over recent years.</p><p> Other participants in the marketplace, such as investors, developers and the banks had the benefit of professional advice, or had significant in-house expertise to assist in their decision-making processes.  By 2008, there was a recognition within the property industry that market conditions were over-heating, however, I do not believe that most market participants realised the extent of bank lending to the property market, and second, that we would ever witness the collapse in value that subsequently occurred, which was due to an extraordinary confluence of global macro-economic events, combined with an over-reliance on debt in the property market.</p></speech>

I will deal with Mr. Moran's concluding comments before calling the first questioner this morning.  Mr. Moran spoke about how Jones Lang viewed the market between 2006 and 2007.  Does Jones Lang employ or retain its own economists or does it buy in financial intelligence that specialises in property market trends and developments?</p></speech>

I would be lying if I said we did.  At that time we felt that values had appreciated so significantly they were bound to have a correction at some stage.  We never envisaged the adjustment that took place afterwards.  A normal valuation correction that one would expect in a market that had six years of exceptional growth is between 5% and 15% for investment property, perhaps 30% for development land.

It is important that it is done on a specific date because property is not a static asset.  It changes so it is only a snapshot in time.  It is our best assessment of the open market value that would be agreed by a willing seller and willing buyer acting without compulsion.  That is the definition contained within the Red Book.</p><p>It has to be based on an appraisal of evidence of current sale prices, current rental values, current property yields and real transactions in the marketplace at the time.  It must use the most up-to-date and relevant evidence for the specific property involved.  We then take that evidence into account.  We adapt it for location, the size of the property and the type of the property.  In an investment, we will analyse the length of the lease and look at the strength of the covenant.  We ask whether it has the ability to pay the rent and the potential for future rental growth.  We determine whether the property itself is over rented or under rented.  All those components are taken into account, and that will deal with most investment values.</p><p> Development land values are slightly different.  We use an approach called the residual valuation approach.  What we do is estimate what the completed value of the development will be, less the cost to bring it there, and that generally gives the residual value, which should be the land value.  We test that against market evidence, which is based on the value per square foot and per acre being paid for sites.  That is the general process.</p></speech>

Without being flippant, obviously when somebody buys for a price in excess of the valuation price, they see something significant in the property that is more valuable to them than perhaps anybody else in the marketplace.  It can happen particularly with land value.  Perhaps people assume buildings can be constructed on the site at a higher density than one assumed in the valuation.  Perhaps they have assumed a lower building cost than the valuer has assumed.  Land value <i>per se</i>is volatile and can move around with investment value.  One would be disappointed if one&rsquo;s valuations were being exceeded all the time in sales.<br/><br/>One thing that is important to understand, though, is that valuation is backwards looking; it is not forward looking.  Values are based on the most recent previous evidence.  Therefore, if a buyer wants to make a market by paying more, he is entitled to do so.  It is vitally important that it be understood that we are not market makers.</p></speech>

The professional bodies, I think, were happy enough with it because it meant there was absolutely no risk of somebody trying to increase the value to increase the fee, so it suited from everybody&rsquo;s perspective.</p></speech>

That would be in general property advice that we would be giving to people.  Where we would have been talking to them about pricing and the prospects for their assets, or otherwise, we would have given forward-looking advice but a valuation does not give forward-looking advice; it is set at the specific date and time.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran referred to a valuation at a particular point in time but he is aware of risks coming down the line.  Does that not affect the valuation being set?  Does the valuer not have to take that into account in some way, even if it is just looking at future rent yields?</p></speech>

It is really important to understand that.  A valuation is set at the particular time.  In calculating the investment yield, will we look at the prospects for the future rental growth and for the property and will we look at the duration of the receipt of income?  Absolutely, we will, and we will take that yield and start to adjust that yield, but what tends to happen in real estate, in particular, is that it is a lagging indicator.  Generally, what happens is that by the time one makes the projections, the transaction will have happened already, and this will have set a new benchmark.  One has to take into account the evidence one has and also make judgment calls on how one believes the property will perform.  However, that will relate purely to the yield one has chosen.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran said in page 5 of his submission that, "The practice of borrowers giving personal guarantees to secure debt became increasingly common in 2006 / 2007, and led to significant cross-collaboration of debt".  What would his relationship be with the funding of a transaction?  He said he introduces parties.</p></speech>

We do not introduce parties per se to banks or otherwise; that is not part of our role.  We have no involvement in the debt markets whatsoever.  Obviously, we would know what would be going on when somebody is buying a piece of property.  We understand and realise that they go to the banks to seek their funding.  What became very clear &ndash; some of this is with the benefit of hindsight &ndash; is that personal guarantees became quite common in 2006 and 2007, in particular.  What that really meant was that the banks started making their lending decisions based primarily on the apparent net worth of the borrower rather than the real underlying value of the security.  That is one of the issues that we have.  Those personal guarantees meant that the lending practices started to look away from the actual real estate itself and relied-----</p></speech>

In page 5 of his statement, under the heading &ldquo;Sources and extent of funding of the commercial real estate market in Ireland&rdquo;, Mr. Moran uses the phrase, &ldquo;Whilst we may introduce parties&rdquo;.   I think this is what Deputy Murphy was referring to.  Mr.  Moran is on the record as saying he is introducing parties.  Perhaps he could clarify that.</p></speech>

We provide two services when it comes to investment property: we sell investments and we also provide buy-side advice.  Therefore, when somebody comes in to us and wants to buy an investment, he will either be fully backed by equity or will say to us he will use debt as part of the transaction.

There was a variety of people.  There were private syndicators, private wealth managers, stockbroking firms and the private banking arms of the banks, which effectively pooled together private investors to pool together their equity to allow them to buy larger assets.  Those assets would have been out of an individual's reach in terms of their size and scale so the syndicates pooled the equity, put debt in behind it to support those types of transactions and then proceeded to acquire.</p><p>They pooled together the equity, put debt in behind it to support that type of transactions and then proceeded to acquire.  Coincidentally, that started in the financial services centre in the mid-1990s, where a lot of syndicated deals were put together to benefit from what were quite attractive tax allowances and then continued into 2000 onwards.  We do not involve ourselves in syndicates and never put together any syndicates.  Our job, with regard to any private syndicate, was to advise it on trying to find opportunities for it.  If the syndicate was successful in buying, it then was to do the due diligence for the syndicate on that transaction.</p></speech>

I will move on to risks and indicators because my time is vanishing for some reason.  Jones Lang LaSalle became increasingly aware of risks in the Irish commercial property market.

Did Jones Lang LaSalle discuss this with any other players in the property market or did Mr. Moran speak to the Government about those risks or fears?</p></speech>

Throughout that entire period, no approach was made to us by anybody from the Government as to what were our views on the market.  Again, with the benefit of hindsight, we found that to be slightly unusual.  We expressed our concerns on risks with our client base, because we have our duty of care to that base.  In or about March 2007, my research team stated publicly that we were cautious about the market and that the market required a significant amount of caution at the time.  That is when we started to make statements publicly about it.</p></speech>

In September 2007, it was valued at &euro;345 million and at the time, <i>The Irish Times</i>stated it would be the second major shopping mall in the town and had raised questions about whether the local population was large enough to sustain both.  In February 2015, it was being valued at &euro;60 million.  What has happened there?  That is not a small overvaluation but is a significant change in value.  Even in 2007, Mr. Moran's company would have been aware that there were risks in the market, as was<i>The Irish Times</i>itself.  While people were aware this actually might not have been sustainable as a development, it was valued at &euro;345 million but then, in 2015, it has been valued again at &euro;60 million.</p></speech>

At the time in 2007, Athlone Town Centre was being leased up to international occupiers such as Zara, H&amp;M and Marks &amp;amp; Spencer's.  These were the type of companies that were going into it.  At the time, shopping centre yields probably were trailing in at approximately 3% or 4% capitalisation rates so the valuation probably was sustainable at that moment in time.

Ireland's economy was performing well, with GDP and employment growth driving the expansion. </blockquote>Quite a number of witnesses who came in here as well as various reports on the banking crisis have stated that, in fact, it was a credit-fuelled bubble as a result of inordinate amounts of money lent by banks and financial institutions that drove the growth.  How does Mr. Moran reconcile his view that it was economic fundamentals with that?</p></speech>

If one looks at CSO forecasts, which I happen to have in front of me, the forecast for 2006 was 6% economic growth and the forecast for 2007 was 5%.  The forecast was due to tail off in 2008 at 3% to 4% per annum.  We took all our economic commentary from a variety of sources.  We looked at ESRI reports.  We looked at Central Bank reports.  At no stage were what I would regard as the pillars of economic commentary, which would be Government-backed organisations or alternatively organisations such as the ratings agencies or otherwise, saying that we were about to witness the cataclysmic crash that we did.  We were aware that there was a lot of credit in the marketplace, but it is the oft-used word, that there was an expectation to which I referred earlier, that there would be a soft landing, and that the soft landing would result in an adjustment of prices but never to the extent that actually happened.</p></speech>

It is therefore imperative that we understand levels and impact of risk.<br /><br />Prior to the banking crisis, we were advising our clients on the nature and impacts of the property market and how it was performing.  Any advice was informed and reinforced with key primary research data.  We collect and monitor research for each property sector, with some datasets going back to the early 1970s.<br /><br />Any valuations ... were based on evidence of historical market values.  Valuation reports are not forward-looking.</blockquote>Let us take that on the one hand, and then on the other hand we take an article by a UCD academic called Morgan Kelly in December 2006 in which he stated:<blockquote>Offering no evidence except wishful thinking, estate agents and politicians assure us that we have nothing to worry about: the Irish housing market can look forward to a soft landing ... If the experiences of economies similar to ours are anything to go by, we may be looking at large and prolonged falls in real house prices of the order of 40-50 per cent and a collapse of house-building activity.</blockquote>Professor Kelly goes on then to instance research in the property sector in many countries from the 1970s on.  His conclusion, by comment consent turned out to be absolutely correct.  Mr. Moran said he had done the same research, or that he was basing his prognosis on historical research as well.  How does he reconcile-----</p></speech>

I have made it abundantly clear that we are not experts in the residential property market.  What Morgan Kelly was talking about was the housing market.  Our research relates to property data relating to what happened in the commercial real estate market, namely, how many offices are occupied in a year, how many retail units are occupied in a year, and what pricing has taken place.  We also said in Q1 2007 that we had concerns over the state of the residential market.  At the time we actually saw developers seeking change of use from residential to commercial opportunities.  Effectively, we anticipated price drops.  I think I have said that.  We anticipated price drops of between 5% and 15%.  We certainly did not anticipate price drops of 70% for commercial property and 90% for development land.</p></speech>

If one is talking about a housing estate for example, the value will be calculated on what the developer thinks he will be able to get for the houses, the end value of the houses less the cost of getting him there will lead one to the residual portion of the land.  I have no doubt developers made significant mistakes in that regard.  They were over optimistic in their assumptions.  They assumed increasing prices, which we felt were unsustainable.  They assumed higher densities than we felt they could probably get and therefore they started bidding the market up accordingly.  As a consequence, each time a developer bought a site, he set a new level so the price went up by another 10% and that became the next benchmark for the market to look at.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran was at the coalface.  He saw the size of the deals that were going down and the huge increase in price for commercial properties.  Where did he think the money came from if not from the banks?</p></speech>

I do not deny that for one moment.  It is very important to make clear that as practitioners we did not know how much equity was going into the deals.  We did not know whether equity releases were going into the deals.  We were never privy to or involved in any of the negotiations around the terms of those transactions.  We did not know what personal guarantees were being given.  What became very apparent afterwards, again this is with the benefit of hindsight, is that we did not know the level of lending.  We did not know the geographical concentration of it, nor did we know the level of lending to specific borrowers.  That is information to which real estates advisers would never be privy.</p></speech>

At these levels, international purchasers were priced out of the market, with more competitive yields available in other European countries".  Do I understand that European capitalists became wary of what was going on because they felt that prices were far too high in Ireland and they went elsewhere?  Is that how to read this?

There is no tradition of foreign ownership of Irish real estate going right back to the 1970s when commercial real estate started to get really developed in Ireland.  The proportion of foreign owners in the Irish market has always been exceptionally low but that has changed significantly in the past three years.</p></speech>

In a book authored by Shane Ross and Nick Webb, on page 161 they say:<blockquote><br /><br />Looking back at that period, you could have advised a developer to pay tens of millions for a field in the middle of nowhere based on valuations that turned out to be nonsensical, but it did not damage your career.  NAMA paid hefty salaries to people who had been at the coalface of the crash.  NAMA was there to take up the slack and all previous errors were forgotten.  It was a bailout for the professional classes.</blockquote>Is that fair or unfair?  Is it an assessment Mr. Moran would agree or disagree with?</p></speech>

As I have said and I repeat, we do not make the market.  We give opinions and developers, owners, investors make their own decisions.  We do not take their decisions for them.  We do not know what their endgame actually is.  Did people get it wrong?  Absolutely.  There is no doubt that was the case, but we do not turn around and say, "You should do this at X".  People have their own teams, they are professionally advised and take their own choices.  I have never turned around to somebody in my entire career and said, "You should go and buy that for X."  I would say, "We think it is worth X" and it is up to them then to decide what they want to do with it or otherwise.</p></speech>

The syndicates were put together, as I said, by people who specialised in putting them together so you had specialist companies that were putting syndicates together.  There were private wealth managers, the stockbroking houses and the private banking arms of the banks putting them together.  The profile was people putting in relatively small - I use the word carefully - amounts of equity so they could participate in significantly larger projects.  It would not have been unusual for clubs of ten to 20 people to be put together that would put a certain amount of equity into a transaction which would enable them to buy a property that was significantly larger than if they were trying to buy it themselves.</p></speech>

Whose side are the boys on?  I ask that in reference to a predecessor of Mr. Moran who, in 2006, made this statement:  "Amazingly, the fundamental that is missed by those looking at the property market is that the price of land is high because the price that people are prepared to pay for houses is high, not vice versa."  The suggestion there is that young people trying to purchase a home wanted to pay the by any standard inordinate prices that were demanded to put a roof over their head.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran's predecessor finishes by saying, "there is the Chinese proverb which counsels 'be careful what you wish lest your dream come true'".  It seems to me that a Government which engineers a fall in house prices in order to pick up first time buyers' votes may not alone be confusing action with progress but may also live to repent at leisure.  Is the suggestion by this particular estate agent, that house prices should be kept at the inflated levels they rose to up to 2006, in the interest of young people buying their homes?  Does Mr. Moran agree or disagree with this view?</p></speech>

We are on no side, that is the reality of the situation.  We act for buyers and sellers all the time.  I think I said at the outset and I passionately believe this - we need a functioning property market.  People forget that property is effectively land, which is a factor of production, which is necessary for economic activity to take place.  As a practitioner I would much rather see a property market that has increasing values in line with whatever the prevailing inflation rates are at the time.  I have no interest in participating in booms and busts, I have no interest in keeping values artificially high.  I have to run a business and I can assure the committee running a business in the cyclical industry that is property is not very pleasant.  We would rather see slow, steady growth.</p> <p>  As I said, property is a factor of production.  Without it people do not have roofs over their heads.  They do not have shops to shop in or offices to work in.  It is a necessary function of a functioning economy.  I believe that slow, steady growth rather than this boom and bust cycle we have seen time and time again is far preferable.</p></speech>

Then it was prepared, as I understand it, by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with input from spatial planners from Denmark or other such expertise that was procured by the State at the time.  I ask the Chair for a little latitude here.  The strategy stated that towns such as Sligo, for example, would have to prepare an infrastructure for a population of 100,000 by 2020 and, obviously, that was mirrored in other towns, villages and cities throughout the country.  To what extent was this analysis wrong?  Why was it wrong?  To what extent did it fuel the policy agenda of the day that led to the property boom?</p></speech>

It enabled towns as gateway towns and it was pro-development to the extent that people were anticipating that population growth.  Where the issue arose is it was very difficult.  If the Senator will recall, we had a rapidly growing population at the time.  We had quite significant immigration and there was a view afoot that the population was going to continue to expand and that we were going to have to provide both residential and commercial accommodation to all these new population centres.  Hindsight proves that we were completely wrong.  Did it assist in fuelling development in locations where perhaps development was not sustainable otherwise?  Absolutely.</p> <p>  One point I will make, and which I feel quite strongly about, is there has been a lot of blame delivered at the doors of the banks, estate agents, developers and various other stakeholders.  The town planners in this country are also equally as culpable for fuelling the development boom.  Planning policies were extraordinarily lax.  They were difficult and virtually impossible, and incoherent in a number of respects.  Certainly, in a chase for rates income and in a chase for each town wanting to out-develop each other, they led to completely and totally unsustainable development.</p></speech>

We thought that values would fall by 5% to 15%, not by, as I stated, 70%.  We were aware of all the economic commentary that was in the marketplace but what nobody, certainly, in Dublin anyway, was aware of was what was happening globally.  We were not aware that Lehman Brothers was about to collapse.  We were not aware that there was going to be a credit crunch.  We, certainly, were not aware that the banks had over-lent in every aspect of real estate which led to the cataclysmic events that we have endured.  What we have just been through in the property market is unprecedented.  It has never happened before.  We knew there was an adjustment coming, but certainly not of the magnitude that we have currently undertaken.</p></speech>

Whilst we were not involved in final loan-to-value calculations between our clients and the banks, were are aware that loans were available at high value ratios.</blockquote>Is there any particular emphasis on the word &quot;final&quot;?

That is the job of the bank, not us.  What we would have been aware of, through general market knowledge and anecdotal pieces of people to people, was the level of types of loan-to-value ratios that were available in the market at the time and they could have been, I am sure, in certain circumstances, up to 90%, and in other circumstances there were exceeded by that.  That, to us, is an exceptionally high level of loan-to-value ratio.<br/><br/>If I compare it to today, which might be a useful benchmark, a very high-quality investment property in Dublin today will get a loan-to-value ratio of perhaps 65% at the outside.  One can see where the differentials lay.</p></speech>

In terms of international investors, was that a particular cause of concern?  Mr. Moran indicated already that Jones Lang LaSalle gave advice to some of its investors to dispose of assets.  In terms of international investors, how did the company express that concern?</p></speech>

I think one has to understand as well that the real estate market in Ireland is actually quite small.  We have 40 million sq. ft. of modern office space in Dublin, compared to 400 million sq. ft. in London, for example.  International real estate investors generally seek markets where there is scale.  In the period 2002-07 it was the first time ever that the Irish market had shown any signs of scale.  There are a number of international investors who will not invest in a market unless it trades at least &euro;2 billion a year, so it simply was not on their radar screen.</p></speech>

Dublin, at the time, was at No. 3 in the regional growth index.  That was around 2004-05.  It was predicated on things like employment growth, GDP growth, increase in consumer spending, and increase in consumer sentiment.

Why does Mr. Moran think that is?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.203" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015040200002#L01000"><p>I think the component of volatility that really impacts, and it relates to both commercial and residential, is land.  Land is exceptionally volatile in value and that is because it is open to so many various different interpretations.  If there is a one-acre site, for example, and I think I can build 12 houses on that site, I know I can sell them for a certain amount.  I know what it will cost to build them.  I know what my services and financing costs will be.  That tells me what I can afford to pay for the land.  However, if somebody beside me thinks that he can build 50 apartments on it, he knows that the end value will be significantly higher.  His construction costs may be slightly higher but he can afford to pay a lot more for it.</p> <p>  That pertains through commercial land as well.  If I think on an office site I can build a 100,000 sq. ft. of offices to deal with a company of 700 or 800 people and the person beside me thinks he can build 200,000 sq. ft. of offices, different values will arise.  That is where the real volatility around value arises.  The other aspect of it is in a scenario where there were high loan-to-value ratios.  The level of equity that was being put into the transactions was relatively low so when one is operating in a market where values fall by 70% to 75%, everybody's equity gets wiped and I think that is why we are in the situation that we are in where, obviously, loan levels then become unsustainable because the natural buffer that one would expect to be in a normal piece of lending was not adhered to.</p></speech>

The scale of this was unprecedented.  If there had been a fire sale there would have been buyers for it, there is no doubt about that.  The same people who had been buying over the previous three to four years would have been active participants but they simply would have paid less.  I think, in hindsight, the benefit of holding the assets for as long as we possibly could was probably a wise thing.  Also I do not think - and the members of the committee would be better qualified than me to say this - that the State could have taken the hit, unless we dealt with in the way that we did.  It is arguable that the State has not been able to take the hit.  The scale of this is that &euro;74 billion worth of loans were transferred into NAMA, or &euro;74 billion worth of face value.  That does not take into account the other hundreds of billions that the banks had on their balance sheets that were not put into NAMA.  It is mind-blowing in its magnitude.</p></speech>

As a firm, we had been involved with the IFSC since its inception.  I doubt without the tax benefits, either the capital allowances or the double rent allowances, it would have been successful because it was a location the people simply did not want to go to.  Those tax breaks became a little less attractive after 2002 when the cap was brought in on the amount of income that could be used against them so they did not feature as much.  I believe that the other array of tax allowances that were provided for holiday villages and all the various other hotels, in particular, led to a proliferation of development in some fairly obscure locations where there was obviously no end user demand.  So I think latterly those types of allowances were ineffective and led to overdevelopment.  Also the preponderance of the Government to say at the time that the allowance would be gone at the end of the following year and then suddenly extending it again exacerbated and fuelled developers trying to take advantage of those allowances.</p></speech>

We need people to buy all these distressed assets which are now being re-sold back into the market place.  Therefore, in order to widen the potential buyer pool I think REITs were a good idea.  I also think they will play a role in future development.  They are allowed to develop 35% of their portfolios so they will become important providers of space which should help us to respond to the supply side issues that we have in the marketplace at the moment for both residential and office accommodation.</p></speech>

I was looking at <i>The Irish Times</i>piece that Mr. Moran had in 2008 looking forward to 2009, when the podcast went off.  I am not being paid by <i>The Irish Times</i>to do that deliberately.  It is the second time it has happened, so my apologies.</p><p>Mr. Moran has said that in 2005 he suggested to his clients to sell and not buy at that point in time.  Clearly they ignored his advice, given that levels of investment by Irish investors increased dramatically in the 2005-06 peak year, and 2007.

We, as a firm, did not have an enormous involvement in the private investor market.  We were considered, and probably still are, the institutional firm in town, for want of a better expression.</p><p>Most of them adhered to our advice.  Some 90% of the buying activity at that time was private investor led.  Quite frankly, it was stoked by a lot of people.  Private syndicators were making a great deal of money out of it so it was in their interests to try to continue to push property acquisition and investment as an asset class.</p></speech>

In that context, some 121 transactions accounted for the &euro;3.6 billion.  Of these, 39 involved amounts of less than &euro;2 million so one would assume that they related to private individuals.  A further 23 involved amounts of between &euro;2 million and &euro;4 million, so they probably also related to private individuals.  Above that, some 20 involved amounts greater than &euro;40 million and I would say 90% of these were probably syndicated transactions.  Out of the total of 121, one could probably argue that 40 or 50 were syndicated transactions.</p></speech>

First, and believe it or not, with &euro;3.6 million being traded, there simply was not enough opportunity in terms of supply in the Irish market in 2006.  There was still a lot of cash washing around the system at the time so people were starting to seek better returns.  There were better returns available in other countries, so people opted for them.  People were also perhaps seeking to "de-risk" their strategies to some degree and said, "I do not need complete exposure of my property investment strategy to Ireland and I would like to take some exposure in London or elsewhere".  In that context, people invested money in all sorts of God-forsaken places.  There was an element of that involved and a certain proportion of it was fuelled by the same syndicators to whom I referred earlier and who needed to continue to build their businesses.  As well as being active in Ireland, most of those syndicators were also active overseas.</p></speech>

That update also highlighted the risk of investing in commercial property.  Was Mr. Moran aware of the update to which I refer, which, I believe, was written by Marie Hunt?

The point I am making, therefore, is that it is fair to say property agents such as Jones Lang LaSalle were directly involved in maximising the value of particular sites, this site in particular which was over &euro;400 million.</p></speech>

It must be understood the property market is primarily about supply and demand.  It is about the general state of the economy.  The market, buyers in particular, was not populated by people who did not take advice, who did not have internal advisers or who did not take external advice.  People made mistakes and if they paid too much money for a property, they did so with their eyes wide open.</p></speech>

Reading back, he says the property market was supported by the economy.  In our case, it was driving the economy.  It accounted for some 25% of GDP when it should have been only 8%, 9% or 10%.  He says it peaked on 30 September 2007, but it is now generally acknowledged that it peaked around July 2006.  Jones Lang LaSalle is one of the main estate agents and puts itself forward as such.  However, the ordinary person would have to ask this question.  How can it state the property market peaked 14 months after the time we now know that it peaked, in July 2006?</p></speech>

I did say values tend to lag in the market, so activity levels had started to fall off.  That is why I said there were two reasons for looking at the property market.  We look at the property market in terms of value appreciation, but we also look at the depth of and activity in bidding.  I contend that the depth of and activity in bidding had started to wane towards the end of 2006, but that is a matter of opinion.</p></speech>

Much of the investment taking place is with equity rather than debt.  The general financial circumstances of the global market - it is not often we use the term "global market" in Ireland's case - are that there are significant amounts of equity seeking homes and a yield in the absence of decent returns elsewhere.</p><p>The occupier market and the general economic fundamentals support a reasonably performing property market.  Should these factors change, should there be an economic shock or significantly increased interest rates, for example, values will decline.  Are we at the bubble stage?  Not just yet.  Am I concerned that we might be getting there?  Quite possibly.</p></speech>

If we compare ourselves with other economies in Europe, some countries centrally fund their data collection and these data are available to everybody to assist them in making business decisions.  In this country data are opaque and not necessarily always shared.  The industry generally would welcome far better data provisions.  It is not just down to the availability of a commercial property register or the residential property price register; it goes much further than this, into some of the issues on which I have touched, including concentration of risk for banks and the geographics and borrowers to which they are lending.  To use a favoured expression currently, the information we can access needs to be far more granular than it is to allow us to undertake a proper, rigorous analysis.</p></speech>

The vacancy rate for what we describe as grade A accommodation, the best space in the best location in the city, is sub 3%.  I understand there is only one building of over 100,000 sq. ft. available in Dublin city at this time.  It is a serious issue which has led to very significant increases in office rents.  We do a lot of work for foreign occupiers and it is now a major concern in terms of our FDI competitiveness.  People look around Dublin and think certain postal districts compete against each other.  Our experience, however, is that Dublin, when trying to attract foreign investment, is competing against Birmingham and Berlin.  We are at a stage where our rent prices are getting to the level of being unsustainable.  A rental price in the order of &euro;50 to &euro;55 per square foot is sustainable in Dublin, given that it is an international capital and the amount of technology companies based here.</p></speech>

We are looking at a different landscape in terms of the ownership of very important commercial property in Dublin and around the country.  What impact might this huge shift in the ownership dynamic have in a context where the investment decisions these firms make are typically not long-term ones?</p></speech>

Any property recovery has three phases and we are only starting to enter the third phase.  We then have the private equity houses or other investors that come in to take it out.  People think these companies are all vultures and have been coming here to steal all of our assets and everything else, but I regard their involvement as probably the greatest amount of foreign direct investment we have ever seen in this country in capital terms.  That is what it is - people investing their money.  Yes, they are here to make money, but they are also investing.</p></speech>

There would be an announcement that the tax incentive for building these schemes was going to be finished by 18 months or by six months time.  There would be a surge of development activity responding to that.  Then in the next budget the tax incentive would be rolled over again, so instead of finishing it and completing it, which I believe would have been the preferable thing to do, it just caused people to think "There is that tax incentive, I'll utilise that again".  If one drives around parts of the midlands or parts of the west, there are developments that have no reason to be there, other than they were tax based.</p></speech>

Quoting again from the book by Deputy Shane Ross and Nick Webb:<blockquote><br /><br />Jones Lang Lasalle was able to keep afloat through hefty fees from NAMA [after the crash].  In September 2011, John Moran said that the company's work for NAMA was relatively good for us in 2010.  He was putting it mildly.  The former firm was the biggest recipient of valuation fees from NAMA, as noted above [in the figures given].  That figure represented only a portion of Jones Lang Lasalle's income from NAMA.  The company also earned &euro;2.8 million for portfolio management fees over the same period.  </blockquote>Is it unfair that someone thinks estate agents in general, including Jones Lang Lasalle, cleaned up in the bubble and prices were going well and were cushioned in the crash while many ordinary people who suffered had no such lifeline?  Is that unfair or fair?</p></speech>

Our revenue halved and we did not earn &euro;2.8 million in portfolio fees from NAMA.  That is inaccurate.  We do not segregate where we earn our money from and we report normally.  Our accounts are publicly available.  No one who wrote that book consulted with us about the level of fee income we earned.  Like every other agent in Dublin, we earned fees from NAMA.  We are not advisers to them and NAMA takes its own advice and has its own team.  At the moment, our role is now is to implement what it asks us to do.</p></speech>

The benefits of having professional owners of real estate, as opposed to one of private investors, can be beneficial in that they give the opportunity to provide professional management.  Rapid rent increases in residential accommodation, which we witnessed, are wrong.  If I were creating Government policy, which I am not, I would look to change leasing structures in residential investment to have something that is fairer for both landlords and tenants.</p></speech>

That is fairer for everyone and creates a more sustainable model.

There is a key lesson to learn about regulation of bank lending.  There should always be detailed central knowledge of the volume and nature of bank lending, including risk concentration in a sector, a location or to borrowers.  Development lending should include a detailed assessment, not only of the land value, which is a snapshot in a volatile sector, but a detailed assessment of how the money will be paid back.  We did not feel that happened and there should be sensitivity analysis contained within that.  When preparing a development land valuation, one can turn around and say that if it goes right there is likely to be one outcome and if it goes wrong there is likely to be a different outcome.  That did not happen and it is still missing in the industry.</p> <p>  All valuations for bank lending should be commissioned by the bank, paid for by the bank and with the duty of care exclusively with the bank.  The practice of borrowers commissioning bank valuations should be ceased.  </p></speech>

There have been some improvements in the past number of years but it is not at the stage it needs to be.  Banks should have more in-house qualified property professionals as a key part of decision-making or take proper external impartial advice.  There was not a property professional to be found in any of the banks between 2002 and 2007.</p> <p>  Valuation should be more frequent on security because property is not a static asset and changes.  If zoning changes, the value can change.  Valuing it and not looking at the file for five or six years is unacceptable.  The planning system needs a serious overhaul in how it links up and how it gives clear guidance to the development community.  It does not so people make mistakes based on incorrect assumptions.  I have spoken about data sharing, which is something we would welcome</p> <p>  The final point is the limited interaction between the regulatory side of the Government and experts in the industry.  I am open to correction but I do not think there is a property professional in the Central Bank, which I find astounding given the amount of property lending that goes on.  I would welcome the introduction of an expert panel from experienced practitioners to advise the Government on an ongoing basis.</p></speech>

The CEOs of the main estate agencies, like myself, or of REITs can give really valuable insight to Government as to what is happening on the ground.  If we see overheating - and it is in nobody's interests to have an overheated market - we can tell Government we think we have a problem.  The Government can then introduce a policy to deal with it.  Where we see supply-side issues, like we see in offices and residential at the moment, we can also make that known.  We have been banging the supply-side drum for the past 24 months and saying there are simply not enough offices in this city.

A regular conference participant and commentator in the Irish media on property matters, Ms Hunt produces many property market publications on all sectors of the Irish commercial real estate market and carries out specialist consultancy work on behalf of a broad range of institutional, private and public sector clients.</p><p>Before we begin, I advise that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and, as they have been informed previously, the committee is asking them to refrain from discussing named individuals in this phase of the inquiry.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Hunt to make her opening comments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-02a.419" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marie Hunt" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015040200002#T00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to attend to put in context the nature and functioning of the commercial real estate market in the period up to 2008.  Members have my submission so I will not read it verbatim but will highlight some of the key points.</p> <p>  Commercial real estate breaks down into a lot of markets and sub-markets such as office, retail and industrial occupier markets, the investment market, the development land market and the hotel and licensed markets.  All these different sub-markets operate independently of one another.  Commercial real estate volumes are considerably lower than in the residential property sector but the value of commercial real estate transactions is considerably higher.  In the absence of a national census or register of commercial property it is quite difficult to do as the committee asked and precisely quantify the size of the market, though some sectoral estimates on stock figures and transaction activity are collated by firms such as ourselves.</p> <p>  Commercial property tends to break down into three distinct elements, which are the development piece, the occupier piece and the investment piece.  What happened in Ireland in the period up to 2008 is that the three distinct sectors effectively merged and real estate developers began to develop accommodation, let it out and hold onto the property for investment purposes.  Invariably they then used it as collateral for other investments and developments.  </p> <p>  Commercial property is, by its nature, a long-term investment.  In general, commercial property is significantly more complex than other forms of investment and much less liquid.  By virtue of the typical size of transactions it is not really a sector that is accessible to all - one needs a lot of money to be able to invest in commercial real estate.  However, the emergence of the syndicate model in Ireland in the late 1990s did enable a larger cohort of investors to get into commercial property.</p><p> CBRE is a Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 company with headquarters in Los Angeles.  It has 52,000 employees and its Irish firm is the largest property firm in Ireland.  CBRE Ireland is a multidisciplinary firm and is involved in everything to do with commercial property, be it property sales and acquisitions, leasing, investment sales, corporate services, project management, consultancy or anything else.  In the same vein, we do not act for a particular type of client.  We act for vendors, purchasers, landlords, tenants, developers, etc.  In addition, under the property industry umbrella, we act for significant numbers of third-party providers, such as accountants, solicitors, banks, receivers and so on.</p><p> The research function at CBRE Ireland has the same platform as we have in every CBRE office across Europe, in that we have systems, databases and processes in place.  Our main role is to track transactions and market information.  We track transaction volume, land sales, hotel and pub sales, office and industrial leasing statistics and supply and demand to whatever degree we can.  We also comment on issues such as rents, yields and capital values.  All of this information is inputted into global databases and this enables us to produce pan-European publications and to compare Ireland with other jurisdictions.  It is important to stress that the research function at CBRE operates independently of the rest of the business.  Therefore, my team is not involved in transactional activity on a day-to-day basis.  We observe what happens on the ground and we are charged with giving impartial and unbiased observations and commentary based on our interpretation of market trends from the perspective of property market specialists operating in the business.</p><p> I am not an economist.  This is quite unusual because many of those on research teams working within property come from an economic background.  I come from a surveying background.  I am a chartered surveyor by profession and I am a full member of the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, I have completed all my postgraduate qualifications and I am a fellow of that society.  Over the past 20 years, I have been a regular commentator on the commercial real estate sector in Ireland and I produce a range of publications on the market and across all of the sectors.  We produce a significant number of statistical publications on the office, industrial and investment sectors, just as CBRE does worldwide.  The publication we are best known for is our bimonthly report, which is more of a newsy report that provides an update or snapshot every two months in terms of trends and transactions happening on the ground.</p><p> The most significant challenge I have faced in my 20 years doing this job in trying to track the size and scale of activity is the scarcity of data.  Unlike in many jurisdictions across Europe where I have colleagues working, we do not have a national property register.  This has created huge issues, because it is down to private firms like ours to carry out research.  Invariably, when we publish that research, it is claimed we have a vested interest.  Therefore, our research has been a thankless job.  I believe the Government should have established a national property register or system to enable us to track the market better.  Perhaps we can discuss that later.</p><p> The understanding of risk is related to the issue of available data.  Again, we do not have the luxury of a long-time series.  The only independent source of data on the Irish market is produced by a private company, Investment Property Databank, IPD.  I do not know whether members are familiar with the work of IPD, but since the mid-1970s, all institutionally owned properties in Ireland must value their assets quarterly.  These quarterly valuations are what make up the IPD data.  Therefore, the data are not representative of the entire market because the valuations relate purely to institutional assets.  However, the data do give us a good barometer of trends in the market.  As members can see from figure 1, the commercial real estate market in Ireland, for the period for which data are available, has demonstrated a highly cyclical pattern.  This demonstrates the fact that commercial real estate is a long-term investment.  According to this index, the average total return is 16.4% per annum which one would agree is a decent level of annual return.  However, looking at it on an annualised basis, this is hugely cyclical.  Figure 2 shows a table for the years from 2001 to 2008 where this cyclical pattern is clearly evident.  In 2002, we had a total ungeared return of 2.2%.  Four years later that was 24.4%</p><p> Roughly, each cycle has tended to be of ten years duration.  In the period up to 2007, considering the fact that interest rates were rising and we had built a significant amount of property in the preceding years, primarily as a result of the ready availability of cheap and plentiful debt and Government tax policy in place at the time, which incentivised real estate investment and development, it was predictable that the market would turn and we would enter the downward phase of the cycle.</p><p> If we look at what drives property, this can be broken down to four key drivers: the economic backdrop, the balance between supply and demand, funding and sentiment.  If the cycle had followed its normal or expected pattern, as we considered it would at the time, Irish commercial property values would have gradually fallen from peak levels, dipped close to or slightly into negative territory, plateaued and ultimately the cycle would have kick-started again.  For the period from 1976 for which we had data, that was the pattern and what we anticipated would happen.  We did not anticipate the extent of the crash that happened, and the extent to which Irish investors and developers were leveraged exacerbated their losses. </p><p> I will run through each of the four drivers individually, beginning with the economic backdrop.  We are a real estate firm, not economists.  Therefore, our economic projections and assumptions, both from a micro and macro level, came from outside the organisation.  We would have paid huge credence to the ESRI, the ECB and the IMF.  Also, as an S&amp;P 500 company, we would have been very mindful of the ratings agencies, none of which downgraded their projections for Ireland until the third quarter of 2008.</p><p> In regard to the supply-demand balance, I know the committee had someone before it in recent weeks who said the supply-demand balance does not have a bearing.  However, it is critical.  Consider the double-digit house price rises we have seen in Dublin over recent times and the 50% increase in office rents in the past 18 months.  This is due to the under-supply situation we are in.  It was obvious to us in the period up to 2007 that an imbalance was starting to come through in supply and demand.  Cheap and plentiful bank debt and Government tax policy fuelled a construction boom and encouraged the development of both residential and commercial property, much of which occurred in the wrong parts of the country.  Extensive rezoning of land for development across many different local authority areas and the absence of a national planning strategy exacerbated this trend.  In simple terms, we were building too much accommodation, much of which was in the wrong locations.  The pace of development was unsustainable and needed to be curtailed.</p><p> As a firm, we began to warn in 2005 about the potential for over-supply and we welcomed signs that development was beginning to slow down.  Against the backdrop of development continuing to slow down and domestic economic activity remaining strong, as we believed to be the case based on the commentary being provided by the IMF and the ESRI and so forth, a soft landing was plausible in our opinion.  In fact, this was the most likely scenario according to a range of market advisers and participants at that time.</p><p> The third factor, one critical to the committee's deliberations, is funding.  In the context of property, when we worried about funding, all we ever considered was whether interest rates were going up or down.  The likelihood of a global banking crisis removing debt from the equation completely did not enter our thinking.  We believed that the banks were stress-testing borrowers.  A scenario where the global banking system would completely implode and where domestic debt funding would completely disappear, which exacerbated the pace and severity of collapse experienced in the Irish commercial property market, just was not envisaged.</p><p> The fourth influencer, probably the most difficult to measure, is sentiment.  Herd instinct plays a part in the property market and the market is heavily influenced by sentiment.  We took our role seriously and understood that commentary, positive or negative, can influence sentiment to a large degree and that this could influence activity levels and, ultimately, pricing.  As an organisation, CBRE is very mindful of its role.  Any commentary or observations made about the market were made objectively and without influence.  Consider the client base we had and have today.  Talking the market up or talking it down was not on our agenda, because we had clients on every side.</p><p> We believe our commentary always has been open, honest, based on the information available to us and based on our perspective as property specialists.  From our perspective, as I stated the information up to 2007 suggested that a soft landing was the most likely pattern.  We found that a property market tends to follow the same pattern and we refer frequently to a chart, shown as figure 3 in our presentation, which comes from a book written more than 100 years ago by a man called Homer Hoyt.  It follows a study of 100 years of land values in Chicago, in which eight different cycles were followed and monitored, including the gold rush, the arrival of trains and so on.  Hoyt came to the conclusion that a property cycle always tends to follow the same pattern.  CBRE used that graphic a lot in presentations to clients to demonstrate the cyclicality of the market and in turn, to demonstrate risk to some degree.  As members can see, figure 3 typically follows the same pattern but what took everybody by surprise in the crash in 2008 is that it did not follow the normal pattern.  Effectively, we jumped from stage 7, where the real estate market was peaking, to stage 12, where the banks reversed their boom policy on loans overnight.  We skipped all the other stages and that led to the crash being significantly more severe.  Certainly for the period for which data were available, we had never experienced anything of that magnitude.</p><p> Moving on to some of the analysis we do locally, we maintain property databases and again, these follow the same definitions and methodologies as does CBRE worldwide.  We have been tracking what Irish people were spending on investment property and we track every single transaction over &euro;1 million in value.  We can then put that into a global system and look at it on a pan-European basis.  According to our research, Irish investors invested more than &euro;46.35 billion in income-producing assets with a value of more than &euro;1 million in the period between 2001 and 2008.  Were one to add properties that were below &euro;1 million in value, that figure would probably be closer to &euro;50 billion.  I should state that more than 50% of this investment during the aforementioned period occurred in the United Kingdom and 23% in Ireland.  The volume increased year-on-year from 2003 to 2006, peaking at more than &euro;11 billion in 2006.  Unusually, 100% of investment expenditure in Ireland in the period between 2001 and 2008 was by domestic investors.  At the peak in 2006, 30% of Irish investment occurred in Ireland, with 55% in that year occurring in the United Kingdom.</p><p> To put into context how severe was the crash, in 2006 at peak, there were more than 98 transactions of more than &euro;1 million in the Irish market while two years later in 2008, there were only 26 transactions totalling  less than &euro;500 million.  These data were publicly available and were produced in all CBRE research publications at the time.  Anybody who went looking for it could have found it and I suppose it marries the data that were coming out in respect of the amount of lending that was going on.  I have just looked at the peak of the market in the year 2006 to give members a flavour but according to this research, 36% of the investment spend in Ireland was attributable to developers, 26% to syndicates, 20% to private investors, 10% to institutions and the remainder to a combination of different investment funds, pension funds, occupiers, etc.  Outside of Ireland, the proportions were quite similar.  It also is important to note in respect of the types of assets people were buying that Irish investors tended to have a preference for office and retail properties.</p><p> As for development land, we also maintain a database tracking all development land in which we stripped out all agricultural sales and counted everything else.  As members can see, according to that research, which is shown in figure 5, a total of almost &euro;12.5 billion was invested in just shy of 1,000 individual development land transactions between 2001 and 2008.  It is significant to point out that while much of the focus on commercial property tends to be on the land piece, four times that amount was being spent on investment property when one adds it up cumulatively.  It also is important to note that while they will not be included in these numbers, members might remember that in the period between 2001 and 2008, there was a notable increase in the volume of hotel and pub sales in the Irish market, many of which effectively were land sales.  One could also include petrol stations in that regard.  The volume of expenditure is dramatic and increased more than ninefold between 2001 and 2006, according to our data, when more than &euro;4 billion was invested in development land.  In addition to the increases in land values in the period, there was a notable increase in transaction volumes recorded with 59 in 2001, rising to 260 individual transactions in 2006.</p><p> In both figure 4 and figure 5, I will point members to the year 2006 because that was the peak of the market based on transactional information.  Towards the end of 2006 and early 2007, it was obvious that transactional activity had started to slow down.  Members will have seen this in excerpts from various reports from that time.  In respect of funding specifically in respect of the various transactions I have demonstrated to members on these charts, CBRE was involved in some capacity in many of these transactions, be they in Ireland or overseas.  We were also involved in many of the transactions involving Irish buyers overseas and we carried out valuations for lending purposes for many of the purchasers and indeed all the Irish lending institutions.  However, we were not privy to detailed information on how these specific transactions were being funded.  Anecdotally, we were aware that a large proportion of transactions were debt-funded compared with other countries.  We knew that from talking to colleagues in other jurisdictions.  We also were aware of commentary on increases in property lending by the Irish banks and individual financial institutions.  However, we were not privy to the specifics of how particular transactions were being funded, how banks were financing themselves and we certainly were not aware of the extent of cross-collateralisation that was occurring.  Perhaps na&iuml;vely, we presumed that a central register of commercial lending activity tracking borrowers' exposures across different lending institutions existed.  We were not aware of particular banks' exposure to specific individual borrowers.  As I stated at the outset, we are not banking experts and so we had regard to assertions from the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and others that the banks were sufficiently well capitalised and robust.  We were cognisant of ratings given to Ireland by ratings agencies such as Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.  Based on this, we believed that the Irish banks were well funded and appropriately regulated and that the borrowers were being sufficiently stress-tested.  We had no reason to suggest otherwise and we did not have specialist training or insight or any knowledge that would have enabled us to question this.</p><p> As for lessons for the future, in the period up to 2008, to my knowledge we were not contacted by the Government, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance or the Financial Regulator at any stage for our view on property market trends from our perspective or to ask us for any of the data we were collecting on transactional activity or property market performance.  In general, Government intervention in the property market was largely done without any engagement whatsoever with the property industry and certainly not with firms such as ours.  In the future, we recommend engagement with such organisations that have access to reliable information on trends and transactions, as well as the ability to cross reference this with other jurisdictions and geographies because we believe this would give a valuable perspective to decision-makers and those in authority.  It is encouraging that in its recent Construction 2020 report, the Government has acknowledged the need to improve data collection and analysis to ensure that the real estate sector in the future is evidence-based and underpinned by the best available data.  Had reliable, honest, timely and accurate data been collected historically and reviewed in the context of a national planning framework, the scale of the downturn in the most recent cycle may have been somewhat less severe.  That is my submission in which I have made every effort to address the specific items the joint committee has asked me to address.  I will be happy to take any specific questions.</p></speech>

I believe that at the previous meeting, I may have taken her name in vain when I was talking about the financial stability update in 2007.  It was of course authored by Ms Maria Woods and not by Ms Hunt.  In her statement, Ms Hunt mentions that 100% of the investment spending in Ireland in commercial property for the period between 2001 and 2008 was comprised of domestic investors.  Would this be normal for a domestic market?</p></speech>

In the case of Ireland, there were probably several reasons for this, the main one being that many investors simply deemed Ireland to be too small, that the size of opportunities that were brought to the market were quite small.  In the current market, we have lots of portfolios changing hands that are sizeable and this is attractive to investors.</p><p>At that time, however, we were selling individual assets and they were just deemed to be too small.</p><p> We also had a much higher stamp duty regime in Ireland.  For example, one could have invested in the United Kingdom and paid a stamp duty rate of 4% relative to 9% that had prevailed in Ireland, so that was off-putting.  Also, pricing was more expensive so if we looked at yields or cap rates relative to other jurisdictions, Dublin stood out because it was more expensive so obviously investors were not going to invest on that basis.</p></speech>

When someone is in the upward part of a cycle and using leverage, it enhances their returns but the opposite of that is also true.  When the market crashes, they are severely exposed but unlike other forms of investment, they can borrow.  That is what I am saying.</p></speech>

It was a market that was easy to understand and from a banking perspective also it was quite similar, so it was the natural progression for people to go into.  Also, there was much more produce available compared to the small Irish market.  If we consider the types of assets the Irish investors bought, as I said, they tended to buy office and retail properties in preference and they tended to buy very high quality so they bought Bond Street retail properties and West End offices.  They did a little bit of investment in regional UK but most of it was focused in central London.</p></speech>

Firstly, rents are already the second highest in Europe.  Secondly, available shopping centre space is the third highest in Europe and is forecast by the Bank of Ireland to increase by another 60% in the next five years.

The first would be on the transactional side, and clearly the Senator can see from figures four and five that the transactional activity had begun to show signs of slowing down from late 2006.  If one reads any report from that time, there was comment to suggest transactional activity was down year-on-year.  The peak from a transactional point of view was 2006.  Because of the way it is compiled, IPD does lag the market so it was some time later that it began to come through in those sorts of indices.  Again, if the Senator reads all of our reports from 2007 onwards, in every single sector we were pointing out concerns that the market was in the downward phase of the cycle.</p></speech>

Again I would need to go back and check but we track right across Europe, every single capital city.  We track a quarter-on-quarter increase and a year-on=-year increase, so if there was something glaring, it would have stood out.  When significant increases of that magnitude occur year-on-year, if one goes to other markets at the same point in time, there will probably be a similar trend because of capital flows.</p></speech>

When there is trebling from one year to another, Ms Hunt said IPD tends to have a lag.

I think some of them are here for the long haul and some of them did not understand the Irish market, but now that they have come and seen it on the ground, they are much more comfortable and may well stay.

She denounced them.  In February 2010, it was stated:<blockquote><br /><br />According to Marie Hunt, Director of Research at CB Richard Ellis, &ldquo;This has come as a huge surprise to the industry.  We understood that the Government had decided not to implement this measure.  While no one is disputing the fact that tenants in many sectors of the property market have come under huge pressure in recent months and many are struggling to meet rent payments, the reality is that this move will not do anything to improve the plight of retailers and office occupiers who are currently in such difficulties.  </blockquote>Could Ms. Hunt explain why she was so opposed to the change in the upward-only rent reviews?</p></speech>

Therefore, if somebody comes in overnight and says the contract is to be torn up and one is no longer entitled to those upward-only rent reviews, it undermines confidence.  In the period 2009 to 2012, we had a huge amount of uncertainty about this issue and on whether the reviews were going to be amended or not.  If one looks at transactional activity, one sees virtually no transactions happened as a result.  The minute it was announced in the budget in December 2011 that this was taken off the table for constitutional reasons, international investors began to engage and, indeed, NAMA began to release assets to the market.  Nobody was going to buy anything in Ireland, regardless of what price it was, if there was uncertainty about the income flow or the potential of that income to grow over time.</p></speech>

We now have a map of Europe with dots for every jurisdiction.  I am trying to remember the numbers off the top of my head but, roughly speaking, it is about 50-50 at this point.  Quite a bit of that is coming from the US because there are US firms which are now domiciled in Ireland.  The Irish piece would also be split 50-50, between Irish REITs and Irish investors.  For example, the money going into the REITs is invariably not Irish but they are Irish entities.  They are listed on the Stock Exchange.  We would tend to count them, but separate that figure out because it is Irish but the money is coming in internationally.</p></speech>

It is probably 35% now.  Something we have seen with global capital flows over the past 12 months is that there is money coming into European real estate from lots of different jurisdictions.  Our sense is that, going forward, the jurisdictions might change and we might get more Asian money coming into the Irish market, particularly from Asian investors who are now familiar with London and are seeing good opportunities in the Irish market.  We could attract some of that money to Ireland.</p></speech>

It is primarily equity and it is coming from lots of different jurisdictions.  Invariably it is coming from types of investors who have not historically invested in real estate.  What is particularly attractive about real estate at the moment is the unique interest rate environment we are in.  Ten-year bond rates have sub-1% rates and real estate is throwing off 5% or 6%.  Comparatively, real estate looks attractive.  There is then the ability to leverage on it.  Real estate right across Europe is booming at the moment.  We are at a unique juncture because of the low interest rate environment.</p></speech>

At that particular point in time, when we look at who was doing the sale and leasebacks, invariably some of it was coming from the domestic banks.  I do not think it was a conscious decision to get out because the market looked like it was turning.  I think it was simply an effort to generate more liquidity which, in turn, they rolled out into more lending.  I do not think it was a conscious decision.  Some people will speculate and say it was the banks getting out of the Irish market because they could see what was coming down the tracks.  I think it is clear that that is not correct and that it was simply a decision to get out of real estate and to get equity in and to concentrate on their core business.</p></speech>

On the first page, underneath "OVERVIEW OF THE IRISH CRE MARKET", Ms Hunt states, "In Ireland's case, in the period up to 2008, these three distinct elements effectively merged....".  I am wondering what the significance of the three pieces coming together means for the property market in terms of a change and the dangers associated with that.</p></speech>

There are developers who provide the product, occupiers who occupy it and professional investors who come in and buy the income-producing asset to throw off returns.  In Ireland, because there was an availability of debt, many developers built the stock, got it let up, and then held onto it for their own personal investment.  That would be quite unusual.  We would have been asked consistently why there were not more shopping centres trading in Ireland given the amount we were building.  In most other markets, they would be built, let up and then sold on.  In Ireland, they were built, let up and then the developer held onto it as a personal investment and invariably used it to borrow and develop again.  That was quite unusual and that was what I was pointing out.</p></speech>

We were spending a huge amount of money in other jurisdictions but there was nobody investing here.</p> <p>  That is not to say we did not have firms looking at Ireland from time to time if a particularly attractive asset became available for sale but they were usually out-bid by the local buyer, who was invariably bank-funded or debt-funded.  The pricing looked expensive relative to other cities.  The stamp duty was more than twice what it was in the UK, for example.

When a valuation is instructed, a professional valuer, working under the red book, can only value using the market value definition so they have to have regard to comparable evidence.  They would come to us to get the comparable evidence because we were tracking every single transaction.  It worked in that way.</p> <p>  I understood the Deputy's question was, after the event, when the valuation is complete and submitted, did they then go back and cross-check and see, compared to subsequent transactions, whether that was fair.  My answer is, when a valuation is done, it is done, it is submitted to the client, the file is closed and one moves on.  One does not pick up the file and retrospectively check the valuations unless the client subsequently comes back and asks one to revisit that valuation for whatever purposes.</p></speech>

Is there not something of a contradiction?</p></speech>

When we are asked to do the valuation, the price has already been paid.  They have bought a piece of land and they need a valuation subsequently.  Again, I am not a valuer.  They go back and get a valuation instructed and that valuation is fed into the bank, and that is the end of that job.  One does not retrospectively open the file and go back and check the valuations after the event based on transactions that happened subsequently.  One's valuation is based on market evidence at that point in time based on recent historic comparables - transactions that have already happened.</p></speech>

Why would it not have been unusual?  Surely, a record year such as 2005, and a trebling of that the following year, would have provoked some thought?</p></speech>

I am saying, when one has a big jump in one country, invariably, if one looks across lots of different countries, it would not be unusual to see a similar pattern emerging because it is a global market.  Capital flows are global.  If it was a trebling in Ireland and that trend was not coming through in any other jurisdiction, it would have raised alarm bells, but if the entire market in lots of different countries was growing at a similar rate, it certainly would not have.</p></speech>

The previous witness was at pains on several occasions to point out that from the end of 2005 his company was recommending to some of its clients to disengage from the commercial property sector in Ireland.  Was there any such efforts by CBRE in terms of its clients in the Irish commercial property market?</p></speech>

It would not have been my job because I am not directly dealing with clients and not involved in transaction activity.  My role would have been to comment objectively and, as the committee will see from the reports, to issue warnings or concerns if it was merited to do so.

With the benefit of hindsight, and given what Jones Lang LaSalle's represented stated earlier and what Ms Hunt stated in her own testimony here in terms of relying on houses such as the IMF and ESRI, is there a need in the bigger firms, such as her own, Jones Lang LaSalle, DTZ, for more self-generated research as opposed to reliance on determining research from the average of all those houses that she and Mr. Moran mentioned earlier?</p></speech>

We all use different definitions.  There is huge duplication of effort.  We would love a central clearing system where we all supply our data into one source, it is cleansed and we get the aggregate back because it would avoid us engaging in a huge amount of duplication of effort.  As I said, invariably, when we issue our research, regardless of what we say, we are deemed to have a vested interest and it is thrown back at us.  It has been a completely thankless task.</p> <p>  The UK market is miles ahead of us, in terms of the amount and the quality of data available, yet their investment property forum recently stated that if they are to prepare for the next property slowdown, they need access to better quality data and that should go across the lending institutions, the regulations, etc.  They say that, and they are light years ahead of us in terms of the quality and access to data that is available there.</p></speech>

There have been, I suppose, some efforts to improve it recently.  We have had provisions such as the property price register on the residential side which is hugely helpful.  We have the residential property price index now.  Both need some modifications to improve them even further, but they are a step in the right direction.</p> <p>  We have a commercial lease database, created by the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, but it is not really fit for purpose.  It does not really help us, from a transactional point of view.  What we need is a central clearing house where all the big firms supply their transactional information into one clearing house and the aggregate is brought back.  There are models for that right across Europe.  My colleagues in Paris tell me that they have a very good system working, for example, in the Paris region.  It would be quite easy to do.  It would avoid all of the major firms counting the same numbers and coming up with slightly different results because of definitions.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

Ironically, the syndicate model came out of Government tax policy.  When the first tax schemes were developed in the late 1990s, the syndicate model emerged and we began to see wealth management firms putting the syndicate model in place.  They were invariably to avail of tax reliefs in the first instance.</p><p>What happened is that some of those tax reliefs were subsequently removed or ring-fenced.  The syndicate model worked well because it was deemed that ordinary individuals who maybe did not have &euro;1 million to buy a commercial property in their own right could put money into a fund and through a pooled fund of money could get access to commercial real estate.  Otherwise it would have been too big a leap for them in their own personal capacity to get into commercial property. </p></speech>

Individuals could involve themselves at very minimal risk because of the numbers of people in a syndicate.  They could get involved in a small way in what happened to be a big syndicate and were therefore driving a market without any identifiable direct impact on themselves.</p></speech>

There was then a situation where lending became much more readily available and there was the emergence of the syndicate model.  So it brought a whole new pool of investors into commercial property that did not really know a lot about property.  It widened the cohort and it brought a lot of new players into the market.  We are now back at a situation where we are a more institutional market again so it is almost as if the cycle is coming through but it was very much fuelled by the debt situation, the availability of debt, the cost of that debt and, I suppose, access to opportunities overseas as well.</p></speech>

There was no listed vehicle so if they wanted to get into commercial property the only route they had was through an Irish Life fund or one of the various retail funds.</p></speech>

I would be interested in Ms Hunt's observations, as a major player in Ireland, on our ability to attract investment to the country, the issue of the availability of office accommodation, and the rent per square foot in Ireland vis-&agrave;-vis our competitors.  Has Ms Hunt any observations to make on those issues now?</p></speech>

We have continued to see FDI flowing in largely because of our corporate tax rate but I suppose what is unusual about Ireland is that for five years we built nothing so we now have this scenario where we have a huge surge of FDI flowing in and effectively very little office stock for them to locate in.   There is office availability but it is dotted in different places and most of these occupiers tend to want to be in Dublin 2 or Dublin 4 and the big issue is the scarcity of grade A stock, i.e., brand new stock that could be physically moved into in the morning.  The vacancy rate at the moment is about 2%.  Rents troughed out at about &euro;27.50 per square foot.  They are at &euro;47.50 or &euro;50 per square foot today.</p></speech>

I seem to recall that the Paris model that I have heard quite a bit about is solely funded by the Exchequer.  I do not think there is independent influence at all.

I am sure that all of the major top five firms that are spending time and efforts collating data would be delighted to pool it into one central source.</p></speech>

"Irish CRE generated average ungeared total returns of over 16.4% per annum in the period 1976 to 2006 (proving that commercial real estate is a long-term investment)".  A percentage of 16.4% was sustained for 30 years which leaves me wondering did we bailout the wrong sector.  We had a hugely valuable commercial investment for 30 years.</p></speech>

When one invests in commercial real estate one must be prepared for the long-haul.  It is not something one invests in only to divest in two or three years but over the long-term property performs well.  The difficulty we had in the Irish scenario is that the banks were funding on a short-term basis to effectively fund a long-term investment.  Possibly that contributed to the issue that we had.</p></speech>

This is just IPD data so this is just a barometer of the market.  It is a barometer only of institutionally-owned property and is not the market as a whole.

Is the model, which has been built over 100 years, far too slow?  Figure 3 shows that when real estate peaks at stage 7 it takes five more stages before the banks reverse their boom policy on loans.  That means what happened in Ireland was a quicker reaction than the 100-year study.</p></speech>

What we always would have said, in presenting this, is what one never knows is how quickly one will move around that cycle or how long one will be at any particular stage because in real estate things happen.  It could be a geopolitical issue or a financial issues that will trigger the crash or downturn in each case but it usually follows this pattern.  I think what would normally happen is that the market would begin to slow down, business in general would start to decline which one would see in the stock market and then, in reaction to that, the banks would make a move.</p></speech>

To some degree, one could say,  the single currency aided this because all of a sudden one could compare pricing in other jurisdictions.  People could see that there was better pricing to be had.  Also, the stamp duty regime here was extremely expensive so it was cheaper to go to other locations.  People like investing in property but there was very limited opportunity in Ireland to buy so by going to other jurisdictions they had access to product.</p></speech>

If it was an income producing asset one would have to stress test to see, if rent falls by 15%, 20% or 50%, what is the likely impact on the value.

She stated that government intervention in the property market was largely done in the absence of any engagement whatsoever with the property industry.  Our evidence would be that the property industry never stops lobbying and tops the list seeking tax breaks, along with farmers.  In fact, the property industry received three tax breaks in 2011.  Let us remember the Galway tent and all of those kinds of things.</p></speech>

When some changes were brought in it was only after the event that it was realised they had unintended consequences and they were subsequently repealed.  The point we are making is, had there been intervention with property experts, initially, we might have been able to point out that if one removes a mortgage interest rate the likely impact is that rents might start to go up.  There was no engagement in testing the unintended consequences of some of these interventions.  Some of them were brought in and subsequently brought back out again when it was found that they were not working.</p></speech>

The extent of lending in Ireland certainly exacerbated the Irish scenario.  It was the global banking crisis that pulled the rug under, in terms of overnight funding disappearing so we could not get funding internationally but we could not get it domestically either and that was the position.</p></speech>

Ms Hunt's company was commissioned by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority in June 2005 to make an independent valuation of the site and the figure it came up with was &euro;240 million.  In 2006 a consortium came together under the name Becbay Limited and purchased the site for &euro;412 million.  When CBRE was commissioned to come up with a valuation report for the banks in respect of Becbay Limited's offer, the company came in with exactly the same valuation of &euro;412 million for the site.  This is part of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Ms Hunt is saying she would have seen the market as having peaked, yet here we have a transaction that was the mother of all transactions.  Did it feed into her overview?  She wrote in her review in January 2007, "It is now the duty of the development community in Ireland to adopt a realistic approach and put the brakes on the quantum of annual housing completions to avoid oversupply occurring in the medium term."

Having access to accurate and timely market information on trends and transactions is vital to CBRE in being able to accurately assess the commercial real estate market and provide the best qualitative and quantitative information to our clients.</blockquote>On 31 July 2006 Ms Hunt was quoted on the <i>businessworld.ie</i>website as saying:<blockquote>The second hand housing market is showing signs of price stabilisation but some new home buyers are getting nervous because of interest rate movements.  This is more indicative of a steady transition to more stable conditions than a sign of a crash or bubble bursting.</blockquote>On 17 April 2007 CBRE released a press statement that was highly critical of RTE's programme &quot;Future Shock&quot;, calling it &quot;irresponsible journalism&quot; and stating we should not be entertaining &quot;negative speculation and unfounded, worst-case doom and gloom scenarios when all that is being experienced is a levelling in the extraordinary pace of growth we previously experienced&quot;.  It went on to state the programme &quot;should be dismissed as fiction and a soft landing for the housing market is still possible and is the most likely scenario&quot;.  Ms Hunt stated at the time:<blockquote>It is simply technically incorrect to assume that Irish house prices will decline significantly simply on the basis that this has occurred in other economies where the fundamentals were so different.  It is also irresponsible to suggest that the &quot;negative equity&quot; scenario that occurred in the late 1980s in the UK could occur in Ireland...</blockquote>Did CBRE get it so wrong because the international research platform it had used was flawed?  If there were other reasons, what were they?</p></speech>

We were not selling houses, but our reaction to "Future Shock" was as strong as it was because the tenor of the programme was based on a number of "What if?" hypothetical scenarios.  We had already acknowledged in our reports that transactional activity had started to slow down, that development volumes were slowing down and that we were moving into the downward phase of the cycle, but we felt it was irresponsible to scaremonger, for want of a better word, by putting forth hypothetical scenarios.</p> <p>  Three individual scenarios were posited on the RTE programme.  One was that Ireland was going to see a complete collapse of foreign direct investment, with no further multinational investment and many of the existing multinationals leaving.  We were very active in that space - it was a core part of our business - and did not see that scenario playing out and it did not happen.  The second scenario was that we were going to have a major collapse of construction activity in the economy.  That did happen, but it happened as an outcome of the downturn that occurred; it was not the reason house prices fell.  The third scenario was that there would be a very significant increase in interest rates.  While I would say the "Future Shock" programme was right in that it predicted there would be a crash, it did not predict there would be a global financial crisis which would lead to a crash.</p></speech>

That site was bought by a syndicate of rich people and Ms Hunt's company had organised the sale.  After the syndicate had held on to the site for four years, CBRE sold it on its behalf for a speculative gain of &euro;53 or &euro;54 million.  That speculative gain probably added &euro;100,000 to the price of each of the apartments built on the site, which would have had serious implications for first-time buyers.  It might well be the case that ten years of a 40 year mortgage will be spent paying for that speculative gain.  Does CBRE have a moral criterion or compass as to the social or ill effects of that level of speculation and profit seeking during the bubble which was facilitated by the company in a professional sense, with the associated stresses for young people and so on?</p><p>Did that enter into CBRE's considerations?</p></speech>

We are in the business of selling land.  That is our job.  We do not have a moral responsibility.  Land speculation happens in every single boom.  It is not down to firms such as ourselves to fix that because only government can do so.  It has been an issue since 1972, when the Kenny report was published.  We need to put a system in place that shares the benefit of rezoning decisions and speculation with the wider community and not just for the benefit of the owner of the land.  It is about time such a structure was put in place.  However, the political will has not been there to do so.  The only time we saw one step towards that was in the early 2000s when the rate of capital gains tax on land was effectively halved and that brought a lot of supply of land onto the market.  There was a threat that it was going to go up to 60% two or three years hence and that never happened.  There was a step towards doing something about it and then it was reined in, for whatever reason.  However, we are now at a critical juncture.  We are in the midst of a public consultation about site value tax and I think the opportunity might be there to revisit this issue.</p></speech>

I refer to several references in her submission to the necessity for a commercial property database.  The committee will consider this proposal when we come to make our recommendations.  I refer Ms Hunt to the commercial lease database which is in existence.  I ask her to expand on how that informed her work in the periods before 2009 and post-2009.  Has it made a difference to how she does her job?  Does she think there are weaknesses in the current structure?  For instance, we discussed the property database earlier.</p></speech>

I am trying to follow CBRE methodologies and definitions and that database does not give me the information I need.  It is like the example of knowing that house X sold for whatever price but not knowing whether it is a three-bed, four-bed or whether it has a garden.  On the commercial lease database it is completely irrelevant for me to know that CBRE are paying whatever rent if I do not know what size of a lease, what size of a take they have in terms of square foot, what is the length of the lease, the terms and conditions of that lease, if there is a user clause, etc.  None of that detail is available.  In some cases it might be.  I think there is also a reluctance on the part of certain people with a remit to give information to provide it to the database.  The form is cumbersome in that it needs three different entities, the actual landlord, the tenant and the solicitor, who all have to fill in a section of the report and nobody is quite sure who has the ultimate responsibility to send it in to the PSRA.  There is a lot of uncertainty about it.  It has not been user-friendly when I have logged on and tried to use it and it certainly has not given me results that I have been able to analyse in any meaningful way.</p></speech>

Colm McCarthy carried out research in the period 2000 to 2007 on rental data.  During that period the consumer price index rose by 13% while rental income rose by 240%.

I mean by prime is that when we are comparing apples with apples.  That was a prime unit on Grafton Street at that point in time and we tracked that headline rent over time.  It was a period in time when a significant number of UK multiples were coming in to the Irish market and invariably they all wanted to be on Grafton Street so there was more demand than supply.  It is a limited street so they were paying higher and higher rents.  It got to the point when we were at &euro;10,000 per square metre zone A  we were not dissimilar to the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es.  At that point we began to realise the benefit of being part of an organisation like CBRE is that one can compare and contrast apples with apples across different jurisdictions and it was obvious to us that this was overly expensive.  However, people were willing to pay that.  It is like the valuation argument in that once one or two tenants come in, they pay a very high rent and that becomes the new market rent for that street.  It is self-perpetuating.</p></speech>

If I remember correctly there was probably a two or three year period when they stayed quite flat at that level because that was obviously the peak.  They then began to taper off and they came back towards &euro;7,500, &euro;8,000 zone A.  Then they dropped like a stone and they fell all the way down to &euro;4,000 again.</p></speech>

In her statement, which described the programme as irresponsible journalism, dramatic and incorrect predictions, technically incorrect and so on and so forth - there is quite a bit of interesting language in the statement - she addressed her concerns only to the housing market.</p></speech>

Would that first-time buyer in April 2007 have been better off taking on board the sentiment expressed by "Future Shock" or the sentiment expressed by CBRE in Ms Hunt&rsquo;s press release?</p></speech>

We based it on the fundamentals of the market and the economic backdrop as we understood them.  We were also mindful of the huge cohort of people who had just bought a house.  If one's building is on fire, one needs to get everybody out in an orderly manner.  One does not want everybody panicking.  We had already said the market was beginning to slow down, things were levelling off.</p></speech>

Ms Hunt went on to say in her statement that would-be first-time buyers who had heeded equally dramatic and incorrect predictions in the past had lost out significantly, which would suggest she was saying they could lose out again.  I am struggling to understand why, from the point of view of CBRE, which is not involved in the housing market and has no expertise in that area or in respect of the stress testing by the Central Bank for negative equity that the press release mentions, it came out as one of the most vocal critics of "Future Shock", which predicted correctly a property crash, negative equity and problems in the housing and banking sector.  What was the driving force behind issuing such a strong press statement?</p></speech>

We felt very strongly that affecting sentiment or panicking people based on hypothetical scenarios that might ultimately arise was irresponsible.  That was the justification for our reaction.  In retrospect, what we now know is that they were right in the programme but they were not predicting a crash on the back of a global banking crisis.  They were predicting it for reasons that ultimately did not materialise.</p></speech>

As I said, hindsight is a great thing and we now know that the programme was correct.  The programme did not, however, say there is going to be a global financial crisis and debt funding in Ireland will disappear completely and as a result house prices will be halved.</p></speech>

The crash was going to happen regardless because of the increased prices in commercial property and housing property and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst.  The drying up of debt brought that on and some suggest that was to the benefit of the Irish State because investors would have continued to invest if that did not happen.  Ms Hunt seems to hold the contrary view that the reason for the crash was a global financial credit crunch.</p></speech>

That is the point I am making.  What exacerbated it was the global financial crisis because that was what completely removed debt from the market.  In retrospect "Future Shock" was right but it did not identify what ultimately caused the crash.</p></speech>

As far as I am aware, it was Jurys and the Berkeley Court as one site and subsequently the Veterinary College was sold.  We were not the selling agents for that.  It sold separately.</p></speech>

For agency it would be different.  Agency would be letting an office building or a retail unit.</p></speech>

Is there any further information that Ms Hunt would like to put before the committee?  This might include examples of good practice here in Ireland or international ones that could be developed here.  The committee&rsquo;s work is as much about looking into the future and coming up with recommendations as it is about examining the past.</p></speech>

The first lesson is that having a property market that is wholly dependent on domestic investors and developers and primarily debt-funded by a small cohort of domestic banks is not sustainable and I hope we have moved away from those days.  In terms of Government intervention, there should be consultation with the industry before implementing policies to tease out the unintended consequences.  We have mentioned data on numerous occasions.  We need comprehensive data from an independent source and interaction with firms such as ours, which are tracking useful information because if we have that we might be able to spot trends and possible threats at an earlier juncture.</p> <p>  I have been watching closely work done by the Investment Property Forum in the United Kingdom, UK.  It is a cohort of people involved in the property industry and they are doing a piece of research examining the next commercial real estate crash in the UK and how that might affect financial viability.  It has come up with some very interesting suggestions which we could possibly adopt here, one of which is giving consideration to setting up a central lending register whereby if borrower A goes to bank A the bank knows that borrower is also exposed to other banks-----</p></speech>

Having such a system in place might be quite useful.  The final recommendation is to go back to having no property specialists or chartered surveyors working in the banking industry, and no qualification that crosses the divide.  In my training as a chartered surveyor, I had no training whatsoever in banking and people doing banking and financial qualifications have no specialist training in commercial property.</p><p>They could well end up in a bank where their primary business is lending into commercial real estate without really understanding it.  As the committee will find from today, it is quite a complex area.  That could be a recommendation for the future, namely, that we put some sort of banking qualification in place where one can get training if one will be working in purely the area of providing funding to commercial real estate, which is quite specialist.  </p></speech>

I thank you for your participation with the inquiry today.  It has added informative and valuable information to our meeting and has added to our understanding of the factors leading to the crisis in Ireland.  </p> <p>  I would also like to note that today is the last of the Context Phase hearings, the objective of which were to frame the broad context for the inquiry, set out the background for the banking crisis and prepare the ground for the further public hearings after Easter.  We will commence the Nexus Phase hearings starting with witnesses from NAMA and AIB on 22 and 23 April, respectively.  I would like to thank Ms Hunt for her assistance today, and also Mr. Moran.</p> <p>  With that I would like to now suspend briefly so we can go into private session to deal with one matter, to excuse the witness and to clear the Gallery.</p></speech>
