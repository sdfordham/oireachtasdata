I will start by acknowledging the important role that Vicky Phelan has played in highlighting a number of major weaknesses in how people have experienced our national cervical screening programme, CervicalCheck.  The Minister has publicly commented on his swift action so far to address these issues.  He has also expressed his gratitude in public to Vicky Phelan, which I will do here again, for her courage in bringing forward these issues.  Without her, we would not have the opportunity to learn the lessons that I am confident we will learn from this circumstance.  Without attempting to set out a comprehensive roll call, she adds her name to a range of other patients to whom we are grateful who had to come forward in similar circumstances to raise issues of public concern, leading to improvements in the system.  Not least of these are Susie Long, Rebecca O'Malley, R&oacute;is&iacute;n and Mark Molly and Shauna Keyes, but there are many others.  Our challenge will be to derive what value and learning we can from Vicky Phelan's experience, which she courageously brought forward, and use them to improve the system.</p> <p>  Vicky Phelan was diagnosed with cervical cancer in July 2014 and, sadly, was informed in 2017 that her cancer was incurable.  In 2014, CervicalCheck's clinical audit of Ms Phelan's 2011 smear test result, which was reported at the time as normal, identified a query squamous cell carcinoma.  However, Ms Phelan was not made aware of this finding until September 2017.  This delay has raised serious concerns about the processes for providing information to patients and clinicians.</p> <p>  Subsequent to the controversy that arose surrounding her case, the HSE initially advised that, between 2008 and early 2018, 1,482 cervical cancer cases were notified to CervicalCheck.  The majority were women who had already been referred for further investigation or for treatment by CervicalCheck.  As part of the clinical audit process, these notified cases were re-examined and a number were flagged for further cytology review.  In 208 of these cases, the cytology review recommendations differed from the original results.</p> <p>  Last Friday, 27 April, the HSE established a serious incident management team, SIMT, to oversee and direct the management of this incident.  The SIMT has reported that approximately 162 of the 208 women involved have now been informed of the outcome of the audit process.  Communication with these women is ongoing.  We have further details, which we would be happy to share with members.  I regret to say that 17 of the 208 patients are deceased.  Like the Minister, we express our sympathies to the families of those patients.</p> <p>  Arising from the work of the SIMT, and as outlined by the Minister last night on the floor of the D&aacute;il, the number of cases of cervical cancer notified to CervicalCheck - 1,482 - does not represent all of the cases of cervical cancer occurring in Ireland since the establishment of the programme in September 2008.  I regret to say that I do not at this point have the necessary information to confirm how many additional cases this might represent, but work has started on ascertaining what that number is.  We will detail that work.  The Minister has directed that immediate steps be taken so that information from the national cancer registry on any additional case of cervical cancer that occurred during that period is provided to the CervicalCheck programme.  Any screening history that those additional cases may have - not all will necessarily have been screened - will be established.  If any of these women was screened through the CervicalCheck programme, her case will be reviewed in further detail, with cytology review where necessary.  A helpline has been in operation at the national cancer screening service since Friday and clinical staff are following up with women on their specific clinical questions.</p> <p>  Since 2008, some 3 million smears have been carried out by CervicalCheck.  It is important to note that the cervical screening test is not a diagnostic test, only a screening test, that is, a test to indicate the possibility of pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, thereby identifying women who need to be referred for further investigation or follow-up.  Smear tests can produce false positive and false negative results.</p><p>Therefore, cervical cancer may well develop in the time interval between a negative screening test and the next scheduled screening in any cervical screening programme.  The current primary screening test used by CervicalCheck is a cytology test which is known to have low sensitivity, that is, it produces a not insignificant number of false negative results.  Naturally, many women are now concerned about their own health following the publicity surrounding CervicalCheck.  It is certainly our intention, if we may, to use the committee and its indulgence to reassure people about the performance of the programme in relation to those people.  In order to provide assurance, CervicalCheck will make the necessary arrangements to enable any woman who has had a CervicalCheck smear test to have a consultation with her GP, in order to help her determine whether she wishes to have a further test without charge.  These arrangements are currently being worked through and will be confirmed this week.  We will hear further detail of this over the course of the afternoon.</p><p> In addition, in February 2018, the Minister approved the introduction of primary HPV screening for cervical smear samples, and I can confirm that this will be introduced later this year.  A Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, health technology assessment has found that HPV screening would benefit women by making the screening process much more clinically effective as well as reducing unnecessary tests, and greatly elongating the interval between tests for individuals.</p><p> I would now like to turn to the steps that are being taken to ensure the integrity of the CervicalCheck screening programme.  Non-disclosure of information to affected patients has raised concerns for users within the health service.  Patients have an absolute right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication about any adverse event that may have caused them harm.  This is underpinned in the medical practitioner's code of conduct and the HSE open disclosure policy.  The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017, which includes provisions that support open disclosure, became law last year.  These provisions were drafted to create a safe space for professionals to be open and transparent with patients in order that they would be given as much information as possible, as early as possible, including an apology where appropriate.  By doing this, we have taken away any fears that doctors may have in being open and apologising to patients, specifically, fears of creating legal liabilities for themselves.  There is no longer room for excuses.  The patient has a right to know and should be told.</p><p> The next step is to further strengthen and protect open and honest communications between patients and the health service by bringing forward proposals for mandatory open disclosure for serious reportable events.  A stand-alone patient safety Bill goes to Government next week to expedite this.  The Minister&rsquo;s intention is to have an independent statutory investigation to examine the CervicalCheck screening programme.  This investigation will have all the necessary powers to investigate the issues highlighted by Ms Phelan and will place particular focus on the quality assurance systems, clinical audit processes and communications with patients within the cervical screening programme.</p><p> As part of this, a comprehensive examination of the cervical screening programme in Ireland against international best practice and standards will be undertaken.  The investigation will also identify, within its terms of reference, any implications that may apply to other cancer screening programmes.  In addition to this statutory investigation, we are now working on putting in place, as a matter of urgency, an international clinical expert process to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  This panel will also produce an overall report to inform the statutory  investigation and the work of the international peer review group.  We are mindful of the need to provide support to these women and a liaison nurse specialist will co-ordinate the work of the expert group.  We intend to include patient advocates as part of that process also. </p><p> Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in women aged between 25 and 39 years.  Every year in Ireland approximately 270 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and just under 100 deaths occur from it.  Cervical cells change slowly and take time to develop into cancer cells, making cervical cancer a preventable disease.  Even with the inherent challenges in screening, having regular smear tests can pick up early cell changes or pre-cancerous growths and reduce the risk of cervical cancer.  This is the scientific basis of screening.  I must emphasise how important it is that women continue to have their smears and take this test, which can and will continue to save lives.</p><p> It is our intention to take these necessary steps in order to ensure the integrity of the cervical screening programme while at the same time disseminating any learning to all cancer screening programmes.  These programmes are an important component of the progress that we have made over the past ten years in cancer survivorship for people in this country.  The Department is fully committed to the further development of our cancer services and to delivering the ambitious roadmap set out for these services as outlined in the national cancer strategy which was launched last year.  We will be happy to take any questions from the committee members.</p></speech>

I am joined today by my colleagues Dr. Colm Henry, recently appointed as the HSE chief clinical officer; Dr. Jerome Coffey, national director of the national cancer control programme; Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director of the national women and infants programme; Ms Angela Fitzgerald, deputy national director of acute services; Mr. John Gleeson, programme manager of CervicalCheck; and Mr. Patrick Lynch, national director for quality assurance and verification and chair of the serious incident management team, SIMT.</p> <p>  I would like to begin by reiterating on behalf of the HSE my sincere apologies to all those women who have been affected and families involved in the CervicalCheck controversy, and others who although not directly involved have experienced any distress by what they have heard and read in recent days.  I also wish to state that I did contact Ms Vicky Phelan to apologise to her for the delay in telling her that her test results had been a false negative and I want to sincerely make that apology to her and her family again here today.</p> <p>  At the centre of this issue was our failure to communicate to the women that were the subject of the audit.  Those women should have been informed and that is something that will happen from now on.  It is essential that we re-establish confidence in our cervical screening programme, which is a critical public health initiative.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck, the HSE&rsquo;s national cervical screening programme, has provided a population-based cervical screening programme to the women of Ireland since 2008.  It is important to be clear and to understand that cervical screening is not a test for cancer, but a means of preventing it.  Cervical screening works by looking for changes in the cells of the cervix, the neck of the womb, using a smear test and cervical cytology.  The earlier abnormal cell changes are found, the easier they are to treat and the treatment of these changes in the cells of the cervix means that the risk of developing cervical cancer is reduced.  Screening is internationally accepted as a preventative health measure.  While it is recognised that no screening test is 100% accurate, cervical screening is the most effective method of reducing a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing cervical cancer.  By achieving and maintaining the targeted coverage rate of 80% as it currently does, CervicalCheck has the potential to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer significantly.</p> <p>  Since 2008, women in Ireland have been attending in increasing numbers.  CervicalCheck has achieved an 80% coverage rate among eligible women, a figure that is among the highest in EU countries.  Latest figures from National Cancer Registry Ireland, NCRI, show that the incidence of cervical cancer in Ireland has reduced by around 7% per annum since the period from 2010 to 2015.  This means that fewer women will develop cervical cancer and there will be fewer deaths.</p> <p>  To date, CervicalCheck has provided 3 million cervical screenings to more than 1.1 million women.  It has detected more than 50,000 high grade pre-cancerous changes in women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without screening, would not have known they had pre-cancerous changes.  Furthermore the programme has detected more than 35,000 cases of low-grade cell changes and more than 1,200 cancers.</p> <p>  There are 15 clinics across the country which provide colposcopy services as part of the CervicalCheck programme.  Continued successful collaboration between the programme and colposcopy clinics nationwide has led to sustained improvements to colposcopy services and eliminated waiting lists.  The high standard of colposcopy has ensured that women who require a colposcopy are guaranteed timely access to a standardised level of quality-assured care.</p> <p>  In 2009 CervicalCheck participated in an external international peer review of the CervicalCheck quality assurance, QA, standards.</p><p>The international peer review panel consisted of those named on the printed version of the statement and I will not read the list out, subject to the agreement of the committee.  They are, however, a credible international set of experts.  It has been asserted that, in some way, the screening programme in this country is substandard to the US as it is asserted that the US screens every year.  However, the HIQA report of October 2009 on the evaluation of the use of resources in the national population-based cancer screening programmes and associated services presented the recommended screening interval internationally.  In the case of the USA, recommended intervals are initially two smears, one year apart, then every three years.  It is also important to note that much of the US system involves a self-select process, an opt-in which, in effect, is a voluntary presentation and not a calling or invitation system as in Ireland.  It is not an organised programme in that sense.<br/><br/>HIQA goes on to say in that 2009 report:</p><blockquote>A systematic review of the existing evidence base for the optimal age-range and screening interval for cervical screening was undertaken in order to determine if the current age-range (25-60 years) could be narrowed or the screening intervals increased.  Based on the literature review, the current age range and screening interval adopted in the CervicalCheck programme in Ireland would appear to be consistent with the international evidence base.</blockquote><p>The HIQA report also noted that CervicalCheck administration has achieved the ISO 9001-2000 quality certification and maintains this standard through regular internal and external audit.  A comprehensive smear taker training prospectus has also been developed and underpins a smear taking training programme developed and delivered in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, the National University of Ireland Galway, and the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP.<br/><br/>There has been much commentary on the outsourced CervicalCheck laboratory services.  In that regard, I would like to make the following comments.  A procurement process for the provision of cytology laboratory services was undertaken in December 2007 with the publication of a notice in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union </i>in line with public procurement regulations.  The requirement of the NCSS was that each potential contractor would need to meet certain criteria, including that they must hold third party accreditation from a recognised accreditation body to international standard ISO 15189; have capacity to screen a minimum of 25,000 cervical smear samples per year; have capacity and ability to process smears within a ten-day turnaround in order to facilitate the delivery of results to women within four weeks of their smear test; and hold independent quality accreditation of the service.<br/><br/>On completion of the procurement process, a private sector provider of laboratory services, Quest Diagnostics Inc., was appointed for the provision of cytology laboratory services.  In addition to the criteria above, each slide analysed by the laboratory is examined twice by two separate cytologists.  CervicalCheck, in line with public procurement guidelines, re-tendered for laboratory services in 2009 and again in 2012.  Following the 2009 procurement process, Medlab Pathology Limited was appointed along with the previous incumbent Quest Diagnostics Inc.  In 2012, a further tendering process took place and the two laboratories mentioned above were appointed under a HSE framework agreement.  This framework agreement is still active today and both Quest Diagnostics and Medlab Pathology are still providing cytology and HPV laboratory services, under contract, on behalf of CervicalCheck.<br/><br/>I now want to address the findings of the serious incident management team, SIMT, report.  I have submitted the full report, which is also available at <i>hse.ie</i>, to the committee with the opening statement so I will highlight some of the key issues here.  Over the past week there has been considerable public focus on, and concern about, the cervical screening service.  Much of this concern stems from an audit of 1,482 cases of cervical cancer reported to the programme in the period between 2008 and 2018.  The CervicalCheck clinical audit process examines the screening history of all notified cases of cervical cancer, with a date of diagnosis since the programme commenced in September 2008.  The cases covered by the audit were those cases of cervical cancer notified to the programme and not the larger number of cases notified to the National Cancer Registry for the same period.  The programme advised Department of Health officials on Friday evening that the figures were based on the cancer registry figures and it was on this basis that the Minister was briefed.  It was subsequently determined by the SIMT that this was incorrect.<br/><br/>The audit process is an opportunity to see if any aspect of a programme could be improved.  The process can also provide more detailed information to women on the reasons their cancer was not prevented, as well as information on the effectiveness and limitations of screening.  Of the 1,482 cases notified and logged to date, 442 cases, 29%, were flagged for review of one or more elements of the cervical screening pathway, which includes programme operation, screening, cytopathology and HPV testing, colposcopy or histopathology.  Cases are reviewed by an internal review group, with the support of an independent pathologist.  The most common review type, as expected in a cervical screening programme, is of cytology, that is, the smear test, due to its inherent limitations as a screening test.  Cytology reviews are performed internally by the original reporting laboratory, and by independent laboratories if a further opinion is required.<br/><br/>In February 2016, the programme commenced formally communicating review outcomes of historical notified cervical cancer cases where prior cytology had been reviewed to the consultant doctor looking after an individual woman diagnosed with cervical cancer.  All historical reviews were communicated to treating doctors by October 2016 and the programme has been communicating current cases since that date.  While the audit process established by CervicalCheck is seen as good practice and has the potential to make an important contribution to improving the quality of the programme, there was some evidence that the women whose cytology smear test had been reviewed as part of the audit process had not been informed either of the review or the outcome as it pertained to them.  The women whose cases were reviewed already had a diagnosis of cancer so the outcome of the review of their cytology smear test would not have changed their diagnosis or treatment.  They were entitled, however, to know that their case was reviewed and the outcome of that review.  This was particularly important where the review team drew conclusions that were different from the original interpretation of the smear result.<br/><br/>The SIMT established that there were 208 women who should have been communicated with in relation to the review process.  These were women where the CervicalCheck review team interpretation of their smear result was different from the original smear interpretation.  Of these, 175 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result and, based on the opinion of the review team, this would have led to a different clinical escalation, namely, a referral for biopsy or colposcopy.  Of the total, 33 cases reviewed had an interpretation that was different from the original smear result but, based on the opinion of the review team, they would not have recommended different clinical management other than an earlier repeat smear.<br/><br/>On 30 April 2018, following the review of patient charts over the weekend, it was established that of the 208 women concerned, 46 women have already been communicated with and 162 women had not been told.  Each hospital group was then required to ensure that each of the 162 women who had not been told of the review outcome would be phoned on Monday, 30 April and Tuesday, 1 May 2018.  They would be offered an appointment to meet the appropriate senior clinician during the week ending Saturday, 5 May 2018.  There were 17 women in this cohort who have died.  It has been established that two of these women had the results of their review communicated to them before their death.  It is acknowledged that, in addition to a diagnosis of cancer, finding out at this stage that they were the subject of a review will be distressing.  The SIMT is confident that the clinicians meeting with these women or their next of kin will be very sensitive to the context of this information.</p><p>While the women who were the primary focus and concern of the work of the SIMT had all received a diagnosis of cancer at the time of their review and the review would not have changed the outcome, they were all entitled to know the review had been conducted and its outcome as it related to them.  This openness and transparency should lie at the heart of a caring and compassionate health care system.  Many women may be worried because of the recent coverage, and there is useful information available on .<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>During the course of its work, it became evident to the SIMT that the number of cases audited by the screening programme varied from the number of cases of cervical cancer reported to the National Cancer Registry over the same period.  The SIMT immediately took action, escalating this matter to me.  This, as the chief medical officer has already referenced, will result in the National Cancer Registry being mandated to share its data with the programme, the lists being reconciled, and an immediate audit of these remaining cases being undertaken.<br/><br/>I would like to conclude by saying that I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he is establishing a statutory investigation, which will be carried out by HIQA.  I also welcome the appointment of an international clinical expert panel to provide the women concerned with an individual clinical review.  The HSE will fully co-operate with both processes to ensure we establish all of the facts surrounding what has occurred and, above all, so we can learn from what has happened and ensure it does not occur again.<br/><br/>Given that I started my career in the public service in BreastCheck, the recent events are indeed a personal blow to me.  I do not have many more weeks in my role.  Indeed, I have only a few months because, as members know, I announced some time ago I would not be remaining beyond the term of my current contract, and consequently I intend to devote the greater part of those weeks to addressing these issues.  In that regard, as I believe the Taoiseach confirmed earlier, I have appointed Mr. Damien McCallion, one of our senior national directors, currently responsible for emergency management, among other duties, to take charge of the national cancer screening service from tomorrow so all the issues that need to be worked through as we deal with this can be managed by him.  He will report directly to me.  I will be taking a very close personal interest in every aspect of this process.  The SIMT will continue its work also.<br/><br/>That concludes my opening statement.  Together with my colleagues, we will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

As this may be a prolonged meeting, witnesses and members may take a break after two hours, if they wish.  It is very important for the members and witnesses to note that the women at the centre of this controversy should remain our main focus.  The setting up of an inquiry that will seek the truth on this issue should concern us.  We should concentrate on that and not take political issues into account.  The issues that arise this evening relate to trust.  There has been a breakdown of trust.  There has been a loss of trust in the CervicalCheck programme.  There have been a breakdown in and failure of open disclosure.  There has been a destruction of confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.  That needs to be restored as quickly as possible.  Full disclosure might not have affected treatment but it certainly would have altered women's ability to respond to the information.  It might have afforded an opportunity to seek redress elsewhere, as Ms Vicky Phelan did.  Therefore, non-disclosure had a significant effect.  It raises issues regarding governance, accountability and the cultural change required in the HSE and the Department.</p> <p>  I have three questions to start the meeting.  The first is for Mr. John Gleeson.  How could open disclosure not be part of the CervicalCheck programme?  It seems quite difficult to understand.  The cervical cancer registry and the CervicalCheck database did not match.  How could that possibly be and how could there have been such a breakdown in communication?  My third question is for Mr. O'Brien.  Is it now possible to say we know all the information in regard to this issue?  Have we identified each person who requires a smear case audit but who has not had one thus far?  Has the total number of patients been identified?  Perhaps these questions could be addressed first.</p> <p>  Members will have ten minutes each for questions and answers.  Witnesses are advised to keep their answers as concise as possible, just as I hope members will keep their questions as concise as possible, to allow every member to engage.  Perhaps Mr. Gleeson might address the two questions addressed to him.</p></speech>

It did not make specific reference to screening, which is different.  One is dealing with people who do not have symptoms.  It is not like people in hospitals; it is a different cohort of the population.  Without trying to not do open disclosure, we went about trying to figure out how best to do it in respect of women we were concerned about because, after all, they had been diagnosed with cervical cancer.  We were looking at something before that point in time and how to communicate it but we did develop the process.  It took a considerable amount of time, for which I apologise, but the intent was always to let the women know.  We looked to practices in England and elsewhere to determine how that might best be done.  It was always felt that the treating clinician of the woman at that time was the best channel through which to communicate with her.  We would not know the context surrounding her current care and treatment at whatever stage she was at in her plan to address the diagnosis.  We did develop and implement the open disclosure and communication policy in respect of treating clinicians.  Admittedly there were certainly gaps, for which we apologise, in terms of making sure the information actually got to the women but our intention was always that information we had that related to a woman should be made accessible to her.</p> <p>  Could the Chairman repeat the second question?</p></speech>

It is not part of the HSE so there are data protection issues in terms of the exchange of data.  When we ask women whether they would like to participate in the screening programme, they give consent to share their information with the National Cancer Registry.  It does not operate the other way, however.  If the National Cancer Registry is registering a cancer &mdash; in our case, cervical cancer &mdash; it does not go the other way.  The National Cancer Registry was given access to the cervical screening register in order to be able to report, in an aggregate way, on the programme.  It is a question of whether, over time, we can reduce the incidence and whether the detection of cancer will start to move to an earlier stage to give a better prognosis.  The national screening service measure was under way to implement a data-sharing agreement in line with the forthcoming GDPR to make that communication two-way.  We also felt in the early years, however, that most of the women would not have engaged in cervical screening.  There are roughly 1.2 million women between 25 and 60, and about-----</p></speech>

This is a very important issue that the Chairman raises because there is concern or a feeling &ndash; I acknowledge where that feeling is coming from &ndash; about a drip-drip flow of information.  Therefore, what we wanted to do as the SIMT progressed was bring as much information and clarity into the public domain as we could.  That has had the effect that we had been sharing information before we had complete information.</p><p>We gave a media briefing and provided the written briefing the members have on Monday based on the best information the serious incident management team had at that point.  It was only after that that what we have told the committee today about the National Cancer Registry information not being the same cohort of women became clear.  We have shared all the information we have.  However, the data matching exercise has not been completed, and we do not yet know the total number of women who participated in CervicalCheck.  That work is currently under way.  </p></speech>

That involved finding out who had been told and who had not been told.  We did not know, when were started on Friday evening, whether the majority had been told or not.  We discovered that in the cohort of 208 women only 48 had been communicated with.  The other 162 women had not.  Regardless of the other issues that had to be dealt with, the priority for myself and senior colleagues who stayed in all over the weekend was to inform these women.  Clinicians went into hospitals to pull files and identify the women.  Our objective was that from Monday everybody on that list had to be contacted and offered an appointment so that they could be told that a review had taken place which they should have been told about, and to make sure they had information on the outcome of that review as it pertained to each individual.  The first focus was on the women concerned, and as the process has progressed other issues have been identified which the SIMT will focus on.  We did not want to be deflected from the core purpose in the first few days.  We could have got caught up in the data issues and not done what we were set up to do in the first place.</p></speech>

In some cases - and I do not have the exact number - the woman has died, but their next of kin has been contacted.  All of them have been offered an appointment this week.  Some of the women have chosen not to take appointments this week because they have scheduled appointments and do not want to come in for a second time.  The objective was that all of those women would be contacted and offered an appointment this week.  Of the 36 who remain, at our press conference on Monday we were aware of 14 who were outside of the public hospital system.  There has been difficulty in determining where they are and how contact can be made with them.</p> <p>  Attempts have been made to try to contact everybody, but there have been some difficulties in reaching people.  Some people are out of the country and some have just been difficult to contact.  We have moved from a situation at the beginning of the week where only 46 women were contacted to the current position, with 172 women contacted.</p></speech>

To give the public some sense of the scale we are talking about, a back of the envelope calculation would suggest 250 to 300 new cases a year for ten to ten and a half years would represent approximately 3,000 women.  Just under 1,500 have already been identified to CervicalCheck.  Are we talking about an additional 1,500 women?  Are the witnesses in a position to broadly confirm that?</p></speech>

We will work as fast as we can, along with the National Cancer Registry, to identify who these women are.

If there are approximately 3,000 women known to have been diagnosed with cervical cancer, why has the national screening service only been engaging in audits on less than 1,500 of those?  Why were the other 1,500 not under the remit of CervicalCheck?</p></speech>

This is with regard to the 25 to 60 year old age group.  There may be people who presented from the 20% of the population who never engage with the screening programme.  That is a big part of the gap between the number we are speaking about and the potential for other cases above and beyond the 1,482.</p></speech>

The writer states that as a young woman she is second guessing the accuracy of her results as, she assumes, are most women at this point.  Regarding the HSE number, which is the 1,800 number, she states the line is impossible to get through to and those lucky enough to make contact with somebody have had their details taken and been dismissed quickly only to be told they will get a callback.  There is an awful lot of anger, but she states it is fair to say there is real fear, and it would appear the steps that have been put in place do not adequately service the demand and fear that is out there.  I ask, as a matter of urgency, what is being done to make sure there is an adequate patient and public support response to this.</p></speech>

In addition to the 15 trained nurses in place this morning, we have provided an additional 40 to 50 public health nurse staff, between doctors and nurses, who are being made available today to answer messages that have been left and those who have requested callbacks.  They are being provided with brief training and information to provide to patients or concerned members of the public the most accurate information, and encourage them to continue to partake in the screening programme.  These calls may take some time, perhaps 25 minutes apiece, so at the same time we need to get the message out there, and today on the websites of CervicalCheck and the HSE we have provided information for the public, including a video message by Dr. McKenna of the national women and infants health programme, who is with us today.  In addition, today we have engaged with primary care and we have sent information on frequently asked questions and frequent scenarios to all general practitioners, circulated through the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association of General Practitioners.  In addition, we have printed and sent this to all smear takers in our service.  This information explains the background to the service and provides a framework of advice to GPs to provide to any concerned patients.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-02a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018050200002#PP00800"><p>As a follow on from the last question, it might be advisable to get that information out to GPs as soon as possible because the women who cannot get through to the helpline are trying to get through to their GPs and they are being advised that the GPs have absolutely no knowledge of what they should be doing.  That is just by way of comment.</p> <p>  My first question is for Mr. O'Brien.  He stated at the press conference that he found out about what he describes as a failure to communicate - and perhaps he might want to revisit that description of what we are discussing today -  in the media.  I am interested in trying to get to the bottom of this.  A circular issued in 2016 is at the heart of the failure to communicate, as Mr. O'Brien describes it.  It advised clinicians simply to add a copy of the audit to the file and use their clinical judgment on whether to tell a woman something about her own health and, in a case where the poor unfortunate patient had died, to stick a note on the file.  When that circular was being drafted, and I understand it was signed by someone who was a member of the senior management team, senior clinicians and senior people in the HSE presumably were involved in drafting a circular of this nature.  It stretches credibility a bit for me that these people, members of Mr. O'Brien's senior team, would not have communicated to him on an issue as serious as this.  If we want to talk about open disclosure and being full and frank, I hope we can get away from what we have had in recent days, which is an endless round of people - mostly men as it goes and no disrespect intended to men - describing to women what it is like to have a smear test and how important it is.  I do not need any of that advice.  I have been having smear tests for 22 years, since I had my daughter.  I understand how important it is.  I also know it is not a diagnostic test and I understand it is a screening test.  It would probably be helpful if we could dispense with having to repeat that.</p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Brien give me some information as to who would have been involved in compiling that circular, because to me it seems that it came from a very senior level?  It strikes me as odd that it did not come across Mr. O'Brien's desk, but he is telling us the first he knew about it was in the media.  Perhaps he can talk to us about who was involved in compiling that circular.</p></speech>

On the particular point the Deputy mentioned, and the reference to whether a woman was deceased, we conducted this review long after the diagnosis of cancer and when we were notified the woman may have been deceased.  Our understanding of data protection legislation is that it was her information and it was not to be told to anyone else.  In other words, putting it on the file would make it legally accessible to anyone granted legal access to the file.  This may have been a wrong interpretation.  We did allow for clinical judgment as we did not feel we were in that position.  We did not know what the particular circumstances of a woman were when a letter was written.  We did, by phone, text and email, consult among various members of the team to try to get it right.</p></speech>

My understanding of Vicky Phelan's case, and I am not a doctor, is it was not within the normal range of statistical error and, in fact, when they went to look back it was not that she had had a missed diagnosis and that test had missed the early stages of cancer but, in fact, by the time she had her first test her cancer was far advanced.</p><p>I ask Mr. Gleeson to correct me if I am wrong in that regard.

However, if one had a clinical cancer, the chances of finding abnormal cells on the smear are less than if for a pre-cancer, the reason being that a clinical cancer may be ulcerated and one will have lots of blood cells, white cells.  The smear programme is not designed to pick up cancers but to pick up pre-cancers.  I am not in a position to draw any statistical significance from the lessons from one person.</p></speech>

The screening look-back, the retrospective nature, is what I was referring to.  It does not mean this was not a broader issue or that the ongoing cancer audit was not important and it was not referring to any disclosure issues.  Specifically on that point, the patient at that time and what we knew to be the case, I would have to say that much additional knowledge about the broader programme and the disclosure issues became evident subsequent to that communication.</p></speech>

If, during my years as a Minister, I had received that note and the events we are discussing had transpired subsequently, I would have felt misled.  That is my honest opinion, not that of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, although I am not sure if his opinion differs much from mine.  Regardless of whether we like it, in the opinion of the public this is either a massive cover-up - the witnesses can shake their heads - or one of the largest examples of collective incompetence in the history of Irish health care management.  It is one or the other because the issues here are so significant and they are frightening many people across the country, as all of us accept.</p> <p>  My first question is to the Department of Health.  As of today, 2 May 2018, how many cases similar to Ms Vicky Phelan's have been taken against a diagnostic company and-or the HSE?</p></speech>

This does not break down in quite the same way as the Department asked the questions.  We asked slightly different questions.  Our question was on the number of active claims.  Active claims could be ones in which proceedings have issued, inquiries have been received from solicitors or a level of inquiry exists which leads the agency to believe a matter should be treated as an active claim.  It is a different question.  The answer is "ten".  We are also aware of media reports today on another case which is not included here and in which the State Claims Agency was not involved.  Media reports relate to a prior case which it is reported was settled by one of the laboratories with a plaintiff.</p></speech>

While it is a subjective question, I found it amazing, albeit I believe him completely, that Mr. O'Brien found out about Vicky Phelan's case and the issues around it from the RT&Eacute; website.

I feel let down by the fact that I was not aware.  There is very significant contact and communication at many different levels between the HSE and the Department.  Different divisions and different parts of the HSE are in constant dialogue.  I have no concern that the Department was aware.  The concern is that I was not aware.</p></speech>

The question relates to the reading in a laboratory of the slide on which the material from the cervical smear test has been applied.  In other words, it is the examination of that through a microscope.  In the first three years of the programme, there were two full and complete reads by two separate people.  On the basis of an international evaluation panel recommendation, there are still two reviews, but the second is what is known as a "rapid review".</p></speech>

It is long and I will not read it out in full.  However, I ask Mr. O'Brien to refer to it.  It does not say they are all checked.  I presume that changed subsequently.

This is my last question.  The last question relates to the bombshell, as I described it in the D&aacute;il yesterday, when the Minister came in.  He was obviously not aware of the new information regarding the approximately 1,500 women who have not been audited.</p><p>For me and the public, it is incomprehensible that we had a national cancer control programme with its layers of management - whom I presume are all very good people - we have a process to compile and maintain a registry of national cancer statistics, and we have CervicalCheck.  Even though we had layers of people, management, processes and pathways not one person over the years noticed that only half of the tests were being audited.  Collectively, for our health system, how does that make the witnesses feel?  It is absolutely mind-boggling that only half of tests have been audited since 2008.  Frankly, that is just not good enough and it is wrong.  There was panic in the D&aacute;il Chamber last night as a result.  I do not think it is credible to claim that nobody in the whole place knew about this.  Somebody must have known.  I am shocked by the fact that the matter was found out and then told inside in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien, initially there was a two-year contract for the outsourcing of cervical smears, which took place under his watch in 2008.  Was the two-year contract renewed or was it audited in order for the State to continue the contract?  Mr. O'Brien was in charge at the time.  In 2008, the decision was made by the then Minister to send the smears to America.  Mr. O'Brien outlined the procurement procedure involved and stated that serious concerns were raised in various quarters.  It would seem obvious to me that if domestic concerns had been expressed about the process then two years into it Mr. O'Brien, as the person in charge, should have reviewed the outcomes.  Perhaps I missed something in the opening statement.  Under the heading, the procurement of cytology laboratory services, in his opening statement he referred to capacity of a laboratory and the turnaround time.  I am reading his statement and can see mention of "international standards".  His statement seemed to dwell on speed of turnaround rather than on quality.  There is not much reference to quality.  Perhaps he did not elaborate on quality in his opening statement.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien said at the end of his statement that this matter was a personal blow to him.  I would like to make it very clear to you, Mr. O'Brien, that this is not about you.  You are the last person that this is about.  It is about the women of Ireland who have, yet again, been let down by the health service and by you because you are at the top and you are in charge.</p> <p>  Can anyone tell me who owns the slides, the slides that have bits of my cervix on them in America?  Who owns them?  If we end the contract can we retrieve the slides for audit purposes?</p> <p>  When a company pays &euro;2.5 million without contesting it then it is obvious that the company has calculated the sum in advance and multiplied 2.5 million people by 208.  Does Mr. O'Brien think that handing over &euro;2.5 million to 208 people could indicate, without an inquiry, that the laboratory knew that it was not up to scratch?  </p> <p>  Can Dr. Coffey explain his job to us now, if he does not mind? </p></speech>

In referring to international standards, I was referring to international quality standards, of course.  I will come back to the bigger question.  The only reason there was a reference to a ten-day turnaround, and why that was important, was because prior to that it had not been possible to indicate to women who availed of the pilot programme in the mid-west when, against a very long timeframe, they might expect to get their results.  A big priority, in order to encourage uptake of a screening programme, is that at the point that a smear test is taken there is some certainty about when the result will be provided.  That was the rationale behind that issue.</p> <p>  Before the tendering process took place, guidelines for quality assurance on cervical screening with reference to the EU guidelines were developed in 2007 to 2008, and they were part and parcel of tendering process.  There was also an external international peer review of those guidelines, which was referenced earlier.  Quality metrics were in place, and still are in place, for any laboratory under the contract, which relate to pathologist workload and reporting profiles, screeners' workload, primary screening sensitivity, the reporting protocol----- </p></speech>

We are behind the curve in getting that message out.</p> <p>  To return to a point that Deputy O'Reilly raised about how good the programme is, let us say that we add another 100 to the 200 cases of false negatives we are taking, that would be 300 false negatives out of 3 million tests, that is one in 10,000.  That is a very acceptable rate of false negative screening.  The programme is effective.  It would be terrible if people were scared from using it and scared of using other methods of having their cervix checked because only by enrolling in the programme can one continue to have the umbrella of being sent for a check and having the screening quality checked.</p> <p>  I fully accept that we have not done well in defusing the confusion and getting our good story out. </p></speech>

I know that much has been said on the issue of public confidence.  I am not suggesting in any sense that the Deputy is taking us back in comparison, but it is worth pointing out that before the programme was established in 2008 - and this is a ballpark figure - we were doing somewhere in the region of 300,000 smears a year.  We were sending the smear tests to small laboratories, where we were getting poor quality assurance, QA and we had no QA to tell us what the performance was.  Some of the women being screened were being screened far too frequently and others were not being screened at all.  We were having no impact on mortality.  I can remember testimony by clinicians, particularly from those who came back to work in this country around that time about the late stage of presentation of young women with young children with cervical cancer.  That situation has not changed completely, but it is changing substantially.  We have had since 2010 a substantial reduction in the mortality associated with the programme and a range of other factors that allow us to say that people are being identified.  <br/><br/>We heard earlier about the 50,000 or so women who have been identified with early stage changes that could be dealt with definitively.  If we continue with the performance parameters that we are seeing with our programme, we can be confident that we will continue to drive down that mortality.  When we supplement that with what we are doing in terms of HPV screening, which will start later year, we can be confident in the screening performance of that.  We have substantial reason to continue to express high confidence as leaders in the health care system.  All of our health care practitioners should be in a position to continue on the basis of the data that we have available to us.  I can make available to the committee an article that was published in the <i>European Journal of Cancer Care</i>about three years ago, based on a side by side comparison, questionnaire based.  This analysis of cervical cancer screening programmes around Europe confirmed that we have one of the most organised, highest performing and most quality assured programmes anywhere in Europe.  Many of the features we are talking about here today are exhibited by very few organised programmes.  Many well-known countries, First World countries as it were, do not have that type of organised programmes.  The basis for us to continue to reassure people that they can have confidence in the programme, confidence in the results of their tests on the basis of its performance remains.  That has not been changed by any of the unfortunate experiences that some of the people of whom we have talked about have had.</p></speech>

It came through very clearly in conversations I had directly yesterday and today with the Irish Cancer Society, the Marie Keating Foundation and this morning with the Irish Patients' Association.  What needs to happen in cancer services in general and in screening in today's context is bringing patients and patient groups into the programme to be part of the redesign and service development so that they know and understand the process from the inside, have all the information and contribute to it.  I made that commitment yesterday and today.</p></speech>

We all know that the volume of calls to the helpline are significant.  We are now being advised that calls are being prioritised.  How can that be done?  If the three lady members present were ringing the helpline at the same time, who decides which of us would be a priority and who decides on the criteria for priority?</p> <p>  The advice from the HSE is that women who are worried about their screening results should go to their GP.  I am aware that the GPs in west Cork are inundated already with large numbers in the waiting room.  One must wait a few days, unless it is an emergency, to get an appointment to see the GP before this crisis happened at all.  How can a GP, take on this workload on top of everything else?</p></speech>

If there are exceptional circumstances in one's personal case, then attend one's GP and in discussion with one's general practitioner, decide whether another smear test would be necessary or indeed advantageous.  For the majority of people who have had negative reports, the message we would like to get out is to stick with the programme and attend for the next scheduled smear.</p></speech>

We were concerned by the volume of calls that were coming in.  The helpline is the initial contact point, but the most important element of the service is the callback.</p><p>It is experienced qualified people who are in a position to call back and talk to women about the questions that they have.  There were very serious challenges.  We understand that as of this afternoon, from the programme, there will now be 72 qualified people taking those calls.  Most of them are clinical staff, doctors, nurses and people who have been trained.  We have had very good support from others as well.  There will also be people from the Irish Cancer Society and from the Marie Keating Foundation, who have agreed to support this. </p><p> There is a distinction to be made in respect of the issue of prioritisation.  It is not prioritisation, it is that different types of questions have been raised.  Some can be answered by a particular type of clinician, some may have to be answered by a doctor.  In terms of streaming the calls and the questions, they will be streamed to particular members of the overall team.</p></speech>

The HSE issued an apology on Saturday and on Monday morning, where there were technical difficulties with the volume of calls and there were definitely long waiting times for people, and people had to call multiple times.  My understanding from assurances that have been given to the serious incident management team, SIMT, today is that has improved.  We were then concerned by the length of time it was taking to return calls to women; one does not want to phone on a given day and feel that one has to wait a week for a call back.  We have been given assurances this morning, as I have already mentioned, that all of those elements have been put in place.  I would be surprised and disappointed if we find tomorrow, when we look at the statistics, that things have not improved significantly today.</p> <p>  That is in addition to the wider communication through the clinical community, through GPs and the Irish Nurses and Widwives Organisation, who have also been very supportive and want to ensure that the confidence in this programme is not lost.  There has been a general goodwill by everybody to get this fixed and make sure that we respond appropriately.</p></speech>

Some women may seek to have a repeat smear test, and the Minister has offered that opportunity.  That will obviously depend on the availability of an appointment with a smear taker.  Women will already know who their smear taker is and how to access a different one, from the CervicalCheck website.</p> <p>  It may be that for those women who may wish to do that, that they might alternatively think of requesting that the original slide, which will still exist could be re-checked, rather than having to have a fresh smear test.  In general, as Dr. McKenna has said, that is not what is being actively advised.</p></speech>

There have been a lot of calls and we have drafted in very significant additional resources, which Mr. Lynch has described.  It is anticipated, however, that each callback is likely to generate a conversation that is likely to continue for up to half an hour.  Even with that number of staff, with the number of calls, it is going to take a number of days for everyone to have that full detailed conversation.

When the information became available that there were inconsistencies in the results, at what stage was there a decision taken not to share that information?  Was legal advice sought by either the HSE or CervicalCheck, on that?</p> <p>  The second question I have relates to when the first legal letter came in on this matter and who it came to.  There would have been an exchange of legal correspondence before proceedings started.  Who did it come in to and why did that not set off alarm bells at that stage about notifying the other people who were involved?  Why has it been the case that we have had to wait for it to go all of the way to court before we have now decided to notify all of the other people involved?  Can these matters be clarified?  When did the letter come in?  Why were alarm bells not set off immediately that this is an issue that was going to come to the fore at some stage, if not in this case, then in other cases?</p> <p>  The other issue I want to move on to - and I am aware that Mr. O'Brien has spoken about reassuring people - is that the problem out there now is that people do not feel reassured.  There is going to be huge increase in the number of people looking for repeat smears.  What system has been set up to deal with the increased volume of repeat smears that are going to be taken and analysed?  Has any process been looked at at this stage in relation to that area as regards ensuring that, if there is an increase in volume, that they can be dealt with in an expeditious manner?</p> <p>  Finally, my understanding is that there are 15 clinics.  Some of those clinics had raised concerns with the people directly at the top of the organisation over the last number of years.  Can it be clarified whether there were regular meetings with the principal people involved in these 15 clinics, or was it all by email and by telephone?  I have received information to the effect that some people in the clinics based around the country had expressed concerns about issues as they arose but found that their concerns were not being taken on board.  Was there a mechanism where regular meetings occurred on an overall basis between the 15 clinics and the people who were in charge of the entire programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-02a.244" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jerome Coffey" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018050200002#UU02200"><p>First, I will deal with the questions in sequence, I will then hand over to Mr. Gleeson for certain points.</p> <p>  The first point about disclosure which is critical and central here, a decision not to share is the reverse of my reading of the process in this situation.  There was a clinical audit ongoing.  There was a very protracted discussion both nationally and internationally about models of disclosure, concerning how and when to disclose.  That is where the debate was; it was not designed not to disclose.</p> <p>  What has evolved, apart from the reference earlier to the information being sent to the clinicians, was a patient information leaflet for patients telling them, where appropriate, that a review had taken place, and a very simple mechanism to trigger an appointment with a clinician to discuss all elements of the review.  </p> <p>  The second point I will leave to Mr. Gleeson, regarding the current case and when correspondence started.</p><p> The third point is that we anticipate an increased volume of smears, but it is very hard to quantify.  Our actions this morning were to make sure there was the capacity, where clinically appropriate, to enable women to have smears without delay.  That is open-ended.  We do not know how long the interest and anxiety will last for, but we are prepared to keep the enhanced resourcing until everybody has had their questions answered to their satisfaction and, where appropriate, additional smears will be taken.  That process will continue for as long as it takes.</p><p> The final point was about correspondence and colposcopy clinics.  I am afraid I will have to leave it to my colleague.</p></speech>

We will disclose, but it is a question of how best to do it.</p> <p>  We communicated with the 15 colposcopy clinics which tend to be the centre for most of the diagnoses and invited their views.  We have an annual colposcopy forum where we gather and to which we invite all of the doctors and nurses who work in colposcopy clinics to discuss issues.  We brought in a consultant doctor from England  who was involved in having to engage in open disclosure on cases to provide for some learning and a stimulated discussion on how best to do it.  Individual consultant doctors did engage, more or less, with us in saying no, this way or that way.  It is an evolving process and getting better.  We met them a couple of times last year.  We  have communicated suggested changes to them, some by email and some by face-to-face meetings.  It has been a process for over two and a half years and it is still evolving.</p></speech>

The process has been evolving for two and a half years.  The decision to disclose was taken.  It was to go back to every diagnosis made since 1 September 2008 when the CervicalCheck programme started.   They commenced in February 2016.  There was a backlog because we were going back to 2008, but we got all of them out by around September  2016 and as cases have been reviewed since.  We have modified this approach slightly to make it better to make sure it gets to whom it is intended.  The process is still evolving and obviously we are trying to get better at it.</p></speech>

Surely to God, someone can come to a decision one way or the other, rather than having dragged on correspondence.</p></speech>

Clearly, it was a flawed process.  Clearly, too much time was spent in trying to resolve disagreements.  Had the matter been escalated, as it ought to have been much sooner, at a corporate level we would clearly have intervened to make sure the objective which was communication to patients would have happened.  A key lesson is that there was probably too much time spent in trying to come up with a "perfect methodology".  As time passed, that pursuit should have ended and the process of communication should have started.</p></speech>

The question is to whom did the legal letter come?  Was it to CervicalCheck or the HSE?  Everyone is hiding behind the State Claims Agency, but am I correct in stating it initially came to the HSE or CervicalCheck?</p></speech>

In some cases, that provision is made and the thing does not proceed further.  In some cases, it proceeds further.  Then either the service or the official headquarters of the HSE receives correspondence.  There is much such correspondence which, by statute, is passed to the State Claims Agency.  In this particular case Mr. Gleeson may be able to tell us the sequence of events.</p></speech>

The person obviously had concerns that a disclosure had not been made.  Surely when a letter like that comes in - it is like any organisation getting a legal letter - the immediate response is if that is what is happening in the particular case, maybe we should now look at the other cases also.</p></speech>

In the records we provided in response to the request for all records was a copy of the disclosure from 2016 because it had not gone out.  It was then when the woman was informed, but this did not trigger, "Oh, we have got to disclose" or in other cases which had already been done with.  It was an access to records request.</p></speech>

It is clearly the case, given that this was never escalated to me prior to my hearing about it on the RTE app, that the significance of all of this was recognised and identified to a sufficient extent.  The Senator is right to identify that there was an event which should have triggered an analysis, an assessment and possibly a series of actions.  We do need, as part of the totality of what we are doing - this will not be for the SIMT - to look at how such initiations of proceedings are used to inform our understanding of risk and issues and the success or otherwise of the processes that have gone before.  I am actually agreeing with the Senator's point.</p></speech>

Is there such a trigger mechanism and, if not, why not?  What happened in the particular case we have discussed in the past couple of weeks?  Was the emphasis on defending the case in court, or was it on reaching out to the victim, the patient, and alerting other patients to what might be happening?

That is the most tragic thing in this circumstance because, unless the CervicalCheck programme continues to receive the active participation and support of the 80% of those eligible who have supported it up to now, we will be in danger of seeing a reversal in the trend for cervical cancer.<br/><br/>I have explained &mdash; some people have taken issue with my explanation &mdash; that what is at the heart of why we are here now is that a decision to carry out reviews or audits and then to communicate the results to the individuals concerned fell apart at the implementation stage.  That is kind of what brings us to where we are now.  As Dr. McKenna has outlined, even <i>in extremis</i>based on the estimates we have heard and even if all of the cases were missed opportunities for diagnosis, they fall, in total, within the parameters of a successful screening programme because screening programmes are not 100% effective.  The benefit of this screening programme is that 50,000 women have had a diagnosis of high-grade cell changes resulting in early treatment, resulting in their being able to avoid developing cancer.  Consequently, the numbers of cancers have fallen and the number of deaths has fallen.  These are really important health benefits in respect of which we must collectively try to do our best not to lose because it would be to the detriment of everyone if the trend went backwards.  In addition to putting matters to right for the women who were not given the information they should have been given, one of our greatest focuses and one that has been our immediate priority is restoring public confidence.  Without it, we will pay a huge public health price.  That is why I am focusing on this now to the extent that I am and why I have taken the steps with the movement of Mr. Damien McCallion to take personal charge of the national cancer screening service.<br/><br/>I ask Mr. Patrick Lynch to speak about how alarm bells should be treated.</p></speech>

Therefore, when one asks about alerts, one should note there is a whole range of alerts and different levels of severity.  Certainly, where patient safety is any way concerned, we have incident-reporting systems and risk-management systems, all of which should ensure the people who need to know do know.  That is not just for information purposes because very often some action has to be taken.</p> <p>  In the context of the serious incident management team, our objective, as I said at the beginning, related to the women concerned.  We did not know last Friday about the 208 women and how many had been told and how many had not.  At the end of the weekend exercise, we were surprised by the number who had not been told.  That, for us, was very concerning in terms of openness to the women.  We have not got to the why, who and what at this stage but I believe there was an important lesson to be learned.  It might not have appeared on an incident system but there are opportunities for any part of our service now to know that there are certain things that have got to be escalated, not just to notify people but very often with a view to taking action, and something has got to change as a result.  The work we have done in the past week will help in addressing this.</p></speech>

They were entitled to know that information.  These were women already diagnosed with cancer but they were entitled to know.  In 175 cases, when the review team reviewed the smears its clinical interpretation was different and it would have recommended a different escalation of clinical management.  Yes, they should have known.  The process was in place to achieve this.  It fell down somewhere.</p></speech>

The focus for us this week has primarily been on making sure the women who had a review were made aware of the fact that a review was undertaken and the outcome in their cases.  That is just a basic requirement in respect of the openness of the health system and the responsibility to the women of those of us working in it.  The second priority was to a very large cohort of women and their families right across Ireland who were concerned about cervical screening and their own health.</p> <p>  There will be time.  All of these things will be looked at because we want to improve the system and ensure we learn from what happened so it will not happen again.</p></speech>

Did anyone anticipate what could happen in a situation like that given the scientific knowledge available to the health services?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-02a.274" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018050200002#WW01000"><p>It is absolutely inevitable that there will be women who will get a "no abnormality detected" smear test result and subsequently develop cervical cancer and in respect of whom, on the basis of a review of their slides, once it is known that they have had cervical cancer, a reviewer will suggest a different result ought to have been given.  That is because this form of testing is internationally understood to be 70% accurate.  It is a screening test and not a diagnostic test.  It was always inevitable that the screening programme, as with all population screening programmes, would not provide a pathway to diagnosis for every woman who might have been able to benefit from it.  At the outset, based on all the public health information available, and in any country that has decided to have a screening programme for any population-based cancer, the decision is made to have the screening programme based on the benefit it can deliver as opposed to the benefits it will not deliver.  That benefit, as I characterised earlier, is a 7% reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer.  The detection of high-grade cervical cell abnormalities among 50,000 patients, enabling them to have treatment, means they will not go on to develop cervical cancer.  There have been 1,200 women diagnosed with cervical cancer through the programme, the result being that they could start their treatment pathway earlier than otherwise.</p> <p>  The issue to which the Deputy is referring is the relationship or suggestion that the decision to provide the cervical cytology testing through laboratories outside Ireland is in some way connected with this.  There was always going to be a certain number of cases like this, unfortunately.  There was always going to be a need to review, and there was always going to be a need to communicate, but the performance of the laboratories is in line with international expectations and has not contributed to a situation where there are more such events than would be likely to occur in any event.</p></speech>

Are all the laboratories - those in the United States and those here - equally efficient in their ability to determine and alert to the existence of the disease?  How does the HSE propose to set in place a procedure that will quickly alert both the system and patients as to what to be aware of?  Who alerts whom from there on?  How are the relevant sections of the HSE and the Department of Health alerted?  Are they alerted at the same time?  Is all the information collated and referred in such a way as to ensure that the necessary information is available to everyone within the system?</p></speech>

The laboratories are all operating within the norms one would expect, and this is monitored closely.</p> <p>  Regarding the alert system, the first thing to note is that the CervicalCheck programme will be fully data-linked with the National Cancer Registry.  The triggering of a review will be based either on a notification from the registry or, where that notification becomes known to the programme more quickly, as a result of presentation at one of the colposcopy clinics.  Each individual review will be undertaken expeditiously and the information communicated at speed to the treating clinician.  The treating clinician will be the one to convey that information to each individual patient.  We will go through a specific learning exercise and a review of what happened in this particular case to ensure that we cover and block off the gaps.  There will, of course, be continuous sharing of information at appropriate times with the Department of Health, just as there was in this instance but perhaps in a different way, more efficiently and more transparently.  Of course, what we will not allow to happen again is the kind of confusion and communication that arose in respect of this cohort, the numbers of women who had assessments carried out versus the National Cancer Registry data, which I discussed in my opening statement.</p></speech>

I will now bring in some Deputies who are not members of the committee.  The arrangement we had come to prior to the meeting was that non-members would have five minutes to ask questions.  Deputy Coppinger is first, followed by Deputy Br&iacute;d Smith.</p></speech>

I wish to ask about the claim Mr. O'Brien has just made to the effect that 70% is the average accuracy of the test.  That is not the figure that was cited on the D&aacute;il record in 2008.  What is a not insignificant number?  I will group my questions, if the Chairman does not mind, because I have only half the time of the committee members.  Why is the accuracy so low when, in 2008, Irish labs had a 95% accuracy rate, according to Senator James Reilly, who went on to become Minister for Health and who is a doctor.  I assume he was not telling a lie.  Why would we move to a system that, according to other experts at the time, had an 85% accuracy rate?  I refer to the US system.  I am not just blaming the witnesses.  These were political decisions that were taken.  The witnesses are managers.  I put it to them that this was testing on the cheap.  At the time, Mr. O'Brien, in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>published on 9 May 2008, said he was satisfied Quest Diagnostics could provide the required quality of testing.  However, the emphasis in his opening statement today seemed to be on getting 25,000 smear samples done a year with a high turnaround to get the results back in people's hands by a certain amount of time.  This seems to sacrifice quality for quantity and a fast turnaround regardless of the results.</p><p>I wish to take the following issue up with Mr. O'Brien.  He has said, or has given the impression to another Deputy, that two people were looking at every slide in the American labs.  Is he satisfied that this was the case?  He will be well aware that Dr. Gibbons, who was high up in the HSE and the cervical programme, took issue at the time with this and said this would not be the case.  Also, with the difference in the way they test - once every three years there with two pairs of eyes, whereas we tested once a year with one pair-----</p></speech>

Why has Ireland never reached the 1.8% average high-grade detection rate that other countries reached, particularly as this incidence of cancer here is higher than anywhere else in Europe?  Will the witnesses explain the other screening programmes?  MedLab Pathology claims, in its own propaganda and publicity material, that it has the contract for the bowel screening programme.  Will Mr. O'Brien or anyone else from the HSE clarify if this is the case?  Will the witnesses also clarify how outsourcing to a foreign company could be considered best practice when it is not then possible to have multidisciplinary team meetings?</p> <p>  Finally, regarding the calls to the helpline, it was stated that 4,876 women are awaiting callbacks.  Obviously, this could take a huge amount of time because they will require significant conversations.  Is Mr. O'Brien saying that these women could also have had inaccurate results and that if they require callbacks, the scale of this could be much higher?  Given what we have learned, will the HSE give a commitment not to outsource this testing ever again and to bring it back under public, nationalised control here in Ireland?  In other words, to be carried out close by to the hospital where a woman would be receiving treatment?</p></speech>

The quality assurance, QA, guidelines we have and the publication of QA audits in this regard demonstrate that.  A side-by-side comparison makes that clear.  We have had a substantial impact on mortality as a consequence in this country and we know we have had a significant impact on indicators such as the stage of presentation of cervical cancer.  We are confident, therefore, that the QA data and the actual outcome experience of our population demonstrate that we have had significant public health value.  The, in my view, erroneous assumption that was being made that in some way this was falling short by the order of a third in terms of the standard in comparison to other countries is simply not correct.</p></speech>

That was the first year.  However, while it did go up in subsequent years and hovered around a rate of 1.4%, it never went up to a rate of 1.8%.  That is a significant difference in average from other countries that do the test differently.  I refer to our nearest neighbour, the National Health Service, NHS, for example.</p></speech>

Added together, they come to 1.66%.  That is perfectly within what one would expect.  I wish to correct any belief the Deputy might have that the decision to outsource was cost driven.  It was not.  While every competitive tendering process must take account of cost in order not to be a hostage to overpricing, 80% of the criteria in the tendering process were quality orientated.  The volume requirement of 25,000 was because, as in many things, there can be a correlation between volume and quality.  We did not want to have very small providers doing things such as were happening in Ireland at the time.  The Deputy used the interesting phrase "reading the slides close to the hospital".  In some cases, that meant on the kitchen table at home.  Ten years ago, Deputy Coppinger's constituents might have waited up to a year for their results.  The ten-day turnaround is because that is what is required to be able to offer a credible cervical screening programme - or any screening programme.  We can not say come have a test and wait forever for the result.</p></speech>

Dr. Gibbons and other scientists subsequently resigned because their concerns were ignored and dismissed.  When that was put to Mr. O'Brien, he said that he had addressed those concerns in the final contract before it was awarded to Quest Diagnostics.  Will the witness describe how he addressed those concerns?  What was written into the contract?  If Mr. O'Brien was prepared to address those concerns, why was that not indicated to the scientists at the time, instead of forcing their resignation?</p> <p>  He subsequently said he was happy with the standards applied by Quest Diagnostics.  Mr. O'Brien must have been happy with the standards applied by CPL in Austin, Texas, as well, because he awarded it the contract.  However, CPL is the company that was successfully sued by Ms Vicky Phelan.  It settled with her for &euro;2.5 million.  Why would the company have settled with her if there was not a difficulty?  I would like a brief answer. </p> <p>  I have read the press release from the Academy of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine on cervical screening.  It has called on the Minister for Health to publish the results of the 2014 audit.  When I asked the Minister in the D&aacute;il last night to do that, he said there were no results of the audit - there were just individual reports for individual women.  I spoke to a friend of mine who is a scientist about this today.  She said that would be extraordinary because every audit has to have at least an introduction, the basis on which the audit was carried out, why it was carried out, what triggered it and what the terms of reference were.  That is the very least.  An audit will not just have Margaret's results, Ruth's results and Br&iacute;d's results and a description of how they have been looked at.  There has to be a description and a report back.  We are looking for that to be published.  I echo the call by the academy for the 2014 audit to be published.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment.  </p> <p>  When the State Claims Agency, and I think it was Mr. Gleeson, was alerted that there was a claim made by Ms Vicky Phelan, Mr. O'Brien said he did not know anything about it until last Friday.  I do not believe him.  I do not believe that the Minister did not know.  Other people might believe Mr. O'Brien but I doubt it.  I think there are thousands of people out there who do not believe Mr. O'Brien.  There may not be a paper trail or a smoking gun, an email or anything else but there could have been a conversation.  Did Mr. Gleeson keep this to himself as a secret or did he discuss it verbally with anybody else?  Would Mr. Gleeson get information like that, in a position of responsibility, and keep it all to himself?  If Mr. O'Brien, as the head of the HSE, did not know until last Friday, he must be hopping mad.  He must be looking for heads to roll over this.  If he is not, I wonder why.  I think anybody else would.  I have one more quick question. </p></speech>

I want to clarify, in terms of accountability and the setup of this in 2008, in spite of all the advice that was given to the witness and the experts that resigned and all that, he made the decision to outsource this screening to America.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

In fact, there were other experts who supported that process.  There was a national cancer screening service board.  There was a debate in the Oireachtas and there was ministerial approval but I certainly supported the decision.  Contrary to what was said earlier, nobody was forced to resign and there were a number of steps taken.  The issues that were raised at that time did not relate to this process, they related to an earlier process.  A total of 1,000 slides had been outsourced as part of a catch-up programme in 2006 to 2007 by the HSE which I did not work for at that time.  I worked for another organisation.  Certain conclusions were being drawn based on that.  Those were addressed in a number of ways.</p></speech>

Who made the final decision on this?  Normally somebody signs off on it.  Was it made by the HSE in the screening process or was it made by Government?</p></speech>

There was a specific, specialised agency for the cancer screening service.  I was its chief executive.  I was part of that decision; I did not have sole decision making and I believe the decision was correct.</p></speech>

At the time, there was no potential to provide a national cervical screening programme based on the laboratory system that was in place in Ireland at that time.  The labs were not accredited.  Women were waiting for up to a year for their results.  Some of those slides were being read on kitchen tables. That is not a place-----</p></speech>

It was run to an extent that there would be no alternative, which happens so many times, so it would be outsourced to America.  I know I am very limited in time.  When I had my smear, why did somebody not tell me there is a 30% chance that this is not going to work or I will not get the correct information?  There is a 30% chance so this is what I need to do, that was not communicated to me or to other women.</p></speech>

It is not 100% effective.  In the public discourse we have heard a lot of talk about people being given the "all clear".  I understand that is a shorthand approach but it conveys a certain meaning.  The result is "no abnormality detected".  It is not an "all clear".</p></speech>

There are many different statistics that appear to be in conflict with each other but they are not.  When we talk about sensitivity and specificity of a test, it means a different thing when we talk about false positive and false negative.  They are technically different things.  It is a different thing again in terms of a yield and how likely it is, and how positive one can be that the result that is negative is in fact negative.  They are different measures and they are being used interchangeably.</p> <p>  It is important we are given time to be able to set this out for the committee in a way it can understand.  I am not suggesting Deputy O'Reilly is doing this, but the way in which various statistics are being used is creating an impression that there is a conflict that is not in fact there.  If I can give an example, and I am not going to quote in terms of the screening programme and its figures because we can calculate those figures off the performance of our own programme, but if we are talking about something that is 80% sensitive this means there is an 80% chance that if a disease is there a test will find it, and there is a 20% chance that if the disease is there it will not find it.  This is what the 80% means.</p> <p>  Whether or not we can rely on the test being negative when we get a negative result depends not only on the sensitivity but also on the incidence of the disease in the background population.  I appreciate this is a technical epidemiological point I am making.  If a disease has a frequency of 1% and a test is applied that has a sensitivity of 80%, there is a different likelihood of it being positive or negative than if the disease had a frequency of one in 10,000.  All of these factors bear.</p> <p>  The statements that are being made about the performance of the test, and its sensitivity and specificity being low, at in and around 70% in relation to sensitivity, is correct.  It is broadly in line with the performance of the test in international hands.  Statements have been made about negative predictive value, in other words, if I get a negative test how likely is it that the disease is not present.  This is a very small figure.  It is a percentage figure that probably for the performance or test might even be much lower than the figure that has been given, and I am not in any sense disputing the figure my clinical colleague has given.  He may be referring to a different patient population where a higher incidence of the disease might exist.</p> <p>  It is important that we do not get confused and create a sense in which figures that are really important in terms of people's ability to be able to rely on the test and rely on the information they are getting in terms of predictive value, in some way appear on the part of the programme to be confused.  I take the point that in general terms the programme should, on a continuing basis like any source of information, continue to improve its communication.  This is not in any sense to say that erroneous information is being transmitted to patients.  It is really important that we get this point across.</p></speech>

I want to ask Dr. Holohan, Dr. McKenna and Dr. Coffey what they would put on the leaflet to indicate the likelihood of there being a false negative result.  It states it may not be 100% accurate.

I want to home in if I can on who knew what, at what stage.  I am reading from a letter that was copied to Dr. Henry and Mr. McKenna from a consultant gynaecologist and it is dated 22 August 2017.  It states: "What has happened is totally inappropriate."  That is referring to withholding of information from women.  What I want to know is, given that Dr. Henry, who is here, and Dr. McKenna who is also here, were aware that there were serious concerns, was any of this kicked up the line, and at what point?  Mr. Gleeson has already indicated that stuff got kicked up the line.  I am not quite sure what that means.  We might get a chance to go back to that.  Was any of this kicked up the line?  I find it absolutely extraordinary that Mr. O'Brien would not have been informed of a senior clinician who had serious issues with regard to the conduct of sharing information with women about themselves, which is material.  The consultant said: "It is because I feel that the women deserve to know the results of the audit process."  My God, if only other people shared that desire to share the information with women about their own health and well-being.  Was Mr. O&rsquo;Brien, as the head of the HSE, unaware of this?  Those are very senior people.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. O'Brien.  I would like to read out what the HSE defines as open disclosure, which is at the heart of all of this.</p><blockquote>An open, consistent approach to communicating with service users when things go wrong in healthcare.  This includes expressing regret for what has happened, keeping the service user informed, providing feedback on investigations and the steps taken to prevent a recurrence of the adverse event.</blockquote> <p>So, the question at hand is whether Vicky Phelan was afforded open disclosure, and whether many other women, and possibly men, within the national screening service have been afforded open disclosure, and indeed there is a wider question now across the HSE, due to this.  From what I have seen in the past week, there is a conspiracy of silence within the healthcare system when it came to Vicky Phelan's case and when it came to several hundred other women who were not informed of false negatives.  Senior people within the national screening service knew the details of Vicky Phelan's case and they knew that hundreds of other women had not been communicated with.  Senior management within the HSE knew those things as well, and the doctors knew those things - maybe not in the hundreds but they knew that their own patients had not been communicated with.  People at the very highest levels within the HSE, at the level of direct reporting to Mr. O'Brien, at a senior level within the national screening service and senior consultants, all knew for years that the false negatives had occurred and as of today all of the women still have not been told.</p><p>I will start with Dr. Henry.  We know that he was made aware of this issue, not just Vicky Phelan's case, but the wider issue of women not being afforded open disclosure, why did he not inform Mr. O'Brien as the head of the HSE, and why did he not act to begin to put in place the measures which are now being put in place, in an emergency response - because this has gone public?  Why, when he was told about this, did he not act to ensure that all of these women were afforded open disclosure, as is clearly required under HSE policy?</p></speech>

The reply I received from the cervical screening programme was that it was the responsibility of the caring clinicians to provide this information.  There was an exchange of correspondence and meetings on advice I received from other relevant clinical leads which culminated in a meeting between the lead colposcopists, that is the clinicians, and the medical director of the screening programme on 1 September, three months later - the first correspondence I received was on 11 July.  I received correspondence the following week from the medical director of the screening programme saying that they had changed the policy regarding communication and that further meetings were planned with the colposcopists so there would be consensus as to how they were going to communicate with patients, who was going to take responsibility and when this would happen.</p></speech>

My question is that Dr. Henry was made aware of a very serious breach of open disclosure, it would appear that when he was made aware, actions were not taken to ensure that the women were informed.  Why?</p></speech>

That was the role I played there.  I received assurances subsequently that that meeting had taken place, that the communication policy had changed, and that there was agreement as to how communication would take place.</p></speech>

Dr. Henry has just stated to the committee that as far as he is concerned he initiated the process, took the appropriate action, and was led to believe that things were happening.  Does he, bearing in mind what we now know, believe he was misinformed by other parts of the HSE?  It seems he was led to believe things were happening that clearly were not happening.</p></speech>

We have a circular from CervicalCheck, saying to doctors that in instances where the woman is still alive they should use their judgement, and that in instances where the woman is deceased it should be noted on the file.  We also have a letter from Dr. Hickey, Vicky Phelan's consultant, to CervicalCheck, addressed to Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly.  It stated that on further reviewing the letter CervicalCheck sent down to Dr. Hickey with respect to an audit of the cervical smears on cancer patients, CervicalCheck highlighted just three it felt should be considered for recall on discussion.  Dr. Hickey wrote there were a number of others that looked as though there were significant discrepancies, and he was somewhat uncomfortable about just recalling the three that CervicalCheck had highlighted.  Dr. Hickey had ten patients.  This was active correspondence from a consultant saying this matter was affecting ten of his patients.  Doctors have been told to use their discretion, but clearly Dr. Hickey was being told by CervicalCheck that only three of the ten needed to be told.  Given that information, and given what was in the circular, does Mr. Gleeson stand over the statement that there was never a decision not to disclose?  If so, how does he stand over it?  </p></speech>

The process was under discussion between two senior clinical people - consultant doctors - about how to disclose.  We had already sent the information to the receiving clinician.  There is an assumption that the other nine cases were identical to the one that has appeared in court.  I doubt if any two cases are the same, so I believe caution should be exercised.  I am certainly not going to reveal the details of those cases.</p> <p>  We had disclosed.  We had sent it on and asked that it be taken further.  The commentary around that - and I will not speak for Dr. Flannelly, who is still here - was that this consultant sought assistance in reviewing patient notes.   That was done collaboratively, and it was decided who should immediately be told.  One does not know whether one of those reviews had changed anything or not.</p></speech>

In 2014 there was an audit.  In 2015 a decision was taken to share the results with the women; two years after open disclosure came in.  In 2016 the information was shared with the doctors.  In 2017 Vicky Phelan got the information on her smears.  Given that timeline, does Mr. O'Brien believe the HSE has failed in its duty of open disclosure and in its duty to these 208 women?</p></speech>

I said in response to a question earlier - I believe the Deputy was out of the room - that at an earlier stage it would have been appropriate for someone to put their hand up to say that the process was taking too long and that the fact that there was an ongoing discussion about how to do it rather than doing it needed more significant intervention.  It should have been escalated, if necessary, all the way to myself, although I would have hoped it would not have had to get that far.

Many members have asked questions, so I just want to be clear.</p><p>Is Mr. O'Brien telling us that he is happy with the standards of the three or four labs being used - it does not matter to me how many - both American and Irish?  As head of the HSE, does he think, not in his personal opinion but from evidence, that they are up to scratch for the provision of this service to the women of Ireland? </p><p> I have a second question.  Before the 2014 audit that led to the recent findings, I am led to believe that there were two years of audit that were used for education and training purposes.  Might Mr O'Brien explain why that happened?  When the real audit of real people's data happened in 2014 and this rate of false negatives was identified, did the HSE compare the rates of false negatives and false positives of the four individual labs?  That is the first batch of questions.  I am sure Mr. Gleeson and Mr. O'Brien can answer those. </p></speech>

I have a question for Mr. O'Brien.  How can Irish clinicians conduct multi-disciplinary teamwork with people in different time zones, who use different nomenclature and perhaps different terminology regarding cervical cytology?  That is the first question.  Second, from the time the cervical screening programme was introduced, and we did not have the capacity in Ireland because there was a backlog, was any attempt made by the HSE to increase the capacity in the Irish system?  When the backlog was dealt with abroad, was the HSE working to ramp up capacity in the Irish system, based on the concerns of clinicians in Ireland in 2008?  Doing the job in the United States was a third of the price of what it was here.  Did that ring any alarm bells when it came to quality analysis?  I have come upon the McGoogan report from 2004, which laid out what we should be doing before we had the screening programme.  Here is recommendation 1.7 on how it should be conducted:</p><blockquote>&quot;A management structure with clear governance arrangements is required to ensure that the legal obligations to eligible women, health care professionals and staff participating in the Programme including Phase One are met.&quot;</blockquote> <p>Another recommendation: &quot;The establishment of effective governance arrangements with immediate effect is necessary in order to provide overall leadership and direction in terms of policy development&quot;, and so on.Recommendation 1.12: &quot;A quality assurance (QA) programme should continue to be given priority in the ICSP.&quot;  The report further recommends that:</p><blockquote>&quot;Structures must be put in place to allow review or revision of quality standards by a National ICSP Quality Assurance Committee which should include representation from the Professional bodies, other key stakeholders such as the Cancer Registry, the Cancer Society and other cancer screening programmes&quot;.</blockquote> <p>It seems that much of what was recommended did not actually happen.  Then I found the women's charter.  This is addressed to the women: &quot;All members of CervicalCheck staff will respect your privacy, dignity, religion, race and cultural beliefs.&quot;  It makes a commitment that women would always have the opportunity to make their views known and to have them taken into account.  Women are assured that their smear tests will be screened in an accredited quality-assured lab.  CervicalCheck also committed that a woman's result and any treatment recommendations would be provided to her and her nominated smear taker by the programme within four weeks.  In regard to that last point of the women's charter, I do not think Vicky Phelan got what it said on the tin.  Would Mr. O'Brien agree? </p></speech>

On the point in the charter about four weeks, this is intended to refer to the initial smear test.  The fact that this is what the charter is referring to does not take way from the fact that Vicky Phelan should have had open disclosure in relation to the outcome of the review into her particular case that was carried out.</p></speech>

Rather, I was invited to take up the role on the basis of a set of Government policies which were about the abolition of the HSE and the introduction of universal health insurance.  So I did the job in a particular way, in the context of that, for close to three years, expecting to be winding down the organisation and moving it into a collection of different types of service providers, hospital groups on a statutory basis and community health organisations.  As the Deputy knows, that did not happen.  I had discussions with the relevant Ministers.  What we have actually been doing is seeking to prepare the HSE for the type of future envisaged in the Sl&aacute;intecare report as a result of which Government sanctioned: the appointment of a chief operations officer so that there is very clear accountability for the operating system; the appointment of a strategy and planning head in order that we have much more focus on planning to population need, as they do in other countries; and, just recently, for the first time ever in the Irish healthcare system, the appointment of a chief clinical officer.  So what I have been attempting to do in the second three years, and it has been extraordinarily slow because of the approvals processes one must go through, is come to a much more streamlined system of governance.  That is the only reason people have moved around in this context.  In an organisation the size of the HSE, people move around.  They have opportunities to apply for different jobs, posts become vacant and other people come in.  Yes, it is complicated.  An organisation the scale of the HSE is inherently complex.  I have long maintained that the structures of the HSE are in fact not fit for purpose.  I have been saying that throughout my time.  I have now got to a point where I think, subject to the implementation plan for Sl&aacute;intecare, that there is a much coherent organisation of functions at the top level which is useful and valid.  It is extraordinary that, for the very first time, the Irish health system has a chief clinical officer - appointed within the past four or five weeks.  I am very glad to have been the one who brought that about.</p></speech>

I am sorry for coming back on this.  Did it not occur to Dr. Henry that, in the context of the delay in making the decision about getting the information out, someone should have sought legal advice about whether we could run into difficulties about not disclosing this information and the delay in making the disclosure?  Did it concern Dr. Henry that there might be a legal problem caused by not making the disclosure in a timely manner?  The next issue is the time it takes to make a decision.  We are going over a period where no decision was made.  Did that not concern Dr. Henry?  He was the clinical officer.  Will this be the process in the future regarding any decisions that are to be made?  Will it go around the house and back again to the same place where it was two years previously?  Did that occur to Dr. Henry at the time?  I know he was not clinical director but surely it must have occurred to him that this delay was not acceptable.</p><p>My second question concerns the role of clinical director.  The clinical director was <i>in situ</i>for quite a period.  I know we are going back to 2008 when this process was set up.  The masters of the Coombe, Holles Street and the Rotunda have seven-year contracts.  In fairness, any of these roles are extremely demanding.  The person is dealing with a huge number of people and a number of different units throughout the country.  Likewise, a master of one of the maternity hospitals faces a huge number of demands.  Does Dr. McKenna not think the way forward might be to stipulate a defined period for the director's job?  The director can reapply when the job comes up for review but that process would be there.  I am just looking at the way forward.</p><p>What kind of timescale would be involved if we decided tomorrow morning that we wanted all smear tests to be dealt with here?  I know the Coombe is carrying out some analysis in this area in the sense that it is providing a service.  My understanding is that the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland had a laboratory but that this service has now gone out to private enterprise.  I stand open to correction on that.  The process is being provided in Ireland.  How long would it take to put in place the requisite number of people with the skills necessary to deal with all of the smear tests that are done here?  Would it take two, three or four years?  What kind of period would it take us to build up those skills?  It is important to look at that.  Given that we have been sending tests out and using US companies for over ten years, surely we should be looking at trying to keep all of this work within the Irish jurisdiction.</p></speech>

Later this year there will be a change away from cytology to the HPV test for primary screening.  This will have the effect that the cytology capacity required by the programme will fall from approximately 280,000 cases per annum to 50,000 to 70,000 per annum.  This is because if the HPV test is negative, the patient or client will simply return to routine HPV testing.  If it is positive, that is, if HPV is detected, it will be followed up by cytology.  The expectation is that will be in the range of 50,000 to 70,000 cases, which is less than the number of cytology tests currently being conducted onshore.</p></speech>

It is a considerable undertaking even to put in place the structures to change the operation of the screening programme and to convert it to HPV testing, that is, looking for the presence of infection with certain types of HPV which are associated with cervical cancer rather than looking down a microscope for the presence of abnormal cells on a slide.

I want to mention two or three things which have come to my mind. The statement provided to the committee by Dr. Holohan states:</p><blockquote>Patients have a right to be provided with honest, open and prompt communication about any adverse event that may have caused them harm.  This is underpinned in the Medical Practitioners Code of Conduct and the HSE Open Disclosure Policy.  The Civil Liability (Amendment) Act ... These provisions were drafted to create a safe space for staff to be open and transparent with patients.</blockquote> <p>How does that sit with current events?  It is very laudable but it does not seem to have been part and parcel of the daily exercise of the HSE in all its workings.  That is one question.  The other thing I notice is that in 2009 HIQA conducted a survey which concluded that the system warranted an ISO 9001 accreditation.</p></speech>

There are many places in which a screening service can fall down.  In the first place, one has to get the patient to the doctor or practice nurse.  One has to get the practice nurse to take the sample correctly.  One then has to get the sample to the laboratory where it must be processed correctly and then one has to get the information which the laboratory generates back to the referring doctor and to the patient.  Clearly, in this process, where the system has broken down is beyond the steps which I have laid out.  It broke down where a quality assurance programme was instituted, which was found to have failed.  In its failure, that information was not passed on.</p><p>The steps I have pointed out have worked pretty well, but it is the step beyond that, which is the conveying of wrong information to the patient, is the reason we are here.</p></speech>

Traditionally with cervical screening, certainly up until instituting national screening, it was the well informed and well off woman who had availed of the benefits of screening.  When one introduces a population-based screening such as this, one eliminates that as much as one can and one includes the entire population.  However, it remains a challenge to get everybody in the target population to avail of the service.  That is one weakness any screening service will have.  The concern will be that the debacle surrounding this, as it was referred to, will make it more difficult to make inroads into the number of women who will not be availing of the service.  Getting the right woman to avail of the service is the first step.  Ideally, the service should be trying to get to nearly 100% but no service achieves that for a variety of reasons, some of which are very valid.</p></speech>

What we are talking about today is how to make what is a satisfactory service better and more comprehensive, in that it will make sure the patient will be informed not only if the result is positive at the time, which is usually considered to be the challenge, but also that if it subsequently turns out to be positive and one looks back and it was negative that will also be included as part of the process.  That is where the system has fallen down on this occasion.</p></speech>

However, I am raising whether a different structure might have been more alert and responsive, whereby the alarm bells about what might have happened might have gone off at an earlier stage and generated a reaction to it.  If the witness was to make recommendations, apart from the ones he just mentioned, relating to the structures of delivering the services to the population of this country, what would they be?</p></speech>

We are talking about days.  I believe it would benefit from being part of a bigger structure.

This does not fundamentally disagree with what Dr. McKenna is saying because he is talking about the present day context.  I spent a number of years doing my best to try to prevent the national cancer screening service board ending up as part of the HSE - it is ironic that I am now the director general of the HSE, although not for too much longer - and I believe that had governance with a non-executive board remained closer to the screening programmes red flags would have been raised more quickly, more locally and more effectively in that structure.</p></speech>

However, I wish to focus on the testing because my concern is that once one turns the health service to a profit motive one gets these mistakes.  The witnesses are at pains to assure us that is not the case, but they have not been able to provide the results from the different laboratories which might go some way to reassuring us.</p></speech>

To be honest, that information should be at the top as the witnesses knew this issue had emerged in the press.  The witness made some disparaging remarks about tests being done on the kitchen table.  That is at odds with what Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith said.  He is not an insignificant person as a former master of the Rotunda Hospital and he called the service it ran accredited and world class.</p> <p>  One cannot dismiss the fact that this was predicted by people ten years ago.  In addition, they said it would be ten years before these problems would emerge.  Some &euro;20 per test multiplied by 3 million, which is &euro;60 million, was paid to a private company which makes massive profits and has connections with Goldman Sachs.  These people are in it for a reason, and it is not for patients.  That was not purely the HSE's decision.  The witness is correct that the D&aacute;il voted for that, despite counter arguments at the time.  The majority of parties, even if they ranted about it at the time, did not challenge it when they came into power.  It is the issue of public services being starved of resources and then being privatised.</p> <p>  I have a question about the rate of testing.  My understanding, and I am open to correction, is that the NHS guidelines are that 50 tests per day is the recommended best practice level.  Quest Diagnostics was doing 90 to 100.  I tried to calculate the figures by dividing 25,000 by 365, but presumably laboratories do not operate for 365 days a year.  They might take weekends off, but I do not know.  However, the rate in Quest Diagnostics must have been nearly twice what the NHS recommends.</p> <p>  A screener is only supposed to carry out a maximum of 5,000 per year.  If there is pressure to make profit by getting as many tests carried out as possible these things are absolutely inevitable.  Corners were cut in women's health at a time when the economy was going into recession.  Again, political parties took that decision.  Why did CervicalCheck downgrade, as I have read, from two deep checks to one deep check and one rapid check in 2011?</p></speech>

What I am trying to address here is a sense that we have evidence of a substantial failure of the cytology service that people here depend on for the reliability of the tests.  We have to try to reassure people about that because they are genuinely worried and concerned.</p> <p>  We carry out approximately 250,000 smears per year.  The abnormal rate that is reported, between high grades and low grades, is approximately 8,000.  I will call that 10,000 for the purpose of simplicity.  That is 240,000 negative test results per year.  We know we have approximately 300 incident cases of cervical cancer in this country per year.</p><p>We believe the test performs at the rate of about 70% sensitivity.  That means it misses about 30% of cancers that are present at the time of testing.  For simplicity, we will say that works out to be somewhere in the region of 100 false negatives.  That gives a false negative rate of substantially less than 1%, therefore, when the accuracy figure of 99% set out in the figures is quoted, it is based on statistics like that.  That is a back of the envelope calculation.  What I am trying to illustrate is that the general assertion - I do not suggest Deputy Coppinger is making this particular assertion - is that there is some evidence here of a substantial failure in the cytology service being used to give people reassurance.  We simply do not have evidence of that.  There have been substantial failures.  There has been clear admission in regard to them, particularly in terms of unacceptable failures of communication to patients, but that cannot be equated with a statement or review.  I have to make that point about the cytology service and the evidence we have in terms of performance.  The point has been made by the director general that the differential performance, about which again there is a legitimate question, can be provided by way of response to the committee.  That may well help to satisfy some of the questions that have been asked.</p></speech>

I have a question on that.  In a case of a false negative, and the frequency of testing is every three years, the rate of growth of cervical cancer is slow.  If someone has a false negative and she comes back in three years' time, is there an estimation of how advanced that cancer would have progressed in those three years?  The benefit of screening is that women are screened every three years in order that a profile of the patient is being built up.  If there is a false negative on one smear, how much of a change would be expected in a three-year period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-02a.636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018050200002#HHH00300"><p>I could hazard offering an answer on that.  Once a woman has a visible, invasive cervical cancer, she will probably live without treatment for about 18 to 24 months.  However, we know, and this is one of the best studied areas of screening in any part of the body, that to get to that stage there is a pre-invasive stage that may take as long as 12 or 15 years, which starts off as a mild abnormality and usually progresses at a reasonable rate to a severe abnormality and then to cancer.  At any of those stages it can revert back to being normal, but the nearer one gets to having an invasive cervical cancer, the more likely it is to progress into being an invasive cancer.  The premise of the Chairman's question is whether one has several opportunities to catch it before it becomes invasive.  The answer is one has many opportunities.  This test, which has a high false negative rate, works because one has several attempts at it over the ten or 12-year period before it turns into an invasive cancer.  If it progressed more rapidly and the test was as good as it is now, it would not work but because it progresses so slowly, this test, which has error built into it, works.</p></speech>

What is happening now is not what he predicted.  What he predicted was that there would be a very high incidence of missed cancers.  The chief medical officer has just taken us through an explanation of why that is not what we are experiencing.  Dr. Gibbons did not predict that there would be a review process that would go so terribly wrong in terms of its communication to patients.  That review process going terribly wrong has got nothing to do with where the slides were read.  Such a review process would have had to occur wherever those slides were processed, including here, and there were such misses when the programme was based in Ireland in terms of its cytology process.  If the same flawed process of communication had occurred, we would still be here having this discussion because it is fundamentally not about an excessive level of miss, taking into account the limitations of this test.  Clearly, any miss is highly regrettable.  While we have this programme, the whole purpose is to prevent cervical cancer.  We do not take some satisfaction from the fact that the miss rate here is simply that which would normally be expected.  We would wish we had a better test, and we will move to a better test, but what Dr. Gibbons predicted is not what we are experiencing.  What we are experiencing does not vindicate the arguments he made ten years ago, however valid.  This does not prove that he was right.</p></speech>

I would imagine that figure is in his head somewhere and that he knows it.  If he does not, he is not doing a proper job.  That is a fundamental question in terms of what was said in 2008.  Mr. O'Brien misrepresented Dr. Gibbons and the obstetrician when he said that that is not what they predicted.  They predicted that in about ten years' time we would see the results of poor-quality testing that had been outsourced to America.  That is what Dr. Gibbons argued at the time.  We are seeing that now but what we are also seeing is an attempt to cover it up.  That is why we want to know what was reported to whom on which I have a few questions to ask.</p></speech>

We are not seeing something that is out of line with what might reasonably be expected in a screening programme based on this technology.  However, with the Chairman's agreement, we will provide full written information on the questions that have just been asked because it is far better done by giving it to the Deputy in writing than seeking to give her that kind of information verbally.</p></speech>

If that is not the case, why did CPL settle the case with Vicky Phelan for &euro;2.5 million?  Why would it do that?  Why would it say, "here is &euro;2.5 million but there is no issue here with us having poor quality testing"?  Our contention is that the outsourcing has delivered poor-quality services in cervical screening for women.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson kicked it up the line.  Who did Mr. Gleeson kick it up the line to?  There are two heads of screening; one is the head of the national cervical screening programme, Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, and the other is the national head of screening overall, Charles O' Hanlon.  To whom was this kicked up the line and what did they do with the information?  Did they at any stage kick it further up the line to the chief medical officer and did he tell the Minister?

Proceedings were made against naming the HSE and another entity, which happened to be a laboratory.  We were informed of that and the State Claims Agency asked if the contract indemnified the HSE in respect of the reading of a test with regard to a co-defendant.  We went to work on that and found that it does.  The plaintiff's legal team was asked if it would drop the case and make it just against the co-defendant, and they said "No".  The legal team said it had an issue around the delay in informing the affected woman.  That element of the case was struck out; it was not that we did not tell the patient, it was noted that the information was late and took a long time.  That was the basis.  After that, any engagement largely centred on legal teams and we were asked if a settlement was proposed during mediation prior to a court appearance.  The State Claims Agency advised that we should be supportive of any such moves.  We took the agency's advice and said "Yes".</p></speech>

That was a specific requirement of the other defendant, which was the laboratory.  It would never be a case - that I am aware of - that we would seek to enter into something like that, or that the State Claims Agency would.

The number was narrowed down to the 400 figure which the Deputy mentioned, and out of those the other concerns were removed, as we have heard.

When Dr. David Gibbons, Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith and others made their warnings and indicated their fears on the consequences of outsourcing, it was not mere speculation.  They had evidence, namely, that the positive rate coming from US laboratories, because of a different methodology or system, was 1.2 rather than 1.8 in Ireland.  Were they correct at that time?  Was that true then?  Is that evidence correct?</p></speech>

They were basing that on a sample of 1,000 slides which had been outsourced from the St. Luke's laboratory and which were not subject to the same requirements as the contract in place from 2008 under CervicalCheck.  While they were correct in what they said, what they referred to was not what CervicalCheck does.</p></speech>

That is their data and I have no reason to question it.  Currently, the return rate of high grade is at 1.66.  A number of things were different.  We have discussed the double reading and the fact that the laboratories in question know they are dealing with a population in Ireland that is screened on a three-year cycle.  They have dedicated cohorts of readers who are screening Irish-originated slides.  None of that was the case with those 1,000 slides.</p></speech>

Here in Ireland the figure was more like 30 to 35 slides.  I would have thought that if a reader is looking at 90 slides each day, the possibility of making mistakes is considerably higher than if he or she is doing 30 to 35 or a maximum of 50.  That was one of their concerns.  Will the witnesses tell us if that continued to be the case after the contract for the screening programme was established?</p> <p>  Is the 1.66 rate that the witnesses mentioned, which is still lower than 1.8, across the results from both the Irish and American tests?  We were told that 50% are still being done in Ireland and 50% are being done in the US.  When the witnesses give the figure of 1.66, is that the aggregate of both the Irish and American tests?  If it is, that does not tell us specifically what detection rate is coming from the American laboratories.</p></speech>

The Minister had been told about it ten days before it became a matter for public concern, and the Department knew about it ten days before that.  It is fair to say that the system was caught completely off guard.  Did the Department do anything to prepare for the potential publicity and public reaction which has ensued before it became public?</p></speech>

I do not want to take up the Deputy's time in giving a long-winded answer but the information we received gave us no reason to believe that there were concerns that went beyond the individual case.  That has manifestly proved not to be the case and the public information that came out on the Thursday of that week made that very clear for everyone.</p></speech>

We had no reason to believe that this was anything other than an isolated case.  Again, I do not wish to be long-winded.  We receive notifications, formal and otherwise, from lots of sources about individual cases.  They come to the Minister; they come through the media; they come from the HSE and many other sources.  Our initial focus is to try to determine first and foremost if there is a reason to believe that this leads to a concern about a service and a potential risk to people who are not yet using that service, in other words that the service is not safe.  That is our primary line of questioning.  That is the basis on which we would interact.</p> <p>  Our next issue to try to satisfy is whether we have any evidence that there is a group of people who have been harmed as a result of contact with the service who now have to be identified and a lookback or something of that nature required.  If we can satisfy both of those questions in the negative on the basis of the information, we would take the view that that is an issue that does not have wider patient-safety concerns.  That is not in any way to take away from a view that the individual case and the case for an individual might be something of great significance.</p></speech>

However, if the Department's role is to determine potential adverse future use of screening services, which is exactly what has happened, should officials not have asked the national screening service when it said: "This is Vicky Phelan's case.  This is what is coming.  There is an issue of a false negative.  Actually it is more serious than that.  It is a missed screening of cancer.  The State Claims Agency say in their view there is going to be publicity around that."?  I know hindsight is a wonderful thing.  Should officials not have asked the national screening service if this was an isolated case or if there were other issues?  Officials gave the Minister a note and therefore knew about it.  The court case from the State's perspective centred on non-disclosure.  Where there is potential liability to the State and it goes to the confidence of the screening service, would officials not regularly ask if it is an isolated case or if there are more?  Should that question not be asked?</p></speech>

That question was not asked as part of the interrogation.  As the Deputy said, we are speaking with the benefit of hindsight.  I gave him a sense of the primary purpose of the assurances we would give to a Minister in that situation and the role of that.  I can go through that in more detail.  On our index of suspicion, so to speak, regarding what has now come to pass that there was a widespread - I will not say systemic - practice whereby discordant smear test results were not being fully fed back to patients, there was nothing in that note that could reasonably be said on the basis of what it said at the time to give any reasonable index of suspicion that that was the case - that that would be a reasonable line of questioning.</p></speech>

I do not know if the national screening service, itself, had a significant suspicion that this issue of open disclosure and the thing that the Deputy referenced in the note were likely to a substantial concern - that it had a substantial concern about that practice - because it did not know about it either.  Events of recent days have shown that.  The extent of that has only come to light through our investigations once we became aware.</p></speech>

CervicalCheck not only knew this it was a wider issue, but it was actively involved in the wider issue.</p></speech>

This is a very worrying illustration of a culture of silence.  I presume he is doing a lot of thinking about this issue.  Why are clinicians not disclosing information to patients, which is clearly in contravention of the HSE's open disclosure policy?</p></speech>

It should be ingrained in their clinical practice when they are relaying good and indeed bad news every day of their lives.  It should be ingrained in their training.  </p> <p>  In this case, my reading of this looking back is that there was an audit designed for quality assurance and learning, and that the linkage between that learning and quality assurance audit to the clinicians who are treating the cervical cancer patients was never closed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-02a.772" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1436" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018050200002#LLL01500"><p>When CervicalCheck finally acted, it informed the clinicians in 2016.  We know that in 13 hospitals and in three out of every four patient cases, the doctors did not relay on the information.  That is nothing to do with training and what one understands the purpose of an audit to be.  The doctors were told of these serious incidents.  They were presumably aware of the HSE's open disclosure policy.  Furthermore, even if they are only acting in enlightened self-interest, the Taoiseach in the D&aacute;il yesterday and again today, and the Medical Council representatives before this committee this morning, stated that the level of non-disclosure involved in these cases - I am not talking about any individual clinicians - could lead to a clinician being struck off.</p> <p>  Given it being so contrary to a culture or at least a stated policy of open disclosure and given that it could lead to them being struck off - these are people who have dedicated their lives to saving men and women - why do they choose to put themselves at such risk and act contrary to open disclosure?  What is going on?</p></speech>

In these particular circumstances, there was a dispute as to who had the responsibility to disclose this information to the patients.  Did the duty lie with the programme that had collected the information about the audit or did it lie with the clinicians?  That degree of disagreement can be seen coming through the correspondence the Deputy has.  It was not that there was a decision not to tell.  Unfortunately the discussion centred on who should tell and this was the subject of the disagreement.</p></speech>

Clearly if there was no issue; there would not have been that.  The clinicians would have got the results and if they felt safe and ethically bound to tell their patient, they would have just told their patient.  However, they did not do that.  Clearly something is stopping the clinicians from sharing the information.  It is really important that we try to understand what that is.  Until we understand what that is and name it and do something about it, one of the adverse outcomes of this saga is that patients will no longer believe as a matter of default that their doctor is being fully open with them.  I know I am asking the witnesses to hypothesise and speculate, but what is causing the doctors to put their patients and indeed themselves in this situation?</p></speech>

There will be an investigation into those facts and how they might have played out in these cases that might help to elucidate the specifics.  That goes to the heart of the question he asked earlier about the advice I gave the previous Minister for Health and now Taoiseach and gave to the current Minister which seems to be counterintuitive.  The reality is that it is complex.  In the minds of many medical practitioners, what plays into their decisions are fears over creating medical legal risk for themselves.  This may not be the reality in terms of genuine risk, but there is a perception there.  All too often when harm occurs, instead of embracing the opportunity to sit with patients and explain, sometimes the temptation on the part of practitioners is to circle the wagons, close ranks and not share information.  I could give a long list of cases where that has been at the very heart of those practices.</p> <p>  Without going into detail, the purpose ultimately of what is in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act is to essentially offer protections to doctors and standards on open disclosure, effectively saying that if they do it in the right way, these protections will be offered to them.  That allows us to give them reassurance and say that it is a safe and worthwhile thing to do and to encourage it.  There is a judgment at the heart of my advice around which is likely to be more effective, because we want to see disclosure happening in every case.</p><p>We want to encourage people to do the right thing rather than require them to do something they are unwilling to do.  We want doctors to do the right thing.  That is a very shortened version of complex advice.</p></speech>

Medical practitioners have historically feared the consequences of full open disclosure, as has been outlined.  The more protection that is afforded, the easier it will be to create an environment where doctors can discuss all outcomes, including adverse outcomes, directly and confidentially with patients, which is what we want to have in every clinical scenario in this country.</p></speech>

It feels like we have been here for 20 hours.  I thank all the witnesses for remaining with us this evening.  The committee members are aware that the meeting has been prolonged but we have questions which must be answered.</p> <p>  Two people in this room - Dr. McKenna and Dr. Henry - received the letter from Vicky Phelan's consultant.  I do not understand what happened after they received the letter, nor why it was not brought to the attention of senior management.  What did they do when they read it?  Its content, with which I am sure they are familiar, is astonishing.</p></speech>

I regret that I did not follow up to check on who that would be or, more importantly, that it was being done.  I was led to believe that the matter had been resolved.</p></speech>

How high up did this go?  He is a very senior person in the HSE structure and was such when he received the letter.  Did he feel the need to give it to a more senior person?  Did he speak to people on the same level as himself?  Did he inform the Department?  Were any other letters of that nature in circulation?  This type of letter would cause me alarm and prompt me to take action.  I do not think I would be happy to walk away and assume everything would be okay, given that the purpose of the letter was to advise that everybody in the equation was assuming that somebody else was taking action.  Nobody was doing so.  In the intervening time, information was being withheld from women, as per the circular that was issued.  Notwithstanding that, did Dr. McKenna or Dr. Henry feel obliged to take action?  With whom did Dr. Henry discuss the letter and what action did he take?</p></speech>

I regret that that outcome was not achieved.  At the time, I believed no further actions were required by me as a clinical adviser once the clinicians had met the lead of the cervical screening programme and I had been assured that that caused a change in the communication policy and there would be further engagement on a consensus approach which would lead to patients being informed.  If I had known the patients were not going to be informed, I would not have been happy.</p></speech>

I am not critical of Dr. Henry for thinking that he had done what was asked of him, which was to facilitate a resolution, as he was advised that had been resolved, although that proved not to be the case.  He is not accountable for that resolution not being followed through to delivery.  Those who said they had resolved it but did not deliver must be accountable for that.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien has advised us, notwithstanding the opinion we may or may not have on how good he is at doing his job, that he intends to devote himself and the time remaining to him to tackling this issue, let us say the latest scandal-----</p></speech>

I would like to give a little more detail of what the Taoiseach was talking about this morning, although in the circumstances, I do not want to spend a long time in describing it.  If we call the total 3,000 people for the purposes of discussion, whether they are part of the original 1,482 or the cohort that has to be identified, each case is to be looked at through an international process we are to establish.  We have taken steps to begin to mobilise some of that expertise.  It will require us to gain access to some of the slide materials from some of the laboratories.  It will require us to do the data matching that was described.  Any discordance, in the 208 cases we know about or any other one we might identify, will be subject to a full clinical review which will involve assessment by an international panel of experts capable of making it.  It will include a review of charts and a meeting with each of the individual patients.  Each individual woman who finds herself in this situation will have the question addressed as to the likelihood it has had an impact on either her treatment at the time of diagnosis or the eventual outcome.  In very tragic cases where people are no longer alive, for the next of kin who will such information, it will help to address some of the questions for them.</p> <p>  We also see some of the information in the findings of that process which will bring it to one report which will be published being made available to feed into ongoing consideration of the redress process that the Taoiseach this morning indicated that he was open to considering and to which the Government will give consideration.  We are also giving further consideration - I know that the Minister has taken steps today to engage with other parties to - to the question as to what will be the most effective investigative vehicle to bring closure to some of the items of information, in particular some of the additional items that came into the public domain last evening.  With the Minister amd as the director general said, we will receive receive daily reports from the head of the serious incident management team, SIMT, and Mr. Damien McCallion who will have operational responsibility.  We will receive a daily report from the director general on progress in the management of everything that has been described.</p></speech>
