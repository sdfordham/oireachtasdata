    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/996" speakername="Michael McCarthy" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400002#A00300"><p>Ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh na finn&eacute;ithe &oacute; Uisce &Eacute;ireann anseo inniu.  Is d&oacute;cha go mbeidh cruinni&uacute; sp&eacute;isi&uacute;il agus suimi&uacute;il againn.  Ar aghaidh linn.  I welcome the team from Uisce &Eacute;ireann, Mr. John Tierney, Mr. Paul O'Donoghue, Mr. John Dempsey, Mr. John Barry and Mr. Ger Cowhig to our meeting.  I acknowledge that we issued an invitation to them to attend this meeting very late on Friday afternoon, for obvious reasons, and I thank them for confirming they would attend and supplying the information in advance of today's meeting.  I am sure the committee members found it very helpful in terms of researching their questions for our exchange this afternoon.</p><p>  I have stated consistently that the creation of Uisce &Eacute;ireann is a good news story.  It is a very significant undertaking and a gargantuan task on the part of the State to transfer the delivery of water services from 34 local authorities to one single public utility.  Obviously the level of curiosity and disquiet on the issue of consultancy fees is the focus of our meeting this afternoon.</p><p>  I acknowledge that the management of Uisce &Eacute;ireann will come before the committee in February to discuss other issues related to the set-up, roll-out and so forth and other very significant matters.</p> <p>The primary focus of this meeting, however, is to establish precisely how much money was spent on consultants, the purpose for which it was used, whether taxpayers obtained value for money, whether the expenditure was worthwhile and what we have as a result of it.  I gave the example of information technology this morning when I asked whether Irish Water paid for IT advice or a physical manifestation of IT resources.  This will be at the forefront of questioners' minds.</p><p> I will first call the main spokespersons who will have longer speaking times than other members.  The first speaker is Deputy Brian Cowen, followed by Deputies Brian Stanley, Catherine Murphy, Kevin Humphreys and Noel Coonan.  Other members of the committee may then contribute and non-members will subsequently have an opportunity to ask questions.  The question-and-answer format is the best use of our time.  </p><p> Before I ask Mr. Tierney some questions on the establishment of Irish Water and other matters, I will refer to the technical aspects of giving evidence and the protection afforded to witnesses.   I draw attention to the fact that, by virtue of 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House, a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Opening statements made to the committee and the proceedings of the meeting will be published on the committee's website.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I described Bord G&aacute;is as being in many respects the midwife of Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  The reasonable assumption on the part of all concerned is that, given that Bord G&aacute;is is an established utility company, Irish Water would have expertise available to it in the areas of billing, supply, technical services and operational capacity.  That being said, we accept that this expertise will not be 100% and Irish Water will have to avail of outside expertise on occasion.  At what level did it become obvious that outside expertise was necessary?  Can we be guaranteed that the consultancy services used by Uisce &Eacute;ireann were not available within the resources of Bord G&aacute;is?</p><p> On processes and the decisions made on consultancy services that have given rise to the expenditure under discussion, I ask Mr. Tierney to indicate who in Uisce &Eacute;ireann made the relevant decisions and who ultimately signed off on those decisions.  Was the Government kept informed of this expenditure?  Was it made aware of it in advance and was its sanction required?  Was the Cabinet aware of the expenditure?  I ask Mr. Tierney to bear in mind my questions when he makes his opening remarks.  I invite him to address the committee. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tierney" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400003#B00200"><p>While the Chairman introduced my colleagues, I propose to elaborate on the position before we start.  Mr. Paul O'Donoghue and Mr. John Dempsey, who are seated on either side of me, are part of the Irish Water management team, while Mr. John Barry and Mr. Ger Cowhig are part of the Irish Water programme in Bord G&aacute;is.  They are working on building the permanent organisation and its systems before handing them to us, as the Irish Water company, to run the business.  To give a simple example of this, metering was set up and then handed to the business last July.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to present to them.  We are here to talk to them about implementing Government policy and the process involved in undertaking one of the largest reform projects in the history of the State.</p> <p>We understood the committee to have come here today to hear an explanation of four things: what money is being spent on establishing Irish Water; whether it is being appropriately spent and whether we are getting good value; whether the proper controls are in place to approve and control spending; and whether consultants or external service providers were required.</p><p> Bord G&aacute;is was given a mandate to establish Irish Water as a key part of the water reform programme.  We set out for Government our approach to delivering Irish Water back in January 2012.  Our proposal was to establish it as a modern utility that would deliver a world-class water system and the best possible value for the customer.  In order to deliver this we established the Irish Water programme and assembled a team comprising the best utility expertise in Bord G&aacute;is combined with the water and wastewater expertise of the local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  This team scoped out the full project to deliver a new company with the capability of managing all of the public water and waste water assets and deliver services to customers.  That programme was to run from April 2012 to April 2015, with one of the key milestones being to ensure we had all the systems, processes and capabilities in place to take over &euro;11 billion worth of assets from 1 January 2014.</p><p> The budget as submitted by Bord G&aacute;is for the programme was &euro;150 million, with a project contingency of &euro;30 million.  This entire programme and associated budget, as well as the approach to resourcing and staffing the programme, was rigorously examined and approved by both the internal Bord G&aacute;is governance and approval processes and the relevant Departments.  The full programme, associated works scope and full costs were presented to the Department in September 2012.  Bord G&aacute;is standard programme management methodology has been applied to the Irish Water programme, with monthly reports to the Bord G&aacute;is internal steering committee, the Bord G&aacute;is board, the recently established Irish Water board and the Department.</p><p> Bord G&aacute;is set out clearly from the outset that while the core capability of defining what was required to establish Irish Water existed within Bord G&aacute;is, it would require the use of specialist service providers to help implement the programme.  In essence, the Bord G&aacute;is team, in conjunction with secondees from the local authorities and the Department, specified what was required.  Bord G&aacute;is used its experience and its existing systems and processes to define the requirements for Irish Water.  In the main, this required us to specify and implement five major utility information systems: a customer care and billing system, a work and asset management system, a financial system, a procurement system and capital project management systems.  All of these were based on existing Bord G&aacute;is systems, but the specification had to reflect the needs of a water utility, as distinct from an energy utility, and meet the needs of an organisation approximately three times the size of Bord G&aacute;is today.</p><p> In order to design and implement these systems to the specifications set out by Bord G&aacute;is, we engaged external service providers through a competitive procurement process.  They are experts in the building and integration of complex utility information systems.  The use of such expertise is standard practice for utilities internationally and is seen as the most efficient practice in terms of both delivery and cost management.  These service providers have joined our team temporarily to help us build a hugely valuable asset.  We did not bring in experts to tell us how to build Irish Water, to answer the Chairman's point.  We brought in contractors to help us build the systems and processes necessary to run the business.  This is standard practice in utility businesses.  In our case, we simultaneously built five major systems and procured global specialist expertise to ensure that the most efficient industry practice is being deployed.  The following are the major companies that were used by Irish Water to help deliver the required systems and processes: IBM, Accenture, Ernst &amp;amp; Young and KPMG.  To date we have invested approximately &euro;100 million in the delivery of the programme and approximately &euro;50 million of this was used on such specialists.  The Irish Water programme will run to April 2015 and will obviously be run down on a graduated basis between now and then in order to finalise the systems I have described and deliver two more, a geographic information system and a mobile workforce management system.</p><p> The main scope of external work went out to public tender in nine lots and, following a detailed evaluation of the bids, we secured fixed-price lump sum contracts to deliver the major work scopes.  Importantly, we only pay out when we have a proven deliverable.  Based on the delivery of the full scope of work, we expect the final cost of the work packages to be as follows: IBM, for three lots, &euro;44.8 million; Accenture, for three lots, &euro;17.2 million; Ernst &amp;amp; Young, &euro;4.6 million; and KPMG, &euro;2.2 million.</p> <p>Detailed explanation of the works involved comes later in the document.  These systems will enable Irish Water to deliver a minimum of &euro;2 billion worth of savings for the Exchequer by 2021 and provide the Irish people with a fit-for-purpose water system that will ensure the public health and safety of our communities, facilitate economic development and protect our environment.  </p><p> Bord G&aacute;is is privileged to have been selected as the company to establish Irish Water.  It has been a hugely demanding task and the approach taken accords with best international practice.  The Irish water programme has been established to deliver this huge reform project and it is being delivered on time and within budget.  Irish Water, as a new modern utility, is up and running since 1 January 2014 as planned. </p><p> I will go back to the questions I posed earlier.  On the question of what money is being spent on establishing Irish Water, I have outlined the overall programme cost.  With regard to whether it is being spent appropriately and whether we are getting good value, the answer is "Yes, it is," because we procured on the open market on the basis of fixed price.  It benchmarks favourably and has the capacity to save the Exchequer &euro;2 billion by 2021.  On the question of whether the proper controls are in place to approve and control spending, governance both internally and externally is rigorous.  On whether consultants and external service providers were required, from the very outset, Bord G&aacute;is advised the Government that this type of support was critical to delivering the programme and achieving the targets set in a demanding timeframe.  In terms of achieving targets to date, the performance has been outstanding in meeting the milestones set for the metering programme initially and now in having Irish Water in place to commence its work as Ireland&rsquo;s newest utility.</p><p> I will now give a brief synopsis of what is in the rest of the document I submitted.  Section 2, on page 4 of the document, deals with Government policy.  The proposal to establish Irish Water was contained in the programme for Government announced in 2011.  Despite the fact that since 2000 investment of &euro;4 billion had been made in wastewater treatment, environmental compliance remains a major factor.  Currently the EU is taking an infringement case against Ireland for non-compliance with EU standards on up to 80 plants.  Many other plants cannot satisfy EPA license standards.   Despite the issues at the time, before making a decision to go ahead with the establishment of Irish Water, the Government asked the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to carry out an independent assessment in 2012.  This assessment made key findings, recorded on page 5 of the document, which relate to both existing provisions and recommendations for the new organisation.</p><p> Page 6 of the document provided summarises these findings. In summary, to establish Irish Water to deal with the chronic problems in the system there was a requirement for utility-standard asset management, utility-standard workflow practices, utility-standard procurement practices, and an appropriate IT infrastructure to support this.  In regard to the programme strategy and budget, as far back as January 2012 Bord G&aacute;is set out its strategy to the Government for delivering Irish Water.  The model put forward in response to what Government was requesting was to utilise the core experience of Bord G&aacute;is and supplement that with support from third-party service providers for an intense short period in order to deliver Irish Water as cost-effectively as possible.  </p><p> Page 8 of the document provides a summary of the budget submitted by Bord G&aacute;is in September 2012.  This budget work was grouped into various lots for the purpose of tendering activity.  The tender process is described in detail on page 9, as is the conclusion of the contracts.  Page 10 provides a summary of the significant lots plus the legal services tendered by Irish Water for consultants.  The main legal services have been highlighted.  On that page, reference is made to a figure of approximately &euro;13.3 million and 18 contractors, but that should refer to 22 contractors, and we will circulate that list of contractors today for information.  We are happy to respond to any other queries in regard to this.</p><p> Section 4 of the document, on page 11, deals with the budget process, the establishment of Irish Water and timelines.  As I mentioned already, we made a submission in January 2012 and in response to the Department's queries a detailed statement of capability was provided, which confirmed that as part of the project Bord G&aacute;is would have to use external service providers.</p> <p>Next, we provide important timelines in the process, starting with the mobilisation phase from May to August 2012, following on to September 2012, when the budget for the programme was submitted in the sum of &euro;150 million plus contingencies, recognising that any contingency would need further express approval of individual items from the Department if it arose.  In December 2012, Bord G&aacute;is received a cost recovery letter from the Department amounting to &euro;50 million expenditure to the end of March 2013 and permission to enter capital commitments totalling &euro;80 million with termination rights in the contracts.  These were requirements of Bord G&aacute;is, having regard to good governance prior to proceeding with the project.  In March 2013 we began the formal financial reporting letters to the Department, with submission of the year to date budgets and the actual spend.  We also submitted an outline of the lots that I mentioned earlier, defining what each lot means and the outcome of procurement processes and an indication of the scores.   On 25 and 26 July, Irish Water received a letter from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for consent for Irish Water to enter into a &euro;250 million loan facility with the National Pensions Reserve Fund, to facilitate the metering programme and establishment costs.  We can see that in December, CER recognized that the establishment of Irish Water was a significant undertaking and efficiently incurred costs should be allowed into a regulated asset base.  In other words, those costs themselves were to be treated as an asset.  The CER further noted that all of the activities described by Irish Water are core to delivering the objective of a national integrated water service provider with associated benefits to customers and other stakeholders in Ireland.  The CER also noted that Irish Water has drawn heavily on BGE personnel and processes, which is the most efficient means of establishing Irish Water; in other words, the most cost beneficial.</p><p> On page 15 of the presentation, we take the reader through what the money is being spent on, from the work and asset management and capital programme planning, and managing and operating &euro;11 billion of assets, to page 17, where we outline customer operations and billing functions, and how we have to manage the expectations of 1.8 million customers, which is the largest customer base of any organisation in the country.  The support services are listed on page 18 and outline the systems required for supporting 4,300 staff and so on, working with the local authorities to perform their roles.</p><p> I will not go through the issue of benefits, except to state that the end of the benefits section on page 20 shows the projection over an eight year period to 2021, regarding the combination of these total efficiencies of &euro;1.1 billion, along with other factors such as the increased income resulting from the introduction of domestic water charges, which will result in a net reduction of at least &euro;2 billion in Exchequer funding of the water industry than would have been the case, absent Irish Water.</p><p> Benchmarking, which is outlined on page 21, is quite important.   We can glean certain information from documents in respect of UK utilities.  For example, Severn Trent Water expects to spend &pound;101 million to upgrade its systems with the objective of achieving the "lowest possible charges".  Thames Water installed a new working asset management system in 2011, which is one of the five that we are talking about here, at a cost of &pound;150 million.  We provide a Scottish example and an Irish example from bringing together an all island single electricity market.</p><p> I have tried to convey the reality of the situation.  Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water were asked to deliver a project based on Government policy, with an incredibly exacting timeframe.  This is what we are doing, within time and on budget.  There have been extremely demanding timelines involved, and the people who have worked in this project to make this happen deserve great credit in my view.</p> <p>I have tried to cover as much as I could in the synopsis.  Obviously, we will take every question the committee wishes to ask.</p></speech>

Members who have had it for some time would have had a chance to go through it and they can ask whatever questions they wish.</p><p>  A reasonable assumption was made relating to capacity within, and the expertise of, Bord G&aacute;is Energy in utilities and technological services, the operational expertise in terms of building services, the size of the customer base and so on.  The reasonable expectation was that Uisce &Eacute;ireann would rely on that in the process of its inception.  At what point did it become obvious that outside expertise was required?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tierney" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400007#F00300"><p>It was given at the outset.  I will ask Mr. Barry to cover the topic in terms of being there at the beginning of the project.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Barry" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400007#F00400"><p>We made a submission to the Department in January 2012 before we were asked to carry out this task.  Certainly, embedded in that submission clearly was the fact that we had certain competencies and skills as a utility but we would have to rely on external service providers to build the technology for us and to write the processes for us.  That would be standard in any task of this magnitude.  When an organisation is building such systems and making them go live it needs external service providers.  It is very technical.</p><p>  I believe the word "consultants" is a misnomer.  These are service providers, technical experts, process engineers, software engineers and so on.  I am making the point clearly and upfront that we simply would not have had the capability within Bord G&aacute;is Energy to deliver such systems on such a scale in the timeframe delivered.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/996" speakername="Michael McCarthy" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400007#F00500"><p>There are other models of delivery in Scotland, Wales and England.  Did Uisce &Eacute;ireann take advice from those companies and use that advice accordingly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Barry" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400007#F00600"><p>We certainly did.  We would have engaged with them, principally on the difference between being a gas and a water utility.  We would have taken advice from them.  However, we certainly brought our own expertise in running a utility business to bear.  That was at the forefront.  Bord G&aacute;is Energy people would have driven this programme from the start with that competence and expertise.  We would have brought in the service providers, guided them, directed them and put down demanding schedules for them.  We would have liaised with them, principally on the difference between water and gas, which was very relevant.  We dealt with organisations such as Scottish Water and Thames Water.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tierney" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400007#F00700"><p>Another important point is that mobilising this type of resource is a one-in-20-year situation, and the experience of the utilities in the United Kingdom, for example, bears this out.  An organisation would not carry this type of expertise or resource because the scale of the work is only mobilised in our case at our beginning and in the case of the other organisations when they have reached the end of a certain cycle.</p></speech>

Who would have ultimately approved the expenditure in respect of the contracts for service providers?  My next question is allied to that.  Was the Government kept informed?  Was individual notice sent to the Minister, the Department or the Cabinet?</p></speech>

It is on page 11.  I am going through the key points in the timeline.  The committee will find the timelines on page 11.  We did the scope document, which we finished in August 2012.  In September 2012 we had a budget completed, which we submitted to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  That outlined the budget cost of &euro;150 million plus a 30% contingency.  Further on, we sent the budget to NewERA.  We forwarded that in November.  We had a meeting with the Commission for Energy Regulation and we provided a high level outline of the budget to the commission at that stage.  That was all done before we engaged in any contracts or anything like that.  The budget was known at that stage, before we engaged in contracts and before the tendering process was complete.  We had fully informed the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, NewERA and the CER at that stage.</p></speech>

There will be several interactions during this process of questioning on the report we have just received.</p><p>  The document the delegates have presented today is very welcome.  The circumstances surrounding its publication are unfortunate.  Much of its content is answers that other members and I would have expected when they questioned the Minister in recent months.  Irish Water has been handed what Mr. Tierney deems to be &euro;11 billion worth of assets in the form of the networks throughout the country.  It has been afforded hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers&rsquo; money towards its formation and setting up.  I am puzzled as to why others and I speaking on behalf of the taxpayer get no answers when we ask how that money has been spent.  I get no answers from the Minister, the Department, Bord G&aacute;is or Irish Water.  Will Mr. Tierney, as CEO of this huge organisation which will deliver one of the most important services to the people on any given day, with the amount of expertise at his disposal, tell me what happens when a question such as mine is put to the Minister?  Does he block information or is he directed to block it?  Why did we have to wait until a question similar to one I had asked was asked by a radio journalist last week?  Suddenly we find ourselves here with all of the answers.  Will Mr. Tierney elaborate on that point first? </p></speech>

The Deputy is correct about the importance of the &euro;11 billion worth of assets mentioned.  One of the reasons for setting up Irish Water is that these assets are in difficulty in many situations.  Under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-13, there was a call from local authorities that approximately &euro;6.2 billion needed to be spent on these assets.  One of the main reasons for setting us up is to deal with the issues associated with these assets.</p></speech>

He says Irish Water has no role in the process of responding to parliamentary questions.  The Minister&rsquo;s answer to me was that the Department would be in touch with Irish Water which would, in turn, give me an answer.  I have not heard from it.  It has public relations people at its disposal.  Is it not their job to watch out for the publication of such questions?  Did the Department or some of his own staff make Mr. Tierney aware of the questions asked?  Was there a decision not to respond?  Was the Department not in touch with him?  Was he not in touch with it to give an answer?  I am at a loss to know how this process breaks down.  Like everybody else here, I am elected with a duty to the taxpayer to question and hold bodies to account for how they spend their funds.  I am simply trying to do my job.  Who is not doing his or her job?  Why am I and others not getting the answers to which we believe the taxpayer is entitled?</p></speech>

I am concerned that it appears the only reason we are here today and the only reason we have been provided with extensive replies is because Mr. Tierney answered a question from a radio journalist last week, a question to which I or others could not get an answer in our Parliament.  Mr. Tierney tells me he was not aware of the questions.  Is it that the Department did not inform him or his staff were not aware that the questions were asked?</p></speech>

In my view, the first lesson in that regard may be for someone to acknowledge the failings of that system to which Mr. Tierney referred.  This does not in any way create the sort of trust and support that Mr. Tierney and the rest of us need in order for the job to be carried out effectively and to ensure that the taxpayers can be confident that their money is being spent properly.  When I and other public representatives cannot get answers to our questions asked in the forum to which we were elected, there needs to be a change in the culture.  My hope is that Mr. Tierney, together with the Department and the Minister, might find a solution to that issue.  Those are my views on that topic.</p><p>  There is a new-found interest in transparency.  The process was constructed in such a way as to keep much of the information at bay.  Considering his previous answer is Mr. Tierney committed to absolute transparency as part of his function as chief executive officer of Irish Water?</p></speech>

If Mr. Tierney is telling me that the culture is going to change, I am pleased to hear it because this blocking of information cannot continue.  I refer to the table in the reply. There is no information in it about me asking why a decision was taken against the advice of a PwC report.</p> <p>There might be a very credible answer to that question and that should be the case.  Unfortunately, however, it has not been provided.  I am glad it has been stated that there will be a change in the culture and in the manner in which information is given to us and that the entire process will be transparent in nature.</p></speech>

In other words, whether it should have been a stand-alone, from-the-ground-up entity or whether the offices of Bord G&aacute;is, the ESB or Bord na M&oacute;na should have been used in the process.

The first point I made is that I welcome this but I also outlined my disappointment about communications breaking down to the extent that the same questions were asked some months ago and the relevant answers were not provided at that stage.</p><p>  Does Mr. Tierney believe that Irish Water should be subject to scrutiny by the Comptroller and Auditor General?  It is not configured to allow for such scrutiny as matters stands.  If the legislation under which the company was established were amended, would he be amenable to that?</p></speech>

I will take that as a "Yes".  The existing legislation passed by the D&aacute;il - by means of a Government-imposed guillotine - prior to Christmas includes an obligation on Irish Water's representatives to come before this committee once a year.  Provision was not made to allow the committee to compel the company's representatives to come before it more often than that.  In the interests of the newfound transparency, the willingness to be accountable and so forth, would our guests be willing to come before the committee on more than one occasion each year if they were directed to do so?</p></speech>

This is an indication of Irish Water's continued willingness in that regard.  As stated, the legislation only makes provision for one meeting per year and the representatives of Irish Water cannot be compelled to come before us again during a calendar year if they do not wish to do so.  I am glad to hear that Mr. Tierney is interested in that issue.</p> <p> Another issue, which has been mentioned in recent days, is that of commercial sensitivity.  Will Mr. Tierney assure the committee that this issue will not be used as a barrier to the provision of information from Irish Water to this committee or any other body of the State into the future?  As colleagues have pointed out, Irish Water has no competitors.  It is a semi-State organisation which effectively has a monopoly and controls &euro;11 billion worth of taxpayers' assets.  Will Mr. Tierney give a commitment that commercial sensitivity will not be used as a barrier to our obtaining information into the future?</p></speech>

Prior to this meeting, for example, we discussed the release of the information we have given with all of the providers who had no issue with that disclosure.  We are part of a regulated model.  There are situations, for instance, where in the case of competitive processes between bidders, the release of information might damage further tenders.  We have to keep in mind those types of situations in the context of the legal piece.  My colleague Mr. Barry might expand briefly on this issue.</p></speech>

We contacted all of the service providers we have listed today to obtain their permission.  We have no difficulty with sharing the information so long as it does not tend to impact on the commercial competitiveness we want in the marketplace vis-&agrave;-vis bidders.  That is the important point.  We want to drive benefits and cost savings.  We want a very competitive supply base, with suppliers actively competing for projects and services we wish to buy or procure.  In regard to the point of principle, however, we do not have a difficulty-----</p></speech>

Like Deputy Cowen, I have been drawing a blank with my questions on this major project during the past two years.  I do not agree with the political decision to set it up but, nevertheless, we are where we are.</p><p>  On the recruitment process for outside consultants, was the Minister, Deputy Hogan, or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, informed of the scale of the outside help that would be needed?  Were they aware of the major contracts that were being awarded?  Mr. Tierney mentioned one of &euro;44 million.  That is one part of my question in that respect, and there is another part to it.  It was reported in one of this morning's newspapers that four contracts had been awarded without open competition.  Can Mr. Tierney clarify that?  Can he state here categorically that every contract was open to competitive tendering on the open market?  I have a number of questions and I will move along quickly.</p></speech>

Were the delegates aware at that point, having seen that report, of the scale of external contract assistance that would be needed?</p></speech>

I am sure the Department will clarify that it mainly dealt with the likely configuration of the future company.  In October of that year, as I recall, the Department published the implementation plan for Irish Water, having been advised that a number of the work streams within Bord G&aacute;is would be working on the implementation of Irish Water.  However, it was also clearly stipulated that Bord G&aacute;is would be taking on external service providers as part of the process.  That was published on the Government website at the time.</p></speech>

As we explained, we are talking here about a once in 20 years scenario in terms of spend and the cycles of development of a company.  It was always going to require specialised mobile expertise to do the system building, create the product, that is, the utility, and deliver on the mandate being given to that utility in terms of assets, operations and serving 1.8 million customers.</p></speech>

Like other questions that have been answered in recent days, people in the corner shop were able to give me the answers because they had heard Mr. Tierney talking on radio or through bits and pieces that have been emerging through the print media in recent days.  However, Members have been unable to get such answers in the Chamber, which is the problem with setting up a company like this.  Anyway, members are here now.</p><p> Mr. Tierney has outlined that the start-up costs will be &euro;150 million and possibly a further &euro;30 million.  Would it be safe to state Mr. Tierney will need this &euro;30 million?  As for the Minister's knowledge in this regard, by what date was the Minister aware that Mr. Tierney would need &euro;180 million to set up Uisce &Eacute;ireann?  If I heard Mr. Tierney correctly earlier, he stated that in September 2012, he had prepared and presented this budget.  Consequently, if the Department knew, did Mr. Tierney speak to the Minister about this?  Was a circular sent to the Minister by Uisce &Eacute;ireann directly to notify him of this or did Mr. Tierney expect that his departmental officials would let him know?  I refer either to the Minister of State directly responsible for water or the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

In respect of the cost of establishment, we have set out the complete process here.  Moreover, I have gone through this with the Deputy previously in respect of the previous answer.  Part of the process is that the advice of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, is also given to the Minister and that process is actually under way at present as the CER has advised separately.  However, the Department will answer with regard to the internal processes within the Department.</p></speech>

In recent days, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has stated it will save &euro;2 billion over a seven-year period.  If one takes it that at present, it costs &euro;1.2 billion to run the service across the Twenty-six Counties, one is looking at a cost of &euro;8.4 billion over a seven-year period.  Therefore, if &euro;2 billion is to be saved, that means the cost will be reduced to &euro;6.4 billion.  Will Irish Water be able to achieve this reduction?  If so, Mr. Tierney should riddle me this one.  At present, slightly more than 4,000 staff are employed in local authorities in respect of the provision of water services.  A macro-structure is to be imposed on top of that and is in the process of being created.  I understand the midwife is busy at work at present and approximately 500 staff are involved in this regard.  Mr. Tierney should explain to me in the first instance how, with that structure on top of the existing local authority staff - all of whom will stay in place - he expects to make those savings?  How does he expect to be able to reduce the cost of providing water services by 2021 down to &euro;6.4 billion?  Does he expect it will be possible to do this?  Briefly, he should outline how he proposes to do this with the staff and the new structure that is being created.</p></speech>

The savings to the Exchequer of &euro;2 billion are made of two things.  It is taking the expenditure over time versus the income over time, allowing for the efficiencies that have been included - perhaps I will get Mr. John Dempsey to comment in this regard - as well as the fact that Irish Water must create the customer base to actually run this in terms of bringing in the income as well.  Consequently, there are two pieces to it, which Mr. Dempsey will explain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Dempsey" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400014#N00700"><p>In terms of the establishment budget, obviously we have talked about the amount but that represents the once-off upfront investment that is necessary to deliver on the Government objective of establishing the water utility and transforming the water industry over time, both in the short and medium term and out over the longer term.  Again, as previously mentioned, that is a once in a 20 or 30-year decision.  The benefits one derives from making that upfront investment are of two different types.  The first type would be quality improvements in respect of customer service quality and the quality of one's network, its integrity and efficiency.  Moving onto the second broad type of benefit one derives from the investment, one is talking about generating efficiency.  Consequently, Irish Water as a company is under an obligation and will be scrutinised on this obligation by the CER to deliver efficiencies for the benefit of the consumer.</p> <p>Looking at the eight year period to 2021, we project that we will achieve efficiencies on both operating expenditure and capital expenditure of the order of &euro;1.1 billion.  I should qualify that by saying we are subject to Commission for Energy Regulation review and when we go before the commission with our expenditure and revenue plans, it will scrutinise that.</p></speech>

The Minister is clear that he is saying &euro;2 billion.  How many jobs will be lost as a result?  What size of workforce is Mr. Tierney talking about?</p></speech>

I want to make that abundantly clear.  That is not in this at all.  There may well be situations in the future where, as there is at present in local authorities, there are voluntary redundancy schemes, but there is no such thing as compulsory redundancy involved in that.</p></speech>

In the past six years in local authorities alone, there has been something like a 25% reduction in staff numbers, and natural wastage and voluntary redundancy schemes give us good projections.  However, we are not getting into a number here today because, as the committee will be aware, there is due process with unions in all of those situations with which we would have to deal.</p></speech>

All of the roles on the management team were filled by open recruitment and it would have been expected that applicants would come from the water industry itself and experts would come from other relevant fields, whether we were hiring for an IT job, a financial job or whatever.</p><p>  In relation to the make-up of the management team, it comprises three from the private sector industry, one from Bord G&aacute;is, two from local government, and one who was previously a manager who had been working for two years for the local efficiency review group before he got the job.  All those posts were publicly advertised through open recruitment and the highest standard of management team has been put in place, and that is the way it should be.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1052" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400016#P00900"><p>I thank the delegates for responding speedily to the request to appear before the committee.  I want to elaborate on some of the questions already asked.  What has probably taken most of us by surprise is the extent of the need for external consultants.  It would be very useful for us to see the scoping document that would have been presented.  The delegates might let us know whether this is possible.  It would be very helpful.  I presume the document would have covered the capacity of Bord G&aacute;is.  There is a feeling that we are at variance in terms of the information that was provided.  For example, Bord G&aacute;is delegates were before the committee some time ago and when we got into some detail we were told:<blockquote><br /> The billing system we use in Bord G&aacute;is Energy is already being adapted for Irish Water and the design for the Irish Water billing system is in progress.  The billing system will be ready by 1 January 2014 and we have already seconded resources from our energy retail business into Irish Water, transferring those who are proficient in the establishment of billing and customer service.  Therefore, this expertise will not be lost with the privatisation. We have had to backfill some positions to replace those people, which means more employment within Bord G&aacute;is for people from other customer service and billing organisations.  This is already happening.  We put forward the view that we would leverage and clearly we have already started that process. I can therefore assure the committee that we will have the billing system up and running ...</blockquote>  The only thing I could conclude from what was put on the record by the delegation is that this was all being done in-house.  That must be considered in addition to the documents of early 2012, which I cannot put my hands on but which more or less gave the impression that there was surplus capacity within Bord G&aacute;is.  I want to be satisfied that there was not spare capacity in Bord G&aacute;is.  I do not feel satisfied that I have got that information.  I accept that there sometimes needs to be expertise.  The reason Bord G&aacute;is was partnered with Uisce &Eacute;ireann was because of the spare capacity.</p> <p>We have to be absolutely sure of that but I cannot see how we can be sure of it without seeing the scoping document and what was there before the process started.</p><p> My second question is linked to that matter.  Mr. Tierney said it was a tight timeline and I completely accept that he is right about that.  Does Mr. Tierney believe that this might have added to the need to hire in expert assistance?  He was working to particular timelines that were pretty much set by the Government.  Most of the consultancy seems to be around areas where we had an expectation that there would be spare capacity, such as billing systems and customers but not in the engineering area.  The bulk of the money has been spent on management, IT and financial systems.  It is beyond the &euro;50 million.  The four lots Mr. Tierney cited totalled &euro;68.8 million, while there is another &euro;13 million for 21 smaller groups.</p><p> I presume that the engineering capacity would come predominantly from the local authority sector.  In a rush to reduce local authority staffing levels, did we lose people who had the capacity to work directly on this, as opposed to potentially hiring consultants or even hiring them as consultants in future?  </p><p> I will pose those two questions to begin with and will come back with a few others later.</p></speech>

Is he certain that there was no capacity in Bord G&aacute;is to provide those services?</p></speech>

The output of the three parts of the programme included the people who were brought in from Bord G&aacute;is, local authorities and the Department, as well as all the external providers.  It needs to be understood that these people were not producing reports, they were building an organisation to become a utility to do the work on assets, operations, customers and so on.  The tight timeline has a great benefit in one respect because it was constructed on deliverables and that was hugely important.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Barry to comment on the bid document.  I will also ask Mr. O'Donoghue to comment on the customer question that was asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Barry" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400017#Q00400"><p>Before I come to the bid document, I want to remind the committee what has been achieved here.  Bord G&aacute;is got a letter asking us to carry out this task in April 2012.  In approximately 18 months we stood up a national utility and all that goes with that.  Therefore a lot of planning went into the first 12 weeks.  I brought this document with me and will happily put this on the record if the Chairman wants me to do so.  That is our scoping document, which is about 800 pages long.  It goes into enormous detail about what we have to do concerning systems, organisation and timelines.  A huge amount of planning went on.  That document was, in turn, shared with our service providers because we wanted them to understand what they were bidding on when they put in their tender prices.</p><p>  We developed that and put it into the bid documents, so that when the service providers engaged with them on a contractual basis they knew exactly what they had to deliver.  I can assure the committee that only for that rigour and discipline we would not have achieved what we did in the 18 months.  That is the answer to the first question.</p><p>  As regards the timeline and increased costs, I would argue the other way.  The fact that the timeline was defined, clear and concise has reduced the cost enormously.  It has forced us as an entity developing it - as well as forcing our service providers and other parties - to make decisions.</p> <p>Let us not forget that in the course of that timeline we have engaged with 34 local authorities, negotiated a service level agreement with them individually and produced annual service plans, which is an enormous task.  The money invested in our systems is open for scrutiny.  The bulk of our systems went live on 6 January.  We are now procuring for the Irish Water systems in eight local authorities goods and services that were procured last year on their own.  We are starting to open up the capital projects in our systems in all capital offices.  That, in turn, will lead to the ultimate savings described by Mr. Tierney.  The level of planning and detail that went into this was enormous.  As someone with experience, I would not have done this without that level of planning.  The money was invested correctly.</p></speech>

An existing utility such as Bord G&aacute;is might implement this range of systems over 15 or 20 years; therefore, the cost that would be incurred would be spread over that lengthy period.  Unfortunately, optically, all of these systems have come on board and come to fruition in 18 months; therefore, the spend is compressed.  While it is an unfortunate optic, the fact that it was compressed allowed us to go to the market to look for an efficient way of procuring the systems.</p></speech>

Our energy supply side already had Oracle customer care and billing, CCB, installed and implemented three years ago.  As a result, we had expertise within the energy supply business on the process design and project management sides.  They knew how to specify processes for billing for a utility and translate this into code in an Oracle CCB system.  What we did not have were the people to write the code, as well as those who could implement and integrate the systems.  The latter group is important as a modern utility needs systems to talk to each other, as much of the automation and many of the efficiencies are based on the degree to which one&rsquo;s systems interact with one another.  We took 15 staff from our energy supply side and put them into this programme in the early days.  They helped us to draw up the tender documents which allowed us to procure the experts who would take the brain-dump from these 15 people, translate it into code in the systems and get them to talk to each other.  That expertise is not what one would carry as part of one&rsquo;s standing staff complement.  One would not keep it enduringly in an organisation because one will only set up a system like this once every 15 or 20 years.  Those whom we hired to do this were typically doing similar projects in the United States.  They will probably go to similar implementation projects in the UK or elsewhere after this.  They are global nomads.  Organisations like Irish Water do not keep them on the books because one only needs them once in a while.</p></speech>

This goes back to the central point of what capacity was available.</p><p>  I accept that no one knows who will tender for a project.  Mr. Tierney spoke about how unfortunate it was that these matters were compressed into a short timeframe.</p> <p>Does Mr. Tierney have a view about the fact there are certain optics and trust issues relating to particular companies such as Ernst &amp;amp; Young and KMPG who had a role in auditing banks?  Does he think this type of trust issue is desirable in terms of the formation of a new company?  I have a few more questions.  </p></speech>

By virtue of public procurement rules, if people pass a minimum standard to allow them to tender, we include them in the tender list.  Notwithstanding Deputy Murphy's point about public perception and what has gone on in the past, we cannot legally preclude them if they pass that minimum standard.  It would be against and outside procurement rules.  I acknowledge fully the point made by the Deputy but notwithstanding that, we must include them once they pass the minimum to pre-qualify and bid.  It is an open competition after that.</p></speech>

In respect of the &euro;2 billion, it is the language of government.  I am always keen to look at the exact words you are using.  There is a &euro;2 billion saving to the Exchequer.  That saving also factors in income from a source.  For example, it is turning citizens into customers for the want of a description.  Could the witnesses tell us the amount Irish Water is factoring into domestic income?</p></speech>

The position with the CER is that we have two submissions to make - one at the end of January and the other at the end of February.  There is then a process between March and August, which is the latest date at which a charge must be announced for us to be able to implement for the last quarter for next year to do the first billing in January.  This is part of due process and what the charge is will become apparent in due course.  We will then remodel based on that charge but we are satisfied that we are using a conservative figure in &euro;2 billion in total.</p></speech>

I must remind the committee that one of the critically important points in respect of setting up Irish Water is to create the ability to deal with 1.8 million customers as part of a new charges system and using that money to be able to create the ability to invest more funds to be able to do the work that is critically needed to deal with the problems in the sector.</p></speech>

We have tried to maximise the amount of information in terms of the additional list but I said that if there were one or two other things that still needed to dealt with, all of that would be put out in respect of the breakdown of who got what within the programme.  We refer to these generally as service providers.</p> <p>I return to my earlier point on the work they are doing.  The work we are describing here is about producing the product and all the disciplines that have been involved in the support of that.  We have already given out the information.  If there are another three or four pieces of information to be given out we will do that.  One of the major difficulties we had in the last couple of days was getting around to everybody to ensure we had the appropriate permissions to release, and we have done that to the maximum extent possible.</p></speech>

For good governance, our board was constantly looking for that to ensure Bord G&aacute;is was kept cost-neutral on it.  We were not spending money without notifying the Department and it was covering us in letters of underwriting.</p></speech>

We need freedom of information because there is a lack of transparency in how we do things.  Whether one can have full transparency here is another matter.  It is clear that we did not know, but the Department knew, there were very sizeable amounts and I will not ask the witnesses to comment on that because, as they said, it is the political side of things.</p><p>  The architecture of the proposed Irish Water is cryptic.  It has service level agreements with the local authorities, which will continue to be the direct employers of the staff who will predominantly carry out the work.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, will oversee the cost.  Irish Water will run it.  Pardon me for being sceptical but we have not been good at building good institutions and we have not had a great heritage in that regard.  It looks a little like the HSE from where I am standing and alarm bells are ringing.  It remains to be seen what the nature of it will be.</p><p>  How many people is it expected Irish Water will directly employ?  Will the local authorities continue to levy development contributions and will they be directly payable to Irish Water?  How will that kind of thing work in terms of an income?  Part of the reason local authorities would have employed consultants, and it is part of the same reason the witnesses are talking about in terms of designing facilities, is because they would not have had the in-house expertise.  Will there be the in-house expertise in Irish Water or will it continue to put out work to consultants when it designs or upgrades water or wastewater facilities?</p></speech>

We are a slightly hybrid model in terms of operation as well through the service level agreements.  However, the Deputy endeavoured to potentially compare us to another agency.  Given the manner in which we prepared for that, we would strongly argue that by putting in the systems we are putting in at the moment, it will give the organisation the foundation to be a high performance utility model.  The critical point in spending this money up front is to save the Exchequer substantial moneys over the medium to long term as we have explained.</p><p> I refer to the culture within the organisation and performance in terms of the programme and the hours people are putting in working on the programme to stand up the business by 1 January, which was a hugely demanding deadline.  The Deputy asked about the number of staff.  We have 299 staff recruited and we expect to have between 500 and 510 by April or May of this year but the overall figure will not be finally decided until we are aware of the funds we will have available from 2015 as we move towards the regulated model because we have two different funding sources and that is still critically relevant to us.</p><p> The development contributions under the legislation will pass from the local authorities to Irish Water as part of the connection charging system.  We are adopting the model in the first year within the local authorities from the point of view of the charging regime.  It will then move into the fully regulated model and be an output from that.</p><p> With regard to the in-house expertise, we have tried to design the operation of the company to require little consultancy but there will still be an ongoing need to use companies under the capital programme regarding the design of schemes and so on because one can get that on a once-off basis depending on the scale of the scheme.  One could not necessarily hire permanent staff to do the design of the schemes that might only be once off for ten or 20 years, for example, in terms of scale.  Different factors come into play as part of a capital programme for which one would have to use expertise outside the organisation.  That is part of the capital spending but, on the operational side, there would be little consultancy.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we have been very up-front from the start of this pointing out that we would have to bring in external service providers.

To explain in terms of the original budget, what we have done here for the committee is that we have taken that budget and we have outlined in lot terms what each person got, because that was one of the questions being asked of us.

I feel confident it will be successful, particularly as it is headed by a Tipperary man.  It cannot but go right.</p><p>  In view of what Mr. Tierney has heard already today from my colleagues to my right there seems to be a serious problem with communication, whether with Irish Water, the Department or the Minister.  Will Mr. Tierney bring forward plans to improve communication?  Will he consider establishing a parliamentary division in Irish Water whereby elected public representatives could make direct contact and seek advice or answers and responses to their various queries?  If it is to be a success we must not forget the public element as it advances.  Many difficulties will arise with the general public and, as always, public representatives will be the first port of call.  Is Mr. Tierney in the position this afternoon to give an undertaking that he will address this serious matter with a view to improving it?</p></speech>

Irish Water took over responsibility generally on 1 January.  The Deputy will have noted that with regard to issues such as metering, Irish Water took on responsibility for communications in July.  Committee members from counties where it has commenced will know strong communication has taken place in this regard.  Equally, there will be a communications strategy with regard to the company itself, and we have already put in place separate measures for local representatives which have been circulated to all local authorities.  We will try to brief Deputies as much as possible and will advise them of our proposals in this regard as we go along.  The service level agreement means we need a specific measure in place for local authorities and we will also need to communicate with Members of the House.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Tierney might elaborate briefly now and in detail later on what exactly was provided by these consultants.  For example, were advice, direction, systems, equipment and so on provided?  Mr. Tierney referred to a figure of &euro;44.8 million in respect of IBM, &euro;17.2 million in respect of Accenture, &euro;4.6 million in respect of Ernst &amp;amp; Young and &euro;2.2 million in respect of KPMG.  Perhaps he might elaborate on what exactly was provided by these companies.  The ordinary individual would like to know, without his going into detail, whether these companies provided advice or other services.  The sum of &euro;44.8 million is a lot of money and people would like to know if for this amount systems were put in place and equipment and so on was supplied.</p><p>  I am always sceptical of consultants.  Coming from a local authority background, as did Mr. Tierney, I know that to even hang a gate a consultant's report was necessary, which report often cost twice the amount to do the job.  It has been said that it is because Mr. Tierney comes from that background that consultants have been engaged extensively.  I am sure the reason is to ensure the putting in place of a modern utility that will deliver a world class water system that will provide the best possible value for the consumer.  Perhaps Mr. Tierney might confirm that that is the case.  While, as I stated, I am sceptical of consultants, perhaps if they had been engaged for the PCAR and e-voting systems, millions of euro would have been saved.</p></speech>

They are not, in the information I have before me, broken down in the manner stated by him.  The sum of &euro;50 million referred to is the spend to date, whereas the figure we have provided is the forecasted spend in the document.</p><p>  I will ask one of my colleagues to elaborate further on the systems issue.  However, the Deputy will note that the systems are outlined on pages 15 to 19, inclusive, including in relation to asset management.  One of the big issues for the system is the critical lack of data on the condition of the assets.  This information is hugely important in ensuring efficiencies and a better capital spend in upgrading or improving these assets.  That is a huge part of the work involved.  Another important part of the work is in relation to customer and operations billing; again, it is an enormous system.  I mentioned some of the international systems in relation to customer billing.  Mr. O'Donoghue has already spoken about this issue and can elaborate further, if members wish.  As in the case of other organisations, there are many other support systems required, including HR, financial, health and safety, environment, incident management, capital delivery, environment regulation and so on.  Reference was made to a system set up a number of years ago, but it was never implemented.  The systems about which we are speaking have been largely implemented, with some, for parts of the process which will come into force on 1 January next year, remaining to be completed, including in relation to customer billing.  These are one-off costs.  My employment has nothing whatsoever to do with these consultants.  They were already in the process of being recruited when I joined.</p> <p>They were needed to do this and whether I ever joined was irrelevant.  These were needed and it was pointed out that they were needed.  They were procured properly and that is the reason we have the foundation for the utility we currently have.  One of the reasons I joined was that I knew that Bord G&aacute;is would have approached this in a very professional manner.  That was critical.  The essential factor for any utility starting off is to be well prepared.  If a body is not well prepared, it will run into endless trouble, and that is a critical point.</p></speech>

The witness has indicated the setting-up cost will not be &euro;180 million but I wish to speak about consultants.  Does this include the proposal to extract water from Lough Derg and transport it to Dublin?  Has money been spent on consultants for that project or is that outside the setting up of Irish Water?</p></speech>

That will be delivered through a capital project team and we would have taken on the capital project people dealing with this in the Dublin city organisation, on behalf of the region.  That comes in under the remit, and with the projects like that mentioned by the Deputy, there will be a major projects piece to deal with the three or four really big projects which are currently part of the overall programme.  The Deputy mentioned one and there is another in Cork, a major drainage scheme in Dublin and the Ringsend scheme extension.  These are projects of that nature and they are significant.</p></speech>

We want to achieve two critical matters.  Currently, there is only approximately &euro;310 million per annum available in that regard.  It was difficult for local authorities because even at the height of output in the sector, the proper funding of the capital piece only existed for probably five of their 130 year existence.  As a utility we can marshal ourselves in terms of economies of scale, the market and in establishing a consistent customer base in income and we are trying to get additional funds.  Our target is to get approximately &euro;600 million of investment.  We are trying to deliver that investment with no more cost than approximately &euro;450 million per annum.  That is the type of efficiency we are trying to bring.</p></speech>

I will not repeat questions but I want some clarification so as to hone in on the costs.  It seems, having looked at the document, that &euro;97.9 million was spent by December.  The guts of &euro;100 million has been spent so far.  Mr. Tierney has also confirmed that there is a likelihood that there will be some contingencies, so the &euro;30 million contingency fund might be delved into to an extent.  I will not proceed with that question as Mr. Tierney has dealt with it.</p><p>  With regard to the &euro;97.9 million, the statement indicates that approximately &euro;50 million was used on specialists.</p> <p>Is that correct?</p></speech>

However, for the committee today we have extrapolated that up to the end of the project, so there is no doubt as to what the overall cost of the project is and what the overall spend will be on the service providers themselves.</p></speech>

I will go through the different lots.  There are eight lots.  Can Mr. Tierney give me an approximate breakdown between the service provider, consultants and capital cost regarding IBM and particularly Accenture?  Of the &euro;44.8 million that has been awarded to IBM over lots 1, 2 and 3, what is the breakdown between capital costs and consultant fees?</p></speech>

I am seeking the breakdown for lots 1, 2 and 3 between capital costs and consultant fees for the &euro;44.8 million, and the same with regard to Accenture and the &euro;17.2 million.  That is the first question.</p><p>  Second, what overlap is there between Ernst &amp;amp; Young, the lot in respect of governance, finance and regulation, and lot 9 in respect of KPMG, which appears to be very similar although there is an obtuse use of language?  There is an allocation of &euro;2.2 million for KPMG to provide quality assurance services for the board and senior executives in lot 9.</p><p>  Third, I thank the witness for giving us the additional breakdown of the &euro;13.3 million.  There appears to be approximately &euro;4.2 million of legal costs.  Are there any other legal costs inherent in lots 1 to 9 on top of that figure?</p><p>  Fourth, what has happened to lot 7?  Lot 7 is not mentioned here.  Is there a reason for that?  It could be that it is just a small amount, but perhaps the witness would clarify that.</p><p>  Finally, have any of the service providers refused to give permission to release information on fees and costs, as opposed to not giving Irish Water an answer?</p></speech>

How much was saved by establishing Irish Water under the auspices of Bord G&aacute;is?  Do the witnesses have a figure for those savings?  Second, the witnesses might feel they are answering the same question a second time, but perhaps they would clarify a matter.  If the systems were based on those of Bord G&aacute;is, was it not possible to ask Bord G&aacute;is's system provider to provide the services to the scale required by Irish Water, rather than hiring consultants or third party providers and re-inventing the wheel?</p><p>  In the same vein, value for money is the big concern of Members of the Oireachtas and the public with regard to the figures quoted in the media.  The witness said he got advice from Scottish Water and Welsh Water.  With regard to comparative pricing for their establishment costs, can the witness give figures for establishing the Scottish Water and Welsh Water companies?  That would be very telling with regard to the value for money for these consultancy fees.  Also, page 8 of Mr. Tierney's document refers to &euro;32 million for IT infrastructure.  Was all of that put out to tender?  It would be very helpful to get a breakdown of that.  Were all the legal contracts also put out to tender and how many expressions of interest and quotes were received?  Perhaps we could be given a breakdown of the tendering process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1162" speakername="Denis Landy" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400028#BB00100"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  I am cognisant of the fact that Mr. Tierney was appointed on 29 January 2013 so my first question applies to representatives from Bord G&aacute;is.  I understand that Bord G&aacute;is won the tender to take over Irish Water over Bord na M&oacute;na.  In that process, Bord G&aacute;is put forward the argument that it had 55 experts in its employ who could provide expertise in setting up Irish Water.  As reported in the document before us, those staff were not made available to Irish Water when it was set up so it required consultants.</p><p>  I refer to pages 5 and 6 of the document.  Can Mr. Tierney answer clearly whether this fact was made known to the Department before it made a decision on the awarding of the contract for the takeover of Irish Water by Bord G&aacute;is?  The Government and NewERA contracted this project to Bord G&aacute;is and it appears they were sold a pup.  They were given to understand staff were available but then the staff were told they would be needed to continue to run Bord G&aacute;is.  It reminds me of the story of the man in the nightclub late at night trying to attract a lady and telling her he will bring her home in his Porsche.  Then, she discovers there is no Porsche and that she has to pay for the taxi to bring them home.  That is how it looks to me.  Bord G&aacute;is got this contract on the basis of in-house expertise and now we are paying &euro;86 million of the &euro;150 million start-up costs, some 57% of the budget, because the expertise is not now available to Irish Water.</p><p>  I am aware of the challenges facing Irish Water.  We have 1,000 water schemes across the country at risk of bacterial and viral contamination.  Water in Roscommon is subject to boil notices on a continual basis and some 41% of water is lost through leaks.  There are flood warnings across the Shannon and water shortages in Dublin and Leinster.  People are prepared to pay for services but not for poor water or no water.  Approximately &euro;1 million was spent on engineering companies known to me, such as Nicholas O'Dwyer and JR Barry.  How much work has gone into dealing with the issue of the shortage of water in Dublin and in Leinster, as referred to by Deputy Coonan, and the problem along the Shannon?  Over Christmas we saw people on television who were afraid that their front gardens would be washed away by flooding.  How much work has gone in during the preparatory phases to set up the reservoir at Garryhinch, County Laois, to deal with the problem of the flooding in the Shannon and the lack of water in Dublin and Leinster?</p><p>  With regard to the &euro;11 billion worth of assets Irish Water owns, as per the document, it states that there is no satisfactory record of the assets and a limited record of their condition.  We have established a figure of &euro;11 billion of assets available to Irish Water to start working on.  Can Mr. Tierney clarify how the figure was arrived at?  Does the figure stand up?  It is important that we know what we are starting off with.  The figure is used in comparison to the &euro;86 million in consultancy fees.  It may pale into insignificance in respect of &euro;11 billion of assets.  Clearly there is no identification of how the &euro;11 billion figure was arrived at.  Can Mr. Tierney provide clarity?</p></speech>

It is very hands on.  We are going to get a solid customer system, a solid working asset management system, a solid support services system, physical systems and tangible outputs for all that.  Some 95% of it is that and the other 5% is IBM supporting us in change management in the field with local authorities.</p><p>  The other bit is Accenture, at &euro;17 million, approximately half of which is probably in our design in terms of standing up the organisation and finding the right organisational structure for a high performing water utility model.  The rest of it is change management within Irish Water and all the training that is necessary to stand up Irish Water and all the new roles in the utility - leaving people to identify their roles, getting them trained into those roles and getting all that knowledge in place.</p><p>  One must remember that we are working with 34 local authorities and we have run a lot of training courses with the local authorities in systems and in terms of protocols to identify how we are going to work.  There is significant change management in place between us.</p></speech>

Lot 6 is mainly programme management of the large company establishment project in the set-up.  Lot 6 was about project managing all those different projects necessary for the company establishment of Irish Water, so it was Bord G&aacute;is people and Irish Water staff and the programme managers working together to drive all the deliverables necessary to stand up Irish Water.  That was a significant job in its own right.</p><p>  All the legal costs were tendered and they are all off a legal panel.

Conservatively, when we looked at the figures, the estimate was that we would save an additional 15% on top of the number which was put out, amounting to &euro;29 million.  I believe that estimate is very conservative and does not cost in the risk for doing this by some other method.  Additionally, there is the sum of &euro;58 million for software licences, which we saved by going through the VEET notice and by placing our licences in a central location rather than in the 34 local authorities.  At a minimum, we are looking at &euro;28 million plus &euro;58 million, with the latter amount spread over a five year period.  What is not costed in is the cost of standing up the utility by some other method.  It was mentioned earlier that the fact that the time-scales were well defined de-risked the project to an enormous extent.</p><p>  The Senator asked about the set-up costs for Scottish Water.  That was set up over a period of four years, from 2002 to 2006, and involved the amalgamation of three regional authorities into Scottish Water at a cost of &pound;200 million.  That is a very good comparator for what we are trying to do in 18 months, in terms of costs and the fact that we are going from 34 authorities to one.</p></speech>

I wish to give an analogy for the systems.  If one imagines a major local authority area and one drives into it and finds it has no buildings and is only a car park.  Setting up Irish Water is tantamount to that.  We need premises, systems and processes for all of the things that we rely on every day in order to do our job, such as payroll, work management, customer services and so forth, as we have described here today.  Then we need people, who must be trained in the particular processes we intend to implement, given that this is the first time we have had a water utility in Ireland.  The enormity of that work has not been grasped fully.  It is a huge piece of work to bring that about.  It is an initial establishment cost that is necessary.</p><p>  Members asked for comparisons with Wales and Scotland but it is very difficult to do that now because when those countries did it, they used slightly different models.  The Welsh model has changed back from being a privatised model.  What we tried to do in our report for the committee was to use benchmarkings in terms of some of the items we are talking about here and what they cost in other utilities.  In terms of value for money, the regulatory environment is all about the protection of the customer and ensuring value for money in terms of what we do.</p></speech>

We will have to make submissions on expenditure levels to the regulator.  As mentioned earlier, in any utility, such submissions receive a very high level of scrutiny.  We have to justify our costs both before and after the event.   When we go through a particular price control period, we then have to look back and explain and account for how we spent the money.</p></speech>

Are they categorically saying that the expertise was not within Bord G&aacute;is for particular services in the set up or establishment of Irish Water?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Donoghue" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400030#DD01200"><p>Correct.  As I said, we were able to bring something to the party but not everything that was required.  I will use a simple analogy to make my point.</p> <p>We are all familiar with getting new televisions or phones which are pretty much plug and play devices.  We switch them on and the machine tells us how to set them up, tune in stations and so on.   These boxes of tricks are not simple or straightforward.  They come out of the factory as a standard model and must then be shaped to suit one's utility and processes.  We must switch on certain functions and move certain fields around.  Then, depending on how much it needs to be changed, it may go beyond configuration which is what I am describing to customisation, particularly if one's processes are very different.  Sometimes one is not in control of the process or the regulator might say he wants something to be done in a certain way or the Government might introduce a policy that requires a process to be gone through in a certain way.  This might mean that there is a need to recode the machine, but this - recoding - is not the kind of expertise a utility keeps.  Experts are required to come and recode the machines.</p></speech>

They would not carry that expertise as part of their standing complement of staff.</p><p>  We have selected a particular suite of IT systems, many of which have been mentioned, such as work and asset management, customer care and billing, Core for HR and Oracle financials.  All of these systems must talk to each other.  Every utility will have a different mix of systems and how we get them to talk to each other is unique.  We need a systems integrator to get them to talk to each other to ensure the data from one system get on the bus and go to the other system when required in order that the records are kept right.  This expertise is something one brings to the party at the time the system is implemented, but it is not kept among permanent staff.</p></speech>

On the &euro;11 billion worth of assets, that is the valuation coming from the local authorities to us.  Obviously, we will have to consider that valuation.  As I said, the description of asset is somewhat different in this context because the scale of liability attaching to these assets in terms of what needs to be done with them is substantial.  I mentioned the water services investment programme.  During that period alone local authorities were seeking to spend approximately &euro;6.2 billion, if all the projects were to be undertaken.</p></speech>

We do not net-off on the issue of expenditure.  There is an ongoing need for expenditure over a period of time, but there is already a huge stack-up in the system of money that needs to be spent on environmental compliance, capacity, drinking water quality and all of the different issues that need to be tackled.</p><p>  The Senator's second last point concerned establishment costs.  None of this money is taken from existing operational funding or the existing capital investment programme.  None of it comes out of these two allocations of funds.  These funds are separate and have not been reduced by virtue of the establishment taking place.</p><p>  In regard to payment for water where there are difficulties with water quality, I have mentioned that we estimate there are approximately 20,000 people on boil water notices.  We want to ensure this issue is dealt with as quickly as possible, but this will take time because schemes must be put in place to rectify the issues involved.  However, we have prioritised the issue and put arrangements in place to try to deal with it as a key issue.</p></speech>

We are dependent on capital investment from the Government this year, and then a decision has to be taken on next year.  However, subject to these decisions, we will come back with a timeline to deal with those as key priorities within our existing funds.</p></speech>

The Dublin City Council staff who were working full time on that project are now working directly with Irish Water.  Even though it is very early stages of our involvement, we have looked at it closely and a consulting engineer has been appointed to bring that project up to the planning stage.  We have a very good track record in building pipelines and large infrastructure and we estimate that the very best that can be done will take around seven years.  We hope to go to planning in about three years, then we can allow for a 12 month or 18 month planning process and the rest is construction.</p></speech>

That is the level of environmental assessment that must be done before we can go through a project of this magnitude.  That is absolutely necessary.

The staff were picked out of Bord G&aacute;is, which is not a resource-heavy organisation.  In some instances, those staff had to be back-filled in key roles, so we pulled them out of BGE and put them directly on the programme.  I know them because I picked them out myself.  They are the subject matter experts and most of them are still working on the programme right now.  We did not make the 55 core staff and probably more available, even on a part-time basis.</p></speech>

I think I answered that earlier in a previous question.

This has been a very welcome public debate on the transparency and clarity that is required for these issues.  We are establishing a new national utility, which I would equate to the establishment of the ESB or even Bord G&aacute;is.  I think we all need to keep that in mind.</p> <p>It is important that we acknowledge the practical expertise of Mr. O'Donoghue and Mr. Barry which is very evident to me and how they have initiated this process in their engagement through Bord G&aacute;is.  They have explained in clear terms much that I did not know before.  That is very helpful from a public information point of view.</p><p> Some of my questions may have been broached already.  The specific asset management system in which these specialists have invested was not in place before and was required for the management of Irish Water.  The new customer billing and support systems were not in place before and were required for the efficient management of Irish Water and what the delegates describe as an asset worth &euro;11 billion.  We spend over &euro;1.2 billion a year on that asset which is not efficient because approximately 40% of the water leaks from it.  Am I right in saying we have inherited an <i>ad hoc</i>asset system that has not been properly recorded, that has been managed and maintained at different levels by different local authorities, depending on the funding made available in them?  Will the delegates clarify this for the public record?  Can these specialised systems being installed be utilised?  Mr. Tierney mentioned a life cycle of 20 years.  I presume that we will not have to reinvest in these systems in the short to medium term.  Will he clarify this, too, for the public record?  As was said, some systems introduced by the public service such as PPARS which cost &euro;110 million and e-voting machines which cost &euro;50 million never saw the light of day.  Will Mr. Tierney clarify whether these systems will be used and that they have a life cycle that has been determined?</p><p> I welcome the manner in which the delegates have come and put all of the information on the table and their commitment to continue to do so.  That is essential for public confidence.  I want to hear again the reassurance that all national procurement protocols have been adhered to.  Benchmarking was mentioned.  I would have expected people with the expertise of Bord G&aacute;is and others now involved in Irish Water to have analysed and compared similar systems and best practice.  I expect that they have a cost-effective model and a system to deliver real savings to the taxpayer through the efficient management of the water supply which we have not had heretofore.</p><p> From where has the funding come for this budget?  Is it coming directly from the Department, the taxpayer, or is it being raised by way of a loan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.321" nospeaker="true" time="17:35:00" ><p>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy took the Chair.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.322" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1115" speakername="Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute;" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400033#GG00300"><p>The answers we have received today will allay some of the fears in the public domain.  In the light of these answers it seems that the Minister was privy to all of this information when he refused to give it in response to parliamentary questions.  Following that refusal, a vacuum was allowed to develop, in which a controversy arose, which has to be a distraction for Uisce &Eacute;ireann.  In the testimony we have heard today the delegates have mentioned that Uisce &Eacute;ireann will always abide by the decisions of the Government.  Will Mr. Tierney confirm that he has no objection to the Minister deciding in the future to put information he has received from Uisce &Eacute;ireann on the public record?  It is important to have that point clarified.  </p><p>  There is a lot of unrest in local authority areas regarding possible redundancies.  Mr. Tierney has outlined that there will be no compulsory redundancies.  Was this matter discussed during the engagement with 34 local authorities because I take it that redundancies could be a matter for local authorities rather than Uisce &Eacute;ireann?  It would be helpful to have that matter clarified.  </p><p>  While the assets being transferred, whether they are worth &euro;11 billion as put forward by the local authorities or whatever figure is brought forward subsequently, I understand pension liabilities will not pass from the local authorities to Uisce &Eacute;ireann.</p> <p>Can Mr. Tierney elaborate on that point as I presume this has formed part of the discussion with the Department and with the local authorities?  In the discussions which have taken place in the Oireachtas on that matter it would seem as if the assets were being taken from the local authorities - &euro;11 billion would be very substantial - but liabilities relating to pensions would remain with the local authorities.  Can Mr. Tierney expand on that point also?</p><p> As regards the projected &euro;2 billion savings to the Exchequer, what is meant by savings?  Are these to mean savings on investment in water services by the Department and investment by local authorities?  Is it a profit situation of &euro;2 billion coming forward from Uisce &Eacute;ireann in the year to which Mr. Tierney referred?  If that is the case, obviously this must be based on projected usage of water.  To date, we do not have any report from the regulator as to the costs.  If that is the case, how are we to estimate what the income is likely to be?  If it is based on income, that income will be taxpayers' money.  There is quite an amount of concern because we understood that the new arrangement was not just about the generation of income, it was also about saving water which in turn will result in less income.  I ask Mr. Tierney to expand on where that &euro;2 billion is coming from and what is the precise meaning of "savings".  If we had that on the record it might be helpful.  </p><p> Today's exercise has been good and helpful, and we would have had a meeting on the broader issues in February, but to what extent would today's exercise have been necessary if all the information had been placed on the floor of the Oireachtas when it was requested originally?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.324" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400034#HH00300"><p>I will seamlessly move on from Senator &Oacute; Murch&uacute;'s point and he nailed it in pointing out that a very full and frank communication of all these issues previously would have obviated the need for a hearing such as this.  I hope Mr. Tierney and his colleagues would admit that public confidence in Irish Water is crucial to its legitimacy, particularly when we are attempting to seek resources from the public to operate a public utility.  It is very welcome that a public utility, owned by the Irish people and answerable to the Oireachtas, is now in operation, but Irish Water has not got off to a good start in the minds of members of the public because of the farrago over the last few days.</p><p>  As a TD, a member of this committee and of the Committee of Public Accounts, and as a citizen, I find it offensive that the type of information we are discussing here this afternoon had to be extracted from Mr. Tierney in an interview with RTE's Sean O'Rourke last week.  I find that appalling.  In that regard, it is quite clear to this committee and to the wider general public that the <i>modus operandi</i> of Irish Water needs to change if it is to gain public confidence and acquire the legitimacy that it needs.  I am confident that can happen but it can only happen if Irish Water learns lessons.  My fundamental question to Mr. Tierney is what lessons has he learned over the last week and what lessons has Irish Water learned over the last week in terms of generating public confidence and in terms of its obligation to the Irish people as a public utility wholly owned by the Irish people?</p><p>  I have a few more questions.  There has been much debate in recent days about the fact that, as we speak, Irish Water is exempt from the scope of the Freedom of Information Act.  We are all of the view that this needs to change.  That Act was essentially reviewed in recent months and legislation in this respect is currently going through the Oireachtas.  Can Mr. Tierney confirm whether Irish Water had any function whatsoever in terms of communicating with the Department?  I would like to hear his view on whether the organisation should be exempt or otherwise from the scope of the freedom of information legislation.  </p><p>  I ask Mr. Tierney to put on record his salary.  As I understand from public commentary, it is &euro;50,000 below the pay ceiling for those in commercial State-companies.  Can Mr. Tierney put on record also whether he, any of his colleagues or any full-time staff member, wholetime equivalent, in Uisce &Eacute;ireann has received any bonus payments last year or whether any bonus payments would be expected as part of their contract for next year or any subsequent years?  </p><p>   We are dealing with fixed price contracts awarded to service providers which is a positive development.  Related to that, I ask the witnesses whether those contracts provide for any sanctions or penalties where there are cost overruns or where elements of contracts fail to be delivered on time or within budget?</p></speech>

On the specific asset management system, the customer care and billing system and the other systems the Deputy mentioned, all of those were required.  I will ask Mr. John Barry to go through that.  We have verified in the report that the systems are already up and running.  The metering programme was the first system launch in terms of Irish Water but in terms of the business we had a major take on in that respect on 1 January.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.327" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Barry" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400034#HH00600"><p>The point the Deputy made is very relevant.  We have inherited a relatively <i>ad hoc</i> system of asset management through no fault of the people involved but that is the way the structure of the industry was.  We have now centralised that in one central system.  Asset management systems are data hungry.  They require an awful lot of data.  As that data are gathered and fed in, that allows the asset managers to make informed decisions about where to direct the capital investment and where to direct their maintenance programmes.  As Mr. John Tierney said, we launched the asset management system in mid-2013 to facilitate the metering programme and on 1 January we went live with the upgraded version of that, which was always part of the scope.  We now have a functioning asset management system.  I can give the Deputy a tangible example of that.  When the operatives are installing meters the work orders to the individual houses where the meters are to be located are despatched remotely.  They have a mobile device in their van and are notified the jobs through their mobile device; they dig the hole, put in the meter and record what they find such as for example, lead pipes or leaks, and upload that data and that goes back into our central system.  Equally, the completion of those jobs are recorded and they go through to our customer service centre.  If a customer wants to know when a hole will be filled or whatever, the people in the contact centre have instant information on it.  That is a tangible example of what these systems will involve.</p><p>  Deputy Coffey queried the issue of reinvestment.  Obviously we have made a very significant investment in the past 12 months and there will be continuous upgrades as the technology improves as we move forward but for us to invest we will require regulatory approval.  We would have to go to the regulator if we want to invest more in these systems in years to come and seek approval for him to sanction that spend, be it upgrades or complete reinvestments in new systems.  The Deputy can be assured that any money that is spent post this investment will be subject to absolute regulatory approval.  From my experience in the gas business, there were many instances when we refused approval for the spending of money.  We would have to make a strong business case for the spending of such money and there would always be a business case to support such investment.</p></speech>

Deputy Coffey asked for a declaration that we followed national procurement rules.  We did so in all cases.  We benchmarked it and we have provided some quotes.  Thames Water is currently investing some &euro;100 million in the asset management system we put in place in the past 18 months to get to where we are in water and gas.

With regard to unrest in local authorities, I have confirmed that the model does not allow for compulsory redundancies.  There is protection from the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, in respect of negotiations held earlier in the year.  This is reaffirmed in the service level agreement.</p><p>  Pension liabilities are dealt with in legislation.  The preserved piece is not the responsibility of local authorities.  Under the legislation, it is the responsibility of the State.  The new piece is the responsibility of Irish Water.</p><p>  In respect of savings and investments, the figure of &euro;2 billion is not a profit situation but the saving to the Exchequer.  If the current model stayed in place, the Exchequer would have to find at least &euro;2 billion by 2021 just to maintain what is happening in the current system.</p></speech>

There is a function of State subvention and the tariff and it will move up, more than likely, depending on the tariff.  There is a process relating to the tariff and it involves us doing two submissions, one at the end of January and one at the end of February.  There is a process, including public consultation, over time until August by which time the water charges plan will have gone on public display.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Nash's questions, at every time in my career where there were events happening and issues being dealt with, I always review them and take on board the issues that arose to ensure the very best is done in the future to deal with the issues.</p><p>  I have already confirmed that if freedom of information provisions are commenced as part of the legislation, Irish Water will absolutely abide by them.

In a new social and political chapter in the history of the State, if we are going to charge people for domestic water, it is important we are assured that we have an effective operational system and a system of capital investment, that people are getting value for money and that we are not, in Irish Water, creating a monster that we will all have to account for in years to come.  That is from where public concern comes.  The idea of getting information is that we can ensure there is fairness and value for money.</p><p>  The case for domestic charging is that it is common throughout the rest of Europe.  To date, businesses have carried a disproportionate burden in respect of water and sewerage charges.  The system we have does not tend to push the individual towards water conservation and it is more a matter for the individual's conscience and disposition.  The witnesses have presented a serious company and a serious job of work that must be done to set up a company to service 1.4 million customers.  The end result, or the aspiration, is an effective, somewhat commercial, efficient way of delivering the water and sewerage services to people.</p> <p>It should also be a more dynamic and proactive way of getting the infrastructure in place that is badly needed.  That would be very impressive, but it flags one concern.  I know consultants are used to establish the cornerstones in order that we can build on them and get it right.  However, my serious concern, based on experience, is that using the traditional polluter pays methods, a storage system or water services facility in a big urban centre could be affordable because the polluter contribution could result in more investment in the infrastructure, but in rural areas, like the one where I am from, there was not such investment because people could not come up with their segment of the money.  Therefore, many rural areas did not see investment in water or sewerage infrastructure.</p><p> There have been comments that the company will be lean, mean and trim and that it will come with efficiencies, savings and plans for economic and regional development.  As I have said, rural areas have not seen this investment, with one of the problem being economies of scale, as some areas do not have the big businesses that can supplement investment in the delivery of infrastructure, whether through development charges or other means.  With regard to the delivery of the infrastructure, coupled with whatever the State puts into it, what safeguards has Irish Water put in place to ensure there will be equitable investment of capital in rural areas?  How will it avoid the overriding consideration of achieving a return on investment, with the company looking at profit as the bottom line only?  Where there are no economies of scale, how will projects be funded?  We are talking about more a expensive delivery to smaller populations; therefore, how do we know they will not be put at the bottom of the pile or deprioritised?</p><p> What is the company's public service obligation in this regard?  The likes of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann have such an obligation, but what is Irish Water's obligation?  This is more than just a commercial company and there is another aspect to the issue.  I respect what the delegates are trying to do, but my concern is not really up for debate.  It will be a real concern for the people I represent who live in environmentally sensitive areas.  We saw what happened in Galway when cryptosporidium was found and there is also the septic tanks issue.  Some people in rural Ireland do not have a proper water supply system; therefore, how will the company address such issues within its remit?  The matter has not yet been addressed, but I would like some response on the matter at this point.</p></speech>

In December 2011 the Minister, in addressing a water summit in Dublin, revealed that PricewaterhouseCoopers had carried out the first phase of its independent assessment of the concept of the Irish Water project as part of the programme for Government.  I see no costs outlined in the document before us for its consultancy fees and no reference to who took care of them.  Was a full analysis, including of costs, carried out by the Cabinet at the time?  At the summit the Minister categorically stated he would be using the expertise of local authorities.  There is a great deal of such expertise in local authorities up and down the country, as I know as I was a member of local authorities for a number of years and involved in the setting up of group water schemes.  There were personnel with experience in the authorities that would be the equivalent of that of consultants.</p><p>  The public is angry as it believes the &euro;50 million spent on consultancy fees is excessive, considering that 34 local authorities around the country last year collected approximately &euro;200 million in non-domestic charges.  One quarter of what was collected last year has been spent on consultancy fees, which is excessive.  We are overlooking the fact that the Department and, by extension, the Government and the State is spending in the region of &euro;300 million to upgrade the water system and should not be giving the impression to the public that the infrastructure is also being dealt with, as it is not; the &euro;50 million was solely spent on consultancy fees.</p><p>  Will there be further spending by Irish Water on consultancy fees?  In the document presented to us it is indicated that the Irish Water programme will run to April 2015 in order to finalise systems and deliver a further geographic information system and a mobile workforce management system.  How much will this cost and is the cost included in the &euro;50 million figure?  The document also indicates that the Irish Water business model is to operate largely within Bord G&aacute;is and the local authorities, with a very small element of support from third party providers.  Who are the third party providers?  Do they include the national confederation of group schemes or local authorities?  How much will they cost and who is engaging them?  I would like these questions to be answered.</p><p>  The document indicates that the entire programme and associated budget, as well as the approach to resourcing and staffing, were rigorously examined and approved both by the internal Bord G&aacute;is governance approval process and relevant Departments.  What Departments were involved other than the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.356" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1084" speakername="Luke Flanagan" time="18:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400036#KK00300"><p>It is quite obvious, having listened to Mr. Tierney, that there was a big hoo-ha because people did not know this money was being spent, but the Government knew it was being spent.  It is very handy to dish all of the dirt on Irish Water as that is how things work in this country.  The HSE was set up in order that we could dish the dirt on somebody else when it came to health matters.  That is how the country works.</p><p>  It is quite obvious what Irish Water is trying to do.  It is building a massive cash register to collect money in order to repay debts that were not ours in the first place.  It is sickening, as the idea that we do not pay for water is becoming the truth because of repetition.  As we are talking about setting up a system, I will pay for water a third time.  I currently pay for it through taxation and I also pay for it in going to the supermarket.  As there is another system being set up, I will have to pay for it a third time.  The only system that has worked so far is going to the shop.  If it does not work in that scenario, in which there is great quality assurance, I will get an apology and my money back.</p><p>  How much has been saved by going with Bord G&aacute;is?  The original idea was to make savings because the company had much of the required talent, but it now seems that it has none of it.  What exactly was saved?  When somebody has done a job, it is nice to know how many hours of work were done for the money and the wages involved.  Were the consultants getting &euro;1,000 or &euro;1,500 a day, for example?  They were probably getting plenty to decide what would be charged for water.  Ordinary people will not receive such payments.</p><p>  Mr. Tierney indicated that he had joined Bord G&aacute;is because its approach would be very professional.  Although we have strayed into the area of water quality, apparently the only reason we are here is to ask if we have received good value for money.  I read today the Local Government Audit Service report on spending in Dublin City Council in the year ending 2011.  It states:<blockquote>It is evident that the financial management, as part of project management by the environment and engineering department for this project, has been weak.  There needed to be evidence of much more comprehensive oversight in monitoring and controlling expenditure.  No proper classification of expenditure on an invoice basis was available to account for moneys spent on this project in the initial audit stage (April 2012).</blockquote></p> <p>This is a project that was led by Mr. Tierney.  The question is whether we trust what is going on.  How the hell can one trust what is going on if the head of Irish Water is having such things said about him by the LGAS report?  There is something wrong.</p><p> We were meant to meet to talk about whether we were getting good value for money but in his address and the documentation that was emailed to us, Mr. Tierney also strayed into the area of water quality.  He brought it up and it must be addressed.  As far as I can see the only quality that will be looked after is that the billing systems will be of quality but the water will not be of good drinking quality.  Mr. Tierney referred to dealing with water quality issues.  How will he deal with them?  Will they all be end-of-pipe solutions &ndash; in other words, will a load of chlorine be fired into the water to make it drinkable or will the pollution be prevented in the first place?  If that is the case, what will be the role of Irish Water?</p><p> Mr. Tierney raised the issue of water quality.  He referred in the report he presented to us to storm water getting into sewerage systems and polluting water courses.  I will give an example of what currently goes on and I would like Mr. Tierney to tell me what will happen when Irish Water takes over.  Our local authority polluted the local water courses because of a problem with the storm water system which allowed storm water to get into the sewage treatment system.  When I reported it to the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, the EPA got the local council to investigate the matter.  What will change under Irish Water?  The same local authority system will be used to solve the problem.  I am paying for water three times.  It will cost a fortune to put in the payment system.  Mr. Tierney cannot tell us what will be saved by going with Bord G&aacute;is.  Mr. Tierney&rsquo;s record is not good in terms of what was said about him in the report unless what I read in <i>The Irish Times</i>today is not true.  It would not be the first time that was the case but I urge Mr. Tierney to please prove the newspaper report wrong.</p></speech>

He has explained many of the issues of concern held by the public.  We wish to ensure value for money is being obtained.  While I disagree with some of the previous speakers I am cognisant of the fact that we need Irish Water.  We have needed such a body for a considerable time given the amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money that is wasted in treating water and the fact that 40% of it leaks back into the ground.  Irish Water will also be responsible for wastewater.  Other speakers have referred to the significant problem we have with contamination.  It is an enormous challenge and must be addressed as quickly as possible.  Has Mr. Tierney made any calculations of the fines that will be imposed on this country for having poor quality water or water contaminated by effluent or other undesirable matter?</p><p>  My other question relates to the fact that Irish Water will, in effect, be a monopoly in its management of water and wastewater.  Has Mr. Tierney put systems in place to ensure the consumer gets value for money and what are they?  Could he also ensure that the money entrusted to him through the taxpayer will provide value for money?</p><p>  Reference has been made to the fact that Mr. Tierney met with the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  How often have Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water met with the CER to date and how often does Mr. Tierney expect to deal with the CER in the future?</p><p>  Reference has been made to a matter previously but I wish to get further clarification.  What amount of funding has been saved by the use of Bord G&aacute;is&rsquo;s own systems and processes?  I would very much appreciate if Mr. Tierney could provide a figure for the total sum involved.</p><p>  I understand a 12-year service level agreement has been obtained with local authorities.</p></speech>

The capital project team is slightly outside the remit of the meeting but reference was made to it earlier.

Irish Water must come up with a 25-year investment plan for our long-term strategies.  In addition, we are preparing a two-year capital investment plan in the short term and we will also have to prepare plans as part of the price control review with the regulator.</p><p>  Efficiency should be interpreted as the ability to have money to spend on more relevant pieces of work that we need to carry out.  I mentioned capital.  For an annual spend of what would be &euro;600 million today, if we had it, our target is to try to drive the output of that for about &euro;450 million.  That is the type of target we are setting ourselves.  We have 2,000 water and wastewater treatment plants to manage, not one or two big ones.  We have all of those other ones to manage.  We want to put in place procedures and investment that gets to the ones that need to be dealt with quickest.  On the next day we intend to give a more detailed outline of the asset management approach and some of the planning approach.  That will cover some of the questions that have been raised by certain Deputies.</p><p>  In terms of compliance, we have to deal with the EU and Irish law.  We are already dealing with a serious legacy with the European Court of Justice, ECJ, case and also with issues relating to the Environmental Protection Agency.</p></speech>

We were not involved as it was prior to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, becoming involved.  The intention is and has been to use the expertise of local authorities.  That was done through secondment to the Irish Water programme itself.  A number of staff in local authorities have successfully applied for jobs in the permanent organisation, Irish Water.  We are using the expertise of local authorities through the service level agreements.</p> <p>The money being spent on establishment does not come out of the moneys being used at the moment to invest in local authority schemes or operations.</p></speech>

That budget is completely separate.</p><p>  In regard to spending levels, what we have done is provide the expenditure to the end of the programme.

This is being done on the basis of trying to meter the maximum number possible.  This is Government policy and we have been charged with implementing it.  Our intention is to use the maximum amount of the money generated to maximise investment in the system efficiently to deliver some of the crucial investment needed, as mentioned by the Deputy, in the area of water quality.</p><p>  I will deal with some of the other points made by the Deputy, but Mr. Dempsey will deal with the issue of savings within Bord G&aacute;is.  We will also cover the issue of man hours.  </p><p>  In regard to the approach we are taking, the Deputy has mentioned articles that have been published in some newspapers.

Of course, there is the thorny issue of how the moneys were spent, but there were a couple of little sweeteners such as there would be jobs and that the water quality problem would be solved.  If these are included, they must be discussed.  Mr. Tierney has not dealt with the water quality issue.  In regard to jobs, he was very quick to tell us that 400 new jobs would be created, but there will also be jobs lost.  If we were to start charging for air in the morning, jobs would be created.  That is hardly a reason for celebration, but it is thrown into Irish Water's document as involving the creation of jobs.  Irish Water is not creating jobs; it is destroying them.</p></speech>

That question was asked of me and the situation I pointed to and to which I referred was similar to the one already occurring in the system.  Let us look at the situation and what Irish Water is trying to do.  One of the big problems we have in this country is that the capacity of the systems is such that it affects economic development.  Apart from the important issues of water quality, environmental compliance and so on, a critical issue is capacity.  If we had more capacity, far more jobs could be created and there could be far more investment by indigenous companies and international companies here.  That is one of the critical reasons Irish Water is being established - to create a funding basis, including charges.  We need that consistent funding to be able to generate further investment in the system.</p></speech>

The first is from a financial perspective, about which I will speak.  The second is from a customer service perspective, about which Mr. O'Donoghue will speak.</p><p>  From a financial perspective, we want to keep costs as low as possible.  Internally in Irish Water and within the Bord Gais group we have appropriate controls for how we spend money.  That was one of the reasons Bord Gais was selected to set up the utility.  An important aspect of the establishment of any utility is that one control costs.  Apart from control internally within Irish Water and the group, there is also scrutiny by the Department and through other fora such as this one, as well as by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  We have to make a submission to the commission on our costs and will be doing so in the next period of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.425" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Donoghue" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400039#NN01500"><p>Consumers today will become our customers and have different expectations.  We will be providing these services as a regulated utility and subject to the same codes, charters, guidelines and so forth that are imposed on Bord Gais, the ESB and other energy providers in the State.  We will be expected to publish our customer commitments and make promises to the public quite explicitly about how services will be provided, including, for example, about how quickly we will answer telephone calls, deal with complaints, respond to call-out requests and conduct work on a customer's property, including complete reinstatement and so forth.  All of these will become published standards and harmonised in the sense that the same standards will apply nationally to all customers of Irish Water.  We will deliver this over time and do so in the context of being a regulated utility.  The CER will consult on all of these standards and set them out publicly.  They will then be published on websites, in brochures and leaflets in order that the public will be aware of them.  I do not doubt that, as with other utilities, the CER will then move to impose penalties and provide compensation where we fail to meet the required standards.  If we make a public promise and it is evident that we have failed to achieve it, the public will have the right to receive compensation for not being provided with the service promised to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.426" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Barry" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400039#NN01600"><p>A question was asked about the number of man days involved in the project.  I have just checked our documentation and while I am broadly happy with the numbers, with the permission of the Chairman, I will revert on that detail because the figure looks to be a little low.  I will gladly come back with the accurate number.  We have an estimate which appears to be low.  Rather than give that figure now, I will revert back, if that is acceptable.</p><p>  The second question concerned the savings made as a result of the contract being awarded to Bord Gais.  As I said, in the context of contingency funds and the additional money that it might have cost, we made an original estimate of approximately &euro;29 million against a 20% and a 35% contingency figure, given the unknowns.  Savings were made in the area of software licences in the order of &euro;58 million.  The most important point is that the value one puts on what the Bord Gais utility brought to the establishment of Irish Water is very hard to quantify for a number of reasons.  First, we have come from a standing start and in 18 months delivered the utility on time and within budget.  I think, without fear of being challenged, this has never been done before anywhere.  At the heart of this was the core expertise Bord Gais had brought, but putting a value on it is very difficult.  If I had to put a value on it, it could easily be tens, if not hundreds, of millions, if one went to the market and tried to bid for what has been achieved.  Second, the utility expertise we brought in in terms of picking the systems and dictating the contracts for the service providers to do what they did was fundamental to what we had been doing as a utility for many years.  It is difficult to quantify it and it is not covered in the numbers I have outlined.  The savings, therefore, are far greater than I have outlined.</p></speech>

In his presentation he said the approach taken by Irish Water was in line with a modern, new utility, but the information I have suggests that is not necessarily the case.  We are talking about value for money and I would like Mr. Tierney to defend some of the utility's actions.  Irish Water is using drive-by meters, for example.  Why, when the rest of the world is migrating away from such meters to smart meters, is Irish Water installing an older, out-of-date system at huge cost?  Mr. Tierney has said that in July 2013 a letter from the Department gave Irish Water consent on a figure of &euro;250 million for the metering project.  Is that the total cost?  How can he defend the decision to install an older, out-of-date system when countries such as Malta which was praised by IBM is using a smart metering system?  Why was this decision made?  What consultant recommended this course of action?  Was it recommended by a consultant?</p><p>  We have been back and forth on the issue of the expertise Bord Gais had over and above that of Bord na M&oacute;na, which is why it won the contract.  Mr. O'Donoghue said Bord Gais could not possibly have all of the required expertise in-house, which I accept.  That has been verified elsewhere and Mr. O'Donoghue has said Irish Water needed so-called "global nomads" with expertise.  Did Irish Water consider secondments, as was done in Northern Ireland?  I heard the CEO of Northern Ireland Water who retired recently speak about that issue recently.  He made the point that hiring permanent staff would have been too costly and that hiring consultants would have been very costly, too.  In that context, considering secondments was the wisest choice.  Why was it not considered, or was it?  That approach is used in Government Departments all of the time.  </p><p>  I ask the delegates to clarify an issue reported in some newspapers today that four contracts were awarded without going through the public procurement process, even though they had met an EU regulation guideline.  Is that true?  What will the overall spend on consultants be by April 2015?  </p><p>  My final question relates to those consumers who are members of group water schemes and those who have their own wells.  Will they have any relationship with Irish Water?  Will they have to pay any charges to it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.431" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="18:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014011400039#NN02100"><p>I welcome Mr. Tierney and his team and hope their presence is indicative of a generally open approach to what is the most important and vital service we require in the country.</p> <p>The witnesses are in charge of the most important service we require because we all need water in our daily lives and it is vital, along with electricity, for industry.  I am very conscious of that and that it is very important the witnesses be given every opportunity to deliver an excellent service.  The complexity of it is such that I have concerns on the delivery, governance, the technology involved, etc.  On the way into this meeting I gave the witnesses a list of 18 technical questions for which I requested written replies.  I can read them but the Chairman would probably prefer me not to.  I would very much appreciate if the witnesses could reply to me and the committee on those technical questions on the delivery of IT systems, etc., as soon as possible.</p><p> I will be interested to hear the witnesses' comments on how they intend to interact generally with local authorities, particularly when problems arise, and what their legal obligations are to do so.  Could they comment on an issue that arose in the media yesterday on the provision of a water provision facility in Cloghran in Fingal?  The allegation on the radio was that they cannot go ahead with this because it was not ready to go to tender before the end of December.  There may be more such issues.  Will the witnesses be able to deal with them?</p></speech>

Furthermore, our Government was trying to cover up that fact over the last year.  Having listened to the Irish Water representatives, my fears are not allayed on any of those questions.</p><p>  Who knew what, when and where?  Did Mr. Tierney know parliamentary questions had been asked when they were asked, along the lines of what has been asked today and on which we finally got answers today?  Is he surprised that last week, Government representatives, including the line Minister, Deputy O'Dowd, and the T&aacute;naiste, expressed surprise about the amount that was spent on consultants, while he is telling us they knew?  Ordinary members of the public, and I as a public representative, are confused at how Mr. Tierney can tell us they knew while last week they said they were surprised.  We need clarity.  Mr. Tierney has given us the answer, that they knew but were not telling us.  Therefore, their expressions of surprise last week were fake.  They were fooling the public last week when they said they were surprised.  They were not surprised because they knew.  That appears to be what Mr. Tierney is telling us.</p><p>  Is all the money that is being pumped into Irish Water in the form of home taxes, and soon to be water charges, going to line the pockets of consultants and highly-paid executives?  The figures are extraordinary: &euro;44 million to IBM.  The Irish Water representatives have tried today to convince us that this is money well spent.  They would want to do something special to justify &euro;44 million to IBM or &euro;17 million to KPMG.  How many pipes were fixed for this money?  What is the percentage improvement in the amount of water leaking out of the system for the money that was given to IBM, Accenture, KPMG and Ernst and Young?  Not one iota of water has been saved as a result of that expenditure.</p></speech>

How much water has been conserved as a result of that expenditure?  It all relates to billing and charges.  If we did not have water charges, and consequently did not have the requirement to install meters to monitor how much water people are using, how much of this expenditure would have been necessary?  Is the vast majority of this expenditure about billing and charging rather than about building reservoirs, fixing water pipes, ensuring water quality, and the issues people are concerned about?  Can the Irish Water representatives convince us that there will be real, meaningful savings?</p><p>  Mr. Tierney has told us he gets &euro;200,000 per year.  In the semi-State sector there is a pay cap.  He was paid less when he was city manager for Dublin City Council.  His pay has gone up.  How many extra executives who are not subject to the normal public sector pay caps have been employed as a result of the establishment of Irish Water?  If those executive positions on salaries higher than if they were working on local authorities is indicative of so-called savings, it does not add up.  We are paying more to do things previously done by local authorities.</p><p>  I do not mean to personalise it, but that is what ordinary people are thinking.  They are going to pay charges and the guy at the head of the company who will impose those charges on them is getting paid more than when he was in the local authorities.  That is how ordinary people feel.  They do not understand how Mr. Tierney is being paid more while they are being charged and ordinary workers in the public sector have had their wages slashed.  Are we creating and paying for a big, expensive bureaucracy to charge people which is doing nothing for the water infrastructure of this country?</p><p>  If I understand Mr. Tierney, last year Irish Water spent &euro;50 million on consultants from a total spend of &euro;100 million.  By the end of the programme it will be &euro;180 million and &euro;80 million on consultants.  More will be spent on consultants and set-up charges, and that does not even include the metering.  This is all about office systems, IT software, billing, charging and bureaucracy.  What the hell are these people doing for us?  The issue is the taking over of &euro;11 billion worth of assets that were not functioning well.  It does not seem to me that establishing offices and software systems, and all the rest on which Irish Water has spent enormous amounts of money, addresses any of the key issues that face that water infrastructure.</p></speech>

There is nothing about the nature of water consumption which requires more data than what these drive-by meters can give us.  Driving by is an efficient way of collecting the data from them.  Because they are installed externally we can get an actual reading at very high levels, whereas if we were to install meters inside properties, we would have the issue of access on a regular basis, which we still experience in the case of gas and electricity meters.</p></speech>

Drive-by meters are labour and vehicle intensive because one must drive by within 100 m to pick up levels of usage for billing, whereas smart meters are connected to a communications system which can connect directly with the utility.  Therefore, there is no need to drive around in vehicles, which is a cost and which involves the emission of carbon dioxide.  Smart metering is a more sophisticated system with up-to-date information available to customers, while data for leakages can be easily determined.  It would not seem-----</p></speech>

We do not require constant streaming to identify leakages.  The systems about which the Senator is speaking are not universal.  It is not the case that water utilities everywhere are switching to fully smart metering systems, with radio feeds or constant data streaming.  The nature of the use of the product does not require minute by minute consumption patterns.</p></speech>

At the back-end of these systems enormous quantities of data must be handled.

We considered all of the alternatives at that time and concluded that, on balance, it was the best route forward for us.  There is nothing inefficient about the process.  The Senator is absolutely correct; it does what it says on the tin.  One must drive down the street and pick up pulses from the meters which contain the data we need to bill customers.  They also give information on leakages.  It is a very efficient system in relative terms.</p></speech>

As I pointed out earlier in the meeting, the money does not, in any way, come out of the allocations for operations and maintenance and capital investment.  There is a separate funding line in that regard.  In the current year the moneys for both operations and maintenance and the capital investment shall come from a mixture of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and,  potentially, some funding to be raised by Irish Water.  It is on that basis that the estimated figure for capital investment for 2014 will be &euro;310 million with roughly &euro;240 million provided by the Department and &euro;70 million to come from Irish Water.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about real savings.  </p></speech>

Let me use the analogy of the gas sector in Ireland.  My colleague, Mr. John Dempsey, can speak more eloquently than I on the sector, on where it was 20 years ago or whatever period before Bord G&aacute;is was established and compare it with the standard of the product today.  That is why Bord G&aacute;is took on Irish Water.  However, Irish Water cannot deal with the problems overnight and we have never said that they can be resolved overnight.  One must put the mechanics in place and that means one produces an investment in the system to bring about the improvement.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Tierney understand why people are not terribly trusting when it comes to matters like this one?</p><p>  Let me refer to the article published by <i>The Irish Times </i>but I shall not go into the company's role in the matter.  I understand that a lot of what happened with RPS predated the company's involvement in the Poolbeg project.  It is more alarming that RPS was contracted for &euro;8 million but the project cost &euro;32 million and we will probably not have an incinerator.  While I am glad that we do not have an incinerator I am left with the following question.  Where did all of the money go?  It went into the pockets of the RPS guys, its consultants, spin doctors and management people.  No matter what they did one is left with a few questions.  Where did all of the money go?  How did costs overrun by so much? Can people be trusted to manage projects and deal with the enormously valuable asset that is water?  Is there any reason Uisce &Eacute;ireann appointed two former senior RPS executives to the board of Irish Water given the poor role that it played in the Poolbeg project?   </p></speech>

The person appointed head of asset management is the most experienced water engineer in the country.  The person appointed head of communications is a communications expert, a chartered engineer and has serious qualifications in environmental science.  We picked the best people for the jobs based on the applications submitted through the open recruitment campaign and that is the way recruitment should be done.  The whole management team was picked on that basis.</p><p>  I have covered the issues that were mentioned earlier.  The Deputy asked one other question on the pay model.  The differential, in my  regard, is &euro;10,000 but that has not been in any way affected by the pay model.  Let me explain.  When one compares two jobs then the pay model is determined by the sector.  My pay is a matter of public record and it was stated from the very first day.  The Deputy mentioned my pay but the comparative costs are far lower than comparable utility pay in Ireland and the UK utility sector.  </p><p>  With regard to the pay model generally, I pointed out that the pay model that we have introduced is a factor of difference in terms of levels of pay that are paid, by comparison, in the UK.</p></speech>

An earlier contributor asked whether Irish Water have learned anything from the past.  Has the Oireachtas learned anything?  I hate to suggest that we have not.</p> <p>The difficulty is twofold - it is a lack of oversight and a lack of access to information.  That is a flaw in the legislation brought forward by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and passed by the Oireachtas.  I find it hypocritical that many of us are questioning issues raised during Second and Committee Stages in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il and the legislation was voted through.  I did not think we would be back this soon.  Irish Water and other similar bodies will appear before this and other committees until such time as we take responsibility, ensure oversight is in place and there is access to information.  This is what we voted through and we are where we are as a result.  Given that businesses do not like paying water charges, Irish Water will have a very difficult task.  There are a few things it can do to help itself.  </p><p> With regard to the legislation and its flaws, it does the public and Irish Water no service.  If Mr. Tierney was to request the Minister to make his body subject to parliamentary questions, that would go a long way to addressing the difficulty.  I do not think Irish Water has a board of directors.  Is their merit in it having a board of directors to act in the public interest and in terms of oversight?  With respect to the kernel, I agree with my good colleague, Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett and others, that the public do not have confidence when large sums of money are spent on consultants because they cannot quantify, as I cannot, how they can be spent on such a service.  I will give one example.  Some &euro;5.4 million was spent on governance and regulation.  If Irish Water gave a commitment to publish on its website an exact breakdown of that amount, rather than the bland &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million for oversight, the nuts and bolts of the actual money, we would be able to adjudicate.  If a certain legal practice sent it a letter to pay &euro;2,000 for the advice or the stamp, that would go some way to addressing the difficulty.  I am not in a position to say that the &euro;50 million spent on consultants was value for money or that it will save money ultimately.  I do not know because the information is not available.  I do not believe people will have confidence in Irish Water until such time as the information is available.</p><p> I have a few brief questions following earlier contributions.  Senator Landy mentioned that the 34 local authorities have assets of &euro;11 billion.  The impression I got from the submission was that there was a sloppy response from local authorities.  There is a great differentiation.  There is an onus on Irish Water to publish the response from the local authorities.  It is outrageous that local authorities had assets in the region of &euro;11 billion and they were not sure what they had or what was happening to them.  What other assets have local authorities got?  I am a strong advocate of reform of local government as I think it is dysfunctional.  Many of the members behind me have come from that system.  We have &euro;11 billion worth of assets.  The terminology I have written down here includes, "differential" and "not in a complete fashion" or something to that effect.  Let us see if there was a difference between county councils.  Was the submission from Roscommon County Council in order?  What councils defaulted?  What was the most valuable asset within the &euro;11 billion.  In regard to the outstanding bills for water owed by business, I do not know if a figure has been put on them.  I see somewhere that it may be &euro;1 billion or &euro;500 million.  Does Irish Water have any idea of the outstanding bills?  Will it also quantify the actual outstanding loans?  If it has not already quantified that figure, perhaps it would do so now or in the future.</p><p> The issue of bonus levels was raised.  I believe everybody except the CEO can get it.  What is the level of the actual bonus?  From a political credibility point of view - I used this line in the past - that we are paying for water anyway so we agree with water charges.  By a logical, political and fair extension of that, there should be a yearly total of income taken in by Irish Water.  The tax take from the public should be reduced by that figure if we are paying for it, rather than paying on the double.</p></speech>

They said they keep themselves aware of what happens in Parliament.  I submit that what has happened in the Parliament was an absolute shambles.  It started with the Water Services Bill.  The document refers to an explanatory and financial memorandum.  There is no financial memorandum in it.  Does the company stand over that?  Did the witnesses brief the Minister before he came to the Seanad in the week before Christmas?  Given that they follow the parliamentary debates they will be aware that he turned down amendments in respect of local authorities and he turned down any role for the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority to see that the organisation was working as a competitive body.  He also turned down any role for the Department of Finance in relation to investment appraisals.  We are finding out now that &euro;100 million is already gone and we do not know what it was for and we are trying to catch up after the event.  He turned down any role for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform which is supposed to deliver reform.</p><p>  I live in Kildare.  The Minister said we have low water charges.  The organisation should not say it is inventing water.  I have water.  We have paid &euro;1 billion per year for it in taxation.  Some &euro;539 million has been spent on meters and &euro;100 million on consultants to charge me for what I was paying for through my income tax.  I do not know what are the set up costs.  It is simply an amalgamation of 34 local authorities.  I hope there are some efficiencies but I have to say the way company and the Department have treated the Parliament is unacceptable.  That is why people are so annoyed.  The company has made an appalling start and it had better try to get onside pretty quickly if there is to be any public confidence in the organisation.  </p><p>  Why was the electricity regulator chosen to regulate water?  They are two completely different fields.  The electricity regulator has an electricity price which is 42% above the European average.  That is a wonderful start.  Are we going to pay 42% more for water as well, under the same regulator?  The whole issue has been an absolute shambles from beginning to end.  How many of the consultants were associated with the collapse of banking in Ireland?  As elected represented, we are trying to get away from that situation.  I am disturbed to see that the same people who walked out of Government Buildings with &euro;64 billion in their pockets are now advising Irish Water.  That is an appalling situation.  Why could it not have slowly amalgamated the 34 local authorities who were doing the job and why is it not open to having its investment plans put before the committee, the Department of Finance, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  Why is it so anti-consumer?  What is wrong with the National Consumer Agency?  The organisation would not even accept advice on the billing system.  It seems to me that the National Consumer Agency would be well advised.  If the organisation is running a closed shop as it has done up to now, it will be very difficult to persuade people that this investment is in any way worthwhile.  It has been a disastrous start for Irish Water because of that.  It should have been open with us, given that it follows the parliamentary debates.  </p><p>  Some 164 amendments were tabled in the Seanad in respect of the legislation, 56 of which were Government amendments, having realised the flaws in the legislation.  If the organisation is in consultation with the Department there are many improvements needed to bring it up to an acceptable level so far as Parliament is concerned.  It must be accountable.  The secrecy we have witnessed heretofore is unacceptable to the public.  We are trying to reform this country and what happened to it in 2008.  This is more of the old bad stuff so far as I am concerned.  </p></speech>

I have been present for a few hours, I left for an hour and I am back again.  The consultancy and PR fees beggar belief.  I cannot get my head around it.  It cannot be justified.  Mr. John Tierney and his colleagues have made an effort to do it but the wider populace, including myself, gets it hard.</p><p>  Other utilities, for example, Telecom &Eacute;ireann, ESB, Bord G&aacute;is have annual fixed charges, which they charge on their accounts.  For example, the ESB charge in rural areas is based on the size of the house, while in urban areas it is based on the number of rooms in the house.  It is an annual fixed charge that it pays the utility concerned and whether it uses a unit, it gets a minimum fixed charge.  I forget the terminology.  Will Uisce &Eacute;ireann have a fixed charge?  People are being asked to fix their leaks and to conserve water.  No doubt we will return to the two or three 40 gallon barrels outside the back door to collect the rainwater running off the roof. </p> <p>Will the cost of water per unit be more expensive to somebody who tries to conserve it, perhaps by not flushing the toilet as often as one might otherwise do?  Will Uisce &Eacute;ireann have a basic charge irrespective of whether one uses water or not?  It is not realistic not to use one's telephone or electricity.  Will there be an added charge?</p><p> Let me refer to the question of the &euro;539 million.  I have rounded this figure off to &euro;540 million.  Am I correct in stating 1,700,000 households require meters?</p></speech>

I divided &euro;540 million by 1.7 million and got a figure of &euro;330 per house.  It would have been closer to &euro;500 if my figures had been right.  I am not so sure but this figure seems totally excessive.</p><p>  Was the contract given to one concern or two concerns?  Local contractors in every town and city could have been given jobs.  They would honestly laugh at the figure of &euro;540 million.  Fifty four of them would get &euro;1 million each to install so many meters.  They would regard the figure as very much excessive.  It cannot be justified.  The cost associated with metering has really gone up in recent years.</p><p>  Other utility companies have interconnectors between the North and South.  Is it the intention of Uisce &Eacute;ireann to have an interconnector between the North and South or interconnectors between our cities and towns throughout the country, as exist in other utility systems?</p><p>  What is the anticipated cost of repairing the leaks in the existing system, which is losing 40% of its important commodity?  Will the cost be met by consumers?</p></speech>

Meter installation was put to public tender.  There were eight regions decided upon and eight contracts.  The system was very well put together in that it is based on work packages.  Consequently, if one does not deliver in one's work, it can lead to the contract being passed to somebody else.  It has worked extremely well.  It is on the public record that four of the contracts went to one contractor.  Two went to another contractor and two contractors got one each.  These are the main contractors.  We set a target that a minimum of 25% of their staff would have to be from a combination of small and medium enterprises, school leavers, graduates and the unemployed.  Some 60% have come from those sectors.  A significant number of small subcontractors around the country are being employed as part of that programme.</p></speech>

There has been some turnover because of the demands of the programme in terms of getting the work done and because of the strict nature of the programme.  It is working extremely well.  Let me give the Senator one figure to take away today.  In the United Kingdom, Thames Water is installing 2,000 meters per month.  Its plan is to complete the process by 2030.  It is obviously increasing the rate to achieve this.  We were set a target of installing 27,000 per month and delivering 1,050,000 by the end of 2016.   We have reached the target of 27,000 per month and we are on target to reach 1,050,000 by the end of 2016.</p><p>  There will be a conservation programme.  It is part of the capital investment programme to begin to deal with the leakage problem.</p><p>  On the issue of the interconnector, I am not sure what Senator Terry Brennan is referring to.  There are not similar sets of circumstances at present in the North and South as there might be in respect of gas, for example.</p></speech>

Would it be beneficial?  It is of great benefit to both parts of the island in respect of other utilities when there is sufficient demand.

It would have to be associated with a cost-benefit analysis.  Much more important in the short to medium term is the interconnection between various centres for supply resilience.  This is where the money will go in the short to medium term.  We have a lot of water in the country but we need more resilience in terms of towns.  Interconnectivity between regions will probably happen first, and then, possibly, interconnection between jurisdictions.  The latter is probably a good distance away.</p></speech>

It is typical for a telecommunications, gas or electricity bill to include a standing or fixed element.  This reflects the fact that quite a bit of the cost in utility industries is incurred irrespective of whether anybody uses the service.  Irrespective of whether one uses the telephone, turns on the tap or uses the cooker, significant costs arise for the industry.  In the water industry, these costs are associated with maintaining reservoirs, adding chemicals to water to make it of drinking standard and using energy to pump water between places.  Our expectation is that there will be a fixed element to the bill.</p></speech>

The publication of the explanatory memorandum on the Act is not the responsibility of Irish Water, as the Senator is aware, because that has to be done by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Normally, an initial explanatory memorandum is published by the Department, followed by a version after the legislation is passed.  The legislation has been passed for only two and half weeks at this stage.</p><p>  On the issue of the current payment for the system, there was a contribution from overall taxes because subvention comes from the Government to the sector at present.  There were charges previously and they were stopped.  They are now being reintroduced.  That is Government policy and we are implementing it on the basis of a utility piece that will be about creating efficiency in the system so the money raised in regard to charges is spent as efficiently as possible.  With regard to why the Commission for Energy Regulation was chosen, it was a matter of Government decision and policy.</p><p>  The question asked on consultancies was answered earlier in the afternoon.  Mr. Barry can provide information again on the procurement process.</p> <p>In terms of Government policy on investment plans, we would submit our investment plans to the Minister in accordance with the legislation.</p></speech>

We vet them and once they pass that minimum test, then they go to tender.  We do not discriminate against bodies.  They pass the minimum test that we apply for pre-qualification and then they go to tender.  We do not discriminate on the basis of what has happened in the past or previous submissions.  We judge them on what they submit to us and if they make that test, then they go on to tender.  That is how it works.</p></speech>

I did not understand exactly the question on parliamentary questions.  I provided an answer to that earlier.  Whatever decisions the Government makes on the provision of information, as I clarified earlier in the meeting, Irish Water will obviously abide by those.</p><p>  In relation to the board of directors, Irish Water, as an organisation, reports to two boards.  Originally, it was the Bord G&aacute;is board, but there was also a separate board set up last year for Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.</p><p>  Deputy Timmins asked for certain information to be published on the website.  I might take up separately exactly what he is looking for in that regard and we will examine that.</p><p>  On the comment about the assets, I did not in any way convey an adjudication on the local authorities.  I simply stated as a fact that, mainly because of resource issues and, second, because introducing an asset management system would be a new approach, we are where we are in terms of the provision of information on the assets.</p><p>  On outstanding debtors, there is a process in place with the local authorities on the non-domestic debt which is being worked through because they will provide us with an agreed handover figure on 31 December but the bills for that period still have to go out.  There is a period of the first six months of this year - is it nine months for six months-----</p></speech>

That will take place.  As the local authorities finalise their accounts following on the 2012 year end, I suppose numbers will be put on those liabilities and we will enter into a process in the first quarter of this year where we will agree the amounts involved and come to a net arrangement with each local authority.  It is hard to go into any more detail on it than that at present because there is still not sufficient clarity around all the liabilities and the associated values that attach to them, but it will be a net liability position.  There are some assets that transfer across but it is a net liability position that Irish Water will be assuming.</p></speech>

Personally, I do not agree with that model and I do not necessarily agree that he has inherited a series of <i>ad hoc</i> local authority systems throughout the country.  I am mindful of the fact that 33% of Irish Water's staff came from the local authority system and almost half of its executive are from the local authority system.  That is for another day.  We will agree to differ.</p><p>  There are two or three other points I want to make.  On the savings of &euro;2 billion predicted to be achieved by 2021 that have been mentioned, they state there are 4,300 in the local authority system for all of whom, I presume, there are service level agreements for the future and 510 will be employed in Irish Water in the coming months altogether.  That brings a total of almost 5,000 employed, directly and indirectly.  Can they give an indication of what they expect the staffing levels to be come 2021 and will staffing cost contribute to the savings?  Although it is a little far ahead to look at, it does not augur well for a continued service level agreement beyond the 12 years for which it is in place.</p><p>  In terms of procurement, I am conscious of the efforts the witnesses made to answer the questions from Senator Healy Eames earlier, specifically on the story that was carried in one of the newspapers this morning.  Is &euro;400,000 the threshold for public procurement?</p></speech>

Have many?  The figure is high and excessive.  I am interested to know how many contracts under &euro;400,000 have been awarded without open competition and can Mr. Barry furnish the committee with the amount in total that has been awarded in any such contracts.  Could it be possible that multiple such contracts were awarded and what is the amount in total; have some of those companies, for example, not entered a public competition at all?</p><p>  The Government had committed that 80% of the revenue from this year's property tax would be dispersed to local authorities throughout the country.  They reneged on that commitment towards the back end of last year and stated that the total proceeds, being &euro;400 million, would be redirected to Irish Water.  Can Mr. Tierney inform the committee how that funding is to be spent?  Is it to go towards the capital or maintenance programme of the taxpayers' assets throughout the country that were formally held in trust by local authorities or how does Irish Water propose to spend that &euro;400 million?  Was there a similar budget proposal put to the Department as to that spend and was it agreed with the Minister, similar to what was agreed previously in relation to &euro;180 million with &euro;30 million contingency included that was obviously agreed with the Department and the Minister with responsibility for it in September or November 2012?</p></speech>

Going back to the savings to the Exchequer, the witnesses stated there was a hybrid model and some of that includes payments directly from the Exchequer towards the capital works.  It is only a saving to the Exchequer if there is an actual saving, through procurement, etc., or through additional charges.  That is the relevant point.  One could end up with a good billing system and good asset management system but, because there is a finite amount in consumers' pockets, which is the point commentators make repeatedly, it has been exhausted.</p> <p>Moreover, the credit union analysis shows there is a sizeable number of people with pretty much no scope for discretionary expenditure.  Consequently, there will be a limit on the domestic side and Irish Water could end up with a very good billing system and a highly deficient water system.  For me, this is not a world-class system and the witnesses might comment on that point.</p><p> The location, in most instances, of the meters on public streets means that unlike with gas and electricity, there is a responsibility between the gate and the house.  While there obviously will be a first-fix policy, members need to know much more about that.  It is likely to be something with which the joint committee must deal at the next meeting.</p><p> Another issue with which the joint committee must deal in some detail is that of quality control, because going back would not be desirable.  Members need to know exactly what is the oversight in respect of the installation of these meters because there is a range of subcontractors in addition to the main contractor.  I deal with issues that arise with regard to such matters all the time and this would be a significant issue.  While there was a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund regarding the installation of meters, did I hear the witnesses correctly to the effect that the standing charge may well include more than the repayment of that loan?  What is Irish Water's thinking in this regard, because the witnesses mentioned reservoirs, as well as the maintenance, electricity and so on, for pumping water?  As development contributions vary nationwide, does this mean they will be standardised?  Moreover, will there be a standardisation of the price of commercial water?  An issue that has been raised with me a number of times pertains to those who make a great deal of effort to conserve water.  Last week, members heard that were one to use less, one might be obliged to pay more, which flies in the face of what would be a good culture.  I acknowledge that some of these issues must be dealt with when members come back.</p><p> Finally, on the issue of consultants and the smaller parcels, as I stated earlier, I have a really serious issue with the number of consultants and the way in which this entire matter has been handled.  However, given the manner in which Irish Water packages it, there is a limit on who can apply because the company must be of a particular size.  Obviously, this is a Europe-wide process and although the object was to create jobs, Irish Water will end up creating jobs in consultancies in countries outside Ireland.  That is an issue that was raised with me as a concern.</p></speech>

In a nutshell, Deputy Boyd Barrett put it very well in that, ultimately, it is a question of whether members agree with Mr. Tierney when he tells them he got good value for money.  Other than that, if they do not agree with him, it is tough luck.  I agree with that and on that basis, members must consider other factors and the point I mentioned earlier has not been addressed.</p><p>  Members came here today seeking evidence of much more comprehensive oversight and monitoring in controlling expenditure.  This is not my sentence but is an old sentence from the Local Government Audit Service and this issue has not been addressed.  Were a football team that I follow to take on someone who had been relegated with teams during the previous ten seasons, I would kick up a row about it.  That is football but I am talking about water and there is no more important issue than that.  Members need to nail this.  The public is not happy with the manner in which the money is being spent and there is a public perception problem.  How is that helped when it has been stated about the past work of the person who is running this most important service, that there needed to be evidence of much more comprehensive oversight in monitoring and controlling expenditure?  If all that members have to go on is trust and if that trust is based on past experience, I for one do not want Mr. Tierney running this company.  It is as simple as that.  Put it on the record.</p></speech>

On the value for money issue, there are two aspects on which to advise in that regard.  We have advised the joint committee of the nature of the reporting we provide.  There is the entire internal governance process within Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water itself and there is a further independent process by which all the establishment costs are being assessed by the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER.  The commissioner is already is on record in respect of the approach he will take in that regard and with regard to advising the Minister.  In response to Deputy Catherine Murphy on the number of consultants and how they are handled, perhaps Mr. John Barry and Mr. Ger Cowhig might respond in respect of the packages and so on.  Mr. Paul O'Donoghue might respond regarding some of the other issues pertaining to charges and we will take each one of them.</p></speech>

It brings a lot of good experience for those people to continue developing further business in Ireland.  These people are Irish people, it sustains jobs in Ireland and that works very well.  On the smaller scale, we have a lot of panels that allow a lot of small businesses and single-person enterprises to get work in the Irish Water programme.  It has been a fact of the programme that many small businesses have got work from it and have benefited from it.  My response to the Deputy is that the manner in which we package the bigger chunks of the work is for economies of scale but we make room for the smaller players and there is room for them in the way we have packaged it.</p></speech>

All told, we have a staff of approximately 100 people representing Irish Water who are supervising the metering programme.  Very simply, there are metrics in the metering programme across a wide range of activities, including quality, safety, etc., as one would expect.  The bottom line is that if the contractors fail over time to meet those key metrics, they then lose the contract.</p></speech>

We also have independent oversight to supervise our own people who are supervising the contracts.  On quality, if a contractor or members of the contractors' teams do not measure up to the quality standards on which we insist, then they are removed from the project.  Moreover, there are sanctions that we take against the contractors if the contractors themselves do not measure up to the quality standards that we apply.</p></speech>

How does Irish Water enforce that?  To give a practical example, let us say that Roscommon County Council does not live up to standards and, consequently, Irish Water takes the contract away from it.  With respect, to whom in Roscommon will Irish Water give it?  To Lidl?  How can Irish Water enforce that?  How can Irish Water change the current position in which the fox that killed the chickens gets to investigate the killing?  This is what happens at present and I need to know how that will change.</p></speech>

However, I think people would accept that to go about billing 1.6 million domestic customers and a couple of hundred thousand non-domestic customers, one must have a billing system.  One must have computers, keep accounts, have good records, take data from meters and get bills out.  One must have a billing system.</p> <p>We have no option other than to take that leap of faith.  We must have a billing system in which people have confidence.</p><p>  I echo Senator Brennan's view on locating meters on the street.  We would love to hear more on a first-fix policy.  We have been speaking to the Department and keeping track, with the Minister, of developments in this regard.  The Minister is pursuing a first-fix policy and we would like one to be introduced. </p><p> My colleagues referred to quality control around the installation of meters.  We have a high degree of confidence in quality control, an issue on which I can provide some of the metrics.  We receive approximately 1.9 complaints per 100 installations, which compares to a complaints rate of between two and three per 100 in Southern Water in the United Kingdom.  We currently look good, therefore, relative to other companies which are undertaking universal metering programmes.  This does not mean we do not receive any complaints.  Given the invasive nature of the work, with holes being opened outside people's properties, mistakes will occasionally occur.  It is critical that we do not allow the rate of complaints to increase and we ensure it is maintained at a low level.  Of greatest importance is that we ensure that when things go wrong they are resolved to customers' satisfaction.  We pride ourselves on that. </p><p> On the issue of a standing charge versus a meter charge, as I stated in reply to Senator Brennan, we expect that there will be a standing charge element.  We never relate this element to the meter charge.  As I noted, the standing charge typically reflects some of the fixed costs in the industry.  It is not a line item which reflects a particular cost such as a meter cost.  We never stated that a standing charge would be meter related.  </p><p> On development levies and non-domestic water, we expect that the Commission for Energy Regulation will seek to harmonise tariffs and charges when it has an opportunity to do so.  This would result in the application of single charging regimes regardless of where a development is being opened or where a water supply or service is utilised. </p><p> Another outstanding issue for members was whether customers who use less will have to pay a higher unit rate.  The answer is "No".  The unit rate will be struck and customers who use less against that unit rate will pay less.  </p></speech>

In the past five or six years, a staff reduction process has been under way in local authorities, with staff numbers being allowed to fall through natural wastage.  One could take the scenario of the introduction of a voluntary redundancy scheme, examine what would be its impact and make assessments on that basis extending to 2021.  As I stated, I will not cite a figure because this issue has to be worked through with trade unions and local authorities over a period.  Members will respect the fact that this is how the matter will be dealt with.</p></speech>

Irish Water is now responsible for the expenditure by local authorities on water services operations and maintenance.  We are paying the local authorities for the element that remains with them.

The first two of these will be long-term costs, namely, the cost of the staff who are involved in providing services under the service level agreement and the cost of any associated overheads.  These are the first two components of costs that we will recoup to or repay the local authority because they were incurred on our behalf.</p><p>  The third category of cost is procurement-related expenditure.  Until the end of last year, local authorities were fully responsible for paying suppliers for any goods or services supplied.  As Irish Water has been responsible for the assets since 1 January, it is technically responsible for the procurement related expenditure.  There is, however, a transitional period during which local authorities start using our procurement systems.  Mr. Cowhig or Mr. Tierney referred to the use of our procurement systems by eight local authorities.  Eight local authorities are currently using our procurement systems.  This means they raise the purchase requisition on our system, which means we pay the cost and it is not incurred by the local authority.  The payment comes out of Irish Water's bank account, if one likes.  The other local authorities will move over to our procurement systems on a phased basis.  Until such time as they do so, they will incur the operational-related expenditure for providing water services.  They currently pay suppliers for goods and services off their existing systems.  They will recharge Irish Water for these and we will pay them for it.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues from the Department of Health, Ms. Bairbre Nic Aongusa, assistant secretary, and Ms Fiona Prendergast and Mr. John Keegan, principal officers.  I am also joined by the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, and his directors Ms Laverne McGuinness, Mr. Thomas Byrne, Mr. John Hennessy, Mr. Philip Crowley, Ms Stephanie O'Keeffe and Mr. Barry O'Brien.</p><p>  This year's service plan has been prepared at a time of unprecedented challenges for the health system which arise as a direct consequence of the emergency financial situation in recent years.  It is important to acknowledge the significant improvements in productivity and the increasing range of services delivered during this period against a backdrop of significantly reduced budgets and workforce numbers.  The health system has also had to support increasing demand for its services during this time, with the population of the State increasing by 8% and the proportion of persons aged 65 years and over increasing by one fifth. </p><p>  Managing the impact of these significant financial, resource and demographic pressures on the health system in the years ahead, while delivering safe, quality health and social care services to the public, will only be possible by way of a reformed health system that provides access according to need rather than ability to pay, for best health outcomes from the available resources and treats patients at the lowest level of complexity that is safe, timely, effective and efficient and as close to home as possible.  A 20% budget reduction and a 10% reduction in staff numbers form the backdrop to the service plan.</p><p>  I will continue to deliver the Government's programme of health reform &ndash; the most comprehensive programme of reform since the foundation of the State &ndash; throughout the year.  I am pleased that the HSE has placed the advancement and implementation of these reforms at the centre of its planning for 2014.</p><p>  The following key elements of the health reform programme are built into the fabric of the 2014 service plan: phased implementation of a money follows the patient funding system in hospitals, with payments to be made to participating public hospitals on the basis of the level of inpatient and day case activity that they complete - in other words, if no patients have been treated, no funding will be available to the hospital; the transition to hospital groups, including the appointment of new group chief executive officers, CEOs, where required, the development of a memorandum of understanding between the HSE and each group and the development of a programme for implementation of hospital groups; the establishment of new community areas, with associated governance and organisational arrangements, following the completion of the review of integrated service areas - I refer to Mr. Pat Healy who has done great work with his team in this regard; implementation of new internal management structures, with specific programmes relating to shared services, procurement, human resources and information; establishment of an interim patient safety agency, initially on an administrative basis, within the HSE structure; development of commissioning functions, with the aim of achieving the greatest progress on a commissioner-provider split, prior to the introduction of statutory functions; and formation of a cross-divisional working group for health and well-being aimed at identifying the most effective model for the delivery of health improvement gains for the population in the context of a health care commissioning environment.</p><p>  My overriding priority in delivering these key health reforms across the health sector this year is patient safety.  I very much welcome the fact that patient safety and improving the quality of services to the people of Ireland are at the core of the service plan and that all health staff, individually and collectively, have a responsibility under the plan for the safety and quality of services they deliver to patients and service users in their care and must integrate this commitment to safety and quality into their core work practices.  The service plan provides for the development and use of a comprehensive set of quality and safety indicators to measure the quality and safety of services, with a particular focus this year on the priority areas of medication safety, health care associated infections, HCAI, and the national early warning score, NEWS.  It also looks to implement the recommendations made in the reports of the HSE and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, on the maternal death at Galway University Hospital by targeting necessary patient centred improvements in maternity care.  These health reform and patient safety priorities set out in the service plan are critical in order to maintain sustainable levels of service delivery to the population into the future and build on the progress made in recent years.</p><p>  The 2013 edition of <i>Health at a Glance</i> published by the OECD shows that Ireland continues to make substantive headway in improving health outcomes.  Mortality due to cancer fell by 21%, ischemic heart disease by 59% and cerebrovascular disease by 54% between 1990 and 2012 and in all three instances the rates of improvement in Ireland were above the OECD average.  Since 200 life expectancy in Ireland has increased by four years to reach 80.6 today, again above the OECD average.  I thank the men and women who deliver our health and social care services for maintaining and, in many cases, improving the ever expanding range of services provided for the general public, despite reducing resources in recent years.  Their efforts have been highly commendable in these most challenging of times.  The reform process is well under way and gathering momentum. </p><p>  Chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory disease and diabetes are the leading causes of mortality and account for more than three quarters of all deaths in Ireland.  The risk factors associated with the increased prevalence of chronic diseases such as obesity, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating patterns, over-consumption of alcohol and use of tobacco products are generally preventable.</p> <p>To address these areas of concern, Healthy Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s national framework for improved health and well-being published in 2013, sets out a whole-of-government and cross-sectoral approach to address the demands placed on health and social care services from the growing incidence of chronic illnesses, together with the challenges of an ageing population.  The commitment in the 2014 service plan to the health and well-being reform agenda set out in Healthy Ireland is critical in enabling the required shift in emphasis towards health prevention, promotion and improvement in the years ahead.</p><p> The revised gross expenditure health ceiling is &euro;12.584 billion for 2014.  This figure does not precisely correlate with the funding set out in the national service plan owing to the transfer of the children and families budget, &euro;537 million, to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Child and family services are encompassed within the national service plan, but funding for these services will be channelled through the newly established Child and Family Agency.  In addition to this adjustment, the revised Estimate for the HSE includes additional health funding of &euro;47 million over and above the budget provision and &euro;22 million in funding transferred to the HSE Vote from the Vote of the Department of Health for the drugs programme.  The HSE is required to achieve savings measures of &euro;619 million next year to remain within the 2014 health expenditure ceiling.  The savings target has reduced from &euro;666 million announced in the budget to &euro;619 million as a consequence of the additional &euro;47 million in funding allocated to the HSE Vote in the Revised Estimates Volume.</p><p> I have agreement at Government level that the medical card probity savings target this year will be &euro;23 million, not &euro;133 million previously pencilled in for this measure.  That &euro;133 million comprised &euro;20 million already identified for probity measures and a further target of &euro;113 million included in the budgetary arithmetic.  It is now accepted, as a result of the objective verification process carried out on this &euro;113 million probity target at my request since budget day, that this figure did not sufficiently take into account the extent to which medical card centralisation and already implemented probity measures in the past few years had already achieved much of what could be achieved in that regard, given, in particular, the Government&rsquo;s affirmation that no changes whatsoever were to be made to general medical card eligibility criteria.  The Government has made it very clear that there will be no change to the current guidelines for general medical cards and is committed to ensuring those entitled to a medical card receive and retain one.</p><p> The medical card scheme is demand-led.  We have to ensure those entitled to medical cards continue to hold them.  At the same time, we have an obligation, under the legislation, to ensure those whose situation has improved and, therefore, are not entitled to a medical card are not incurring a cost to the health service.  I am aware that there has been public concern that, under the probity measures, medical cards may be indiscriminately withdrawn or cancelled.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is important to note that no person who meets the eligibility conditions for a medical card will be affected by this measure.  To this end, the service plan provides &euro;35 million to meet the cost of new applications for medical and general practitioner visit cards in 2014.</p><p> The implementation of the Haddington Road agreement, commenced on 1 July 2013, is now well advanced in most sectors and already delivering on its objectives.  The Government is satisfied that the measures negotiated across all sectors, including the health sector, will deliver the targeted savings of &euro;1 billion over the lifetime of the agreement.  The agreement involves a demanding set of targets for the health service which accounts for approximately one third of the overall public service workforce.  Naturally, the resultant savings to be realised in that sector form a significant part of the overall &euro;1 billion target.</p><p> Throughout the talks process which resulted in the Haddington Road agreement senior officials from my Department and the HSE played a key role in supporting the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the negotiations at both central and sectoral level in agreeing the finalised planned measures for the health sector.  They have continued to work closely with officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since the agreement came into force.  The realisation of these savings in the health sector will, of course, be challenging and the focus and responsibility of management are on the delivery of these savings through the implementation of the various measures and other flexibilities for which the agreement provides.  A HSE national assurance and support team is working with managers to ensure measures to deliver the necessary savings are implemented.</p><p> The amount of &euro;108 million is an integral part of the overall savings target for the health sector.  The &euro;108 million pay-related savings target will be subject to a separate process andl, of necessity, remain unspecified and be held centrally by HSE management until a procedure is in place setting out how these savings are to be achieved.  These measures are to be determined with the assistance and support of the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is no question of health employees being required to take additional payroll reductions other than those required under the Haddington Road agreement.</p><p> There are significant service developments included in the 2014 service plan.  In line with the programme for Government commitment to universal health insurance, a GP service, without fees at the point of use, will be provided for the estimated 240,000 children aged five years and under in 2014.  Additional funding of &euro;37 million was provided in the budget to meet the cost of this measure.  In addition, &euro;20 million has been earmarked this year to meet programme for Government commitments for mental health services.  This funding will allow for continued strengthening of community teams, increased suicide prevention resources and clinical programme development and implementation and support an additional 250 to 280 posts.  These posts are in addition to the approximately 900 posts approved to date under the programme for Government commitment to mental health service development.</p><p> The 2014 HSE service plan includes an additional &euro;178 million for vital service developments, including the &euro;35 million for additional medical cards to which I have referred and &euro;30 million in acute service areas across emergency department, inpatient, day care and outpatient services which continue to experience increased service demand.  Other priority service areas addressed in the plan at my specific request include the continued roll-out of diabetic retinopathy screening and treatment, involving additional funding of &euro;4.5 million in 2014; funding to provide a service to undertake bilateral cochlear implants, with a particular focus on five-six year olds in 2014, involving additional funding of &euro;3.2 million in 2014; in the area of disability, there is additional funding of &euro;10 million for young people with a disability leaving school or training and needing emergency and residential placements; there will be additional organ donation and transplantation resources of &euro;2.92 million in 2014 to benefit patients and their families; and funding of &euro;1.2 million in 2014 to allow discharge from hospital and provide required care in the community for special care children who have had to undergo tracheotomies to allow such children to grow up at home, not in hospital.  On the point of funding for young people with a disability leaving school, everyone agrees that the parents of such children leaving school should not face a summer of uncertainty as to whether their children would have a placement.  This funding will alleviate the concerns of these parents.</p><p> On publication of the service plan on Wednesday, 18 December 2013, I welcomed the support of my colleagues in the Government in dealing with some of the concerns that arose following budget day.  These concerns were addressed by way of the additional &euro;47 million in health funding provided by the Government in the Revised Estimates Volume, the reduced medical card probity target of &euro;23 million, also agreed to by the Government, and the further process, now in place, in regard to the &euro;108 million in pay-related savings.  The HSE has confirmed that its primary focus throughout the year will be to continue to deliver the same level of front-line services with a reduced budget, while ensuring quality and safety is paramount.</p> <p>In the context of a reduced overall budget, the director general has also highlighted that the Haddington Road agreement provides an important mechanism by which the service plan can be delivered, and I fully endorse these comments.</p><p> I would like to conclude by again expressing my deep appreciation for the hard work and commitment of staff across the health and social care services.  Given the reduced human and financial resources available over recent years, the achievement of the health service in terms of maintaining quality services and implementing reform during these most difficult of times is deserving of the highest praise.  I am confident we can continue to build on these achievements throughout 2014.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.610" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400005#D00300"><p>Good evening, Chairman.  I would like to add my own seasonal good wishes to everyone present.  The national service plan was formally submitted to the Minister for Health on 25 November 2013, in line with the provisions of the Health Act 2004, and is the first annual plan presented by the directorate of the health service following the enactment of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013.  The service plan is also the first since the publication of the report of the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust public inquiry, known as the Francis report, in February 2013, the findings of which highlighted in the starkest of ways the need for a renewed collective commitment to providing the highest quality care in the safest of health care environments.  The Keogh report which followed again identified poor standards of patient care in a further 14 hospital trusts and set out the help and support required to assist health care providers in accelerating improvements in the quality of care provided while also tackling the causes of poor care.  Similar findings and recommendations were echoed in the investigations by the HSE and Health Information and Quality Authority into the safety, quality and standards of services provided to patients after the death of Ms Savita Halappanavar at Galway University Hospital.</p><p>  The service plan for 2014 sets out the type and volume of services, as required under legislation, which will be delivered within the funding provided by the Government.  At the heart of the service plan is the commitment to the delivery of safe, high-quality health and personal social care to patients and clients and the reform of our services.  The gross current voted Estimate for the health service in 2014, including children and families, is &euro;13.12 billion.  The reduction in the health service budget between 2008 and 2013 amounted to &euro;3.3 billion, and when coupled with reductions in 2014 the total budget reduction over six years amounts to almost &euro;4 billion.  In its initial assessment of health service requirements for 2014, the HSE approved a formal submission to the Department of Health reflecting the need to sustain safe services at the current levels, while at the same time responding to known pressures, demographic requirements, critical service priorities, programme for Government commitments and service developments and quality initiatives.</p><p>  There is an underlying projected deficit of &euro;419 million, including full-year costs for 2013 developments, coupled with a reduction to our funding base and additional savings targets of &euro;619 million.  This means the health service is facing a significant financial challenge in 2014.  This challenge comes at a time when the demand for health services is increasing every year, which in turn is driving up costs.  Managing ill health resulting from an ageing population and an increase in chronic conditions is a major driver of health care costs.  Future projected increases in chronic disease are largely attributable to behavioural factors that the Minister has already listed in his opening remarks.</p><p>  In 2013 the Government published Healthy Ireland, a cross-government framework for improved health and well-being.  A 2014 service plan priority will be development of a three-year health service implementation plan for Healthy Ireland, and this will be led by the new health and well-being division, whose director is Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, who is with us today.  During the course of this service plan, it will not be possible to meet fully all of the growing demands being placed on the health services.  In particular, some service priorities and demographic pressures may not be met.  However, the budget management approach outlined below has allowed the health service to invest in a number of significant and critical service priority areas in 2014, while at the same time ensuring that the health service maintains patient safety and improves the quality of services, protects core services, and drives the delivery of the reform programme.</p><p>  Quality and safety will continue to be a system-wide priority for the health services in 2014, and this is threaded throughout the national service plan.  The key message is that patient safety is paramount.  All health service staff, individually and collectively, have a responsibility for the quality of the services they deliver to the patients and service users in their care and must ensure that maintaining quality and safety is core to their work and practice.  A number of key quality and patient safety initiatives will continue in 2014, including improving patient experience, preventing health-care-associated infections, further implementing national early warning score systems, and improving medication management.</p><p>  Our approach to the reduction in the gross Estimate of &euro;272 million, or 2%, includes the following.  Additional savings of &euro;619 million will be made, of which &euro;108 million pay savings remain unspecified and will be held centrally pending a separate verification process.  A further &euro;80 million in savings relating to the Haddington Road agreement will also be held centrally in the first instance pending an assessment of the most appropriate allocation of the savings across each service location.  This exercise is currently under way.  There is also a projected incoming deficit of &euro;419 million, which includes the full-year costs for 2013 service developments.</p><p>  In developing the service plan for 2014, a multifaceted approach to budget management was adopted in order to protect core services.  It is important to stress that the principal focus is to continue to deliver the same level of front-line services with a reduced budget, particularly in areas such as provision of home help hours, home care packages and disability services, while at the same time ensuring that quality and safety is not compromised in any way.</p><p>  The specific elements of this multifaceted approach to budget management include a reduction in the lump sum provision for pensions, which will be used to offset, in part, the incoming deficits from 2013; making use of savings which will accrue from the phased implementation of new developments during 2014; and additional savings targets of &euro;129 million in areas such as procurement at &euro;30 million, shared services at &euro;10 million, value for money initiatives at &euro;10 million, hospital reconfiguration at &euro;7.5 million, energy efficiency savings at &euro;15 million, and the full delivery of cost containment plans for hospitals, initiated in 2013, at &euro;56.5 million.  Specific actions in respect of the additional &euro;619 million savings target include pay and flexibility reductions totalling &euro;268 million, of which the Haddington Road agreement will facilitate up to &euro;140 million.  As mentioned previously, &euro;108 million of this relates to unspecified savings and will be held centrally pending a separate process.</p><p>  By adopting this approach, it will be possible to provide funding of &euro;304 million for a range of initiatives, of which &euro;178 million will be invested in a number of new critical service developments, initiatives to meet some demographic pressures and programme for Government<i></i>commitments.  A further &euro;126 million will be provided on a once-off basis to address the full-year cost of developments started in 2013, which will continue in 2014.  Full details of these new investments are set out in appendix 1 of the service plan and are included in the printed version of my statement.  I will not repeat the list that the Minister has already covered.  However, I would like to stress that the health service will provide home help and home care packages to approximately 56,000 recipients, maintaining the 2013 approved service levels.  The nursing home support scheme will continue to support more than 22,000 people in long-term residential care at a cost of &euro;939 million.  In shifting the emphasis of the model of care to home and community supports, we will maintain services to allow an additional 1,000 older people to continue to live in their own homes.  </p><p>  Health reform is also a critical priority for the health services in 2014, and a systems reform group has been established to oversee the governance and enable the management of change across the broad portfolio of reform projects being undertaken.  These reform projects include continued implementation of the national clinical programmes; phased implementation of the money-follows-the-patient approach to the funding of acute hospital services; transition to hospital trusts and community care organisations; the development of commissioning functions; the development of a three-year implementation plan for Healthy Ireland; the establishment on an administrative basis of the new patient safety agency; the establishment of the new Child and Family Agency on 1 January - I would like to take this opportunity to wish our colleagues well in that new agency - and the further roll-out and reform of shared services.</p> <p> In the area of human resources, since September 2007 the health service has reduced its workforce by 12,505 whole time equivalents, WTEs.  During 2014 a target of approximately 98,000 WTEs has been set for the health service workforce.  This challenge will require a focused approach to management of our staff resource while controlling payroll and related costs.  In this regard the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016, the Haddington Road agreement, is a key enabler to deliver this service plan and to health services reform, having regard for financial and human resources.</p><p> The national service plan is set out on the basis of the new service divisions, which are acute hospitals, primary care, social care, mental health and health and wellbeing, established in 2013.  Operational plans are currently in development for each of these divisions and will be published in due course.</p><p> In conclusion, it is acknowledged that the 2014 service plan has been formulated in the context of one of the most financially challenging years yet faced by the health service.  The implications of the combined budget reductions and additional savings targets mean that a specific financial management strategy is required in 2014 to ensure the impact of the budgetary challenge on service delivery is kept to a minimum.</p><p> During the course of this service plan, it will not be possible to fully meet all of the growing demands being placed on the health services.  In particular, some service priorities and demographic pressures may not be met.  However, the budget management approach outlined above has allowed the health service to invest in a number of significant and critical service priority areas in 2014.  Implementation of the health service reform programme is also key. </p><p> I wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge the health service employees' contribution and continued commitment to improving patient experience and outcomes, despite reduced budgets and staffing levels.  I conclude by reiterating that the health service is committed to safe quality care underpinned by clinical effectiveness.  To this end, the national service plan focuses on quality and safety, service reform and service delivery.  This concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

I wish everyone a happy new year.  I welcome the two opening statements.  It does not unearth anything earth-shattering in the context of the framework laid out for 2014 but shows it will be very challenging, as outlined by the director general.  It also shows a big hole in the Estimate in underpinning the service plan in funding.  We are talking about an underlying budget deficit of &euro;419 million, coupled with savings to be identified of &euro;619 million.  In previous statements, the director general has referred to &euro;1 billion as the overall adjustment required to live within the budget figures announced.  That was subsequently deleted but it does not get away from the fact that we are facing a budget reduction of &euro;1 billion.  I would like some clarity on why the &euro;1 billion figure mentioned in previous times has now been dropped, even though the only additional funding I can find is the &euro;47 million identified in the Revised Estimate.  The director general said previously that it will not be possible in 2014 to deliver the plan and now he says it will be very challenging.  I find it hard to believe that the sum of &euro;47 million moves it from being almost impossible to very challenging in the overall context of a &euro;13 billion budget.</p><p>  We were led to believe there was uproar at Cabinet when the first draft service plan was presented by the Minister for Health to the Cabinet.  The reason we were told or were led to believe was that Ministers had concerns about the wording of the foreword signed off by Mr. O'Brien, which stated <blockquote>It will not be possible in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands placed on the health services.  In particular, the level of investment required to meet many of the critical service priorities or respond to many of the demographic pressures identified.</blockquote>That was subsequently amended to read:<blockquote>It will be very challenging in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands being placed on the health services.  In particular, some service priorities and demographic pressures may not be met.</blockquote>Twice in Mr. O'Brien's presentation, he has gone for the original wording and I find it strange that it was taken out of the original wording even though Mr. O'Brien has twice mentioned the exact wording that was deleted after political discussion at the Cabinet table.  I find it strange and I wonder why it is the case.</p><p>  It is identified that there will be &euro;108 million of unspecified savings and that there will be an independent verifiable process to assess how the savings will be achieved.  How long will it take to identify where the savings will be realised and whether they can be achieved?  If they cannot be achieved, other areas must suffer to ensure we come in under the budget targeted in the HSE service plan.  When will the savings be identified and, if they cannot be identified, will it require a Supplementary Estimate?  Will funding that has been clearly identified in HSE service plan be withdrawn, as has happened in previous times in respect of disability and mental health?  These areas were targeted in previous times when the books would not balance.  It is important to get clarity on this point very quickly.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il welcomes the change in respect of the probity probe into medical cards.  It never ceases to amaze me that it could have been included in the original Estimate proposals because it did not make sense.  I do not believe there are so many medical cards in circulation that should not have been in circulation.  If that is the case, it is an indication of sloppy awarding of medical cards.  We welcome the rollback.  The Minister also referred to medical cards and how people are entitled to them.  No one disputes that everyone entitled to a medical card under the income guidelines set out in the 1970 Health Act will receive a medical card.  These people are legally entitled to them but the key area concerns discretionary medical cards.  By any adjudication, the number of medical cards and GP discretionary cards has decreased from 96,000 to 57,000 over the past three years.  There is a targeting of discretionary medical cards, even though we are consistently told it is not the case.  Most Deputies and every organisation I encounter say it is almost impossible for some people, who had previously been awarded discretionary medical cards, to get medical cards.  We must revisit this.</p><p>  The Minister talks about reform continuing apace.  I must question that in view of the fact that we are now facing into the fourth year of this Government.  The White Paper on universal health insurance has not been published and it is a key underpinning part of any potential further reform.  The Minister talked about setting up hospital trusts and how money follows the patient.  This is an important area and at this stage we should see what is a central plank of Government policy in terms of the reform of the health services and how they are funded.</p><p>  Consultant-led clinical care teams are a central plank in the delivery of health care.  Where there are consultant-led clinical care teams they work very effectively.  We must acknowledge that.  Anecdotally, I have heard of a number of incidents where it is more difficult to recruit consultants.  Is that the case?  Is it difficult to attract consultants to this country and difficult to retain consultants?  If so, why is this the case?  We all know we must increase the number of consultants in the health services to ensure we have delivery of care.</p><p>  Mental health is grossly underfunded.</p> <p>No matter what way we try to argue or spin this issue, or whether one Minister of State had to threaten to resign to get &euro;20 million included in the HSE service plan, the bottom line is that it is grossly underfunded.  A Vision for Change is effectively being used as a mechanism for closing services as opposed to enhancing them.  We must genuinely consider that issue.  If services are to be reduced in an area, the full recommendations of A Vision for Change should be implemented rather than the parts recommending the reduction in acute or community beds and other areas.  A Vision for Change should be fully rolled out rather than using it in a guise in order to close services.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. O'Brien's usage of the phraseology that was first submitted for consideration in a memorandum to the Cabinet indicating that &quot;it will not be possible to fully meet all of the growing demands being placed on the health services&quot;.  He has stated that twice in this evening's contribution, and it is the accurate and truthful position.  It is very unsatisfactory and unacceptable that the formulation was changed to a phrase such as &quot;very challenging in 2014 to fully meet all of the growing demands.&quot;  This change happened not because of an assessment by Mr. O'Brien but because of political choice, and the more sanitised version was released by the Minister and published in the 2014 service plan.  I expect the Minister to stand up for the health services and state very clearly to his Cabinet colleagues that &euro;690 million in cuts in 2014 is unsustainable.  I also expected of Mr. O'Brien that in the assessment he provided initially, he should have stood up to the Minister and insisted that the phraseology he employed in his informed position as director general should have stood.  I welcome his utilisation of that formula here this afternoon.</p><p>  There was a comment regarding the radio interview of 22 December, with Mr. O'Brien indicating that he was given no source for the proposed figure of &euro;113 million in probity cuts to medical cards, since changed to &euro;23 million in the service plan as presented.  The figure of &euro;113 million did not come from either the health department or the HSE.  That raises real and serious questions as to the methodology of determining budgeting for the health services and planning on a year-to-year basis.  I have repeatedly asked in the D&aacute;il and here where the figure of &euro;130 million in so-called medical card savings came from, so will somebody give the full, detailed and truthful answer?  I note from the Minister's contribution that this is &quot;pencilled in&quot;, but that is not acceptable.  We want to know from where that figure came, and nobody need take any solace from the fact that we are now considering a figure of &euro;23 million rather than &euro;113 million.  Many people who have depended on discretionary medical cards in particular have not retained their cards, and many others who would have hoped to receive their cards will not do so during the course of this year.</p><p>  In the context of &euro;4 billion having been taken from the health budget since 2008, with a further planned reduction in staffing, financial and human resources are being depleted.  Mr. O'Brien indicated in his closing remarks the impact of the loss of approximately 12,500 people within the Health Service Executive.  He did not indicate the projected cuts in 2014 and rather depended on the figure that might remain, but we will see a further 2,600 whole-time equivalents going in 2014.  That is what the service plan projects.  How can the health service, with all the financial cutbacks signalled, be able to carry out the level of service it currently gives, with patient safety in such high demand?  There has been affirmation from both voices heard this afternoon, saying that such safety is the principal and guiding goal at all times.  How can this be achieved if the Government continues to remove such a significant number of people from within the service?  It is not sustainable.</p><p>  I welcome the introduction of GP cards for children aged five and under but, unfortunately, we must consider the issue in the context of overall primary care cuts.  By my calculation, they could amount to something of the order of &euro;294 million.  When can we expect the roll-out of the GP entitlement to all children aged six and under in the course of 2014?  I note the Government is to take an additional &euro;43 million out of the pockets of medical card holders in increased prescription charges, but when that figure is compared to the anticipated savings of some &euro;50 million due to generic substitution and reference pricing, it puts into context just how pitiful the savings are with regard to generic substitution and reference pricing.  The real potential is not being realised at all.</p><p>  On that note, how do the Minister and the director general account for the failure of the HSE to move more quickly in setting reference pricing for medicines under the long-overdue legislation we passed last year?  I have only to reference the recent <i>Sunday Business Post</i> article which details the figures, indicating that a range of drugs placed on the interchangeable lists by the Irish Medicines Board have not yet had reference prices set by the HSE.  We are failing to realise what could be saved.  Will an answer be given to the question?  Do the witnesses accept that the entire process has been far too slow at a time when we need additional resourcing and funding?  We are not moving quickly enough to realise the real savings that can be brought about.  The money is to be taken from the pockets of medical card holders almost to an equivalence of what can be saved in this area, and that speaks volumes in my mind.</p><p>  I am also very concerned that the service plan states that no additional funding is being provided for new nursing home places in 2014.  That is a very worrying aspect, as there are already large waiting lists for places under the so-called Fair Deal scheme.  This plan spells misery for thousands of people, and it is not that any saving is being made.  There are approximately 600 people who may be holding beds inappropriately across our acute hospital network because they are unable to return home or access beds in the nursing home network.</p><p>  Within the very short time available to us it is impossible to cover all of the critical areas.  I wish to ask about the bilateral cochlear implants programme signalled for 2014, which I very much welcome.  Nevertheless, the sum falls far short of what might have been required to set in place a full bilateral cochlear implant programme, not only for those waiting but also for those who may now present.  Will there be a commitment to fully funding and rolling out that programme in 2015, and will the delegation confirm when the programme will be up and running in 2014?  What level of provision of implants will there be and what number of young people is hoped to be catered to in the course of the year?  Lastly, what is meant by &euro;108 in &quot;unspecified pay savings&quot;?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/960" speakername="S&eacute;amus Healy" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400007#F00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and his Department staff, as well as Mr. O'Brien and the HSE staff.  I compliment the HSE staff throughout the country who provide services, as well as related staff, services and communities funded through this budget.  They are under significant pressure and work above and beyond the call of duty on a daily if not hourly basis.</p> <p>It is important that we understand that.  We compliment the staff on the work they are doing under such pressure.  This is the third year in a row we have been presented with an unsustainable budget and service plan.  It is clear even at this early stage that additional funds will have to be made available later in the year, as happened last year and the previous year.  The figures Mr. O'Brien has given indicate a reduction of &euro;4 billion in funding from 2008 to 2014 and a reduction in staff numbers by 12,500.  That means staff on the ground are under huge pressure.  People find it difficult to be seen at outpatient clinics and to get into hospital.  For the first year in a few years we have had an increase in the trolley count in emergency departments.</p><p> I seek clarification from Mr. O&rsquo;Brien of the figures under discussion.  What is the total amount envisaged in savings or cuts?  It would appear from Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s submission that we are talking about more than &euro;1 billion in cuts.  I support the request by other speakers for an indication of what the sum of &euro;108 million relates to.  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien said a number of times in his submission that the health service would not be able to meet all the demands placed on it.  I would like him to elaborate on what he means.</p><p> The sum of &euro;56.5 million relates to cost containment plans for hospitals.  To what does the global figure relate?  Reference is also made to savings of &euro;7.5 million on hospital reconfiguration.  Could Mr. O&rsquo;Brien indicate to what that figure relates?  Some chairpersons have been appointed for hospital groupings and CEOs are in the process of being appointed.  Is there a timeline for the appointment of the boards?</p><p> Before Christmas I inquired about the cost of employing agency nurses and junior doctors.  I would like to know the figure relating to agencies that is part of the plan.  I am interested in hearing the cost of employing agency nurses and particularly junior doctors.  I have not yet received a reply to the request I made before Christmas.  I urge that there be a review of the central recruitment process because it has given rise to difficulties at local level right across the country.  There is scope for local recruitment of staff given the evident difficulty at central level.</p><p> Probity and medical cards have been dealt with by previous speakers.  There has been a change of policy with regard to the granting of discretionary medical cards.  I see it every day in my constituency office and hear about it every day from colleagues on all sides of the House.  There is no doubt that families who have held full medical cards for years are now losing their cards.  They have been targeted and their cards are being withdrawn as we speak.  That is happening on a daily basis.</p><p> In the course of his opening statement the Minister referred to medical card limits.  The limits for medical cards have not been increased since 1 January 2006.  They are now out of date.  Furthermore, there was a reduction in the limits last year.  Will the Minister reinstate the amount allocated for travel to work and home improvement loan entitlements for medical card holders?  The former is required in particular where there is no public transport or very little provision.  The withdrawal of the provision is most unfair.  I urge the Minister to reintroduce such entitlements.</p><p> I welcome the commitment to community-based services such as home help and services for those with disabilities.  I hope that what we see on paper will be evident on the ground in practice.  I concur with other speakers on what has been said about mental health.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of a change in the wording of the service plan following the Cabinet meeting.  First, I ask whether he takes as fact everything he reads in the newspapers.  Much of it is not fact.  What is factual is that the wording did change and the rationale behind the change was the fact that the Cabinet committee was able to agree a revised Estimate volume and additional money which allowed for a change in the wording.</p><p>  Another question Deputy Kelleher asked was how long it would take to identify where the &euro;108 million comes from.  I will invite Mr. O&rsquo;Brien to say a bit more about it but it is something that will require time to study.  It is within the Haddington Road agreement and must come from pay within that, but the mechanisms must be further evaluated.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher stated that the figure of 57,000 discretionary medical cards was a reduction compared to the previous number, but as we all know and as has been stated to the committee time and again, and elsewhere, there has been a huge increase in the number of full medical cards allocated.  We are at the highest number ever and we have allocated a further &euro;35 million this year for new medical cards.</p><p>  The Deputy inquired about the White Paper on universal health insurance.  I have it in draft form to a very high standard.  It requires some minor adjustments in terms of further discussion and it will be published in the coming weeks.</p><p>  Reference was also made to consultant-led clinical care.  It was the policy of Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s Government - one that I would not necessarily dispute - that there be more consultant-delivered care rather than consultant-led care.  The recruitment of consultants is no more difficult than it ever was.  There are always certain areas and specialties where it is difficult to attract consultants.</p><p>  Deputy Kelleher said mental health had been grossly underfunded.  The Government committed &euro;35 million last year and the previous year, and &euro;20 million has been committed this year with a commitment to deliver a further &euro;15 million next year in additional funding to mental health.  I will not take any lectures from Deputy Kelleher on how we fund mental health.</p></speech>

The figure provided was &euro;133 million.  A sum of &euro;20 million was provided for in the original Health Service Executive plan and a study conducted some time ago by PwC identified the possibility of making savings of between &euro;65 million and &euro;210 million.  We pointed out at the time that these estimates were highly speculative and indicative only.  The figure of &euro;113 million is somewhere close to the mid-point of the PwC estimate.  That is the answer to the Deputy's question. </p><p> I was asked when we could expect general practitioner care to be available for children aged under six years.  It will be available somewhere in the middle of this year.  Legislation is required, as is a new contract to reflect the new arrangements. </p><p> Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has stated virtually nothing has been done on the issue of reference pricing.  A substantial amount of work has been done on the issue and a considerable amount of money has been saved.  There are many considerations involved, including the role played by the Irish Medicines Board, Professor Michael Barry and others in achieving savings in the drugs bill.  Mr. O'Brien and Mr. Hennessy will be able to address the matter in a much more detailed manner.</p><p> The Deputy referred to extraordinary waiting times under the fair deal scheme.  The average waiting time is in the region of three weeks.  The reductions in funding for the scheme are being used to provide more places for additional home care initiatives.  This could result in upwards of 1,000 people being able to stay at home, rather than ending up in long-term care.  We are, therefore, exchanging 700 long-term care places for approximately 1,100 additional packages that will enable people to stay at home.  This approach makes financial sense and is much more sensible from the perspective of the client and system.  People do not want to go into long-term care before they need do so.  If we can introduce new and innovative methods to help and support them to stay at home, we should take that route.  </p><p> The Deputy referred to the Department making available funding for cochlear implants.  This was a priority of mine and several members of the joint committee.  I will ask Ms McGuinness to discuss the issue in detail. </p><p> I was asked also what was meant by the figure of &euro;108 million in unspecified savings.  I explained this matter, but Mr. O'Brien will discuss it in greater detail. </p><p>  I am not sure what Deputy S&eacute;amus Healy meant when he described the budget as unsustainable for a third year in a row.  In the past three years the number of people enduring long trolley waits has reduced by 34%.  While there is always a blip at this time of year, members should bear in mind that three years ago this month 569 patients were lying on trolleys on a given day.  Under the Government, the number of patients on trolleys has not come anywhere near that figure.  The current figure is in the mid-300 range and in the first ten days of this month has reduced by approximately 10%.  Ward Watch is a separate method of addressing additional spaces being taken up in hospitals.  As the Ward Watch figure was not available to us last year, it is not possible to compare figures using that measure.  One can, however, compare the number of patients on trolleys.  We count the number of patients on trolleys in a hospital, rather than in the emergency department only. </p><p> Deputy S&eacute;amus Healy asked about the figure of &euro;56 million for cost containment measures in hospitals.  The officials from the HSE will deal with that issue in more detail.  The Deputy also referred to savings of &euro;7.5 million that are to be achieved through hospital reconfiguration.  Obviously, savings can be made by having groups of hospitals working together in terms of how they organise their staff, etc.  </p><p> The appointment of the boards of the hospital groups is imminent.  I will leave the matter of agency costs to officials from the HSE.  Deputy S&eacute;amus Healy correctly pointed out that he had raised this issue before Christmas.</p><p> It is true that the income limits applying to medical cards have remained unchanged since 2006.  While one would have expected them to increase in 2007, 2008 and 2009, one would not have expected them to increase since, given the fall in inflation that has occurred.  I should point out again that the number of medical cards is at its highest ever level.  </p><p> I addressed the issue of mental health when I noted the additional funding and staff provided for this area which has been the Cinderella of the health service for many years.  The Government has sought to address this matter and destigmatise mental health problems.  For the first time, the new primary care centres have mental health facilities.  We aim to have patients removed from the old institutions and treated in the community and to have mental health issues dealt with in the same way as any other health issue is dealt with.  For this reason, a new psychiatric unit is being built in Beaumont Hospital to accommodate patients' needs and ensure they do not have to go to old institutions located at the end of peninsulas.  These institutions would have been located out of sight and out of mind on islands if the authorities had afforded such an approach in those days.  That it is the old way of addressing mental health issues.  All members will agree with A Vision for Change, the strategy the Government is supporting and funding.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.625" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400009#H00200"><p>I shall start by addressing the issue of the language used in the introduction to the service plan because much is being made of the issue.  It is important, therefore, that I put the matter into context.  </p><p>  Until the Cabinet meeting in the relevant week in December, the level of deficit risk associated with the numbers in the service plan was unacceptably high.  It derived from the &euro;113 million figure for probity measures, which I made clear was not deliverable, and the figure of &euro;108 million, in respect of which we do not yet know the method by which it will be deliverable.  There is, therefore, a figure of well over &euro;200 million in respect of risk.  If it had been necessary to publish the service plan with that level of risk, it would have brought with it almost an inevitability and certainly a strong danger of a precipitative mid-year financial crisis this year.  If there were to be such a crisis, the health service would be forced to take immediate corrective action, much as it has done in years past.  Recent history demonstrates that this would leave the health service with very little room for manoeuvre and would likely create the conditions in which the only measures that could be taken would be those that would have a direct adverse impact on the level, quality and quantum of care provided for the most vulnerable in society.  In that context, the version of the introduction prior to the relevant Cabinet decisions stated it would not be possible to meet "critical service priorities".  It did not refer to the possibility of meeting all of the demographic pressures.  The words that have changed are not, therefore, the words the Deputy believes were changed.  I deleted a reference to it not being possible to meet critical service priorities because I no longer believesd there was that level of risk in the light of the changes made.  Instead, the language members see in the service plan is consistent with what I have said previously and today at the committee.  This section of the service plan carries my signature and consequently reflects my opinion on the overall position of the service plan.  The words used previously in the plan were mine in the context of the risk there would have been without the key decisions made.  The words used in the current plan are mine in the context of the actual service plan.  I know there has been much reportage in one newspaper, but I share the Minister's view.  As we will see when we discuss the issue of reference pricing, there are distinct dangers in taking newspaper reports at face value. </p><p>  I ask Ms McGuinness to comment on the issue of cochlear implants, after which I will address the other issues raised.</p></speech>

The programme provides for two types of cochlear implant.  The first is simultaneous, whereby children will have two cochlear implants placed at the same time.  The second is sequential which will be provided for children who have one cochlear implant and would benefit from a second.  In that vein, we met the consultants involved in the delivery of the programme.  The figure provided is the maximum they will be able to spend this year.  The programme will commence in May, with 50 children set to benefit from simultaneous cochlear implants.  Under this element of the programme, 100 cochlear implants will be provided.  In addition, commencing in August, another 50 children will benefit from sequential cochlear implants.</p> <p>Commencing in August, another 50 children will benefit from sequential cochlear implants.  There are approximately 300 children on the list to be assessed for these implants.  It is the assessment of the consultants concerned that approximately 200 of these will progress, of whom 50 will commence on the programme from August onwards, with a further 150 to go forward for next year and the following years.  That is the position on the cochlear implants programme.  It will commence this year, with real progress starting in May.</p></speech>

I used that language very precisely and it referenced my understanding at that time of the likely underlying deficit - not the actual deficit in 2013 but the consequential deficit if all costs continued to run into 2014  - and the then figure of &euro;666 million, which was the abridged Estimates volume figure.  I have never said there were cuts of &euro;1 billion.  In order to avoid any misunderstanding, I left in the two figures, &euro;619 million, as it was then, and &euro;419 million, but I deleted the calculation  of &euro;1 billion because it was becoming apparent to me that it was consistently being reported as "cuts" of &euro;1 billion when it is not a cut but a swing.  I have described in the budget strategy how we deal with some of that.  There are not cuts of &euro;1 billion.  There is a swing of &euro;1 billion.  I used that language precisely but it has obviously not been universally understood.  Therefore, I stopped referencing that &euro;1 billion, but I left the two figures in.  I stand over those two figures and my broad assessment of the requirement for a swing at the last quarterly meeting is borne out by the residual &euro;619 million and &euro;419 million.  I hope that clarifies that matter.</p><p>  With regard to the question about some of the things that will not be done in this service plan that otherwise might have been done, I will give the committee some examples.  We would have liked to develop a national perinatal pathology service this year, at a cost of &euro;420,000, but we are not in a position to do that.  We would also have liked to go to phase two of our intermediate care service as part of the NAS, at an estimated cost of &euro;4.4 million, but will not be doing that this year.  The HSE would have liked to do more in the area of health and well-being initiatives, at an estimated cost of &euro;1.5 million, but will not do so.  We would also have liked to roll out an extension of BreastCheck, at a cost of another &euro;0.5 million, in this current year but that is not proceeding.  We also wanted to put considerable resources into revamping the dental treatment services scheme but we cannot do so this year.  There is a list of things such as those I have just mentioned which, while being important developments, are not ones that can be afforded within the envelope that is available to us this year.  Therefore, they stand as priorities that we will seek to address in the 2015 service plan.</p><p>  It is important to stress, as many have done, that the cumulative effect has a significant impact on the health service and those who work in it.  I thank the Chairman and Deputy Healy for their comments about the staff in our health services.  I know others share their views in that regard.  It is a key concern that during the course of this year we need to have a very robust process for identifying the needs of the health service if it is to meet the needs of our population.</p><p>  On the issue of reference pricing, I will ask my colleague Mr. Hennessy to take the committee through what is involved, because the report referred to is very far from accurate, despite the fact that some of this information was provided to the relevant publication but did not find its way into the report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.629" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Hennessy" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400010#J00300"><p>Reducing the cost of drugs and medicines is a major priority for us in this year's service plan for the obvious reason that it allows us to reduce our costs while not impacting directly on front-line service delivery to patients.  Quite a bit of work is already under way on this, led by Professor Michael Barry and Shaun Flanagan, our chief pharmacist.  The recent newspaper coverage of this issue suggests that we have not been using the legislation to reduce costs and that we have not been moving quickly enough on this issue.  The reality is that we have been moving as quickly as the Irish Medicines Board designates products as being interchangeable.</p><p>  To further clarify the situation, the legislation that was passed in the Oireachtas last year requires the HSE to consider each product and medicine according to a number of criteria, of which six are listed.  The HSE is further required to provide two blocks of 28 days, sequentially, for consultation and notification.  The Irish Medicines Board designates groups as interchangeable on a sequential pattern.  The first of those was atorvastatin, which was listed in September 2013, and we are now seeing the benefits of that in terms of reduced price.  Others have followed in subsequent months.  For example, four products of the ten listed were issued in mid-December 2013.  We act on each of those as soon as they become available.  We follow the consultation and notification due process procedures laid out in the legislation and the price reductions then follow sequentially.  Indeed, a number are now primed to fall due in the very near future.  Cost reductions obviously follow from that and the end result is very much on target in that we are going to realise &euro;50 million of savings for the taxpayer in 2014 through reference pricing.  Additional savings will be available to members of the public as prices fall in pharmacies.</p><p>  It is important to note that a balance must be struck in this process so that supply is maintained in the pharmacies.  That involves a process of continuous negotiation with the pharmaceutical industry and the suppliers.  I wish to acknowledge again the work of Professor Barry and Shaun Flanagan.  They are doing excellent work in this area and we look forward to briefing the committee during the course of 2014 on the progress being made.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.630" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="18:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400010#J00400"><p>On the sum of &euro;108 million and the issue of the critical changes, in order to step away from the figure of &euro;113 million, we had a supplementary provision of &euro;47 million.  Our original internally generated figure for probity of &euro;20 million moved to &euro;23 million, which leaves &euro;63 million unfunded as a result of the elimination of the &euro;113 million element of the probity measures.  In addition, we have &euro;408 million.  These are areas in respect of which there is an agreed process and it reduces the overall risk at the get-go from a health service perspective.  On the question of the sum of &euro;108 million, there will be no measures to support the &euro;108 million which are not provided for in the Haddington Road agreement.  The core Haddington Road target for this year, in terms of pay cuts, flexibility, additional hours and all of the other measures provided for under that agreement, is &euro;140 million.  What we are going to do is to seek to maximise the extent to which the flexibility provided by staff can be leveraged to reduce operating costs within the health system.  There will be no other measures imposed on staff in the health service that are not provided for in the voluntarily agreed Haddington Road agreement.  The process that we are going through will produce an outcome which will save some, all - or, conceivably, none - of that &euro;108 million.  We are optimistic that a good proportion of it can be produced.  At the end of that process we will have a position in which, as the Minister has outlined, we can revert through a process that involves other Departments examining the implications of that.  It is very important to stress - and I have sought to do so repeatedly - that we are not seeking from staff anything to which they are not already committed under the Haddington Road agreement.  The issue is whether the Haddington Road processes can produce savings that are greater than &euro;140 million, and the process we are going through will determine that.  I hope I have addressed all of the questions posed.</p></speech>

Like Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I hope it will continue and upscale in 2015 to meet all the demand because it is a set, limited group of children.</p><p>  This committee has had a series of hearings on end-of-life care.  It is laid out here in the service plan but we do not know what the budget will be because it is part of the acute services.  Will it be the same budget or the increased budget of 2013, &euro;72 million?  At the end of page 32 one of the indicators is the total number of children in the care of the children's outreach nursing services.  It says there is a new performance indicator for 2013 but surely we should know what the figure is.  Normally the indicator on 2013 figures is there, so maybe there is an error.</p><p>  In terms of mental health services, we are in ground-hog day.  In 2012, 2013 and now 2014 we are told the money is ring-fenced, yet we hear about the underspend and the demand for necessary services.  One could say it is great news that we have 156 new staff in 2013 but from March 2009 to the end of 2013 we have 932 fewer staff working in mental health services.  When will these new staff be allocated?  Since I have been a Senator I have sat here and heard recruitment will begin in the next quarter but we never seem to catch up.  The money is supposed to be ring-fenced.  Where will the new staff be allocated?  Will it be in CAMHS, adult mental health, old-age psychiatry or forensic psychiatry?  Nobody ever seems to be able to give these detailed figures, which makes it very difficult for me to see when and where these staff will be recruited in mental health.  We have 9,065 staff; A Vision for Change says we should have 12,240.  On dual diagnosis, is the HSE considering integrating some services, such as mental health and addiction services?  We see a cross-over.</p><p>  Can the HSE confirm that no deficit will be transferred over to the Child and Family Agency?  There seems to be a misunderstanding out there that as part of the budget, a deficit is transferred.</p></speech>

With an 8% increase in the population it is very important we maintain our front-line services and that the patients get the quality services they deserve.  I welcome the news that 420,000 children will benefit from the new GP card for the under-5s.  The Minister has stated it should come into operation in May.  How much will it cost to introduce medical cards for these 420,000 children?  I welcome the &euro;35 million being provided for 60,000 medical cards.  Does that mean an extra 60,000 medical cards will be issued in 2014?  More than 90% of the over-70s are covered by either a medical card or a GP card.  To qualify for that card, a single person is allowed to earn up to &euro;500 per week, and a couple &euro;900 per week.  I met many elderly people over Christmas and they are very concerned about their medical cards.  As the Minister stated earlier, with the number of over-65s increasing by one fifth, what is the long-term future of medical cards for the over-70s?</p><p>  Will any disability services suffer in 2014?  How many hours of personal assistance home support is being provided in 2014?  What will be the differences between 2013 and 2014?  Will respite services be reduced in 2014?  The nursing home support scheme, which supports more than 22,000 people in long-term residential care, will reduce the number of people supported in long-stay care by 700, but will support an additional 1,000 people to continue to live in their own homes.  How will this be done and supported?  The HSE provides home help and home care packages for 56,000 people at any one time.  In 2012 and 2013, 10.3 million home help hours were provided.  Will this change in 2014?  Are any new posts in mental health services coming on stream?  How many additional posts will be filled in 2014 with the additional &euro;20 million in funding?</p><p>  I welcome the bilateral cochlear implant decision.  I thank Ms McGuinness for her comprehensive report.  I am delighted to hear the two programmes will begin in May and August.  Obesity is a major issue in this and every other country.  I plead with the Minister and the director general of the HSE to help combat it.  This will benefit everybody in the future.</p></speech>

I am concerned about the fair deal issue and step-down facilities from the point of view that the number of people over 65 is increasing all the time.  We are talking about providing back-up support for an additional 1,000 people at home.  However, there is a problem with the number of people, particularly elderly people, being discharged from hospital and readmitted within a six-week time period.  There is no engagement between the nursing homes about providing step-down facilities.  Will that be considered during 2014?  There is a big difference between having someone in hospital and back in his or her own home.  A step-down facility is an intermediate place where they can get the level of support they need while allowing time for the proper management structure to be put in place for them at home.  Could that be clarified?</p><p>  This morning I read a letter in a newspaper that indicated that the entire health service had closed down over the last 12 months.  The performance indicators record 2.57 million attendances in outpatient departments in 2014.</p> <p>Outpatient attendance numbers for previous years are not in the report.  I know they cannot be provided today but it would be helpful if the committee had these figures to see the changes.</p><p> I notice the figure for medical cards for 2014 is 1.875 million.  I would like the figures for previous years because this seems to be stable, as no reduction is proposed for 2014, whereas the public perception is a little different.  It is important that we get this information, which is not contained in the analysis, out there.  It would be helpful if it was there.</p></speech>

We have had hearings with groups such as Happy New Ear with regard to bilateral cochlear implants and with Dr. Jim Egan on organ donation and transplantation in which they made pleas for money.  People listen to what is said at committee meetings and are delighted.  Both organisations contacted me over the Christmas holidays to say thank you.</p><p>  I am disappointed about BreastCheck but Mr. O'Brien stated that it would be a priority for next year.  For the 140,000 women who use the service every year, we would like to see it extended to the age of 65 from 69.  I would like this to be a definite priority.</p><p>  We had numerous hearings on palliative care before Christmas.  Last year the budget was &euro;72 million, but &euro;1.3 billion is spent in an unplanned way on end-of-life care.  Does the Minister have plans to co-ordinate this so the money is well spent?</p><p>  We have a major budget for obesity, but Dr. Sinead Murphy from Temple Street hospital came before the committee and told us there is no specific budget within this for childhood obesity.  I will reference something which everybody here might examine after the meeting.  An app is available through iTunes whereby nine year old girls can be helped by other children to go on a diet to make their bodies look better.  We must take this seriously.  If this is what is happening in social media it is unfair to children.  There is a massive budget for obesity and I ask the Minister to take some of it and target it specifically at childhood obesity.  Whatever courses work should be rolled out.</p></speech>

A substantial budget is directed at it but it is true that much additional money is spent on end-of-life care.  Most of us would like to see people being able to end their lives at home and, if not, at least in a hospice.  Mr. Ian Carter, the director of acute hospitals, has taken an interest in this and has plans to address it.  Mr. O'Brien will address this matter further.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien will discuss the issues the Senator raised with regard to children in care and mental health.  Many psychiatric nurses retire at the age of 55, as they are entitled to do.  This is younger than the average nurse retirement age, so more people have left the mental health services as a proportion of the number over all elements of the service.  We have been playing catch-up.  Through A Vision For Change there has been a need for a change in the type of person working in our health service.  We have much more need for allied health care professionals such as psychologists and counsellors as well as nurses.  We are moving away from the old model to the new model.  An element of change in this regard is happening also.</p><p>  The Senator asked whether child and family services will carry any deficit forward into the new agency.  They certainly will bring their proportion of it because otherwise other elements, such as disability and the HSE, would have to take it.  I do not mean Senator van Turnhout, but people have a tendency to ask for something to be ring-fenced.  This means twice as much must come from what is left, so a 2% drop overall becomes a 4%, 5% or 6% drop in certain areas because other areas do not have to take any of the load.  The Child and Family Agency is hugely important and is a big part of the commitment of the Government towards children.  We want to see it fare well but we are not in a position to take the entire deficit.  A proportional amount was left with the services and much was taken back by the HSE centrally.</p><p>  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the cost of the addition of children under six to the medical card scheme.  A total of 240,000 additional children will be covered as a consequence of this initiative, at a cost of &euro;37 million.  He also mentioned medical cards.  A total of 60,000 additional medical cards will be provided for.  The long-term future for the medical card for those aged over 70 is universal health insurance.  This is how it will be addressed, obviously not in this term of government but in the next, if we are re-elected by the people to carry through on the reforms on which we have made major progress and continue to do so.</p><p>  I do not believe there has been a change in the number of home help hours from 2013 to 2014.  I will ask Ms Laverne to address this question and that about respite services.  A number of committee members raised the issue of the Fair Deal scheme.  When people can see a large pot of money they tend to go for the resources.  The consequence is that many people have ended up in long-term care before they needed to be there and without full and proper assessment.  We are developing a single assessment tool which will be rolled out this year in 50% of cases and rolled out fully next year.  This has taken quite a long time to develop and we must train all of the people involved who will use it.  It is about transparency and fairness.  It has not been fair in the past.  In some parts of the country people went into long-term care long before they required it while in other parts people waited for long periods, long after they needed the care and should have had it.</p><p>  Several people raised the issue of obesity.  We take it very seriously and as part of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union we debated it during the ministerial meeting which I and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, chaired.  We have a special action group on obesity.  It is a preventable cause of chronic illness and death and there is no doubt that if we do not address it we may very well be the first generation to bury the generation behind us.  Consequent on the obesity epidemic will come a diabetes epidemic.  When I started as a doctor one never saw a type II diabetic under the age of 30, but now we regularly see teenagers with type II diabetes, which is appalling.  We need to address this.  Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe might say a few words on health and well-being.  This is a cross-Government initiative and does not only involve health.  It must also involve the Departments with responsibility for education, the environment, justice and finance, the latter with regard to VAT on certain products which are healthy, calorie-free or low in calories compared to others.  We are the first Government to put in place at principal officer level in the Departments of Health, Children and Youth Affairs and Education and Skills an individual responsible for co-ordinating services and preventing childhood obesity.</p> <p> Deputy Mitchell O'Connor mentioned organ transplants.  I am pleased that we can put more money into the project, particularly rapidly developing live transplants.  We all acknowledge that the procedure saves lives, leads to a better quality of life and saves a large amount of money. </p><p> Senator Colm Burke mentioned a step-down facility issue.  I discussed the improvement in the number of intermittent care facilities as late as yesterday with Members in the Department.  In the past an older, frail person would enter hospital suffering pneumonia that would be treated within 72 hours but unfortunately other problems would ensue.  Therefore, a person would have to remain in bed for a prolonged period and end up having to go into long-term care.  Had such that person received an aggressive programme of physiotherapy or occupational therapy from 48 hours onwards he or she may not have had to enter long-term care.  We are examining the matter and are thinking outside of the box.  We are considering some of the NAMA hotels which have <i>en suite</i>facilities, gymnasia, canteen facilities and, in some cases, swimming pools, as possible locations for a new type of intermittent care.  We are considering more cost-effective methods and better solutions for patients.  People want to retain their independence for as long as possible and, as a doctor and a politician, we should support that wish in every way we can.</p></speech>

However, I shall not go into detail here as it would not be appropriate.</p><p>  The Senator also asked for outpatient figures.  We are waiting for a tiny bit of work to be done on the figures which will be done during the course of the week and then I will provide him with the figures.  We are the first Government to collate the figures which amounted to 386,000 outpatients.  As I said at the time, it was not the figure that astounded me but the fact that many thousands of people had to wait longer than four years to see a consultant after a GP referral.  We said that we would try to get everybody seen within a year by the end of this year.  However, we only got the figures in March.  We said that we may not reach the target but would get as close to it as we could.  I am given to understand that the figures will be very positive news.  I do not have the figure at present so it would be wrong for me to discuss the matter.  </p><p>  We have already mentioned medical cards.  The Senator also sought the medical card figures for this year, last year and the year before.  We can get such information and will give it to the committee clerk who will forward it to members.

With regard to the 477 posts in the 2013 plan, 180 posts remain in process and the vast bulk of them will be filled fairly quickly.  Between 250 and 280 have been identified in the 2013 plan because the exact mix of posts will influence the numbers that can be afforded.  We will shortly publish the operational plans by division and they will have more details on the matter.</p><p>  Members were correct to say that staff shortages is one of the impacts that followed the various voluntary exit programmes implemented in the early days of the financial crisis.  It was voluntary in the sense that one could put one's hand up and avail of an incentivised early exit programme or a grace period exit.  Many staff who left were from the very areas that we are prioritising for development.  That is why the figures are what they are.  We are playing catch-up, to some extent, in some of the areas.  Unfortunately, there is no getting away from that fact that many of the staff were part of the more than 12,000 staff who left. </p><p>  I shall ask my colleague, Ms McGuinness, to comment on the performance indicator.  The palliative care budget will be centralised and led by a single national director, Mr. Ian Carter.  He will be the national director for acute care.  The choice was made because there is a need to move some palliative-type care out of acute settings and into appropriate palliative care settings.  Giving one person control of the two budgets is considered to be a positive move.  No budget will be at the same level in 2014 as it was at the opening point in 2013 due to the effects of the Haddington Road agreement and other equitable share-outs.  There has been no specific real cut to the palliative care budget and there is no intention to go in that direction.</p><p>  I shall ask Ms McGuinness to respond to Deputy Fitzpatrick's questions on home care but I shall respond to the questions on outpatients.  We have accelerated the pace of access for patients.  Nonetheless, it is our intention, probably, to reduce the overall level of attendance.  The change is due to a disproportionate number of repeat attendance versus first attendance.  The matter was sought to be addressed in the cancer space as far back as Professor Keane's time here when there was a never-ending cycle of repeat attendance and thus limited clinical value.  We want to see a greater proportion of first attendance being part of the access programme.  We do not want people pursued relentlessly with follow-up appointments that are beyond the point of clinical relevance. </p><p>  Deputy Mitchell O'Connor asked a question on BreastCheck.  As she may know, I was appointed director of BreastCheck at a certain point in my career and, with a heavy heart, it was left out of the service plan.  It is something that we will seek to include again as soon as it is practicable to do so, not least because it is a priority in the programme for Government.</p><p>  I ask my colleague, Dr. O'Keeffe, to comment on obesity which is a central part of the health and well-being agenda.  </p></speech>

I am pleased to be working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Health on developing a physical activity plan, examining what we are doing to increase physical activity, accelerating some of that work and injecting a scale and pace in the programme.</p><p>  The reform programme provides a real opportunity to examine the creation of these new divisions with a view to trying to imbed preventive care in the work of the health service and ensuring that every contact counts.  In that context, we will review community nursing services and dietetic services this year.  We will do so in order to see what kind of capability is available to address these issues, specifically for children but not just children.  One can see from the data published in the Growing Up in Ireland report that 26% of nine-year olds are overweight and-or obese and according to the new TILDA study, two out of three adults over the age of 50 show increasing levels of obesity.  </p><p>  As regards children, this year we will provide training to 2,000 GPs on the new ICGP weight management treatment algorithm.  We will also role out a new pilot scheme of school-based growth monitoring sites.  If the pilot scheme works then we will role it out nationally.  </p><p>  The work of the clinical strategy and programmes has provided a real opportunity to imbed preventive care and early detection into a range of clinical programmes comprising vascular diseases, COPD and asthma.  The initiative would have a real impact.</p><p>  Members may have noticed that the HSE has joined the Department of Health and <i>safe</i>food in a communications campaign to inform parents about the correct portion sizes for children.  The campaign will also focus on sleep, physical activity and the consumption of fizzy and sugar sweetened drinks.  A lot of information materials and online supports are available.  So far the campaign has proved successful in terms of recognition levels and demand for materials. </p><p>  There is a broad cross-sectoral element to the HSE's work, particularly through health promotion and improvement.  We work with sports partnerships, schools and a range of externally funded agencies to try to address physical activity, diet and nutrition across key target groups.  One can see that the health and well-being division's service plan lists a range of actions that aim to tighten our performance indicators so that we are in a better position to quantify activity and outcomes from initiatives.  The data is very important and will allow us to build a larger prevention budget over time.</p></speech>

We have not carried out such work previously.</p> <p>I confirm to Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick that 1.3 million personal assistant hours were provided in 2013 and the same number will be provided in 2014.  The number of home support hours provided for people with disabilities in 2013 was 2.4 million and the same number will be provided in 2014.  That is in addition to the &euro;14 million investment this year for disability services, &euro;10 million for emergency placements, residential care and school leavers and &euro;4 million for assessment of children under 18 years of age and autism services.  Fifty-six thousand hours will be provided for home help in 2014, the same volume as in 2013.  In addition, the &euro;10.3 million budget allocation for 2013 will remain at the same level for 2014.

I am not trying to be picky.  He talked about language when responding to other people about the known unknowns of the &euro;108 million and the &euro;80 million carryover from last year.  It was &euro;200 million that was unknown to him in the last plan that caused him to have anxieties about the risks associated with the plan, which were subsequently eased, allowing him to change the language in the new plan.  I see &euro;188 million in known unknowns here, which potentially puts this year's plan at risk.  I wish to ask a specific question about the two ring-fenced areas.  These are pay-related savings targets.  It is stated that they will not involve any additional payroll reductions outside of what is already in the Haddington Road agreement, aside from the &euro;140 million targeted for Haddington Road and agreed by everybody, and no new measures will be introduced that are not already in the Haddington Road agreement.  I am not sure I understand that.  I hope it does not sound as though I am thick.  A total of &euro;140 million is coming from Haddington Road, and another &euro;188 million is to come from Haddington Road also, but we do not know from where it will come.  Who is in charge of that verification process?  What is the scope of that verification process?  Mr. O'Brien indicated earlier that a verification process might result in the money's not being found.  If that is the case, what happens to that &euro;188 million at the end of this year?  Is it the case that we just do not hit the target and we come back looking for more money?</p><p>  With regard to the decrease in staff to 98,000 whole-time equivalents, how many people does that mean we will actively seek to make redundant this year?  What changes will need to be made to practices in order that overall hours are reduced?</p><p>  We have been talking about language.  I wish to ask a question because I am really curious about something.  In the opening paragraph of his statement, Mr. O'Brien mentioned the Mid-Staffordshire report, the Keogh report and the HIQA investigations into safety and clinical care at Galway University Hospital.  That makes me nervous.  Is is trying to say something else?  Is he trying to say it will be difficult to provide a patient-led service this year given the budget constraints?  He mentioned earlier that had the HSE gone ahead with the previous service plan he felt it would have caused immediate corrective actions to be sought during this fiscal year.  Is Mr. O'Brien 100% sure that the fear he had has been alleviated, or does he still see that as being in play this year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.669" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1147" speakername="John Crown" time="19:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400014#N00600"><p>I welcome the Minister, the director general, Mr. Tony O'Brien, and the team, and wish them a happy new year.  I know it will be a very challenging year for everybody working in the health service.</p><p>  I welcome the focus on safety but it is important to realise that there is a lot of talk about this.  I studied this formally when I studied health management and quality.  With regard to the quality metrics that are used, clearly, for those who are on the front line, what is measured is compliance, not true quality.  It is compliance with a predetermined standard.  To be fair, the predetermined standard can be set as high or as low as those who are designing the standard wish it to be.  I hate to personalise this, but in the Galway tragedy, for example, to me there is one key metric - which was mentioned, in truth, in the HIQA report - which is not irrelevant.  The part of Western Europe that has the smallest number of consultant obstetricians per head of population, no matter how much it complies with a predetermined guideline, is not going to be the safest place for obstetric care.  That part was the HSE west region.  It has the lowest number of consultant obstetricians per head of population of any part of western Europe and, to the best of my knowledge, the lowest of any part of the OECD, despite the fact that Ireland has one of the higher birth rates within the OCED.</p><p>  Safety is very important.  I have been at the cutting edge of all kinds of safety issues over a long career in medicine and in college, and I utterly understand the tragedies that can occur.  However, safety is not only a matter of errors of commission; it also involves errors of omission.  People who are on waiting lists - who are waiting to come into the system but who have not engaged with the system - will not appear in the safety metrics, but they are ones who, I believe, suffer the greatest level of departures from true safety in the Irish health system.</p><p>  On an allied issue - I am sorry if I sound pernickety about this, and I do welcome any reduction in waiting lists - it is not really obvious when looking at hospitals that the waiting lists are shrinking that fast, although I hope they are.  I would like some reassurance about the internal HSE documents we got our hands on during the year - which, interestingly, contained whole bits of boilerplate lifted from an NHS document.  They suggested that a new strategy was being used for measuring when waiting lists began in the outpatient component of the HSE services.  It was stated that referral letters would be sent to clinics on behalf of patients, at which time they would be told that they would be contacted when there was a slot for them.  At that stage patients go on the waiting list.  I will be glad to make the document available to the Minister.  One may not actually be on the waiting list for some months after one's GP has received the letter, which will have the effect of cosmetically appearing to abbreviate waiting lists which are, in fact, not shortening at all.</p><p>  The question of health service reform, the money-follows-the-patient model, etc., do not represent this year's budget plus reform. This year's budget is having the trouble it is having because the system needs reforming.  The system is full of perverse incentives and inefficient use of health care resources because of the way the system is funded and because of the silo-like nature of the different responsibilities.  I have to be very careful how I say this because I do not want to get anybody into any sort of difficulty, but I can tell the committee that lots of patients in the public hospital system are put through very inefficient processes to obtain a test because it is realised that the outpatient wait for the test is so long as to be meaningless for the clinical history of their illness.</p><p>  I wish to ask two very pointed questions.  I notice that the projections for service numbers in the acute services are 2,000 down on those for 2013.  Can I get the firm assurance of the Minister, the director general and their colleagues that these will come predominantly from administrative functions and not from front-line services?  Can we get a commitment that we will end all public relations, all management consultancy contracts, all corporate affairs offices within the HSE until such time as the acute front-line needs of patients are being met?  At that time we will be able to afford the luxury of public relations contracts, which, to be honest, do not exist to foster public relations but exist in a client-attorney relationship to advance the reputations of those who pay them.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that we are facing into a very difficult year for those who use the system and those who work within it.  I join my colleagues in acknowledging the tremendous work carried out in primary care and in acute sectors throughout the country.  There are some positives and it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge that.  We had extensive hearings on organ donation.  Those services stagnated for a number of years and were limited in the kinds of life-changing operation that could be carried out.  There are many people who are thankful for the increased funding that has been provided at a very difficult time.  That is welcome.</p><p>  I wish to focus on a report carried out about two years ago, whose name eludes me - I apologise for that - on the internal financial and auditing systems that were not in place within the HSE.  At that time it identified that those working in a financial capacity within the HSE often had no financial or accounting qualifications.  What is the position now in regard to upskilling those people?</p> <p>Have we recruited people with the correct skills base to do this?</p><p> I note in the report that &euro;40 million has been allocated for ICT investment across the HSE.  It promises to deliver quite a lot.  I would like to know a little more about this.  There are but a couple of lines devoted to this in the relevant report.  The HSE hopes to implement recommendations on approved hospital clinical systems, the national patient administrative system in the south-east and mid-west regions, the development of a medical laboratory information system on hospital sites and the development of corporate systems, including the health insurance claims management system, a matter I have raised time and again.  Also referred to is a single integrated financial system, about which I am particularly concerned.  Am I right in saying the majority of the deficit pertains to acute services?</p></speech>

Despite this, we want to try to reduce delayed discharges from acute services by 10% this year.  How will we meet the target of a mere 10% if we do not have a financial system that allows the primary care and mental health services to spend their budgets to prevent the acute services from continually seeking more?  If we do not allow this expenditure, we will never be able to meet our targets in regard to delayed discharges.</p><p>  Everybody, including the Minister, has said the cost of treating patients at home or in their community is less, by multiples, than the cost of treatment in an acute setting.  I acknowledge it is not always straightforward, but if acute services are to continue to hoover up money, if inefficiency is rewarded time and again and if those who are efficient and meeting their targets are being punished, we will never be able to implement the reform that is so badly needed throughout the HSE and health care provision platform.</p></speech>

With regard to access to assessments for young children with behavioural conditions such as autism or paranoia, waiting times are consistently in breach of those stipulated in the Disability Act.  They can be from two to eight months.  Is there a budgetary provision to address the waiting lists?  In the mental health budget is there a provision to tackle the shortage of child psychiatrists?  I know of cases where young children presenting with suicidal tendencies or who have attempted suicide are being seen only by social workers because there are no psychiatrists available.</p></speech>

We must examine the model of care in this regard and whether pressure could be relieved in the delivery of babies of young mothers in hospitals if we looked outside the box a little more and supported midwife-led and delivered services.</p><p>  Nobody present could possibly suggest the tragedy that occurred in Galway could be excused on the basis of staffing levels; there is no question about this.  A basic point with which I am sure Senator John Crown will concur is that if a doctor orders a test, he or she does so because it will alter his or her management of the patient.  One's first duty of care must be to get the result of the test to see whether it will alter the management of the patient.  I do not want to get into specifics in that regard.  There have been three reports on the tragedy and, at this time of the year, our thoughts should be with Savita&rsquo;s husband and family.</p><p>  Let us consider the issue of patients awaiting access to outpatient services.  I will certainly examine the contention that letters are left in limbo until there is a response given and that there is manipulation which would not be acceptable to me.  I am not interested in perception but in reality.  That is why we counted the number on the outpatients waiting list which no other Government wanted to touch.  We want to address this issue in a realistic way and support those who work in the health service to do so.  That is what is being done.  It is on the basis of the same principle that we have used in providing inpatient treatment.  Once the cancer and urgent cases have been dealt with, people who wait the longest should be seen first.  Doing so is equitable and fair.</p><p>  I believe Deputy Ciara Conway was alluding to the Ogden report, which we commissioned.</p></speech>

We now have in place Mr. Thomas Byrne, the chief financial officer.  Within his remit, he has a complete reform board for financial reform within the HSE.  We know there are 11 systems from the old health boards.  Equally, we know there are literally hundreds of IT systems throughout the health service.  Somebody mentioned a figure of 1,700 and some of the systems are not able to talk to one another.  New ones are being developed and there are problems with their ability to deal with what needs to be put in place.  I will allow Mr. Byrne to talk about that issue in a more complete fashion.</p><p>  There is a sense among certain people that acute services drain all of the resources from everywhere else.  That is not absolutely true by any means.  The two areas with the greatest deficit - in nearly equal amounts &ndash; are demand-led and one concerns acute hospitals.  If somebody presents who is acutely ill, it is not like the airline industry in that we cannot refuse to take off because the aeroplane is not safe; we have to look after the person or he or she will die.  Equally, the PCRS is often in serious deficit because it is also demand-led.  If people are entitled to and need a medical card, they must have it.  There is no doubt that further efficiencies can and will be achieved, but they take time.  Much of the low-hanging fruit has gone.  I refer to the new ways of delivering care, the new models of care and the areas I have addressed before at the committee, including the questions of why we have nine nurses per health care assistant in some model four university-type hospitals and 2.8 nurses per health care assistant in others and why we have 2.5 health care assistants per nurse in some community nursing home units, while we can only manage a ratio of 1:1 in others.  There has been a difficulty in achieving best practice across the system.  We are now achieving this through the special delivery unit in the HSE and particularly through the clinical programmes which have carried out extraordinary work in many places.  An example is the care of stroke sufferers.  The survival rate from stroke has shot up as a consequence of the clinical programmes.  The same applies to the programmes dealing with congestive heart failure and frail elderly persons.  More needs to be done and, as I mentioned, the single assessment tool must be borne in mind.</p><p>  Deputy Sandra McLellan asked what would occur if the target of &euro;108 million was not achieved.  I will allow Mr. O'Brien to address that issue, but in my view the answer is very simple.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Health, with the HSE, are examining how the target may be achieved.  If it transpires that it is not achievable, it will become a matter for the Government to revisit.  That is the straight, simple fact of the matter.</p><p>  With regard to children, there is a new model of assessment and intervention in making progress on disability services for children and young people.  Some &euro;4 million has been put aside for that purpose and 80 whole-time equivalents.  The area of children's mental health services is a source of grave concern.  Historically, it tended to fall between stools.  In north Dublin, for instance, there was a considerable deficit in the services to provide for those between the ages of 16 and 18 years when the legal age of a child was raised from 16 to 18 years.  A question arose as to where those in this category belonged in terms of the provision of services.</p> <p>All those issues are being ironed out.  There is still much work to be done but I believe we have come a long way.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien would address specifically Deputy Regina Doherty's questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400016#P00200"><p>With regard to the &euro;108 million and the &euro;63 million, the &euro;63 million is derived from a transfer of &euro;63 million from our original pension provision in order to offset the gap between the Supplementary Estimate and the original target for medical card probity.  The &euro;108 million relates to the unspecified payroll savings.  I will ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to come in on this and when we get to patient safety, I will ask Mr. Crowley to say a word, if that is all right.</p><p>  If the &euro;108 million saving is not achievable, it will not be capable to state that it is a failure of the Haddington Road agreement.  The Haddington Road agreement has a certain design specification.  It produces certain savings for us.  For those earning in excess of &euro;65,000 per annum, it produces straightforward banded pay cuts, which are easy to achieve and easy to bank.  The other main savings come from flexibility, from extra hours which enable us to displace agency and overtime, and in services where there are no agency and overtime but the totality of the extra hours mean that there is more staff than needed, through the redeployment mechanisms available under the Haddington Road agreement and its predecessor, they enable us to reduce costs in other locations.  We believe &euro;140 million is within that design specification.  We have not allocated our &euro;80 million of that because of wanting to ensure that we allocate it to exactly the right places and do not ask some services to do what they cannot do and let others off the hook.</p><p>  In relation to the &euro;108 million, it is considered possible that the displacement of other cost in excess of &euro;140 million could be deliverable to contribute to the &euro;108 million.  That does not ask more of our staff but asks more of our managers in the way they use the flexibility and the extra hours to displace cost.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Barry O'Brien to talk about the verification process, but, as the Minister has outlined, we will within the next period be completing the evaluation process that Barry will describe.  If at the end of the evaluation process it is clear that some part of that &euro;108 million is not deliverable and if it is clear that the pension provision will be underfunded as a result of the move of &euro;63 million, there is a process available to us within Government to have those issues addressed.  There is no mandate to translate those issues into service cuts.  The Haddington Road agreement is not about service cuts.  It is about reducing the cost of services.  That is an important point I should make.  I will ask Barry to add something in terms of the process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.680" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry O'Brien" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400016#P00300"><p>The challenge for us in the HSE, both for the statutory and all of the funded agencies, is to maximise everything which we can under the Haddington Road agreement.  As the director general, DG, has said, there are some fixed savings which are completely predictable - how much it will save over the year for the pay cut over &euro;65,000, how much it will save by the adjustment downwards in the rate of overtime being paid, how much it will save by the absolute freeze on increments and how much it will save by the delayed payment of increments.  The real variable comes in the main in the totality of how one manages the additional hours.  If one takes, for example, that Government approved the recruitment outside of the employment ceiling of 1,000 graduate nurses and the recruitment of 1,000 support staff, those are additional to our existing cohort.  We currently employ approximately 99,930 staff.  We did not meet our employment control framework, ECF, target this year; we fell short by approximately 1,000.  Therefore, there was a balance to be struck between delivering safe services and maintaining services and how we manage the employment ceiling.  </p><p>  Deputy Regina Doherty asked if we would be making staff redundant.  There is an absolute guarantee that there will be no compulsory redundancies under the Haddington Road agreement on the proviso that staff give complete flexibility.  However, if one takes it, for example, that under the Haddington Road agreement there are approximate 5 million additional hours in the system, how will we manage that?  One needs to challenge the managers by asking they have done with their hours, whether they have redeployed and reassigned staff, changed rotas or come up with new ways of working.  I suppose one is asking the managers, before they even contemplate having any service reduction, whether they have maximised use of the Haddington Road agreement.  We are introducing immediately an assurance group which will introduce a standardised model to measure what is happening in each site as per the quantum of additional hours that was delivered under the Haddington Road agreement.  This is not what could be; this is what is signed up to.  To emphasise what the DG has stated, we will undertake that exercise.  We will work with managers to state in that instances they could have done something else.  For example, we had an incentivised career break earlier last year before the Haddington Road agreement was concluded for which we received 2,500 applicants; we were only able to facilitate 326 of those and we are now proposing to reopen that scheme.  Therefore, one could have an orderly facilitation of staff who wish to take an incentivised career break where one then achieves pay savings by replacing those staff with staff on additional hours and replacing the direct skill set.  All I am saying is that is the challenge now facing us and that is why there are no certainties until we get in there to see what is happening and maximise the enablers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400016#P01000"><p>The reason we have focused so heavily on patient safety in the opening section of the report is not because I have specific fears, as the committee would be concerned, but because at a time when the public discourse about the health service is always about the money, it is important that those leading it send a clear signal that the health service must be about patients and patient safety.  That is the primary reason it is there.  In addition, there has been in this part of the world - by which I include these islands - a significant period in terms of learning from adverse incidents, both in this jurisdiction and in the neighbouring jurisdiction, and we thought it was absolutely appropriate to put that front and centre in the opening paragraphs of the chapter.  We absolutely accept, in response to Senator Crown, that merely saying it does not do it but over time the debate about the health service, internally and externally, has been overly focused on money, deficits, etc.  That is heard by managers and staff up and down the country and they need to hear from ourselves, reflecting the message of the Minister, that the most important matter is the quality and safety of our services in all respects, including those who are struggling to access them at present.  If I may, I will ask Mr. Crowley to add to what I have said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.688" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Crowley" time="19:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400016#P01100"><p>I agree with Senator Crown in so far as one must set a series of targets.  Targets, as one will be aware, and as we have seen their impact on other jurisdictions, can lead to game-playing - somebody referred to a possible example of that this evening already - and can lead to tunnel vision.</p><p>  What is important about the service plan is, first, that it has a clear emphasis on quality and patient safety, not only when services go wrong.  It is about improving the quality of care and, really, in the end of the day, is measured by patient experience.  The committee will note in the appendix that there is an increasing number of measures of quality being assessed during the year.  We also will be working with the system to develop what we are calling a "quality profile", which is a set of validated measures of quality, but also incorporating matters such as what incidents have occurred in the setting for which one is responsible, what has one learned from them and what has one done about those incidents.  It will include validated measures of patient experience and, hopefully, with time, also staff experience because we believe that front-line staff have much to tell us about the quality of care that we provide.  We believe we should be listening to front-line staff more and that we would have a much higher quality service if we do that more effectively than we currently do.</p><p>  To reiterate the point about the Mid-Staffordshire report and the Keogh report that followed it, it is imperative that we learn from other jurisdictions.  We share our learning with other jurisdictions as well.  There are lessons from those reports for us.  I have brought that report on two occasions to the management team for us to reflect on those reports and to ensure that we put in place safeguards to ensure that such level of care does not happen in our system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-14a.689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="19:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014011400017#Q00100"><p>I emphasise there always is a danger, when one has someone who is identified as the director of quality and patient safety, that it could be perceived, either internally or externally, that it is that person.  If one looks at every divisional section of the service plan, quality and patient or client safety, as the case may be, are referenced and very clear.  Those national directors who are not present today will be at our quarterly meetings - there are too many to bring all at once - but they all accept a focus on patient safety as a fundamental part of their obligations.  It is not just saying it but doing it and making it a key part of every decision made, recognising that opportunities to improve arrive from time to time and that there are decisions which, if one goes the wrong way, will have an adverse impact on patient safety.</p><p>  To turn to the issue of the staff reduction, where we have a say, we will not be facilitating the exit of staff from front-line services, not least because we would need to replace them and would simply be increasing our costs were we to so do.  That said, there is a grace period exit programme envisaged in the Haddington Road agreement to August 2014 and we will have no control over who chooses to exit early to avail of enhanced or preserved pension entitlements.  We cannot control this, but where there are voluntary schemes, they will be voluntary on our side also.  Unlike in the past, while there will be no compulsion on a person to go, a person who volunteers to go will be faced with a manager who will be obliged to volunteer to let him or her go.  We will not be seeking to let people go where we need to replace them.  In the last year we did not achieve the targeted reduction.  In some instances, that was because we would not let people go because patient safety could have been compromised.  Consequently, in so far as there is a hierarchy, achieving a reduction in people is not at the top of it because it does not always make sense to so do.  We must make calls and take responsibility for them.  Notwithstanding the fact that we are required to balance a range of Government policies and priorities, we must and do make calls.</p><p>  I am deliberately taking the financial control space last because in some respects, it is part of the message we are trying to send.  I refer to the Ogden review and the follow-on report I commissioned on becoming the acting or deputy chief executive officer of the HSE, namely, the PA Consulting Group recommendation.  Moreover, the financial improvement programme approved by a board which I chaired and which included senior personnel from the HSE and the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Health is now available on the HSE's website.  It spells out in absolute detail the manner in which we intend to reshape the financial management model, that is, moving away from an excessive concentration on financial transaction processing to more of an added-value financial management process to ensure funds are properly tracked and used etc.  As the Minister stated, the appointment of the chief financial officer is part of that process and I will invite him to say a word.  I acknowledge that a specific question has been tabled in this regard for the quarterly meeting and the answers have been supplied in respect of the numbers of staff and so on.  However, we seek to reform fundamentally the way we approach financial management in the system.  We are, by agreement, developing a business case for a single common chart of accounts, supported by a single financial system, which will apply to the whole of the publicly provided health service.  This will, among other things, help us to address some of the issues being addressed by another committee of the Oireachtas because of the visibility it will give us.</p><p>  In respect of acute services, last year, in the 2013 plan, we carried out a significant rebalancing in respect of additional resources.  It is true that the overall cost of providing the acute system has come down considerably.  However, at a certain point in time we had reached a stage where the health service was guaranteed to be destabilised by financial overruns in acute services because, put simply, too much had been taken out too quickly, more than anywhere has ever successfully achieved.  It was creating a situation where, when I became the deputy chief executive officer of the HSE in August 2012, I was faced with a likely overrun, without significant corrective action, of &euro;500 million.  That led us in a highly negative direction in terms of some of the cuts that had to be made and it is to avoid precisely this, that these processes I have described around the figures of &euro;113 million, &euro;108 million and so on are so essential.  Without such processes, the level of risk attached to the service plan would have been sufficient that I would not have changed the introduction, to put it in a nut shell.</p></speech>

I mentioned previously that I was appointed to this role six months ago.  It is important to state, however, that although the Comptroller and Auditor General's report states annually that the systems in place are not fit for the purpose for which they are intended, at the same time there is a rigorous audit carried out every year and, touch wood, we have had a clean audit every year.  The issue arises from the number of finance staff, that is, approximately 60% of them, who spent their time working on systems that are not fit for purpose, not on front-line work or driving the business forward.  That is what we intend to address.  As for appointments, the question posed in that regard will be answered on Thursday.  I think we have provided the information.</p></speech>

Following a detailed review around the country of what I had found, while some people outside were suggesting I would be obliged to bring in people around me at the top to sort out the problem, I did not.  The people who are there are well able and more than capable of doing the job.  Consequently, the people we are bringing in are younger accountants at a level below to free up the expertise to work with me in helping to drive this.  These are the people with the expertise who can understand it and deliver it.  I acknowledge that it is tricky and in a forum such as this, it is always difficult to start talking about changing financial systems.  While we are preparing the business case for submission, with 30 years in the private sector and having worked on common operating models with BT also, I acknowledge that it is and will be difficult.  However, there is a simple solution - if one keeps it straightforward and simple - one truth, if we are all using the same common chart of accounts to deliver on information.  Much work has been done on this already, on which we can work and that is my main priority in this regard.  I believe that is sufficient on this issue.</p></speech>

We use consultants fairly judiciously, given the scope of activity with which the health service is charged, which is much broader than sometimes is understood by the term "health service".  It includes, for example, significant mass communications campaigns in the health and well-being space such as the one that is running.  I should pay tribute to Mr. Gerry Collins who has cancer and volunteered to assist us in that campaign.  We use professional communications expertise to help us to put together the most effective public communications programmes.  Similarly, we use PA Consulting Group in putting together the financial reform programmes.  We are judicious in their use, but we need to have recourse to them at times when it is appropriate to do so.</p></speech>

As for Mr. O'Brien's reply, I am not in any dispute with it, would welcome it and do not wish to see any of it achieved.  However, it is another figure which is contained in the service plan.  It is an intention that is part of the overall calculation.  I think "arithmetic" is a word the Minister has used previously.  Where does Mr. O'Brien expect these to occur since 2,600 WTE posts will be found?  In his view, is this achievable at all?  Is it desirable?  So much of the service plan is a wish list; there is no certainty and it states "this may" or "that might...".  Ultimately, the joint committee's concern is that patient safety be a central tenet at all times and that people be able to access critical services on the basis of need, which is not always the case.  I refer to Mr. O'Brien's own line in terms of the change in the service plan and which uniquely, of all the other sentences delivered in his opening statement, stands, namely, "During the course of this service plan, it will not be possible to fully meet all of the growing demands being placed on the health service."  This is something to which we all must face up and accept.</p> <p>Somehow, somewhere, the change must come.  These cuts are not sustainable.</p></speech>

The reason I may have looked puzzled when the Minister was replying to the question was that we sat in this room on 19 December with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and I specifically asked her to confirm the agency would not be burdened with a deficit from the start.  She said: "The 2014 allocation will have to do solely with 2014 expenditure and will not have to address a historic deficit."  How can we reconcile the two statements?  Will the Minister return on Thursday and explain whether there will be a deficit for the agency and, if so, how much?  Everybody knows a new agency faces additional start-up costs.  The agency is not being given a fighting chance and I would see it as a retrograde step if it is burdened with a deficit.</p></speech>

There is no carry forward of the services deficit from 2013 into the agency.  However, there is a carry forward in respect of the HSE component - its full budget from 2013, plus some additions we made, particularly in the area of legal costs, and the full budgets of the other component parts.  Whether there will be a deficit, however, depends entirely on how much money the agency spends in 2014.  However, to the extent that part of the HSE deficit in 2013 was made up of children and family services, none of that deficit from 2013 carries forward as a first charge on to 2014.</p></speech>

I would remind her of what I said earlier.  Leaving aside exits by virtue of retirement, including those that may be stimulated by the grace period under the Haddington Road agreement, which only concerns people paid in excess of &euro;65,000 and who are likely to have a pension in excess of &euro;32,000 who have a financial incentive to go by August - a relatively small slice of the organisation - where there are voluntary exit programmes, we will not permit front-line key staff who would have to be replaced to leave under those schemes.  Consequently, there is a significant risk that the 2,600 figure mentioned may not be achieved.  We also seek to employ significant additional staff in other areas.  Therefore, the net number required to leave to balance this is somewhat higher.</p><p>  I have said clearly that we will not seek to do or permit to be done things that have a direct, adverse consequence either on patient safety or which will increase our overall costs.  One of the reasons we felt it reasonable to take funds from the pension pot was because we do not see that number of staff leaving naturally through attrition.  I hope this is a reasonable answer to the question.</p></speech>

We will be back in another 48 hours and can answer any questions left unanswered then.  Hopefully, we will address Senator van Turnhout's concerns further then.</p><p>  Patient safety is the first and foremost concern in regard to all of this.  For a long time, I have talked about focusing on better outcomes for patients and on seeing more patients more quickly.  I would like to echo what the director general of the HSE has said.  In the past, we have heard the same refrain day in and day out.  I would have been part of that then.  We had too much talk and focus on how many doctors and nurses there were and on how much money and how many billion euro were being spent.  While more money would be welcome, if money alone was the solution, we would not be where we are now.  The question I must ask therefore is why, after more than quadrupling health expenditure by 2008 from the early 1990s, we faced such a crisis in 2009 in emergency departments that the then Minister, Mary Harney, wanted to have the situation treated as a national emergency.</p><p>  Money is not the key issue here, although it is important.  Reform is the key issue, reform of how we work, how we deliver services, how we interrelate and who does which job.  Too many silos have grown up and there are too many people who do not want to let go of what they are doing, despite the fact they complain they are overwhelmed with work.  There is also a lack of transparency.  The waiting list initiative, in terms of outpatients, is a classic and critical issue in terms of transparency and letting people see what we have and the situation with which we must deal.  </p><p>  I want to go further and will go further this year in regard to transparency.  The waiting times for each department and consultant will be made available, initially internally but ultimately publicly.  Morbidity and mortality rates will also be made available.  Patients have a right to know what kind of doctor they are attending and GPs have a right to know the kind of doctor to whom they are referring patients.  The empowered patient is a safe patient.  Why would a patient not have the right to know that a visit to doctor X will mean a six-month waiting list, but a visit to doctor Y would only involve a two-month wait, particularly when both are equally qualified consultants?  Let patients make that choice.</p><p>  This year, we will continue to bring in legislation that will continue necessary reforms.  We want to roll out the continuation of the "money follows the patient" model, to create purchase or provider lists, have functioning hospital groups and new integrated service areas, set up a new contract for GPs for children under six and present a White Paper on universal health insurance to allow a broad consultation with all interest groups to determine its precise shape.  No doubt, this committee will have a huge input into that.</p><p>  I will finish by thanking everybody who works in our health service, who have kept the service running and delivering care 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 52 weeks a year with fewer staff and money and in the face of increasing demand, as evidenced by an 8% growth in the population since 2006 and 20,000 more people over the age of 65 every year, which while great to see creates extra demand.  While the staff of the health service have been doing all of this, they have continued to reform the system to provide better outcomes for more patients.  I look forward to working with them and with this committee to continue these reforms over the next 12 months and to improve health services, which is our duty.</p></speech>
