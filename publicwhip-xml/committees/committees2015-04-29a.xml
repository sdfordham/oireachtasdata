I very much hope I will be of assistance to the committee today in its important work.</p> <p>  I joined AIB as head of investment banking early in 1991.  And subsequently, as I said, I served as managing director of AIB Capital Markets and then as managing director of the Poland division.  In October 2000 I was appointed group chief executive designate and I formally took over as group CEO in June 2001.  My successor was designated in March 2005 and I retired at the end of June 2005.  From the date of my retirement onwards, I had no further involvement in the management and board of AIB group.  As I was retiring ten years ago, I can honestly say that I had no premonition, let alone any evidence, that a liquidity and credit crisis was building internationally or that when that major crisis crystalised late in 2008, that AIB would be so vulnerable to it and ultimately would only survive through taxpayer support.  I deeply regret what happened and the damage it inflicted on the lives of so many.</p> <p>  There are two interlocking parts, Chairman, to the account I want to give of my time as CEO of AIB.  They are in my written witness statement.  I'm just summarising them here.  I'm going to start with the business strategy in general and as it applied to the Republic of Ireland in my time.  And second of all, I want to talk about risk and credit management.  First, the business strategy.  In 2001 the business environment was fraught.  It was in the wake of the dotcom crash, then 9/11 and we had the added challenge in Ireland of foot and mouth disease.  As a result, the strong period of growth that started in the second half of the 1990s slowed for, I think, about two years, but from early to mid-2003 the economy returned to its catch-up growth spurt.  There had been a 1 million person increase in the population between 1971 and 2001.  The labour force had increased by 400,000, or 32%, in the ten years up to 2001.  The number of people in employment had risen by about 400,000 also, or 49%, in the same ten-year period.  Such a rate of demographic growth and change hadn't been seen in the history of the State and the numbers continued to grow through the whole period of my time as CEO.  That meant the potential for many new customers and strong demand from that growing customer base across the whole range of financial products in a very low interest rate environment.  I think that context is very important.</p> <p>  In 2001, investors saw AIB as a federation of banking franchises with varying growth prospects but without any distinctive common thread to its brands.  They saw our main market, the Republic of Ireland, as dynamic but their view was that other banks operating here had more exciting growth prospects.  The strategy we set out in response to those factors, was to position ourselves to build one distinctive model of doing retailing and commercial banking that could be applied to each country in which we operated.  And that model was to focus on growing the total value of each good customer relationship based on having best products, best service and best people.</p><p>In our largest business here in Ireland we believed that we hadn't been fully exploiting our greatest strengths, those were that we had between 30% and 40% market share of all personal current accounts and all business working accounts but a much lower market share of most individual product categories.  So the strategy was to get better at responding to customer needs across the whole product spectrum.</p><p> I've mentioned the very strong demographics so building our relationships with good customers in the property and constructions sectors was a logical part of the strategy, but so too was building a stronger presence in the growing health insurance market and meeting the needs of our growing customer base in deposits, mortgages and investment products.  When I presented that strategy to the board in 2001, I said that if we were successful in executing it we could have an aspiration of doubling our profits over the next five years.  In some of the documents I've been given that aspirational outcome has been incorrectly represented as the strategy itself.  In fact, the medium-term forecast and annual budgets presented to the board throughout my period are focused somewhat more modestly on achieving double digit earnings growth overall on a consistent basis.  So doubling profits in a five-year period was never actually a budgeted target.</p><p> Property and construction lending grew strongly during my time, most of the material I have been sent about that looks at growth trends across the whole period of 2001 and 2009 in percentage terms.  That in my view is misleading because the starting base was actually quite low.  In money terms the entire group exposure to property and construction during my four years was about &euro;6 billion in mid-2001 and it grew to about &euro;19 billion, this is in euro, by mid-2005.  And within those overall totals the figures for the Republic of Ireland were that it grew from &euro;4 billion to &euro;11 billion.</p><p> I have no evidence that at that level we had materially outrun the demand arising from deposit and demographics nor did I have a view coming to me from my credit professionals that standards were slipping at the time.  On the contrary their view to me throughout and to the board was that credit quality was stable and strong.</p><p> In any business you're trying to keep a fairly wide range of shifting factors in good balance so towards the end of 2004, as a result of the fact that loan growth had been significantly outpacing deposit growth, I began to focus on the increasing loan-to-deposit ratio and on the proposal from myself and my management team, the board put in place at that stage targets, one for the simple loan-to-deposit ratio and the second for an adjusted loan-to-deposit ratio.  That was done to begin to slow down the rate of credit growth to a level closer to the growth rate for deposits and also to help ensure that internal capital generation was positive. </p><p> I'm going to turn now to my second main aim in the period mid-2001 to mid-2005; which was improving our risk management capability.  That was partly for strategic reasons, it was partly also because we had three massive regulatory projects to implement; Basel II, Sarbanes-Oxley and the new IFRS accounting standards, and, thirdly, because I had to deal with two major crisis management events during my time - the fraud in our Allfirst subsidiary in 2002 and the FX charging issues identified in Ireland in 2004.  Collectively, all of those factors required the single risk and finance support organisation to be built across AIB Group which had always been heavily divisionalised.  That was a huge five-year project as I saw it.  In the wake of the Allfirst fraud we commissioned separate independent reviews and reports on treasury operational risk, credit risk, policy frameworks across all of those things to get assurance that they were fit for purpose and we constructed a series of projects to implement the recommendations arising.  The general message in those reports was that within each division there were no major issues but that we needed to establish common standards across the whole group.</p><p> During 2002-03 we recruited an experienced chief risk officer, reporting directly to me, to build that single organisation.  We put in place a single group-wide treasury organisation.  We again recruited externally an experienced head of internal audit to build a group-wide capability and we enlarged the mandate and scope of the compliance function across the group.  We devoted massive resources both to the regulatory projects and to remediation programmes arising from Allfirst and from the FX charging issues in 2004.</p><p>Implementation was still going on when I retired, including a wide range of actions designed to change those aspects of culture and practice in the bank that were obstacles to colleagues at any level feeling free to raise any issues that concerned them. And that was a strong personal mission of mine.  I have a couple of final things to say, Chairman.  First of all,  turning to credit policies, delegated authorities and exception management, Deloitte had carried out a very detailed policy and process review, I think towards the end of 2002 if my recollection is right.  What they found was that there were &quot;well established processes, policy and delegated authorities based on skill and experience, that grading and monitoring systems accommodated early identification and management of deterioration of credit policy, that there was a system of credit review independent of business reporting lines and written policies pertinent to current business.&quot;  That's the end of the quote.  Their recommendations mainly had to do with ensuring consistency across all of our divisions.  The delegated authorities to divisional credit committees were relatively modest during my time.  They were increased somewhat towards the end of 2004, but not dramatically, and exceptions to large exposure policy were infrequent.  The month before I retired, in May 2005, Standard &amp;amp; Poor's raised our long-term credit rating to A+.  In their announcement, the agency said:<blockquote><br /><br />The rating on AIB reflects its leadership position in its main market, the Republic of Ireland, strong credit risk management, good underlying financial performance and sound liquidity.  They also reflect AIB's ongoing initiatives to improve its risk management procedures and control frameworks.</blockquote>That is the end of the quote.  Thank you Chairman.</p></speech>

At the outset,  I want to say I'm very sorry for what happened and my role in these events.  I know a lot of people were let down and feel very angry, deservedly so.  I draw no comfort from the extraneous factors that contributed to the crisis.  I take personal responsibility for my actions and omissions.  Public apologies on many occasions have not diminished the deep disappointment that I feel on a daily basis.  Chairman, in my written statement I have addressed the themes that the inquiry requested me to focus upon  including property risk concentrations, liquidity, business planning, remuneration, regulatory relationships, delegated authorities and the bank guarantee.  Conscious of time and that these themes will be covered during my evidence, and in light of evidence given to the committee last week, I will confine my verbal remarks to a summary of the evidence contained in my written statement concerning the bank guarantee.  I have been asked to make a statement on the appropriateness of the guarantee.  Though we did not make the decision, I will describe my role on the night and this role is described in detail in my contemporaneous notes, of which you have a copy.</p> <p>  Together with our counterparts from Bank of Ireland, we asked for a meeting with Government.  At that meeting, we requested a four bank guarantee, but not the blanket guarantee that was ultimately provided.  We were in Government Buildings for over six hours, our presence at the meeting was not continuous, and we were dismissed from the decision makers' room on four occasions.  At the first session we described what was happening in our business, and how our liquidity was being positioned.  That day had been a tumultuous one on global financial markets.  To stabilise the Irish banking market, we asked for a four bank guarantee.  This was not a new idea.  You will have copies of minutes of an AIB bank board meeting of the night before, in which I am quoted, "The authorities expect that two financial institutions will fail (unless white knights emerged) and would guarantee the obligations of the other institutions on a temporary basis", recorded in the AIB minutes the day before the guarantee.  We were dismissed from the room while our request for a guarantee was considered.</p> <p>   At the second session we attended, we were told that Anglo was about to default.  The Government wanted us to give Anglo a loan to get them through the week so that they could be decisively dealt with by the weekend.</p><p>We refused initially and were dismissed and were asked to reconsider our position.  Working over the phone with colleagues back in Bankcentre we mobilised resources and looked into every possibility to come up with a response that would meet the Government's needs.  At the third session, we said we would give Anglo &euro;5 billion until the weekend.  On notice at this stage that Anglo was about to default, we refused to go on risk for Anglo.  Our offer was conditional on a Government guarantee for this Anglo loan.  This solution appeared to be acceptable to the Government and we said we would start moving assets to have the funds ready by Wednesday morning, and that in itself was quite a complex and intricate business.</p><p> The meeting reverted to the four bank guarantee and its form.  We made suggestions regarding duration of the guarantee - we wanted a longer one than the one-year one proposed - and also on the merits of including bonds ... of which we were in favour of.  We were dismissed while a drafting process was undertaken and during this interval our input was sought on ... in bilateral sessions regarding treatment of subsidiaries, for instance, our Polish business, and on what basis would be ... what basis would be used to determine the price of the guarantee.  When we were called back for the fourth session, there was a short discussion about a solvency statement being issued with the guarantee.  We didn't think it was necessary and after discussion, the Government decided not to include that reference.  We returned to the room and at 3:30 a.m. we were told we were no longer needed.  When we saw the guarantee document for the first time the following morning, we could not understand why Anglo and Irish Nationwide were included.  All our discussions that night were based upon a premise that Anglo was to be taken down.  We did not think they would be part of the guarantee, in fact, we were at that time, in response to a Government request, risking our own liquidity to keep Anglo afloat until the following weekend.</p><p> From our perspective, a four institution guarantee was appropriate and necessary for a number of reasons.  Firstly, an Anglo default was absolutely certain to result in an immediate across-the-board agency downgrade for all Irish institutions and an immediate worldwide risk aversion for all Irish institutions.  Secondly, in Great Britain where we had high street branches and &euro;10 billion in retail deposits, we could expect an immediate run on our deposits.  Thirdly, given the Irish public's reaction to Northern Rock, a very minor player in this market, during their crisis in 2007, you could deduce from that it was certain that there would be panic on the streets and that our branches would not be able to cope.</p><p> In the absence of a statutory mechanism to deal with a failing bank, the options were to nationalise, liquidate or guarantee.  There was no contingency plan nationally to deal with Anglo or at EU level to deal with the crisis in general.  In the absence of alternatives, the default option was a four bank guarantee for the remaining four institutions, not the blanket guarantee ultimately given.  This, I believe, offered the best chance to cope with the fallout about to be triggered by the imminent liquidation or nationalisation of Anglo and Irish Nationwide.  The lessons from two weeks previously were fresh in everybody's mind.  Solutions that didn't convince the markets invited misfortune.  This was amply demonstrated when the US authorities allowed Lehman's to fail.  The decision did not restore market discipline and within days the US Government had to rescue many institutions - huge institutions - and introduce a &euro;700 billion TARP, the troubled asset relief programme.  These events contributed hugely to initiating the meltdown in global liquidity.</p><p> I wrote up my notes of the minutes ... my minutes of the meeting a couple of days afterwards and absent hindsight observations that ... I have made some in this statement ... they are a contemporaneous record of events on the night as I saw them.  Since I submitted my statement a month ago, I have been furnished with another record of events on the night from a Department of Finance source, which has been quoted at the committee.  Comments are attributed to me that I cannot remember making.  There was absolutely no evidence of any discussion of AIB's solvency on the night, in either my note or that of Dermot Gleeson's.  We were asked for an update on what was happening in our banks which we gave.  We were asked to provide funds to cover Anglo until the weekend which we agreed to provide.  We were asked about the form of guarantee.  We gave advice on duration and the instruments that could be included.</p><p>We gave advice on duration and the instruments that could be included.  We were asked for our views on Anglo and Irish Nationwide, we said they should be nationalised.  This fact is recorded in both my note and that of Dermot Gleeson.  This fact is further collaborated by the note from the Department and I quote "Minister asks FR, did they agree with AIB, Bank of Ireland, that two need to be nationalised first.  FR did not agree."</p><p>If I said the words attributed to me in the Department of Finance note, they could only have been in the context of what would have happened to the system if no remedial action was taken.  There was absolutely no issue about AIB solvency at that time.</p><p> Chairman, in conclusion I spent 38 years in AIB, operated at many levels and I knew the organisation very well.  I was proud of what the bank had achieved over the decades.  I always viewed my job when I became CEO as one of stewardship, responsibility to staff, customers, shareholders and the public in general.  It was my wish that in due course I would hand on the job to somebody else with the bank in good shape.  That I failed in that responsibility, for me is a matter of eternal regret and sorrow.</p><p> Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

I am sure other members will over the course of the morning return to some of the matters you raised about the guarantee, but as we are aware the guarantee was a response to a crisis, it wasn't the instigating factor of the crisis and that's what I would like to delve into now, if you don't mind.</p> <p>  Mr. Buckley, in your opening statement, can you confirm to the committee, that is what you're telling the committee, that you left AIB in a fundamentally sound position when you departed?</p></speech>

I fully agree with my colleague that in the middle of '05 the outlook and the condition of the bank was very positive and that continued, in my view, for a number ... a couple ... of years after that.  It was only when the market began to unravel, both internationally ... one way I look at it is, there was an international context, there was a national context, and there was an institution specific context.  And, all three of those dimensions changed for the worst in ... from the middle of late 2007 onwards.  There were reasons for it and I'll only address the institution specific ones.  Obviously, everybody is familiar with the context as you had in the Context Phase.</p> <p>  When the market turned negative we were ... we found ourselves overexposed in property in the Republic of Ireland and specifically certain types of property in the Republic of Ireland.  Our expectations as to how those assets would behave in a downturn didn't pan out.  The stress tests we relied upon, while there were one in 25 year stress tests weren't equipped for a one in a hundred year stress, and as a consequence post-2009 as the market continued to display very severe write-downs, the bank's capital position became compromised and it required support from the State.  Earlier of course, it had got support in relation to the guarantee, so that would be my explanation of how it came to be.</p></speech>

Welcome to Mr. Buckley and Mr. Sheehy.</p> <p>  Mr. Buckley, can I just ask a question of your time?  During your tenure, like a number of major control issues arose and you mentioned Rusnak, Faldor and the foreign exchange, the incorrect interest charges for offshore accounts.  How would you reconcile that with the governance standards that you would have outlined each year in the annual reports?</p></speech>

I mean ... so that's the first point I'll make.  When the Allfirst treasury fraud occurred over in Baltimore we immediately ... within I would say 36 hours of first hearing that there was an issue, I was on the radio first thing in the morning sizing it, and very quickly then we said we would bring in independent investigators, which we did, of the highest quality, to investigate it thoroughly, and we promised at the very beginning that we would publish all of the findings of those investigations.  So, first of all, I think that's a very important governance statement because we were making a promise to shareholders and to customers and to our own people that nothing would be brushed under the carpet, and that is a path that we followed two years afterwards when the FX charges issue came up.</p></speech>

I think there were some very important common threads between them.  The thing I would say is that a common thread between them is that, to take the FX charges and related things first of all, those issues, by and large, referred back to the 1980s up to the early 90s, and the subsequent investigations found that in most cases the particular issues that had been brought to the regulator's attention and, via the regulator, to our attention, had been dealt with, by and large, during the course of the 1990s so there was a large element of history about them.  To me, they were probably ... the FX charges was probably the most upsetting part personally to me of my time as CEO because it said that there was stuff going on there that, in terms of the values and principles that I would have had, that were contrary to those principles.  Now ... but we did tear up the floorboards.  I mean, I remember when the FX charges thing came up first, I was on television, and I said those very words.  I said, 'This information about that issue has gone to the regulator and what we are going to do is not only to investigate that as far as it goes but we will tear up the floorboards on every issue of charges that we know about and we'll try to find anything that we don't know about", and we made a promise to customers that we would remediate every case of customer detriment, which we did.  So that's ... I think that's the governance part of-----</p></speech>

So clearly people were not taking account of the investigations that were going on in the other areas.  So how do you finally account for that?  And you might also explain to me as well in terms of property lending, that during your tenure, post '04, so '04 and '05, you had an increase in property lending of 6% in '03.  You had 48% of an increase in '04, and you had 52% of an increase in '05, just before Mr. Sheehy took over.</p></speech>

So you might explain how we have these sequence of events whereby you had these various defrauding of customers happening and, at the same time, '04 and '05, you had this rapid explosion in property lending under your watch, Mr. Buckley.</p></speech>

I think there are several questions there, if you don't mind I'll answer them separately, is that okay, Chairman?  So first of all, if I take the Allfirst one, that wasn't a case of defrauding customers; it was a case of defrauding the bank.</p><p>There was no customer detriment involved there.  Second of all, in the FX charges, and I include other things in that as well in that particular area, in the principal issue there that gave rise to that whole scandal, there was no customer detriment.  What had happened was, we as a bank, were required to get written approval in the mid-90s, I think it was 1996 or something like that, for our foreign exchange charges.  We had failed to do that.  The investigation then found that actually our charges in the marketplace were no worse than any other bank, so therefore we were not disadvantaging customers.  Despite that, we went and remediated and refunded every customer that we could find.  The third element, Faldor, was a situation where there was no customer detriment.  This was a question as to whether, how will I say, a particular legal entity - an investment vehicle - had been given preferential treatment by our investment management arm.  It wasn't anything about customer detriment.</p></speech>

Yes, there were very big increases in that year and a half period or so before I finally retired and I would say there were two reasons for that.  One, as I said in my opening statement, the economy was beginning to recover from a pretty tough few years after the dotcom, and we got ... there was a sort of catch-up spurt I think.</p></speech>

I mean, in 1998 our loan book for property and construction, depending on whether you count in or out our US subsidiary, was somewhere between 12% and 15% of our total book.  So we had a long history in lending and we were quite comfortable that we were an experienced lender to property and construction.</p></speech>

Just on the whole issue, I am taking the property side.  You would have very much breached the prudential lending limits in July '06.  How do you reconcile that, because you were effectively, by the end of 2006 you were breaching these limits significantly and by 2008 you were way ahead.  You were ... effectively, you could have about 250% of own funds in two related sections.  You were at 390%.  How do you reconcile that Mr. Sheehy?</p></speech>

It is not by looking at a definition of an asset class, it looks at all individual credits and applies different stresses and measures to them and attaches a risk weighting to them which leads to a calculation, so it was really as different as chalk and cheese, the way this system was moving towards it.

And, looking at it, that even with Anglo in 2005, you had 52% of an increase and you had ... Anglo had 38%.  So, can you explain how you ...

They were a retail commercial bank; so are we.  There was a slight difference in our customer base.  We were much heavier than they were in the SME sector and property and construction was widespread.  We had, you know, in the ... we had very large customers and then we had 650 customers who had property and construction loans of over &euro;1 million, so it wasn't ... it was very broadly spread and reflected our franchise and the nature of our franchise.</p></speech>

That was in October 2008, in a public meeting, and an individual asked me, you know, "Are you about to have a rights issue?"  Now, it's very simple rules in corporate governance about what you do if you're a public company.  There's also lots of documents you will have seen that we were adequately capitalised at the time.  If a board had decided to raise funds in a share placement with customers, you would have to immediately announce that.</p><p>At the time we were looking at capital, and we had a whole range of mitigants that we thought we could apply.  We were a long, long way from ever having to, at that stage, ask shareholders to pay up.  At the time there was an active shorting in the market, and a huge amount of speculation on bank shares in Ireland that were being played out of London and New York.  I had to be very definite and honest in my response.  Sorry, I lost the first part?</p></speech>

Just in general on remuneration.  You know, there was a number of components to it and they were scientifically constructed.  We had three external consultants who looked at it.  And their methodology was to bring you into a peer group and a reference group and that was probably the biggest driver of the pay policy.  I never asked and I don't know of any colleagues who ever asked the remuneration committee for a pay increase.  It was kind of mechanically devolved out of a system of peer references.</p><p>And if you look at the Nyberg report you will see that AIB was much, much lower ... rather than ... of the peer group, in terms of size.  So, there was a science to it.  There wasn't executives going up, banging the door saying "I want more pay".  It never happened.  But the actual amounts that we were paid were too high ... I mean, when I came from the States I was paid a lot less over there, but they had a totally different philosophy about long-term compensation, so you could make a lot of money in the States as a bank executive if you stayed in an institution for a long time, because there was a huge upside in stock.  Here there was ... actually it turned out, no upside in long-term compensation because the bar had to be ... was ... CPI plus 10% compound which is virtually impossible ... actually impossible to make, so they never vested it.  I think once in ten years there might have been a small vesting.  So there was flaws in the design, too much influence by peer reference, but there was no clamour among bank executives, the people who reported to me directly, for more pay.</p></speech>

What was proposed on the night of the guarantee was a four-bank guarantee.  Was that for deposits only and how much would that guarantee have cost?</p></speech>

Clearly when you are discussing nationalisation, liquidation or default of an institution, that's not part ... that institution isn't part of the future, that's part of the past that has to be dealt with.  We argued, I certainly argued, that the bonds should be included and the reason for that was if you looked at the mistakes that were made in the US around Lehman's and the inconsistency from day to day of the regulatory response, not only in the US but in Europe and in the UK - where we knew ... we found out subsequently there was secret loans being given to banks - you had to be clear about the message you were giving to the market.  Clarity is very important.  If some of those instruments weren't covered, our investor relations desk would have 100 calls within one minute about "Define exactly what you mean here".  So the definition and the clarity were important.</p> <p>  It is worth pointing out that on the night, AIB had no bonds or subordinated debt instruments that would in any way have been enhanced by the guarantee.  None.  We had perpetual debt, which is irrelevant for a timed guarantee and we had dated debt, the earliest of which fell due in 2013.  So there was no agenda from our point of view of getting something extra.  </p> <p>  The pricing of the guarantee on the evening wasn't discussed.  Now, we did have a reference, if you looked at the &euro;100,000 guarantee for individuals which was introduced on 20 September, and that had a 20 basis point price on it.  In the bilateral discussions that we had around pricing of the guarantee I was pushing for an FDIC model which is the US model about ... you price the guarantee relative to the risk you are taking, and the risk you are taking is based on a formula, called a CAMEL formula, which takes in capital, liquidity, management risk.  It would take a bit of working to do but there was a model for pricing of guarantees that's the biggest model in the world, used by the FDIC in the US.</p></speech>

We gave advice on ... in response to questions we were asked.  We said we needed a guarantee, the system needed a guarantee of some type, because of what had happened that day and what was absolutely certain would happen over the coming days.  And after that then for instance, when it came to the duration, there was a one-year duration proposed.  The way the markets operate one year is actually a product, you know, 90 days is a product, there are buckets of time-based funding instruments and one year is one year for one day.  It just becomes technically very difficult to do anything with a one-year guarantee, so we recommended a two-year guarantee and subsequently the European Commission came out and said that that was the only type of instrument that would have had a chance of working, less duration would not have worked.</p></speech>

At the time, certainly from mid-2005 on, the focus was on consumer-related issues, as a knock-on I think from the issues that Deputy O'Donnell raised - you know, the governance issues.  So there was a big focus on that, and then it was immediately kind of replaced by the three big programmes: SOX, Basel and IFRS, which totally consumed the regulator's energy and our energy, certainly through 2006 and most of 2007.  So it was a ... I think the regulator at that time was taxed with a huge amount of oversight in what was happening in the market.</p></speech>

Yes, I think what happened, Senator, was that Jim O'Leary, at a board meeting in, as I recall it, sort of May-June sort of time in 2004, asked for a presentation about property and construction lending from a strategy, credit quality, etc., point of view, and a detailed presentation was made to the board in October of that year, which covered all of the ... which covered all of those issues, the business strategy, where we had got to, volume growth, and credit quality.  And I recall that the presentation was made by, I think, three people.  One was the executive responsible for that sector, for lending to that sector from a business development point of view, another was the head of credit in the Republic of Ireland division and the third person was a senior executive from the group credit committee.  And, after a wide-ranging review of our activity, our strategy, etc., the credit officers there were asked were they happy with credit quality, did they believe that the risk mitigants that were present in the portfolio were appropriate, relative to the size of the portfolio, and they answered "Yes" to all of those questions.  So, in other words, they said that at that point in time, which was, as I recall, October 2004, that the quality ... the credit quality of that book was sound as far as they were concerned.  And, I think ... sorry, my recollection is that after the usual questions and challenges that the board expressed itself as being happy with what they had been told.</p></speech>

We agree ... I agree with them, and the chairman of the audit committee agrees, every year on a work programme, you know, what are we going to ... what do we need to look at this year?  So the work programme ... so we would have asked them to follow this work programme to check out and validate that processes within each function were being carried out.  And after that they rate the problems and typically they do find issues and problems there and you can see there's a rating chart - material, significant, important, and minor.  If you look at this report, there wasn't any material problems identified and these factors are worked out as a money function - how much could it cost if it went wrong?  But the observations, you know, I think are fair.  We are ... we always needed to be given a view from fresh eyes in a process - what was going on there and what do we need to concentrate on?  So we would always take these results from the audit as a call to action.</p></speech>

So we didn't ignore or dismiss his observations and we took the high end.  I mean, Dr. FitzGerald had a lower estimate, but we took the 30% fall, which, of course, would have been unprecedented in experience terms but that was applied in our stress test for residential property.

There's the absolute amount, which you have quoted.  There's the sensitivity of the amount to the grade of the sanction, and you will see in the matrix that the poorer grades weren't increased.  So you don't increase the lending sanction for the poorer grades; you do for the better grades.  And there's also the link between the sanction amounts and own funds.  You know, how much can you put on risk of your own funds?  There was no increase in the amount of risk you could put on own funds because own ... I'm talking about equity, because that had increased in the same period, so that was capped at 2.1% of own funds.  The worst performing grades were not increased.  So it wasn't a ... the numbers look significant but it was a fairly logical thing to do at the time.</p></speech>

If you look at that reference there to, on page 62 ... that discussion was supported by a 64 page submission on that credit.  It was quite detailed.  It's a very large number, but there were very large deals going on at the time.  It was participation in a syndicated loan actually.  The methodology used there was that when loans went over certain limits, they went to the next level of authority.  And they carried with them the approvals and arguments that the various levels prior to that had made.  In this case, when we looked at it and it went to board, there was a lot of support.  The individual had enormously, much higher net worth, there was professional evaluations, there was in overall, I think, a loan-to-value of around 50% in the entire exposure.

While those whose debts were less than &euro;75 million at acquisition, the impairment was around 21%.</blockquote>I couldn't have anticipated that at the time and neither did NAMA at the time, but sometimes the bigger relationships because of the diversification that they had, you know ... typically they would all have had significant UK exposure-----</p></speech>

The dividend was paid on 26 September 2008.  The decision to pay the dividend was taken in July 2008, for the half year ended June 2008.  This is two months prior to Lehman's and the general collapse of the markets.  In addition, the question implies that the dividend was ... extra dividend was &euro;270 million.  The dividend ... the interim dividend is always smaller than the final dividend.  Generally it is a kind of two thirds, one third split.  Our interim dividend for the previous half year, June 2006 was 27.2 cent per share.  We have 878 million shares, that was increased by 2.8 cent per share, a total cost of &euro;24.58 million.  So the &euro;270 million that was paid on 29 September, approved in July, was made up of &euro;270 million, of which &euro;24 million was the increase.</p> <p>  Why did we make that decision?  First of all, if the decision was being made in September, no dividend would have been paid.  In the post-Lehman's world, no dividend would have been paid.  All bets were off at that stage.  So when we declared a dividend, communicated it to market ... that notice is filed on the Stock Exchange.  It is now a mandatory, contractual obligation to pay the dividend, so you have no leeway to change your mind after you declare it.  It is contracted.  Shares are bought on the market,  either ex or cum dividend from the date you make the declaration. </p> <p>  We wouldn't have paid the dividend in September, if that was when we were making the decision so that's my answer there.</p></speech>

This relates to the quality of the business model, setting process, just to tidy up there from some of the questions that may be outstanding before we go for a break.</p> <p>  We will be referring to core documents AIB B2, Vol. 1 and that is AIB reference 01278, page 19, paragraph two.  What I want to explore with you, Mr. Sheehy, here is the development of the bank's business strategy.  I would imagine that this is one of the main responsibilities of the board and try to maybe establish with you how much board time was being taken up with regard to the strategy.</p><p>And the sort of time that was devoted to discussing the development of the sustainable business strategy.  So maybe just to begin with that question, how regularly and how often was the business model that was being operated under your tenure being discussed at board level?</p></speech>

What we tried to do, given the diversity of the business, was to bring a business to the board every month and say here's this business this is how it's going.  So all the businesses were run through, you wouldn't get through them all in one year, what their strategy was, what the market conditions were and that included a property business as you know there was ... they did two or three of those presentations.  So the board wanted and demanded to meet businesses and to get a strategic view of where those businesses were going.  So that was an ongoing process and part of the planning process.  In relation to the overall strategy of the board ... the board obviously got the annual budget and it got a rolling five-year plan as well and to some degree they were linked to remuneration.</p></speech>

Was people saying that we're now begin to mirroring the grow-fast model, that our concentration levels in particular sectors, particularly property, are maybe growing beyond what would be the traditional approach that we've taken?  Was there any ... because our examination records are not indicating that, so maybe there's something that we're not seeing that you could tell us this morning that would demonstrate that these concerns were being expressed at AIB level ... at senior board level.</p></speech>

Just in ... to put a bit of context on it, Chairman ... the Republic of Ireland business accounted for 43% of the group profits and the property division in the Republic of Ireland accounted for 25% of ROI's profits.  So you're talking about between 13% and 15% of the group profits related to this part of the bank that caused, you know, our demise, effectively.  So the board had a lot of things to look at but they did look at the property concentration and general what's the view on the market, what are we hearing from our customers, what's the macro indicators.  That was a constant, as you can imagine, a constant part of the dialogue of the board.</p></speech>

And I'll go to core document AIB B17 ... B1 ... page 79 and 80.  And this relates to EC, under EC treaty rules the bank was obliged to submit a restructuring plan to the EU Commission and this was finalised in April 2010.  It was further updated in 2011 and further revised again in 2012.  Now the question I'm putting to you here, Mr. Sheehy, in it's revised 2012 EU restructuring plan, paragraph 3.9, AIB acknowledges that its decision to expand into property was misguided and that its risk management and internal governance systems were not as effective as they should have been in controlling this risk.  Now could you please comment upon this and maybe come to them in regard to your earlier comments to me as well.</p></speech>

So, I am now bringing the meeting back into public session.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  And just one other matter there, Mr. Buckley, before I bring in Senator O'Keeffe, is if I could just come to yourself, maybe just to explore and get some understanding of the access ... the relationships had ... the access and relationship particularly how ... the relationship that AIB had with the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance, okay.  And a ... the nature and the appropriateness of that relationship between the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the banking institutions, in this specific case, AIB.  What did you see, Mr. Buckley, as the main purpose and indeed the main outcome of the round-table discussions held with the Central Bank post-publication of the financial stability reports from 2004 onwards?</p></speech>

I do remember one, and there may only have been one in my time of those meetings, I do remember one meeting to which all of the chief executives and local managing directors of the banks were invited by the chairman of the Central Bank.  I think I have alluded to something I said at it in my ... in my ... in my written statement and my recollection at that meeting, if I am right, if that is the meeting you are alluding to, or one of those meetings, is that it was a meeting at which the chairman of the Central Bank would've gone through that report and would've asked those in the room to ... whether they had any comments or whether they had any issues, would've talked about the banking market in very general terms.</p><p>So, I would have recalled it as a pretty unstructured meeting in itself.

My first big interaction with the Central Bank in its prudential role was in 2002 when we had the Allfirst fraud.  As you can see, it has marked my recall of my whole time as CEO, but there I found .... what happened at the stage was that we had to deal with a whole lot of regulatory intervention from the Federal Reserve in New York because, remember the fraud had happened in a US-regulated bank with a subsidiary of ours and the local regulator, and what I found was that there was a very professional, very thorough approach adopted by both of the regulators.  They worked together, very closely, we had to sign up a memorandum of understanding, we had to undertake a very detailed programme of remedial action.  That programme was given oversight by a man called John Hyman, who had been the previous controller ...  one of the previous controllers of the currency in the USA.  So, and we worked our way very thoroughly.  I put one of my most senior executives full time on making sure we met all the requirements.  So, in that case I found the regulator acting, if you like, in its prudential mode, behaved very professionally.</p> <p>  The second thing, I'd say, and I am sorry if I'm taking too long but I just want to give you a balanced account.  In the FX charges and related issues that came up during 2003-04 which Deputy O'Donnell has already referred to, I found that the regulator which at this stage was on the conduct side, the customer side of it, was very proactive, was very demanding, rightly, as I would say.  And again, I found that we got into that way of independent investigation, independent oversight, we had a former Comptroller and Auditor General involved, we had a former Governor of the Central Bank involved.  And I found that that relationship was properly demanding from the regulator.</p> <p>  Now, other than those two big crisis events, I would have interacted with the regulator ... and other than the meeting that you mentioned in the beginning ... I would have interacted with the regulator a couple of times a year when our interim results were coming out and when our annual results were coming out, the process was that myself and my finance director would go in the day before, before we made the market announcement, into the Central Bank and have a meeting with the prudential side of the Central Bank.  We would present our results to them, they were ... if you like ... we were open to any questions they would ask us and I suppose my recall of those meetings is that ... and I think I mentioned this in my written statement, that they weren't very demanding, they weren't very probing.  So, they are my three bits-----</p></speech>

Now, if to develop upon Mr. Gleeson's analogy of ... a sporting analogy, referees in different codes of sport have different responses to them.  In rugby, if the captain acts, operates in a very, maybe, described as a gentlemanly sort of role with the referee, and in soccer terms, maybe the players go nose to nose with the referee.  What sort of approach did the AIB take, if they had concerns, as to how the refereeing was taking place, and Mr. Gleeson was saying that it was a very competitive market and the referee should have stepped in to calm things down.  But players themselves have a responsibility to come to the referee to say ... at any stage, did you go to the regulator's office and say, "The model as it is developing at the moment, is of concern to us and we would like you to make an intervention"?</p></speech>

Mr. Buckley, can I ask you specifically on page 8 of your statement, you say there were periodic requests from the Central Bank Financial Regulator, usually addressed to the chair of the AIB, raising concerns about and asking for reports on the mortgage market and AIB's lending strategy in relation to it.  Can you tell us what sort of concerns were being raised at that point?  And specifically, the concerns that they were raising.</p></speech>

I can remember during my time a couple of pieces of work that the regulator had asked us to do on mortgages and essentially the concerns that the regulator was raising was, you know, were we happy that the level of risk we were taking on in the mortgage market was appropriate.

"We had an extensive formula which was eventually adopted later in the night pretty well word for word".  They were your contemporaneous notes in 2008, both of you.  In 2015 both of you now are arguing that it was, a piece of paper in Mr. Gleeson's case, torn out of a notebook, in your case, I think you said this morning, a slip of paper.  So I'm just ... I am confused.  I believe other people may also be confused, so if you could clarify your contemporaneous note versus your recollection now.</p></speech>

The honest answer ... I cannot remember the piece of paper.  We were certainly in dialogue with the Government about technical issues of what should be in, what shouldn't be in, we could have written it out.  I have no piece of paper as a record of the night other than my note.  If we wrote something down we might have handed it over but it certainly would have been a very informal piece ... if it happened, and I'm not going to try to read into the record something that I'm not sure of.

That's the problem.  What would happen if you did nothing?  The Government had already brought out a guarantee on the 20th, which was quite a substantial increase on the previous one.  We had adequate liquidity and when we say that we have enough liquidity 'til the end of October or five or six weeks, that assumes that you never get another cent.  That's a kind of a ... you know if you keep on funding that keeps on moving out.  But you have to take a point in time.  The point in time situation was that if the markets froze totally, and there was no reason for an observer, looking at 29 September, to say "I know what's going to happen tomorrow" because nobody knew what was going to happen tomorrow.</p></speech>

The constant answer that we've had from other witnesses, including yourselves, is that, you know, a changeover was taking place to Basel II.  Did you not, or did you, have any personal qualms about the fact that not only was AIB breaching those sectoral requirements while you were chief executive, but that the breach actually grew once it had been pointed out?</p></speech>

I took comfort from the fact that it was in transition and it's not possible to totally ignore the context of what you're doing at the time, which was an absolute change from that model, of a kind of a stock percentage model, to a risk-based model.  That was what we signed up for.  We were in the process of a formal application to change.  We were in constant dialogue about what that involved, how the models would work and the regulator was in touch with us.  So, point in time, you know, you can say this was happening but there was also a continuous activity going on, changing from that model to another one, with both sides who were involved in it totally participating.</p></speech>

I can't remember the exact quote but to paraphrase you, you said that "The issue of sector lending was discussed at board level a number of times".  Were there any concrete actions, ever, in your time, from the board of AIB ... decisions on addressing the issue of over concentration in the construction and the property sectors?</p></speech>

So it wasn't a static thing, it's an organic thing, you're constantly changing ... the market is constantly changing, you're constantly trying to grapple with the conditions when the loan was made, the conditions now, you're reviewing the loan, you're looking at the customer's cash flows, so it's ... it's quite an organic and dynamic process.</p></speech>

The regulator didn't change the sector limits at the same time as they got the application and accepted it, that would actually change those limits, and you can see from subsequent correspondence that they intended to engage in a series of meetings to change those limits all the way up to 2010, but those discussions have never happened.</p></speech>

There was a five-year rolling view of EPS growth, which was 12% compound, and I moderated it at that time.  I stated why I wanted to moderate it.  There are all sorts ... there is a mathematical reason, obviously it gets harder to grow on growth.  That is one thing.  The UK was beginning to soften.  We had the three big regulatory projects coming down which were going to cost ... they did cost in excess of &euro;200 million.  There was salary cost pressures all the way through the bank because of competitive forces and funding was getting more expensive, so I took it down from 12% to 10%, which is the same as putting an average growth back from 15% to 12%.  So I did moderate it because it wasn't sustainable and just as a by the way, changing that measure of five-year plan eliminated the possibility, if those plans were met, of all the LTIPs, the long-term incentive plans, vesting.  They couldn't vest because the plan now was less than the minimum hurdle required for them to vest, which was CPI plus 10% compound.</p></speech>

In his testimony, Professor Black, who was a renowned regulator and prosecutor of financial institutions that failed in the United States, said that there was a recipe which banks followed which ... that if banks followed, which would "produce the worst losses and is most likely to cause hyper-inflated bubbles" and that recipe includes grow like crazy, and he mentions 25%, and he mentions growth way ahead of economic growth nationally, and also make terrible quality loans.</p><p>And Professor Black, you will have seen, said three sure things follow: record profits from the institution, then, quote, second: "Under modern executive compensation the senior leadership will promptly be made wealthy" and three, catastrophic losses.  Now, gentlemen, can I ask you both, in view of the fact that Allied Irish Bank's growth in 2004 in its balance sheet was 25%; 37.5% in 2005.  The bank made record profits in those years.  The remuneration of senior personnel was at record levels and then there followed a huge crash.  Do you recognise Professor Black's analysis in terms of Allied Irish Bank and do you agree with it?</p></speech>

I think most of Professor Black's observations were based on his US experience, and he did make references to liar loans and the like.  In general terms, you know, he is trying to transfer the ... his US observations into the Irish market.  When you look at, you know, what he said, if you do grow loans and there is a market crash, which is a one-in-100-year event, banks are going to suffer greatly.  Banks absorb the risk between short money and long money and when there's a problem of that nature, it will materialise in falling asset values and problems for banks.  So, in general, I agree with his observations.  In AIB, our economy was, in those years, held up as probably the highest-performing economy in the world.  Our demographics were totally different to the market that he was drawing reference to.  So, some of his analogies, you know, are right, but I think the basis from which he is extrapolating one observation to another is fundamentally unsound because it was a different, totally different, economy.</p></speech>

I'll be very brief.  The point I would make, I've made it in my opening statement, which is that in the period that I'm talking about, up to this time, 2005, you know, we were in - we, as in the economy - was in a big, big catch-up phase.  I mean, you can't ignore the fact ... sorry, one can't ignore the fact that the population did increase by a million over that period of '71 to 2001; that the labour force had increased by 32%; that the employed population had increased by 49%.  I mean, people had to be housed, they had to go shopping.  They were moving into urban areas from the country on a continuous basis, so I think the Irish economic situation was a bit different to, if you like, the model that ...

Mr. Black, for example, supplements ... or his analysis is supplemented by an article written in 1993 by two Berkeley professors, one of whom, George Akerlof, in a Nobel laureate.  I don't expect you or I ... my question isn't predicated on you having read this article.  It is referred to by Professor Black in his evidence.  The article in question, &quot;Looting: The Economic  Underworld of Bankruptcy for Profit&quot;, lays out precisely the strategy I have discussed.  I quote from that article:<blockquote><br /><br />Our theoretical analysis shows that an economic underground came come to life if firms have an incentive to go broke for profit at society's expense (to loot) instead of to go for broke (to gamble on success).  Bankruptcy for profit will occur if poor accounting, lax regulation or low penalties for abuse give owners an incentive to pay themselves more than their firms are worth and then default on their debt obligations.  Bankruptcy for profit occurs most commonly when a government guarantees a firm's debt obligations.</blockquote>That was in 1993.  Mr. Sheehy, could I ask you why, considering the substantial body of literature that exists and analysis, which I don't have time to go into, why were you chief regulators, or risk officers, and indeed yourselves, as senior officers, were you aware of this analysis of banking crises?  Even Sweden, a few years before you came in to-----</p></speech>

That is not the case, never was the case.  The people in the bank that I had the privilege of working with, by and large, almost entirely, totally committed to doing a good job and having a long career in the bank.  That was what people ... that's what motivated people.  I've never met anybody in the bank, or in any of ... most of the other banks that I've met who had anything other than a long-term, stable, repeat business, grow your market share, stay there for the long haul, that's the way people operated in the bank and all the records and all the references in any of the documents you'd have seen would confirm that.</p></speech>

The record of AIB, annual reports will show, that your remuneration substantially increased, along with a substantial increase in the balance sheet growth.  Was Professor Black correct?</p></speech>

As I explained earlier on, the remuneration of the chief executive officer - me, when I was there - was based on market comparisons and norms.  I told the remuneration committee and the board - and they knew it very clearly, as did the director, as did the chairman - that I wanted my salary to be the lowest in its peer group, relative to the size of the bank, and that's in the Nyberg report, page 7, there's a chart of it there.  So, there was no relationship, none whatsoever, between my salary and the size of the bank's balance sheet.  That's a fact.  You can look up the remuneration committee notes.  You can look up the terms of the remuneration committee.  The factors that went into it, the discussions at the board, there is no connection or validity to what you're asserting.</p></speech>

I paid tax on everything I earned.  I made a voluntary reduction in my pension after I left.  In relation to the creditworthiness of first-time buyers, we followed a strategy of not following the market.  We had, I think, 151,000 mortgages; 2,660 were 100% finance, which is less than 2%; the market was 8%.  We monitored, on a monthly basis, what a standard application coming into our counter would be, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>all our competitors and it was always the lowest.  We changed it a little bit towards the end and, if you looked at the published information as at 31 December 2010, in AIB, the 90-day-past-due rate for mortgages, and that's ... 90 day past due is not an opinion, it's a fact - you have to be 90 day past due to be 90 day past due - was 2.5%, which was by far the lowest in the market.  Subsequently, it changed when the bank merged with EBS, who had a different rate, but I think the mortgage process in AIB was best in class.  The numbers substantiate that.</p></speech>

And that is the appropriateness or the credit policies operating ... because the grow-fast model ... or whether a sustainable model is in place, a bank will always want to be profitable and the ... as does any other business ... and to do that it has to grow its business, and in banking terms that means issuing loans.  Mr. Sheehy, if I could put the issue of AIB Group's large exposure policies, this is the GLP as it's referred to, and the limits as to whether there were hard limits or soft limits ... and how exceptions would be granted.  And, it could be suggested that exceptions were sanctioned regularly by sub-board committees.  Could you explain to the committee what processes and actions were taken to monitor - and I'm referring to core document AIB 2, pages 25 and 35 to 37 - so if you could explain to the committee what processes and actions were taken to monitor and remediate the regular approval of exceptions to the group large exposure policy limits?  This would be, kind of, "There is exceptional circumstances here, loan shouldn't be granted, but let's look at it again and maybe grant it"?</p></speech>

So what the escalation of sanctioning - if you go through the various committees - meant was that in each case, first of all, you were going through the committee process because the loans were getting larger, and that's a fact.  And, you know, we talked about a big loan earlier on.  But to me there was a benefit of ... in this process, which was you got fresh eyes at each level, and feedback and interaction.  So the group large exposure policy, and the passing on of when people went over certain limits into their next level was, I think, is a positive process in looking at risk.  It's a positive process.  It can look, because the loans are bigger, as just some kind of a default thing that as it gets bigger it just goes up and gets approved.  That's not the case.  As it goes up, it gets further and further interrogated before it's approved.</p></speech>

And I'm asking you to comment upon Mr Daly's testimony when he says:<blockquote><br /><br />While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that the loan-to-value ratios were, typically, less than 100% when the loan was drawn, the reality, in many cases, was that a developer's equity contribution was in the form of a rolling-up of unrealised, paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position.  Rarely, if ever, was it in the form of cash.</blockquote>So basically what Mr Daly is implying there ... that as a development was under way, its equity was growing probably beyond the original valuation of the purchase or development at the site; therefore, the equity then could be offset against a new development.  He then goes on to say:<blockquote>In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It's safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of borrower equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose.  In the event of a crash the banks stood to take 100% of the losses, and that's what happened.</blockquote>Is that what happened in AIB?</p></speech>

And if you look at a loan application, where an individual could have been in business for 20 years in a trade, i.e. property construction, and has developed a net worth in that business, there are a couple of options open to the individual.  They could say, "I'll cash out here and take my cash off the table," and try to continue on with non-recourse lending ... trying to get that ... "Or I'll leave everything I have in the business".  By and large, to my recall, almost all of the developers we'd have dealt with left everything in the business.  Now, then you come to the kind of intellectual argument about is leaving everything in the business the same as committing to the business?  It is.  I mean, if you have made money over decades and you leave it all in the business, and that is then recognised by the bank as equity, not cash, but as equity, I think that's entirely correct.  And I'll just go ... add a little bit to it.  I mean, when I was a branch manager I dealt with a lot of SMEs and start-up businesses, they never had cash.  People who go into business rarely have cash, because when you go into a town you'll see banks lined up on one side of the street, you won't see "private equity" or "vulture fund" over somebody's door.  The banks provided equity for people who wanted to ... provided cash for people who wanted to take risks.  And, by and large, that came from a trust-based, personality-based decision, a personal guarantee from parents or supporters.  So, you can imagine if everybody ... and we had nearly 40% SME customers and builders ... if the bank had a view that we would not back anybody unless they had hard cash, and disregard their equity, the person coming to the bank who wanted to start a business, had a house worth &euro;150,000, a  mortgage of &euro;75,000, wanted to get seed capital to start off, and we said, "You know what?  Go away, we don't recognise that."  Society wouldn't be-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#X01800"><p>No, no, what Mr. Daly is implying is the exposure that your practice actually created.  It's not that you're giving a few bob to an SME here, or a video shop here, or a health club here.  What you were doing was giving compound lending into one sectoral area, one loan after another, after another, that led to an exposure.  So a developer built the shopping centre, the equity value in that - no cash transaction - maybe increased by 20%.  That 20% then - no cash transference - was used as a notional concept to securitise a new loan to build another development.  This was all construction.  This wasn't SMEs, this wasn't some guy setting up some carpet shop down the road, these were developing loans that ultimately resulted in all these major borrowers having to go into NAMA with massive loans that your bank had provided.  So this is an exposure issue.  And what Mr. Daly is indicating in his statement - and Mr Daly may well be back before the committee and we'll get further clarification from himself, and we may call other witnesses back as well - is that the business model operated by banks was creating an exposure in property without any down payment or cash being made.  The securitisation was notional equity.  Does that reflect the business model that AIB were using?  And did it create an exposure?</p></speech>

It did happen.  And most of the uplift in valuation came from the investment side property.  So, if you somebody who was a residential developer, but they had a successful let investment property, you would take an uplift value in that and pass it on.  But I agree with Mr. Daly, you know, that it would've been a lot better off if the structure ... the industry structure in Ireland around property, had more private equity, you know, and I think that's happening now.  It would have been far superior, and it did increase the bank's exposure, the fact that we released funds on the basis of valuations of uplift.</p></speech>

This was, I don't ... I forget when those loans were transferred to NAMA, it was probably 2011, so six years after I retired.

I'm talking about lending now ... that it may be misleading.  Because ... in my time at the beginning of my time our actual exposure to property and construction overall started at the number of &euro;6 billion ... this was for the whole group and it went up during those four and a bit years to &euro;19 billion.  And on the Irish side of it within that number it went from &euro;4 billion to &euro;11 billion.  And I said this morning that ... and I would repeat it again .. that in the context of the demographic situation to which I alluded which was unprecedented in the history of the State, that I felt that at that point we were not significantly running ahead of what was required in terms of infrastructure in the country.  So the percentages don't ... how do I say ... I don't work off the percentages.  I mean what kills a bank is pounds, shillings and pence lent rather than percentages lent so that's really my answer.  I hope it ... it meets your question.</p></speech>

The second ... what I would say is that ... looking at this from my point of view, for that period that I am talking about - I had absolutely no evidence, nor is there evidence in any of the core documents that I have got and received, that there was reckless lending or anything that could be described as reckless lending during those years, 2001 to 2005.  That's a categorical answer, no evidence whatsoever.</p></speech>

That's not to say that there weren't issues and I have talked about them when asked during the morning, and we did our best at all times to fix any issues that arose at the time and to do it a very open and transparent way <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>our customers and <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>our regulators.  So, there were issues.  There were not issues relevant, I think, to the core of what this committee is enquiring about and we did our best to fix them.  And there was no evidence, is no evidence, in any of the books I've got that there was reckless lending, or anything that could be approaching reckless lending, in my time as CEO.</p></speech>

Thank you to both the witnesses.  Mr. Buckley, if I may I wanted to talk to you about the new accounting standard, IAS 39, that was introduced in January 2005.  Mr. Forde told us that he had a view at the time that this new accounting standard wasn't an appropriate formula.  Did you hold that view?</p></speech>

And the old way of dealing with all of this was in the good times, you put aside money for the bad times.  And what this was doing, essentially, this new accounting standard was saying, "No, you can't put away money in the good times to help you deal with the bad times".</p></speech>

I was on the board of a US bank at the time and they decided to ignore it and the regulator over there said, "You're supposed to do it, but in actual fact you can ignore it" and that's what happened over in America.  Here, when like ... I agree with everything Mr. Buckley said, it's a totally nonsensical accounting standard from a banking point of view.  It may be appropriate for other industries but for banking it was totally nonsensical.  There was a board discussion during my period there.  I haven't seen it noted but I did talk to an official in the bank who would have been an executive director at the time and we did discuss it.  And we discussed whether we should go to the regulator with our concerns and given that no European country other than Spain had deviated from it, we decided there was no point.  Now, I then tried to research what had happened in Spain and why it happened in Spain and there is a very particular reason.  For historical reasons, Spanish banks were required to hold very large shareholdings in large Spanish companies.  When their tier 1 was being calculated, the equity value of those holdings, which are basically stocks and shares, were included in their total capital.  That didn't meet the international standard for tier 1 because of its volatility so the Spanish authorities were able to make the case that, "We have this historical volatile piece of capital in our banks balance sheets - we need the extra comfort of not changing", in effect and having cross cyclical provisions to bolster their resilience.</p></speech>

I will move on then please, Mr. Sheehy, in relation to NAMA's evidence to us last week.  They gave us evidence on the extent to which banks were tending to collect income that was going to the debtors and not to the bank once the crisis began - about rental income from office blocks, from shopping centres - and this was in the millions.  They gave us two figures.  They said that 20% of income from investment assets were being mandated to the banks but 80% of income was being diverted away.  And NAMA said that nobody seemed to be following up on it.  NAMA then went after this income themselves.  Is it the case in AIB that no-one was following up on this income?</p></speech>

So these were customers that had been with the bank for a long time.  So those relationships were managed and evolved over time.  Customers got loans, they paid them back, more loans, they paid them back.  So there was a confidence level there.  There was a constant change in personnel at the bank.  We changed the way these relationships were managed by centralising the management of these sector teams, moving it away from the front line.  There is always ... the nearer the banker is to the customer, the greater the risk.  That's just a golden rule in banking, okay.  So you try to set up structures, processes, reviews and procedures that interject between that risk.</p></speech>

I don't know of the cases but it didn't ... it may stand to reason when you look back at it, the bigger the operator, the more likely they were to have non-Irish assets in their portfolio.  That would be one definite fact.  The bigger the portfolio, the more likely you would have a good chunk of investment property pre-let.  So the most problematic asset was residential development land.  So the bigger you were, the smaller the proportion that is likely to be in the portfolio.  So I think that's probably the cause of that.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson said that the Republic of Ireland division brought the bank down.  They are his words.  And you were chief executive of the group at the time.  Mr. Forde told us that in January-February '09, he was completely removed from discussions at executive management level and board level and then, without objectives or direction in terms of a work agenda in his new position, nine months later he then left the bank.

I have had, and I still have, great respect for him and all his professional abilities.  I felt it was time for change in the ROI division.  We needed to totally reorganise the amount of resources we were going to deploy around the problem and I had to change some personnel.  My plan was that I would give Donal a strategic role, because we had so many strategic issues in front of us, and I had such regard for his abilities in that area - he was head of strategy before - that I was confident he could do a great job for us there.

Accounts are normally reviewed, by arrangement, quarterly or half-yearly or annually.  We now had to try to review everything ASAP.  So there was a ... almost every aspect of the way the bank did its business was changed in those months.</p></speech>

Could I maybe ask you, just to round that off, in relation to the loans acquired from AIB by NAMA, the overall discount rate amounted to 56% eventually.  Would you like to comment upon that discount and do you think it was a high or low figure?  Was the 56% haircut that was applied justified?</p></speech>

Now, I was surprised at the level.  I had been expecting, you know, from the ... some statements by the Minister, and when you take into account the first loss position in all these loans was what the customer input was and then there was the bank's LTV ... basically the bank's LTV, and then there was going to be another drop after that, and I honestly thought when I was leaving that the number was going to be 30%, that range.  So I was surprised when I saw it.  However, I don't know exactly what the process was.  The market absolutely collapsed at that point.  There was no market.  And you could actually, technically, make the point: why had they any value at all?  There was no market.  You know, if you used IFRS 39 it must have been very difficult to arrive at a number.  So I was surprised but the market was so bad, I suppose, nothing will surprise me.</p></speech>

Can I just ask you, to start off with, Mr. Sheehy, to your knowledge, was there a practice of restructuring criticised loans, you know, for example, agreeing to moratoriums, interest-only, interest roll-up or extensions in the terms and conditions in the period of 2006 to 2008?</p></speech>

A customer comes in, change of circumstances, "This is what I thought was going to happen; it's not happening", and the bank would look at it.  Sometimes it would refuse the request; sometimes it would go along with it but it's standard practice.</p></speech>

In normal times it's standard practice in banking to do this.  In relation to that period, 2006 and 2008, did you see an increase of the type of restructuring in the way that I've outlined for large property ... commercial property exposures?</p></speech>

It doesn't matter whether you have a global problem or not, but there definitely was an increase in 2008, I would say.  There wasn't any ... not that I recall, any significant spike before then.</p></speech>

In relation to the position of your bank in the run up to September ... or during September 2008, the liquidity pressures that institutions were facing, but in particular AIB ... did the liquidity pressure for AIB ease during the second part of September 2008 or did it further tighten?</p></speech>

Prior to that I would say, you know, the market was tightening but it was ... we were able to get, you know, adequate funding and we had a good ... as I say, we always had a good piece of leeway in front of us because you know the liquidity hurdles that we ... there was two regulatory hurdles.  We were comfortable there.</p></speech>

The reason I ask you that is ... and I reference Vol. 2, AIB, C3b as core documents here, and we're on page 50.  In the minutes of the board meeting that was held in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, it's reported ... and you reported your interactions with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator since 7 September.  This meeting took place on the 17th, so two days after you report that liquidity pressures increased at that point.  You say that there was a systemic need for term debt of up to &euro;15 billion in the Irish market.  You go on to say that AIB would breach its regulatory liquidity ratio by the end of October 2008 if market conditions did not ease and term funding became available.  It goes on to say Central Bank has been informed of that.  The chairperson goes on to indicate that in the absence of a response from the regulators to the systemic funding problem, the matter would be pursued at a political level.  The reason I ask you this here is you're making it clear in this board minutes that AIB would have a liquidity problem at October if circumstances didn't change or pressures didn't ease.  You've confirmed to the committee that pressures not only didn't easy but actually tightened.  So was it the case that AIB was running into a severe liquidity problem?</p></speech>

Now, when I say ... when you say October, as I said earlier on, we have the liquidity requirements, the regulatory requirements, and you always have a date which is point in time versus the end date, and that assumes nothing happens in the meantime.  There was always going to be funding in the meantime so that date would keep on moving out, but there were real concerns after Lehman's that even offering better prices on term debt would have no effect because people were running to avoid risk everywhere.  So we didn't know what was going to happen.  The term debt of &euro;15 billion was the kind of money that would be rolling over, kind of three and six month money that would be rolling over, and if that didn't materialise or roll up, it would have had to be replaced somewhere else.</p></speech>

You have informed the committee that liquidity pressures didn't ease, indeed what happened after this meeting is they tightened.  So the question I put to you is, was AIB facing a seriously liquidity problem in October or after that point?</p></speech>

We had, you have to think of the way our funding was made up, I mean we ... half of our resources were in retail deposits.  We were very stable there.  And we also had a huge amount of assets that we could turn into self-funding assets.  So we would have had to change things to be better equipped, but we could have done it.</p></speech>

And the question I have to ask you again is, did you have suspicions that any one of the four ... because you only believed that the four were going to be guaranteed, but you asked them not to make a statement saying that those four were solvent.

They had targets on three levels and it was called the people performance index.  They had to have a profit outcome, they had to have a people index outcome which was a stat survey, and they had to have a customer service outcome, which was a customer service initial shopping survey.  I introduced that process in late 2001 in conjunction with HR to actually deal with the issue of a more holistic approach to management in branches.</p></speech>

What I was referring to is that in response to a general request from the regulator to all banks to review their lending policies in relation to mortgages, one of the things that came up before the AIB board, and which was reported back to the regulator, was that we have a particular approach which we applied to the generality of people looking for mortgages, and that includes certain formulae to do with loan-to-value ratio and repayment capacity.  What we do then is that in certain cases where we believe, and we're talking about categories rather than individuals, in certain cases where we believe that people's repayment capacity will grow quite rapidly in the future or where they have family support, we are prepared to go to a higher LTV then we generally would, that's what I said.  So it wasn't about special cases; it was about categories.</p></speech>

Right, just three very quick questions, Chairman.  First of all, last week Mr. Gleeson again referred to a private conversation with Mr. Lenihan in which he was given the clear understanding, he said, that Mr. Lenihan was of the view that Irish Nationwide and Anglo should be nationalised.  Did you ever have - and this is to Mr. Sheehy - any personal conversations or telephone calls with either Mr. Lenihan or Mr. Cowen?</p></speech>

Also last week, Mr. Gleeson made reference to article 14.3 in his opening statement of the ECB statute which says that they can intervene with central banks effectively and direct them how to act, and he seemed to think that interest rates should have been using the Taylor rule between 6% and 12% during the boom years.  Have you a view on whether the ECB should have intervened?  What should they have done if you do have that view?  And, very finally, tomorrow we have the opportunity to speak with Mr. Trichet, the then head of the ECB, and I'd be very interested to know any recommendations you might have about what we might ask him?</p></speech>

Ireland at that time was trying to promote itself, including the Irish Financial Services Centre, as a place to do business that was mainstream European and compliant with all the international standards of Basel, IFRS and everything else.  I think it would have been difficult, very difficult for the Irish authorities to carve out a special case while wanting to drive in a general direction of being really pro-central European.  I don't know what you would ask Mr. Trichet.</p></speech>

I would like to welcome Mr. Sheehy and Mr. Buckley.  Mr. Sheehy,  you passed a comment earlier on that the guarantee did not cost anything.  That would be quite different to the commonly-held view about the guarantee so can you just elaborate on what you mean by that?</p></speech>

The guarantee of the depositors and the bondholders in AIB did not have a direct cost.  The cost to the State from AIB was when the assets were transferred.  They were less than the value that we thought they were.  But the funding of the bank during the tenure of the guarantee was paid for out of the charge that was ordained by the ECB.</p></speech>

Senior debt is perpetual so it never matured unless you decided to call upon it.  Obviously you would not call upon it during the tenure of the guarantee.  There was substantial equity created obviously  when the bank put those debt instruments back to investors in offer for other ones, I think over &euro;3 billion of equity created in the AIB book and &euro;15.9 billion in the State overall, in burning the bondholders if you want to use that phrase.</p></speech>

For instance, we could have got all our mortgages and turned them into self-funding assets.  We could have sold down our corporate loans, probably taken a loss on it.

You had the clear impression that a four-bank guarantee was being considered, not a six-bank guarantee.  On what basis did you have that impression?  The only direct reference in the notes you took on the night is to Mr. Hurley, for example, saying it was impossible to bring down a bank of that size in the middle of the week and could lead to a fumble etc., which is the same word Mr. Gleeson used.

There was no statutory mechanism.  Liquidating a bank is an entirely different process to liquidating other going concerns, because it is a public event.

I have some notions of what might have happened.  There would have been a credit downgrade of all Irish institutions.  There would be a systemic mark on Ireland which would have made funding much more difficult immediately, even with a guarantee.  There is no doubt about that in my view.  But the market would, I think, then have said there is a problem in Ireland and they are addressing the core of it, there would have been a distinction made in due course.

I felt that - just to give an overall comment - I felt that achieving double digit growth was a realistic target, that it was stretching to some extent, but that it was realistic and if I may take that in the context of the Republic of Ireland division, I suppose to summarise the reason why I would have thought that there was good growth available in the Irish division.  Twofold: one, the demographics that I referred to before.  Second of all, a point I mentioned in my opening statement, that, while we had a big share of the current accounts of households and individuals and of the working accounts of companies and the strong position with the SMEs that, on a product-by-product basis, we actually had a much lower market share.  So let's say in mortgages, while we had 30% of all the current accounts in the country, we had 16% market share in mortgages.  So, there was inherent growth potential and when we made an assessment of what would be the net result of doing better on that front, but also reorganising ourselves, for instance by centralising the way in which we dealt with producing mortgages and producing a better proposition, that we would get there.  Double digit growth in the sense of 10% or 11% or 12% per annum, in the context of the economy we had, was not a wild or strange target to have would be my view, even still looking back at it now.</p></speech>

But essentially, it introduced a whole lot of extremely detailed sign-off processes at all levels in a, for instance, a banking organisation, to get to the point where the board of directors would sign off the accounts to make as sure as possible that the accounts were representative of the state of the business.  So it was a whole new panoply, if you like, of sign offs and cross sign offs, and all that sort of thing.</p></speech>

It wasn't open to us to go past our own regulator or it wouldn't be appropriate to go past our own regulator.  There were mechanisms, ELA for instance, which was a mechanism that was available to the regulator to give loans to banks, secured loans to banks, for funding purposes but we didn't ... The regulator didn't want that to happen because when a state regulator facilitated banks with ELA, it was published in the European communiqu&eacute; from the European central banks, and that then, by extension, became a sovereign issue for that country, so I think the regulator wanted to avoid that, if it could.</p></speech>

On B3, Vol. 1, page 6, there's material from Mr. Treble who was looking at the loan-to-deposit ratio going up to 157% at the end of 2006, which would brought you second only to HBOS, and that is a more risky form of banking than relying on deposits and, in the same volume he said that targets were set not to go to 157% but to be less than 134% at the end of 2006.  And the same document you see that coming into 2007, it was already at 162%.   Was that not a risky way to respond to Mr. Treble's concerns about that issue?</p></speech>

He also had ... he was a treasurer, you know, for part of his time, so he would have a view on this and a responsibility .... The loan-to-deposit ratio that we had was targeted to be in the middle of our peer group and if you look at Regling &amp;amp; Watson, page 34, table 12, you'll find that AIB was 143%, Bank of Ireland 173%, Anglo 127% and others up to 250% - that's Irish Life and that's ... I just use data points to show you how unreliable a measure a loan-to-deposit ratio is, because the far more important one is the adjusted loan-to-deposit ratio which imposes constraints.  You could fund ... you could have huge amounts of deposits that were very volatile and very short.</p></speech>

Now, there was .... for Mr. Buckley ... this is the last one, thanks very much, Chairman.  The organisation ... On page 4 of your speech, Mr. Buckley: "The organisational reshaping involved centralising as much as positive routine transactional and processing services out of branches, it involved creating a centralised mortgage processing and decision-making centre".  Now, if I could direct to B2 on page 8, the internal auditor says: "There were only three staff members in place in the Galway office who had the skills to manage cases on a daily basis, which includes an assistant manager with responsibility for the unit.  This could lead to the bank missing significant events or accounts and the subsequent financial loss," which NAMA had said to us, but it is a theory that a solvent bank with a long history like yours went wrong the day it reduced the power of local managers.  Mr. Sheehy did refer to the bank being nearer the customer and centralised everything and Galway, in particular, is mentioned, by the internal auditor as having experienced that difficult.  And we did find an emphasis on extending new mortgages rather than servicing the old ones.</p></speech>

The first thing you mentioned was about centralising our mortgage decision-making processing out of the branches and that was done.  And I think that was a good decision and it meant that there was consistency in decision-making and in dealing with any exceptional situation.   The second thing ... the audit report from my recollection over the last two months of reading thousands of pages is an audit report which is talking about our work-out teams managing loans ... commercial loans that had gone bad.</p><p>So the two things are actually not connected, if I may say so, in the way that you're connecting them.</p></speech>

I think I'm right, Senator.  The first point you made was about mortgages and how we were organised to make decisions on mortgages.  This, I think, is the ... we had, from recollection, three work-out teams on commercial lending in different ... you know, Dublin, I think Cork and Galway is what I recollect, and he is making the point here that there was a resourcing issue in Galway, and it's a factual point, and there's an agreed management action against it.  "I agree with the point raised", which is what whoever the manager was said, "and agree to sit down by the 30th of June to develop and agree a staffing action plan."  It's signed by the senior executive in lending in commercial banking, so there was a resourcing issue.  It could have ... if it was left to continue it could have had those consequences, but the manager concerned or the executive concerned committed to dealing with it and to be honest, I don't know what happened after that but it sounds to me like quite a straightforward situation.</p></speech>

The committee of inquiry into the banking crisis is now resuming in public session and can I ask members and those in the public gallery to ensure that all mobile phone devices are switched off?</p> <p>  We will now hear from Mr. David Duffy, chief executive officer at Allied Irish Banks.  David Duffy joined AIB Group in December 2010 as chief executive officer, chairman of the leadership team and board member.  From 2006 to 2011, he served at Standard Bank where he was head of strategic projects.  Prior to this, he served at ING Group and at Goldman Sachs International.  Mr. Duffy, you're very welcome before the inquiry this afternoon.</p> <p>  Before I begin proceedings, I just wish to advise the witness, Mr. Duffy, that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you're directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you're entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would also like to remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry, so I've been advised that the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p> <p>  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screen here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the gallery, those documents will be displayed on the screen to your left.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p> <p>  The witness has been directed to attend the meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, which will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.</p> <p>  So, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath.</p></speech>

As CEO of AIB since December 2011, I welcome this opportunity to outline to the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis my own experience of joining a bank that was in a significantly challenged state and leading its return to stabilisation and recovery over a three-year period.  I've worked in banking for almost 30 years, specialising in managing and restructuring banks through challenging times.  Though I grew up and was educated in Ireland, I spent most of my career working abroad.  From 1987 to 1997, I worked with Goldman Sachs International in various senior positions, including head of human resources Europe head of general services Europe and business manager for information technology.  From 1998 to 2006, I held various positions at ING Group, including the position of head of global wholesale banking network.  This role included the management of a team of CEOs covering all of the bank's regions globally.</p><p> Prior to that, I was president and chief executive officer of the ING franchises in the US and Latin America.  From 2006 to 2011, I worked with Standard Bank PLC-Standard Bank International, including holding the position of CEO.  In 2007, I took responsibility for the full international franchise.  I relocated to Asia in the summer of 2010 and in October assumed the role of head of strategic projects.  Leaving Standard Bank in 2011, I established Celtic Advisory International, providing capital raising and development advisory services to corporate and emerging companies.  </p><p> I was asked to return to Ireland at the end of 2011 to become CEO at a troubled AIB that had been rescued by the Irish taxpayer following investments of &euro;21 billion.  Together with the then chairman, David Hodgkinson, who joined in late 2010, we set about a daunting task that involved a radical restructuring of the bank and its balance sheet, the implementation of a &euro;350 million cost-cutting programme, an overhaul of the bank&rsquo;s funding and pricing models, governance enhancements, and creating the ability to effectively deal with our challenged loan book.</p><p> Today AIB is a profitable organisation with key performance metrics in 2014 trending positive.  In particular: our lending levels are increasing; our impaired loans and arrears levels are decreasing; the bank's capital and funding levels have stabilised and are improving; the bank&rsquo;s organisational structure and risk framework have been restructured; the bank has received approval for its restructuring plan and passed the ECB-EBA comprehensive assessment; the bank has placed significant emphasis on meeting the expanded and enhanced regulatory environment across Europe.  Having returned the bank to profit and stability, it is my expectation that AIB will be in a position to return capital to the Irish State over time, subject to economic conditions and the wishes of our majority shareholder. </p><p> In conclusion, as mentioned, I have covered the six topics here.  I think the effectiveness of the bank's board governance is fairly well documented here, so I won't spend much time on that and we'll just deal with that in questions.  Our bank credit risk strategies and risk management strategies are significantly updated here.  I'd draw your attention to cash flow, credit lending, which is the most significant difference.  There are many other complementary and important adjustments that have been made in the bank, but that area is one of particular emphasis, versus what has been a practice in the past.</p><p> With regard to remuneration arrangements and bank's risk assessment, I'd just draw your attention to the fact that we are under the bank's placing agreement and restricted in that matter, but I have documented our philosophy with regards to that for the purposes of discussion, although it has been in practice not applied due to the restrictions that we have.</p><p> On the clarity and effectiveness of the nexus of institutional roles and relationships, I think one area of emphasis that I will discuss is the fact that we are supervised in reality by the SSM, and so all decisions on capital funding, appointment of senior persons up to and including my replacement as a CEO, are at the behest of the European supervisors.  I think those were the four that I particularly wanted to mention out of the six.  </p><p> I would say that the liquidity and capital will be an extensive discussion, so I won't try and select components of that.  And with regards to item 5, on the appropriateness and effectiveness of domestic policy responses, and in particular NAMA, I don't have much experience of the history prior to my arrival, but I'll endeavour to answer questions as best I can.  </p><p> In summary, I wish to thank the committee of inquiry for considering my account as documented.  I fully appreciate the difficulties you face in dealing with such a weight of information from so many witnesses.  The banking and economic crisis in Ireland has indeed been staggering, the impact of which I could not fully understand until I returned to Ireland and witnessed the consequences first hand.  I hope that my statement to you has assisted the committee in appreciating how, in spite of the depths to which it plunged, the bank has been stabilised and restructured and should go on to support the Irish economy and the Irish people, as it should rightly do.  Chairman, that concludes my comments.  Thank you.</p></speech>

I'm going to start where you have finished, Mr. Duffy.  "The banking and economic crisis in Ireland has indeed been staggering, the impact of which I could not fully understand until I returned to Ireland."  It's a term not that often used by bankers, who tend to be more conservative with their language, the term "staggering".  Could you explain why you chose that term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.887" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#LL00400"><p>Well I think the thoughts leading to that kind of phraseology would not intentionally have tried to be inflammatory or excitable.  They refer to the significant scale of the financial numbers involved in the rescue of AIB.  The original &euro;21 billion which was invested in AIB as capital was only part of the equation.  In the first year of my taking on the role we had an additional obligation to deleverage a further &euro;20 billion of assets under the direction of the troika regime.  So that was another &euro;20 billion, an almost coincidental number.  Prior to that we had to deliver a very significant portfolio of assets to NAMA at a very significant discount with another capital impact.  In addition, assets had to be sold in various other jurisdictions, notably, most significantly, Poland, but also the US.  So if you look at the cumulative effect of all of those numbers it was a shockingly large number, and in addition it wasn't just about those sales, those disposals, and those injections of capital.  The requirement to reduce the staff by pretty much a further 4,000 since I took over on a gross basis, and a further cut of &euro;350 million of costs, plus an overhaul of the entire structure, governance, culture, and leadership and executive levels, I would put all of those into the rare situation of having to do all at once in one bank as being exceptional and perhaps, therefore, staggering in terms of the scale.</p></speech>

When I refer to the team, as I have referred to them, I refer to the mix of skills, very importantly, as the first element; secondly to the experience base; and thirdly to the international experience base of the team.  I think it's very important, particularly sometimes when you're in a smaller universe, that you have best practice experience and benchmarks from within the universe, but also externally, and those who have the experience of crises perhaps before, perhaps not on this scale.  The recruitment effort that we had sought to find the best in class for each position, and in each position we looked to see if there was a capability that had experience of how to manage significant change management programmes which was, as I mentioned earlier, fairly massive in its scale, and also had the competence to deliver on a model which we were designing which was, in our minds, being structured to prevent a recurrence of any similar catastrophe in the future.  That skill base and that intellect and that experience, domestically and international, was something we took two years to put together, it was challenging, but we succeeded, and I'm very confident in that team today.</p> <p>  I think the comparisons to the past are not directly linked, because what we are faced with is a challenge as a change management universe and a restructuring universe is very different than a business-as-usual management universe, so regardless of whether somebody was competent or not in the past, the skills required to do what we had to do, where every single action was almost simultaneous and in a very short window of three years, were different skills than existed in the team at the time.</p></speech>

I just know of all of the components that I had to deal with, and there was shareholder loss before my arrival, so I can't quantify that exact amount.</p></speech>

Also in your opening statement you state, "Clearly upon my arrival at the bank there were concerns about the bank's culture and governance."  How far did those concerns that you identified go back within the bank?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.897" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#LL01400"><p>Senator, I don't think there was a particular timeframe of reference.  What I am implying by that comment is that on my arrival, when I met with the regulators, there was some dissatisfaction with our process, our control, the quality of our relationship, our communications.  The bank had, during the period prior to my arrival, seen a number of CEOs and new heads, so there was a bit of disarray.  There were impending material programmes, such as severance, which were outstanding 16 months at the time of arrival.  That level of uncertainty and changing leadership meant that the organisation was not in a sufficiently effective place from a regulatory interaction perspective as regards the regulator's opinion.</p><p>Similarly, our shareholder in the Department of Finance in the shareholder management unit did not yet have the confidence on what the strategy would be to recover the bank as we had not obviously had time to explain that so there were concerns about how we would approach that and how effective we could be in delivery.  So it was that level of interaction that led to my comment where there was a concern.  Did we have the right skills, as I mentioned earlier?  Did we have the right leadership?  Did we have a strategy that would be agreeable to, and comply with, the requirements of both the regulator and the troika?  All of those elements were uncertain at the time.  I myself did not know the full extent of the problems until I had spent a bit more time there but those were very clear issues that were relayed to me by the individual stakeholders at the time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.900" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#MM00300"><p>I think my greatest concern relates to what is necessary to run a bank well and that starts with culture.  I think there was an organisation that had been through too much change in leadership, had been through a shocking crisis in terms of shock to the system of internal as well as external.  There was a huge amount of uncertainty.  There was a fear about the individual roles.  It was so much of a distraction that we needed to be able to be very clear up front that the bank is not there for itself, it's not there to worry about itself; it is there to serve customers and delivering a customer culture.  In other words, every thing that gets done in the bank, every process it serves, the customer had to be prioritised.  How could we do that?  That meant customers not just in the normal course of banking, but it meant the significant population who were in distress and arrears at the time for which we had no capability ... so creating that culture which recognised that the priority was not necessarily an internal focus, the priority was an external focus and that meant shifting the culture of the bank to an external lens and then applying all the lessons that we needed to recover the bank to that lens.  So that would be the first issue.</p> <p>  The second issue was, I think, operational risk.  You had a bank that had been through so much recent turmoil, it was not yet certain of the outcome.  We had very many staff leaving, senior people leaving, and an awful lot of the organisation was in stasis.  It was unable to move, it wasn't sure which direction to go, it wasn't sure of its future.  So that uncertainty and operational risk that it generates ... Are people doing their job?  Are they managing the processes?  Are they implementing the controls that we should have?</p> <p> The third area would have been the functioning of the bank in its purpose, which primarily is to lend to customers, that risk aversion was very material at the time.  People weren't sure of what the capital structure was, whether our funding was stable and, therefore, were very, very adverse to taking decisions on lending.  So there was a very significant adversity to taking risk in the bank and that aversion meant that I couldn't be sure where the revenue profile and the cost profile was going to end up in the first six to 12 months.  So I think if ... you know, I'd want to reflect in time if I whether there was any change in that priority but I think culture is overarching.  It's overwhelming in terms of success or failure and then the other two follow from that.</p></speech>

I don't believe that by any manner of definition that you would apply that it is complete and finished work.  I believe that we have stabilised return to stability, applied all of the appropriate governance that we would wish to have to prevent reoccurrences of this magnitude, but I still think we are on a journey in terms of deeply embedding a culture which is about delivering for our customer rather than the lifestyle or livelihood that you have by being in a bank.</p></speech>

I think what is required is experiential learning.  It is embedding everything that we have put in place.  The governance model covering every aspect of the bank from credit risk to our operational risk to lending and trading risk needs to be practised at all levels of the organisation.  The ultimate test of this will be time and tone at the top is where we have focused such that will  be fed through the organisation through all aspects of the organisation.  So it was ... I don't think there are material new developments to be implemented.  I do think there is a significant amount of practice of best in practice governance that needs to be applied and learned from before we can be comfortable that it is a fully completed exercise.</p></speech>

I think my observation would be more limited to what was happening internationally.  I think there was a crisis that was sown a long time before it happened.  When you originally had Glass-Steagall allow retail and investment banking come together, that created a potential significant leverage and, ultimately, greater risk in the system.  When you add to that the techniques of distribution around the globe and securitisation of asset classes where the well known subprime category and many others were combined in tranches of debt which were sold around the world, you spread that risk. which was already highly leveraged.  Then on top of that, the light regulation or principles-based regulation, as it was mentioned, in numerous forums existed and the covenants and documents for loans became less restrictive and lighter and more forms of collateral were acceptable in any circumstance.  And that principally allowed collateral on real estate to be offered up as part of the credit process.  If you look at all of those taken together I think it was common practice across the globe to use real estate as collateral hence the subprime crisis that occurred globally.  And that then was something of a cultural herd mentality that existed around the world in many countries and was no different here in Ireland.</p></speech>

You can't borrow unless you can afford to repay it and, therefore, I think the level of borrowing perhaps would not have been as extreme or as large and significant individual cases as the cash flow would have to be demonstrated.  With collateral you tend to have value rather than cash flow so it's not provable that you can repay the loan; it's implied that you can pay the loan based on future values.  Those future values are subject to, as we've seen, asset class corrections.  So I think, judgmentally, I would say if you are lending on the basis of cash flow, that evidence is an ability to pay, you won't be absolutely able to avoid any crisis but you would certainly be able to be in a stronger position for repayment on your loans.</p></speech>

In terms of debt forbearance, and a moral hazard between mortgage write-down and-or SME corporate write-down, could you just outline your view why you so quickly moved to that position?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.912" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#MM01500"><p>I think the philosophy we adopted at AIB in respect of any compromise on debt was again around the simple principle of affordability.  We started out with two principles.  If we wanted to keep people in homes wherever possible and if we wanted to protect SME jobs, what would the best approach be?  We didn't necessarily take the view that someone would have to stay in their home.  It may be a suitable home.  We took the view that SMEs should be protected only when the business was viable and then when we applied those principles and looked at the financial aspects of each of the cases, we took the view that if it was clear that the debt was simply unaffordable, there are many extremes.  You can have an SME that had a property investment strategy on multiple buy-to-lets in concert with two other businesses or individuals in a small town where the income ratio would imply that to recover the debt might take something in the order of 50 to 100 years, depending on your assumptions.</p><p>If there were extreme cases where you could not see any circumstance of repayment, we thought that on balance it was better to be realistic about that debt structure and to put ourselves in a position where the SME could return to supporting its business and its employment that it had originally started out with, and that would be constructive and positive for the economy.  Secondly we would be, in the case of an individual and the home and looking at exactly the same situation, there are many examples of cases where it was more attractive for the individual and for the bank, for the individual to remain in the home.  If I may give you an example.  If an individual had purchased a house, as was in one case for &euro;400,000, and if you were to evict the individual in the house - on sale in the market at the time was valued at &euro;100,000 - and at the same time you could agree with the individual on &euro;200,000 or &euro;250,000 as an affordable long-term debt repayment, then you would maybe compromise on the residual debt but at the same time the individual remains in their home.  They are functioning in the economy and they are repaying far more for the shareholder than would have been obtained by a simple repossession and eviction.  It was that thinking that we constructed around all of those.  They were very exceptional and treated all individually, very consistently.</p></speech>

I am in a position though, however, to say that from my involvement with NAMA, which was necessarily close both in terms of asset transfers that had happened and the ongoing servicing of the residual assets for which the staff of AIB were still retained, I think the experience I had was that it was extremely helpful to us in our ability ... the scale of what we had to do ... when you look back, it was extraordinary - the volume, complexity and concurrent nature of it and I think it was of immense assistance to AIB that we had that circumstance where we were able to execute all of our other initiatives with the support of our involvement in NAMA.  Also, the NAMA exercise for us gave us a better understanding on crystallisation of losses, of what the capital deficit was and what necessary actions needed to be taken.  So from the narrow view of our execution relationship with NAMA, I would have to say that on balance it was beneficial.</p></speech>

I would just say that the usage of consultants since I have arrived is materially reduced.  Once you can bring the expertise into the bank, the corollary of that is that you can significantly reduce your dependence on external consultancy.  And I think at the same time you will have external bodies continually operating if you have outsourced within a bank, so that's another aspect of this.  So I ... it's too complex to come up with an exact number but I would say that on balance, if the question is are there material amounts of expenditure and consultants contributing to AIB today, the answer is "No".</p></speech>

Mr. Bill Black, when he gave evidence, said ... his term that he used was "grow like crazy" is 30%.  AIB's figures from balance sheet growth from 2001 to 2008 was 29% year-on-year.  What, in your view, is a safe level of growth?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.927" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#NN01500"><p>I am not sure that I can say that there's any safe level of growth because I don't think growth targets are the criteria by which you would manage a bank.  I think you have a simple ... when you wake up in the morning running a bank you worry about liquidity, No. 1.  Secondly you worry about capital and they are the two priorities.</p> <p>  If you are going to lend, you have to have a threshold minimum of capital, which is not just the minimum regulatory capital but is probably that plus a buffer, where you would look to have a very conservative view on a stressed environment as to what that capital could become.  And that is your starting point.  You can then determine what your lending can be, providing that it doesn't breach those hurdles.  Secondly, your lending composition has to be understood in terms of your funding.  The history of lending had no regard necessarily to the composition of funding and you have two choices: retail longer term sticky funding as it is referred to, and wholesale funding.  If it is a short term, as wholesale often is and can be subject to flight in a very quick fashion as happened in Ireland, then long-term lending without short-term funding is going to put you significantly at risk.  </p> <p>  So I think you start off with two very careful principles - what is the minimum threshold of capital - which when in a stressed environment based on rapid asset deterioration, what is that level you should maintain - and is your funding correlated to that profile?  If you have confidence in those two then you can set a target of growth which doesn't breach either of those two objectives.  So I would never start with a number, I would start with the capital and the funding and then allow myself grow according to those definitions.</p></speech>

Not through any lack of enthusiasm or effort but when we arrived we were already on 18 hour days trying to define the future so I didn't spend a lot of time on the past, and what I looked at was what I just described to you in my previous answer - what are those thresholds that we need to safely run the bank for the long term.

Again, I know it was before your time, but you are exiting I keep telling you - you are going soon.  You may be able to offer an opinion.

I would be thoughtful about how my opinion ... I think when I look at the bank guarantee I look at the international world which I was more relevantly a participant in at that time.  I think in Ireland's situation you were suffering the consequences of what was happening globally, which was then exaggerated by the composition of the assets which each bank had here at the time.  Many of those situations involved banks being allowed to go under and many of those situations involved banks being rescued.  There were different logics applied in each of the circumstances.  I think in Ireland's case, were one or two banks allowed to go under, that probably would have created quite a risk for this country but maybe it would have been a position where there was finality a lot sooner ... but is impossible to predict.</p> <p>  There was no question in my mind that a guarantee of sorts had to be applied.  Banks don't make anything, they offer a service which is providing funding for commercial activities.  If there is a failure or a lack of confidence in a bank then there is no control that you have over that and your deposits will run out of the bank.  So if there wasn't a guarantee of some kind - I can't form an opinion as to whether it was the right guarantee or not - but if there was not a guarantee of some kind, the confidence in the banking system here didn't exist and it could have led to a more dramatic and severe outcome.</p></speech>

I can say though that, very explicitly, you don't chase market share and you don't chase competition.  What you do is you manage your bank to the limits of what your capital and funding is.  I think, if there's any lesson that can be learnt, it is that your priority as an executive, or a chief executive even, is mainly risk management.  You manage risk of the bank and everything you do in the bank.  And that starts with capital and liquidity and then you allow yourself any indulgence you would like sufficient to maintaining those thresholds.  So if somebody said to me, "You must double your market share," the very first question is: there's a lot of commercial discretion around that target, do you understand why?  But the very first question is: do we have the capital and the funding to do so whilst maintaining a conservative position in the event of stress?</p></speech>

Mr. Duffy, we've been privileged to have a number of bankers before the committee in the last number of days and each of them have apologised to the Irish people for the mistakes that were made in your bank.  As the previous speaker had indicated, you're probably best positioned, as somebody who came after the bailout, after the transfer to NAMA, but has an overview of what was going on within the bank.  In your view, what was the key areas that led to the bank costing the Irish taxpayer over &euro;20 billion?</p></speech>

If you have an over-concentration in a particular asset class, and in this case property, and you have a funding profile that has too much short-term funding in it and you are suffering what would be then a global liquidity crisis, then you are not well positioned to respond to that because you are going to see a very correlated reduction in the asset values which are going to burn through your capital very quickly and that uncertainty that that creates, without appropriate diversification, leads to an exit of deposits which turns a global liquidity or a domestic liquidity crisis into a solvency crisis.  So a concentration risk and a funding structure that was subject to too much short-term departure of your funding.</p></speech>

I would say that my opinion would be there would have been still significant pain.  I think the issues remain.  You had a short ... too high a content in terms of short-term funding and you had too large a concentration in single asset class, and either of those could have caused you pain.</p></speech>

But it's been suggested again before the inquiry, and the suggestion goes something like this, that the global liquidity crisis actually could have saved this State money in the long term because there was no indication that the banks were going to stop their concentration into the property and development and commercial property sectors.

It was very different than sub-prime, which was part of the global liquidity crisis in the US, but when you have an income, and if your income is rising 5% or 10% a year and the cost of a home is rising 30%-40% a year there's an elasticity problem.  At some point that breaks.  And so I think there are ... definitely the liquidity crisis put people at risk where there was over-concentration.</p></speech>

We've also been told that this was being worked out with the regulator and that this process may change in the future, but, as a banker, with the interest of your shareholders and that concern as one of your core priorities, is it prudent to go above the limits that were in place at that point in time or was it imprudent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.949" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#OO01600"><p>I'm not entirely familiar with the detail of those limits.  It depends on whether ... I'll make it very black and white, Deputy: if there are limits that are around the sustainable nature of the bank's existence, those are limits that you have to define as a banker, not somebody else.  Limits in the past I have seen, have been either indicative, guidelines, or tacitly accepted as too low, many different practices in different countries.  But, again, I regard that as interesting but not the criteria that you manage a bank by.  You yourself have to look to the sustainability of the bank under your fiduciary responsibility and in so doing you have to set the minimum capital and other thresholds that you have, and included in those are concentration risks.  The model which we have in the governance of AIB now is very explicit.  You are going to set limits, with the board's full involvement, to understand in all areas what your limits are at a maximum, whether by sector or individual.  Any breaches of those have to be escalated to the board risk committee, which is chaired by a non-executive, not the executive.  They are raised by the chief risk officer who, in our climate now, does not report to me but reports independently to the chair of the risk committee, who is a board member.  So I think you have to say: is the right answer whether you can or can't breach?  No.  The right answer is: what is the right concentration?  And you should not breach that if you think it's the right concentration.  You set those limits based on your minimum capital and funding thresholds.  That's the way I would work.</p></speech>

I think the fact that it was so heavily geared towards collateral and so concentrated in one asset class.  So I think the reality there is what you're doing is you're implying that there's a value in the future.  You're relying on third-party valuations for that value that you might obtain in the future and if it is such a large portion of your assets then any hit has a highly correlated negative.  If you don't have a large portion of that lending in that category or sector or individual based on cash flow, you have no real certainty.  You have an asset valuation model, not an income model to repay your debt.  So I think that's part of the problem.  There was a whole load of small issues you could consider, but in reality-----</p></speech>

When I was looking at this, before I got to AIB, this was happening in many jurisdictions in many countries, and the faith in asset prices rising and the encouragement by almost every professional in the industry to chase after the best market share in that area, those were the prevailing cultures at the time and those were the prevailing thoughts at the time.</p><p>It should probably have occurred to people that, like anything else, it can't ... asset prices, any prices, can't move in one direction forever.</p></speech>

I would tend to look at it as allowing such concentration in an asset class would suggest a weakness.  I don't know the individuals or the process, but I think there are many issues which I would look at today as being best practice which perhaps the industry didn't have at the time, not just AIB, but having a chief risk officer who is independent and having risk managers who are independent of the business, not allowing the business to originate and approve its lending, having all exceptions to any limit automatically escalated and supervised by the board directly.  Those are the things which probably didn't all exist at the time and certainly, for best practice, should exist.</p></speech>

I mean it is important to define what I mean by that, Deputy, the important differentiation, for me, is the chief executive or the executive cannot be the arbiter of your risk accumulation.  They can contribute, and the board contributes to a strategy, but when you are operating the bank, the people who originate must be separately accounted for in terms of those who approve.  So independence of the risk function is fundamental.  On top of that, the chief risk officer should not be reporting to the chief executive.  If you were, as in some banks in the world today, or as accepted, you were the chief executive and you have a chief risk officer and you are paying his bonus or variable compensation, then you cannot say with absolute confidence that there would not be a conflict of interest at some point.  So I think, one of the first things we did was, for both audit and risk, made sure the independence of reporting directly to a board member, non-executive, who chairs the risk committee is a fundamental principle of how you should operate.  So that, and then our ... all of our policies, all of our guidelines which I have tried to document in my statement, with limits, with exception reporting explicitly mandated and required to be reviewed at the board, with all of those elements I believe we have the appropriate governance to prevent a re-occurrence.</p></speech>

So if you'll forgive me just taking you through the latter, so in your strategy there is no commercial strategy unless you have understood your risk appetite and the framework for that and then that derives your capital funding.  In that risk appetite, we replaced everything, not just large exposures.  And we sat down and said, for a bank whose purpose is principally to serve Ireland, and that's is its sovereign obligation, if that is its sovereign obligation, what is the risk appetite?  And every policy should be resized and reformulated to align with that intent.  So that is what we did.  So every single sector and for single names and every asset class, we reformulated and put the policy in place that aligned to our sovereign strategy and at the same time, massively reduced the levels of limit in each of those categories so that the escalation was required at a much higher... a much earlier level in origination than would have been the case before.</p></speech>

So I think it can have, certainly an exacerbating influence.</p></speech>

How does this process compare and contrast with what you first saw when you arrived at AIB?</p></speech>

And much was made of it, I remember during my time in the UK, much was made of a leading financial centre because it operated a principles-based regulation.  Those were far less forensic and far less, you know, controlling.  I think, when I arrived, we could see that we were going to have to move to a world where we were absolutely clear in our mind as to what our risk framework and appetitive would be by sector and individual.  And we were going to, internally first, be very explicit in our evidence into the board and to the executive supervisory committees that we were compliant with those.  It then followed that obviously, and logically, the regulators moved to a point of wanting also to see the evidence of that.  If you fast forward to today, AIB is as I said, jointly supervised but by the SSM in Frankfurt.  And that is entirely an evidence-based system, so I think both internally and externally, evidence had to be your philosophy.</p></speech>

I am not sure if you have followed the proceedings so far, we have had contributors from NAMA in, which talked about, and there has been quite a bit of discussion at the committee in relation to loan-to-value ratios and what were the real loan-to-value rations that were being offered.  The suggestion has been made in many cases that the loan to value were 100%.  I want to put to you the evidence to the committee of Donal Forde and he said in relation to security and loan approval, it is on page 137 of his evidence and he... the quote is:<blockquote><br /><br />the difficulty arose because the security that we held, which in many cases was equity, also began to devalue very quickly.  So I think it's true to say that in the way things ultimately developed, we were left frequently where it wasn't cash that we had recourse to, but they were assets that were of much less value.</blockquote>NAMA has made the point, Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Daly who has been before, is that the loan to values in many cases and what they have seen transferred into NAMA were close to... were 100% in many cases.  Do you subscribe or dissent from either of those views presented by Mr. Forde or by the witnesses from NAMA?</p></speech>

I think there were circumstances that I saw of that nature.  I think the problem that I could see there is that, a bank should never be the first loss in any lending and putting equity into a transaction puts you in the position of being a first loss there in many circumstances.  Secondly, loan-to-values have to be very carefully considered; they should not be at 100% in any asset class even with guarantees.  I have seen in the crisis, in my previous bank, a loan-to-value of 40% become 100% in a matter of five weeks.  So they are an element but they are a spurious element, they cannot be the defining criteria of your lending.  And as I go back to the point, if you are relying again totally on asset valuations, and loan-to-values against an asset valuation and you have equity in the deal and no cash flow comfort, then you have a much higher risk.  So... hence our model today is cash flow lending, minor collateral but mainly cash flow lending.</p></speech>

Mr. Duffy, you weren't obviously at AIB; indeed ,you weren't in the country at the time of the bank guarantee.  You mention in your opening statement you were born and educated here, you worked as CEO for Standard Bank International.  I'm aware that that was a Standard Bank plc who we might recall in 2009 suggested that Ireland and Greece would end up going into a bailout by the end of the following year, or out of the European Union.  Unfortunately, one of them proved true.  Did you keep an eye on developments in Ireland from your role back in Standard Bank International?  Did you keep an interest in what was happening during that period?</p></speech>

But on a serious note, I also in operating the role I had, would look at funding allocations around the world for our surplus liquidity and where it would be housed and ,in that analysis, our risk team would come up with, as I referred to earlier, countries that they felt were suffering asset bubbles and asset risk.</p></speech>

There were lots of tables out there which were accessible to anybody in the public, indexes of property versus income, pricing movements across a high to low of Europe and, in all of those, Ireland and Spain were right at the very top and consistently so.  There was much commentary in the two years prior to the crash  in the <i>Financial Times</i>, in other magazines, in <i>The Economist</i>, people making humour of it; that the difference between Ireland and Iceland was six months and a spelling mistake.  I mean, so there was a lot of commentary before the event.</p></speech>

I was concerned with how long the elasticity between the growth of income and the growth of property go.  I was again, being anecdotally informed.

We've talked to him about his memo that he dictated on the 2 October 2008 in relation to the night of the guarantee.  In that there's a reference to a draft Government guarantee, which he says, "copy attached".  He informed the committee that that memo went to AIB.  In your time in AIB, did you see the memo that he dictated or the copy of the draft guarantee that seems can't be located?</p></speech>

We have sourced over 50,000 documents through every crevice of AIB in support of the committee's inquiry, and there is no evidence of any such document that I have seen to date.  It may well exist.  It may have been given to somebody else.  I don't know but I have never seen such a note.</p></speech>

I mean it's hard to articulate the environment at the time but, on arrival, the train was already travelling at 200 miles in a negative direction so the future was all you had.  It almost didn't matter what happened in the past or why it happened.  You didn't ask why did it happen, what lessons you learned; you asked what's the best in class in the world for those that survived this crisis and how do we put it in place as quickly as possible, so that was my disposition.

If I can the witness document that's up there on the screen.  It's page 39 and 40 of Vol. 2, AIB Bank 1.  In the document - this is a report that was carried out - it says, in the summary and conclusions of the EU report in the ... it's paragraph 3.9 of it, it says: &quot;Prior to the current financial crisis, AIB was a profitable bank with good growth prospects and the characteristics of a fundamentally sound bank&quot;.  This report you would have had sight of this I assume yourself. It says:<blockquote><br /><br />A key element of AIB's pre-crisis market positioning was its involvement in the Irish property sector which was the fastest growing segment of the Irish economy and this strategy was regarded as reasonable at the time.  AIB's enterprise bank, risk management and governance systems did not act as a sufficient constraint on this growing level of exposure to the Irish property sector.  This shortcoming resulted from weaknesses in the assessment of portfolio risk under stressed conditions, the inconsistent implementation of risk limits and poor credit management processes within the Republic of Ireland division.  AIB acknowledges that its decision to expand into property was misguided and that its risk management and internal governance systems were not as effective as they should have been in controlling this risk.</blockquote>This is in internal documentation produced by AIB.  Would you care to comment upon those value judgments that were made with regard to AIB's business model and model of governance?</p></speech>

So I wouldn't disagree with any of the comment in there.  I was quite happy with that report to be submitted or that proposal to be submitted to the European Commission.</p></speech>

It was put to them in the context of the - and Deputy Doherty has referred to this earlier - witness statement given by Mr. Daly and his opening comment when he says that:<blockquote><br /><br />While internal bank lending documentation may indicate that loan-to-value ratios were typically less than 100%, when the loan was drawn, the reality in many cases was that a developer's equity contribution was in form a rolling up of unrealised paper profit from other developments.  This was presented as an equity position, rarely if ever was it in the form of cash.</blockquote>And Mr. Daly then goes on to say<blockquote>In effect, therefore, the banks were providing all of the real cash funding for both acquisitions and development.  It is safe to say that quite often the borrower's paper equity position never paid for an acre of land or concrete or scaffolding or a worker's wage at the end of the week.  The safety zone of a borrower's equity usually existed only on paper.  The result is that the borrower was typically not the first to lose in the event of a crash.  The bank stood to take 100% of the losses and that's what's happened.</blockquote></p><p>Are those two documents more or less saying the same thing, or not?</p></speech>

I think the documentation kept by the bank in terms of its process was inadequate in many respects.  I think the composition of some of the loans were rolling up, loans which were classified as equity, it was poor practice if you look at a commercial norm.  I think when you look at a bank, it has lending and trading risk, it has operational risk and it has funding and capital risk.  The operational risk is something that will damage a bank materially.  If you do not have good process in a bank then all the other things in the world can go horribly wrong.  I experienced, as did the team on asset transfers, very poor documentation in lots of cases and we had a huge initiative within the bank to restitute that inadequacy.  Solicitors' undertakings would be a classic example.</p></speech>

Mr. Duffy, welcome.  Following on from the discussion before we broke with the Chairman, I want to raise the issue of solicitors undertakings.  It was raised with Mr. Gleeson and Mr. Forde last week.  I want to, I suppose, try and get a handle on how many of these outstanding matters in relation to loans that were entered into prior to your time in AIB, still remain on the books.  Has there been significant losses incurred because of difficulties surrounding loans involving these undertakings and in your 30 years' experience - almost - banking, is it or is it not unusual that seven years after the banking difficulties first emerged that such cases would still be outstanding at this juncture?</p></speech>

In 30 years, it only gives me four periods ... seven years, but I have been through a few crises and I can tell you that a crisis usually generates chaos in an institution and the ability to access and find documents and other parts of history usually get very confused.  So there is always a chaos around documentation, the degrees vary significantly, obviously depending on the institution.  That being said, it was a material concern for us in terms of the absolute level and back when I joined the bank, there were in the ... probably thousands, quite a few thousand, that were, you know, were really just not in our possession or at the level of satisfaction that we would like to have in our possession.  And, it has taken at least three years, to the first part of your question, to materially resolve that issue.  We still have some outstanding issues but we have an agreement in process to try and resolve those and that's going well.  But, nonetheless, a very unsatisfactory issue for an extended period of time.  A little bit ... the cause of it tended to be a disaggregated model where everybody was originating locally and storing their documents locally and it was in a file or in a drawer ... somebody said, "I'll get that to you next week", and it was never followed up.  Typical of a one-way traffic, high-volume type environment, without discipline and process.</p> <p>  Now with regard to losses, I couldn't tell you what the accumulative number is - I haven't looked at that - but it has not been a major issue for the bank.  It has been an issue case by case, but cumulatively not, I don't think, a material one.</p></speech>

I think that, you know, all markets, all commentators, all regulators, all others, felt that all banks were capitalised adequately and funded well in the run-up to this crisis and that is not an Irish-specific comment, that is all countries that were involved in the crisis.</p></speech>

I can ask you then again in relation to your previous experience ... this morning and last week and I refer to core document AIB B1, Vol. 1, page 87 ...sorry, I should say AIB B1, Vol. 1, page 16, in 2004 Jim O'Leary, who is an economist who was board member of AIB at the time, raised the issue of credit concentration in the construction and development sector.  This morning under questioning, Mr. Buckley, who was then the chief executive, stated that while the issue was raised in January, it was dealt with by the board in October.  In your previous experience, did you ... you know, does it tend to take nine or ten months for a commercial board of a bank to act on an issue being raised at board level and being minuted as a decision, ultimately, of the board to look into it?</p></speech>

If it there is an area of concern in a well-practised, well-governed bank, you will tend to respond very quickly, as quickly as required.  I don't know the circumstances of that delay but typically you would look at urgent matters on an urgent basis.</p></speech>

And, this was particular focus on the 200% threshold for lending into one particular sector of the economy and 250% for two related sectors.  The answer that has been given by most of the previous witnesses is that there was a process of change going on in relation to Basel II and Mr. Gleeson, last week, stated, and I want to put it to you, a direct quote, that "... this was not a regulatory standard.  It wasn't a statutory instrument or a rule; it was a guide to assist us in supervision of the banks."  First of all, I want to ask you did you see Mr. Gleeson's evidence last week?</p></speech>

I suppose is a reference to your previous experience ... would it be common practice that the chairman and the board would not act to ensure that the breach would be addressed, or would it have been common practice that, you know, such rules would be seen as merely guidelines?</p></speech>

I refer back to my statements previously which is that it is not for the regulator to set a guideline and for you then to just slavishly follow it, you must take into account that ... and if it's a rule you don't breach it, and report it if you do ... if it's a guideline, it's an input into your own risk management of the institution.  So I would take a view that, at that time, if it's being implied that it was a guideline, not a rule, and there was some suggestion that it was viewed as out of date, people may have taken a position in the bank, but I'm not qualified to comment on their rationale at the time.</p></speech>

As somebody who has vast experience before you came to AIB, and having looked back at, I'm sure a number of the loans that were made, maybe the larger ones in the period 2003 to 2008, by the bank, do you believe that any of the lending practices engaged by AIB in that period were reckless?</p></speech>

I believe that the issue of over-concentration was a bigger challenge than the terminology applied to it, allowing that concentration to get through to such a significant level was-----</p></speech>

Yes, and I'd ... maybe defer from using the word "reckless" within ... in terms ... what is your view?</p></speech>

So to be very specific on that, I am saying I couldn't comment on the terminology.  I would talk about the asset concentration being the challenge that the bank faced, rather than any individual loan being reckless, or whatever the word would be used.  So I don't have an opinion on the word "reckless".</p></speech>

Mr. Duffy, you say that you worked for ten years at Goldman Sachs International.  Can I ask you was that a good or appropriate training ground, do you think, for being subsequently in the most senior position of a bank that crashed following a property bubble?  And, perhaps by way of context, you'll be aware that Goldman Sachs was very heavily criticised in the wake of the crisis in the United States for allegedly speculating heavily on the subprime mortgage situation and crisis and famously or infamously, depending on one's point of view, was described in <i>Rolling Stone</i>as a &quot;vampire squid ... [with] its blood funnel [jammed] into anything that smells like money&quot;.</p></speech>

At the time it was a private partnership and it was ... in any circumstance if it had a loss, it was a loss of its own account, and the culture was obsessive about the customer and obsessive about the quality of your execution and I learnt a lot of good things at the time.  That has nothing to do with whether they did or didn't do anything subsequently in markets when they were no longer a private partnership.  But, my experience there was quite formative and instructive and quite helpful in future days.</p></speech>

Can I ask you to reflect a little bit on that, in the sense that the recapitalisation by taxpayers of AIB was &euro;20.7 billion.  On 26 February, the day before the general election in 2011, a further &euro;1.5 billion ... it is not commonly known by taxpayers, in my view, was transferred to AIB in NAMA bonds and deposits from Anglo, and Mr. McDonagh, the chief executive officer of NAMA, estimated that all the covered banks got effective state aid to the tune of &euro;10 billion by virtue of being overpaid &euro;10 billion from what the market might pay for the loans, and if we ascribe a proportion of that proportionately to AIB it would be &euro;2.83 billion, so that would be about &euro;25 billion in total in state assistance of one kind or another.  So, would it be more appropriate to rephrase your profit statement that there is at the end of 2014 ... the loss to the taxpayer has been reduced from &euro;25 billion to &euro;24 billion?  Would that be a more appropriate way to put it, perhaps?</p></speech>

So, it is still my belief that we will return all those funds to the taxpayer over time.  It is a matter of opinion as to how you should characterise it, but the output is that the State will get repaid all of its funds no matter how we characterise it in the interim.</p></speech>

It is not just about the tax repayment, there is a value by capital not having to be invested.</p></speech>

Would that be the way to explain it?</p></speech>

That is entirely true.  The value to the State is 100% of that, as the primary owner of the bank, and it is not without regard to the fact that the deferred taxation assets are the cause and have been of significant benefit to the State in terms of the bank's capital.</p></speech>

You referred to the opinionated people of west Cork, Mr. Duffy.  Would you say that the people in west Cork or, indeed, west Dublin might think that not paying a penny tax on profits until &euro;20 billion in profit is realised is paying twice for the same losses that the taxpayer has bailed out already?  Do you think they would be ... feel somewhat aggrieved, and do you think that might be a just, or not, grievance?</p></speech>

And there were various other interests, interest payments that were paid to AIB, perhaps a total of &euro;6.5 billion.  What did AIB do with the &euro;6.5 billion that it received from NAMA?</p></speech>

So, again, Mr. Duffy, to ask you, the taxpayer has bailed out AIB to the tune of &euro;20 billion-plus.  There are ... there is no corporation tax for 20 years perhaps and the billions that come in from NAMA's activities go into AIB, go straight to the ECB loans.  Again, could I could ask you would the taxpayer out there be justified or not in feeling deeply aggrieved at this, considering the pressure on their public services, health, education etc., and yet everybody is ahead of them in the queue, it seems to them?</p></speech>

My role was to stabilise the bank and prevent it from collapsing; to make sure that we could lend and support the Irish economy, without which the Irish economy couldn't grow, given the number of banks in the country; and, lastly, to address the issue of arrears and people in distress and try to recover as much of the livelihoods of people in homes and in businesses.  Those were the primary roles.  All of my actions are prioritised around those, as are the objectives of the board.</p></speech>

Deputy Kieran O'Donnell, ten minutes.</p></speech>

Mr. Duffy, can I just ... what have AIB learned from the crisis in terms of the banking model and in terms of their behaviour with customers?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1062" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#WW02100"><p>I think the primary learning is around the issue of culture.  If you run a bank, truly run a bank with a customer lens, it changes every behaviour and every process in the bank.  If you are running the bank in service of a customer, it changes the disposition of the staff and I think, if you are looking outside and you see that you are in a bank entitled to nothing other than the service of a customer, and if you do well you're entitled to an existence, if you get that culture into the bank, then many of the mistakes we made will be avoided and that's the single biggest lesson.  We need a culture in the bank that respects the fact that our job is the service of a customer.</p></speech>

How do you get to that point where people will have faith in the way banks operate, when banks are now beginning to recover, into the future?</p></speech>

It is going to take a considerable amount of time to rebuild trust as, referencing your example, I think that in rebuilding that trust you have to address the conduct issues, which are a regulatory, topical subject at the moment.  Conduct risk and how you behave, how you lend to customers, what you sell or don't sell to customers, the fitness for purpose of the product you sell to a customer.  That philosophy must become appropriately and deeply embedded in the culture, and if you do that you will start out well, and over time you will re-earn the trust of your customers.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1068" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#XX00300"><p>As a matter of just macroeconomics and war, you can never be absolute, but if you look at the more normalised expectations of all of us, everything we have done in the bank is to make sure that we are lending appropriately, that the risk associated with the lending is predominantly cash flow model driven, that the capital thresholds are the minimum regulatory plus a conservative buffer, and that our funding is long-term matched to our liabilities, not short term.  So if you look at the primary influences, they are in a shape that I think will prevent a risk occurring again, and, on top of that, we stress as a board quite extremely, as does the SSM independently of our board, the asset changes in pricing.  So I believe that all of those taken together will leave us in a relatively secure position, notwithstanding another crisis.</p></speech>

I know you've spoken earlier about growth not being the only parameter, but in terms of a percentage of loan book, what do you regard as sustainable?</p></speech>

I suppose the point is, do you view that the level of the percentage of the loan book being property and construction being at 25%, '04, rising to 37% in '08, was too big of a risk factor?</p></speech>

Someone in a home is very different than development land that's undeveloped.  One has an income paying a debt, and the other has none.  It has an asset value.  So it is too generic a description.  That being said, any single asset class or correlated asset class, like in property in general, being too high an overall percentage of your portfolio is risky.</p></speech>

I suppose international experience ... do you believe in terms of the structure of the guarantee ... I suppose two very quick questions.

I don't know what the final outcome would be because I can't predict that.  But certainly there would have been a high risk.  With regard to the second element of burden sharing, obviously if there was burden-sharing there would have lessened the burden for us and that would have helped the position but I don't know what the rationale for the decisions were as I wasn't here so I can't comment further.</p></speech>

You are very welcome Mr. Duffy and thank you for your engagement.  Just if I can pick you up on a question asked earlier on about I think by Deputy Doherty and the Chair as well.  When you joined the bank in late 2011 you said you didn't initiate any review or any internal inquiry as to what happened in AIB and how it came to the fate that it met.  Can you say why ... why would the board not have considered doing its own inquiry as to why a once traditionally conservative bank ended up having to be bailed out by the State with a bill of &euro;20 billion?</p></speech>

If I can put it into context, Deputy, in terms of what we were faced with.  In my first month I was sitting with a Troika and sitting with a shareholder and trying to understand the amount of time we had to come up with a solution and what we had as obligations to deliver.  To be honest every hour we spent looking backwards trying to understand the problem would be an hour wasted when we had to understand what the best model would be going forward.  And that's what we were spending all our time on.  So it's not that we were being careless it's just that we were being very considered around the future.</p></speech>

I don't think anyone is suggesting that you would have come in and prioritised doing a backward looking review, but the board should that had taken over governance who had a lot of new members ... do you know if they considered conducting any internal inquiry or review as to how the bank ended up with a very large bailout?</p></speech>

Thank you.  Can I ask Mr. Duffy in your experience how rare or how exceptional were the confluence of events and factors both domestic and international which lead to the banking crisis in Ireland and indeed elsewhere in September 2008?  How rare or exceptional an event was it or was it entirely predictable?</p></speech>

It's a once in a generation circumstance where the availability of a huge amount of liquidity including retail bank liquidity which wasn't available before in the sense that it was made available as well as geopolitical events where China in order to grow was very much a supporter of a cheap cost of capital through its purchasing of US debt despite the overall levels of debt.</p><p>That meant that the US consumer became very heavily indebted and that was a contributor to the property boom.  So there were many macro or geopolitical events that were fuelling cheap funding and property escalation of pricing.  With that there was also a light regulatory universe which ... of all of the asset classes in property many of which were sub-prime, they were packaged and securitised, distributed around the world with a mix of good and bad assets in those packages.  And rating agencies on top of that were rating the majority of these triple A.  So, bad risk was distributed globally with a high rating.  I don't think in history there has ever been a confluence of events around the scale of cheap money and the distribution of risk and the unknown element of risk contained in the securitisations.  That cheap money was allowing every market to chase property and when it collapsed in the sub-prime and then was further influenced by allowing banks to go bankrupt in the US, there were many more banks were very close to going bankrupt.  So the extraordinary measures of the US Government at the time, both negative and positive, if you put all of those together, it is an exceptional period of time.  Ireland's problem was that we were very badly positioned to react to that given our concentration.</p></speech>

I think the original mistake that started all this that was made, was that Glass-Steagall was unwound and that prevented retail deposits being given to investment banks.  Now once you put the two of them together you had a whole lot more money, a whole lot more leverage and a whole lot more risk.  A retail bank ... its purpose is, I think Lord Turner many years referred to it as "socially useful".  But it is serving the economy you reside in, for the purpose of growth of the economy that you reside in.  Doing so in a way that you're selling products that are suitable to those customers and frankly you should be a boring utility.  That's what banking should be.  It lost the run of itself, it got into all kinds of leverage and chaos that it should not have been in.  So, if you ask the question "Are some of the regulations better today?" - yes.  "Is the process better?" - some of it's a pendulum swing and maybe it's going too far in terms of the bureaucracy sometimes, but the spirit of what the intent is, I fully support.</p></speech>

And nobody had sales targets, so what I am trying to get to the bottom of, really for the people at home is... are branches set up and people put in place purely "Now you sit in there and you service the public if they come in" or are there targets given to regions or branches or individuals to say, "Now look what we want to try and do this month is sell X amount of investment products and Y amount of loan products" and so on?  In essence the question is, did a targeted environment, albeit phrased in a different way ... I know that there was the... the people profit index, is that what it was referred to?  Your predecessor mentioned something like that earlier on.  I may be getting it wrong and the record can correct me.  Did a target culture - and you have mentioned a cultural change - have an unintended...albeit unintended consequence to drive more mortgage product sales?</p></speech>

I think, from the observations of the previous market, there was a competitive universe, including many overseas competitors coming in with more attractively priced and higher LTV products and driving a market share battle which led everybody down that path.  If you look at what are we doing today to be more specific, our position is controlled by our risk appetite.  As you've said, I've correctly said, the liquidity in the capital are your baseline thresholds which you must maintain adequate resources for.  And then, beyond that  when you sell, you can't just sell any amount of anything, there has to be limits within each part of your portfolio and those are strictly monitored and then obviously that's the margin.</p></speech>

It's just that my time is short and I know it has taken me a while to get... to ask my questions.</p> <p>  Again, we know we are talking about your tenure, but again given your international experience and while you have pointed out to other members that you focused on the future and getting things right and I'm sure you that you've done that very well, but in your international experience, was the culture of that time that, you know, target driven, sales driven?  I'm not going to allow the incoming foreign bank to eat my lunch, so get out there and lend more products, lend more money.  Was that happening?</p></speech>

And I can say one thing that I take away from that environment, what it did was drove market share chasing and margins come down and products were inappropriately priced.  And that is where you have got high volume trying to compensate for what was a declining margin over ten years.  And in today's environment we have barely crawled out of it, and we are already starting to talk about how much all the margins or rates should be cut.  We have to be very careful.  The issue is not so much whether you are volume selling; the issue is concentration risk and the issue is having appropriate margin to have capital to protect you in the downturn.  That's my observation from that period.</p></speech>

Former chairman of the bank, Mr. Gleeson mentioned in his testimony that interest rates during the crisis period were too low and suggested that using the Taylor rule, that they should have been between 6% and 12% or thereabouts and he further said that under the ECB's statute, article 14.3, that the ECB could and should have directed the Central Bank here to introduce measures to cool the market, let's say.  That was the thrust of what he was saying.  Would you have a view on that?</p></speech>

I think that's been evident by their actions on setting mortgage limits, so there is a role for a regulator to play.  You can't regulate a commercial market, but you can contribute to the common sense applied in that market.  The mortgage limitations, the loan-to-value, etc., I think, are sensible, so there is a value to that input from a regulator.</p></speech>

What was at risk was a commercial model were you relied on volume to compensate for declining margin.  And at the end of the day a 2% tracker mortgage is below your cost of funds.  And that means you're loss making at tracker levels and that cannot be healthy for the bank in the long term.</p></speech>

If, maybe, I could just refer to two items just following on from Senator MacSharry's questioning.  I just want to refer to document reference AIB B1, Vol. 1, page 87.  And what there are here are a summary of main findings.  These relate to review focused at enterprise at Republic of Ireland level.  This is an AIB document and if you scroll down the page there, it's about the fourth line, it says in there, Mr. Duffy, that in short "the main trust of the Business in ROI [this is the AIB Republic of Ireland model] was to focus and volume [I presume that there's a spelling error there, that should be focus "on" volume] market share-driven loan origination.  This was achieved by growing property advances and related income in an unbalanced manner."  Would you care to comment upon that?</p></speech>

What I saw was a very ambitious growth market share level in all banks and every adviser that I have seen reports of or heard of spoke to the banks encouraging them to compete with each other on a more aggressive basis.  So it would not surprise me to see a comment like that.</p></speech>

There was a practice there ... or not?</p></speech>

Just on the broader context ... and to ... just a comment that you made earlier with regard to property diversification and that these are separate, stand-alone silos and that the risk is separate in all of these and so forth.  I want to challenge the ...that assumption if I may and put it to you ... is that the subdivision of property portfolios into different classes, i.e. development land, office block, housing ... are they not actually both in the lead-up to the crisis and in the post-crisis period and even now ... but in the downturn ... or in a downturn or crisis ... these subdivisions, are they not actually quite closely correlated and related to one another?  And they're not actually diversified, as we would say, in that when the prices drop in one sector, they usually drop in the other sector as well.</p></speech>

The perspective we have on that is that at a high level we have a portfolio management approach, which is that all of those assets are correlated.  And in a small country in an open economy with the connections between those different assets and the borrowers, you have to be extremely sensitive to that fact.  So I fully agree, Chairman, that is a high correlation risk that you must be very attentive to.  Why we do the segmentation is to make sure we limit each of them and to make sure that we understand that you don't want to have too much development land or too much mortgage or too much retail, you want to have a balance between them, with income coming from them rather than asset valuation protection.  But we absolutely accept that correlation risk has to be very conservatively managed.</p></speech>

We addressed all of those.  There is no variable and all of the other benefits were either curtailed or eliminated.  In terms of salaries and associated elements.  We cut a lot of the salaries.

I don't have a view on what is appropriate.  I think the market has to determine that.  If you look at the small community of banking in Ireland, there's a bank CEO on twice my income.  There is another bank on twice that income, CEO.  So same jobs, same street, a bus stop away, massively different.  I think it is very specific to the circumstances.  The one thing I would say about compensation and I believe this passionately; it is not so much the number, it is who bears the risk with that number.  My practical example, if you will forgive me for a second, Senator, is I am used to a culture where I was paid a variable amount of compensation.  It was deferred for three years pending the performance of the bank.  It was put in the shares of the bank, and if the shares of the bank tanked then I lost it.  At the end of that, it was also subject to a malice clause which is matching the duration of risk to the duration of my bonus and could be ... and 100% could be clawed back.  So philosophically, I believe that is the only way you pay variable compensation and if there was a model in the future that allowed for that, the market drove it, investors drove it, I would very much believe that that is the kind of structure you put in a bank.  The shareholder does not bear the risk, 100% recovery for staff.</p></speech>

When Mr. McDonagh was here, in page 44 of his evidence, from NAMA, he said that:  "The colleagues concluded that when the loan-to-value ratios were examined, they were probably closer to 100% rather than the average that they'd averaged out at 77%."  I know you'd nothing to do with that, but, as a banker, if you look at that, how could it happen that a bank, a series of banks, could be so out of sync with what was found?  How do you arrive at that position?</p></speech>

It's not right, you have to be ... And that's where I go back to my principle, if you are not doing your loans on a cash flow lending basis, this LTV process can be very risky.</p></speech>

We had to build a restructuring unit which had to address all of those.  And those issues of income coming through larger real estate developers or others had been diverted, manifested themselves across the entire spectrum including individual homeowners or by-to-lets in other cases.  So we had not yet ... and it was one of my first priorities and, in later term, one of the top priorities of the bank to build a capability across all asset classes to address that and many other similar issues.   So, it was not being effectively done at the time of the asset transfer as we didn't have the capability.</p></speech>

The other issue I raised was in relation to advances to debtors by AIB, once NAMA was announced, until the loans were acquired by NAMA.  The Central Bank had said that it would be acceptable if NAMA deemed those advances to have been made on a commercial basis.  So, this is to the debtors that are moving into NAMA from AIB and AIB advanced &euro;595 million in that period but only 62% of that was deemed as being eligible and, therefore, as being made on a commercial basis.  Can you explain that?</p></speech>

And when NAMA did its review, it found that only 62% of that had been advanced on a commercial basis - 62% of &euro;595 million, so the amount that was eligible was &euro;367 million.  I mean that's a significant amount of money.</p></speech>

Just to explore with you the transition to "boring utility banking" as you call it, what loan-to-deposit ratio would you have in mind to illustrate success in that regard?</p></speech>

Today, we would be around 100%.  I think that level of loans versus deposits keeps you in a ... quite a conservative space and that is what we have now published as market direction in the market domain.</p></speech>

So, what have you got in mind for that particular one?</p></speech>

So I think a conservative governance and independent risk model, and a very careful segmentation, will lead us to a much safer place in that regard.</p></speech>

Because I see, in the 2006 report it says that when they examined the independent valuation they found that 13 of 25 cases tested were without valuations.  One in particular, Glencairn Homes, was for &euro;93 million.  So have you tightened valuation procedures in line with what the internal auditor found?</p></speech>

The internal audit function is ... Frankly any CEO who doesn't have a first class internal audit function puts themselves at personal significant risk.  That person is also an independent reporting person in that they don't report directly to me; they report to the chair of the audit committee, who is our SID and is also a non-exec, and a board member.  So, I have ... I can't direct audit.  So what I do is agree with the board audit chairman what exactly the priorities are for the year ahead and make sure they're executed, but that independence is fundamental.  All those policies behind your statement there were also revisited in light of that.</p></speech>

There were two events that were driving the circumstance of change, the first being that the regulators required us to concentrate back into the centre and centralise many of the governance and approval and risk principles around this.</p><p>Secondly, from my perspective I wanted the risk governance to be brought into the centre and the authority to be brought into the centre, whilst we fixed it.  To answer your question then in detail, we then decided that once we had control over it, and once we had confidence in our processes and our governance, we would allow certain decisions being made in certain categories of clients for specific reasons.  I can give you an example.  We said that we would approve an amount of money in 48 hours to an existing customer, provided we understood their credit history, and that would be at the delegated authority of the branch manager, so they could make that decision independently of the centre.  So that was what we introduced, but first we brought everything to base, restructured, put in the appropriate governance and only when satisfied with that, redelegated some portion of it.</p></speech>

I think it was in - not that I am picking on it, but the<i>Cork Examiner</i>made some comment that I supported the rules, because, in effect, our portfolio for the entire bank was better than each of the ambitious targets that they had in its total.  And, secondly, I believe you go back to cash flow borrowing.  Borrowing for a house, you have to be able to afford it, and I remember exactly what it was when I was looking to do the same in Ireland when I was young.  It was more or less what was announced recently.  So, again, it is consistent with my own philosophy on the utility nature of banking.</p></speech>

All issues are reviewed jointly and those issues involve capital decisions.  They involve the approval of my replacement.  The meetings, typically, are monthly.  I have one next week.  They are, typically, quite extensive.  They have a very large on-site presence, with frequent forensic reviews of different topics which they schedule throughout the year.

I think Ulster Bank has stepped back significantly into the marketplace.  You have seen PTSB regain some strength in its franchise through its raising of capital and its ambitions around its own market presence.  KBC has also made some further inroads and opened up some branches, so I think whilst it is not yet at a level that is truly, fully competitive, it is emerging, and I hope it will get stronger.</p></speech>

Maybe your career, in arriving in AIB was a bit like that as well.  Maybe you could tidy up one matter for us.  Deputy McGrath referenced it and Deputy Doherty referenced it and some other people referenced it as well.

I just say that if you are so concentrated in one asset class, and that the pricing of that asset class was disconnecting rapidly from the income evolution in the country, there was bound to be an inflection point where there was a revaluation of those assets downwards materially.</p></speech>

So the intervention at that particular time, in or around ... or what was happening ... it was not an intervention, but the event that happened in 2008 determined the extent to which the bank was then exposed, but there was potential that, if that event didn't happen, that the event ... that the exposure could have been greater?</p></speech>

The two years before I arrived, or year-and-a-half, involved multiple CEOs changing and then the executive chairman, David Hodgkinson, who took over.  I think my narrow lens on that, not having been here to observe it, would have been that the concentration that was built up was probably ill-advised and led to the exacerbation of the issues that the bank faced when the crisis hit, so from that perspective, I think that was unwise.</p></speech>

Mr. Duffy, we were talking about asset bubbles earlier on and concentration of lending into a certain area which had an asset bubble.  Do you believe that there's a property bubble under way at this point in time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1281" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Duffy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015042900002#JJJ01500"><p>My answer to that is I don't believe there's a property bubble.  I think there is an imbalance in Dublin.  I don't think that's representative, by any stretch of the imagination, in all other areas of the country.  The imbalance is a complex one of supply and demand.  I think the regulation from the Central Bank will have an impact slowing it down.  I think rents are too high because of that demand issue.  The requirement for the deposit size to make an entry into the housing market will have a material effect on first-time buyers.  If you go down to the other major cities of this country, you will see much less of a rise and much less pressure on housing and then there are other parts along the middle spine of this country where there is no pressure on the house pricing.  So, on balance, I don't see this as a property bubble.</p></speech>

If that were to be repeated in the next year, house prices in Dublin would exceed where they were in 2005.  Like, when should the alarm bell, or what would the level be that an alarm bell should go off in relation to a property bubble in Dublin?</p></speech>

I think, if you start to build between 15,000 and 20,000 and 25,000 houses, depending on the ... it'll take a while to build to that, over the next three or four years, that continuum, you might have some spikes up and down but, on balance, you will have a more normalised market.  We do need that housing supply.</p></speech>

It can be in the past caused by credit, or in the future caused by, or in the present caused by lack of supply.  And to take me onto that question you mentioned about the interaction that AIB is having with six developers.  I think you've mentioned last July that you were looking to fund 5,000 houses in the Dublin market.  Has that shown any traction, as you expected in 2015 that there'd be significant traction?</p></speech>

A lot of it is now either shovel ready or processes of development that has started the building.  A lot of complexity in getting infrastructure approval and getting zoning licences and planning permissions recalculated for the purpose that they were now intended.  But that is getting traction, and I think, like us, other banks will be engaged in the same activity, and I think you will see an escalation in the number of developments over the next six, 12 months, and that will build to a peak probably in three years' time.</p></speech>

I know you haven't released names of the developers and I'm not expecting you to release names of the six developers that you are, I think, talking about between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion of funding to be made available, but are you concerned that there may be a reaction from the public that AIB is back into funding major development in this way?</p></speech>

I don't.  We are ... they have to put in equity and we will put in debt, and it will be very much geared around their ability to repay.  So I think the changed model gives me confidence that I could articulate that to the general public.</p></speech>

Yes, yes, well that was kind of looking forward for how do we prevent what's happened in the past.  But in relation to your opening statement you talk about the need to deleverage to meet the newly-proposed Basel III ratios and also the demands of the Troika.  How has AIB deleveraged its loan portfolio, and can you give us a sense of the type of loans that AIB deleveraged?  In your view, if it wasn't for the Troika's demand would AIB have been better to hold on to them for a while longer?</p></speech>

There was some miscellaneous property portfolios around this country which we probably would have sold, and there was some which, in the benefit of hindsight, if we'd seen the speed of the recovery, you might keep.  So there's no explicit black and white answer, it's a combination of the above.  But I think the significant portion of that portfolio would have been for sale in any case.  It has allowed us, additionally, create the space in our capital structure to lend at the levels which we're seeing today, which is new lending stimulating the economy, and more valuable therefore, so a little bit of positive comes out of it in any case.</p></speech>

In your view, having been at the helm of AIB for a number of years now, given that the bank was a publicly owned ... or privately owned bank, it is practically now in full public ownership, and has potential to return to private ownership again, do you believe that it's in the best interest that the bank would now become a private bank once more, or would be developed into a publicly owned bank on behalf of the State?</p></speech>

I think that running an institution like the AIB is very complex.  It isn't as easy as it looks.  You need smart people, you need to get the best people for the market, you need to pay them what you need to pay them to do it right.  I think that in that circumstance, you know, opening up to a participation, I'm not saying sell the entire bank, but selling a material amount that allows you freely operate on commercial terms in the marketplace, with a significant participation by the State, that hybrid of the future would, I think, be the appropriate model.</p></speech>

We are joined by Mr. John Dunne and Ms Catherine Cox from the Carers Association, Dr. Joanne McCarthy and Ms Joan O'Donnell from the Disability Federation of Ireland, and Dr. Devesh Singh, Mr. Tony Kieran and Ms Catherine Kellaghan from the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>The Irish Medical Organisation was also invited but its representatives were unable to attend.<br/><br/>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.<br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask everyone to turn off their mobile phones completely or to switch them to airplane, safe or flight mode, depending on their device, otherwise they interfere with the broadcasting equipment.  This meeting is being broadcast live.<br/><br/>I invite Mr. Dunne him to make his presentation on behalf of the Carers Association.</p></speech>

Today I will talk specifically around carer-related social welfare payments and the medical eligibility criteria, in particular, carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  We were part of the domiciliary care allowance, DCA, review process over the past two years and we are happy that the changes made have brought about considerable improvement, particularly for parents caring for young children with pervasive developmental disorders, PDDs, such as autism.  We have been part of that process and are happy that we have worked closely with the Department on that.</p> <p>  I refer to the issues facing family carers on the ground.  The fact that 50% of carer's allowance appeals are successful causes us concern and while it shows that the Department is honest in the appeals process, the problem lies with the fact that not enough information is being sought or given at the application stage.  We are working with the Department on this.  The application form is 24 pages and that is the amount of space that is given to put in the care duties the carer is providing.  That is far too little and we would like to see the introduction of a daily diary that family carers can fill in. This would prompt them to fill in the details of the person for whom they are caring and the issues they face relating to supervision, personal care and whether there are actions the person being cared for takes that would put him or her or others at risk.  We are also working with the Department on this.  The diary will also deal with medication and the therapies the person is receiving, which will give a more holistic picture of the level of care being provided.  In the absence of a face-to-face assessment, the person looking at the form can see at a glance that high levels of care are required.</p> <p>  We believe that question No. 10 on the medical form is flawed.  I will not go into this as it is quite technical but we have outlined this in our submission.</p> <p>  Family carers who care for an adult with PDD, an intellectual disability or mental health illness face another problem.  The form is strong in capturing information about somebody with a physical disability but it does not capture the issues faced by somebody with a mental health disability.  In other words, it leans heavily towards physical disability and it is very much a medical model rather than a social model.  For example, a person could be caring for somebody with a mental health illness or an intellectual disability who does not understand money or who cannot use public transport or travel on a bus or who may be vulnerable in relationships or vulnerable to addictions or may have suicidal thoughts or aggressive.  None of this is captured in the current application form, which is weighted towards older people and those with a physical disability.  This, in turn, proves burdensome for carers who must provide extra reports, which is costly and time consuming.  It also places an additional burden on the Department because cases are appealed and it takes more time to review them.  In the interests of fairness and consistency, we ask that the DCA review be extended to review the carer's application form.  We acknowledge that the Department is reviewing the improvements to the DCA and it wants to do that to make sure the changes working well for everybody.  We would like carer's allowance to be reviewed as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The medical assessment presents another difficulty for carers.  Carers express extreme frustration when their GP has submitted and signed off that a person requires full-time care but this is often ignored by the medical assessor who does a paper assessment.  We understand and sympathise with those views.  We ask for a change in current practice in order that there would be a single integrated medical assessment process which would look at health, income support and education.  It would cover all those rather than having separate assessments.  We ask for them to be combined.  It would be more efficient but also more humane to the carers applying for the payment.</p> <p>   While we acknowledge the processing time for applications improved dramatically in 2013 when the gap reduced from 26 weeks to 12, we have noticed over the past 12 months that it has begun to increase again.  We ask that this be looked at.  We acknowledge the Department is working to improve that.</p> <p>  We welcome some initiatives by the Department in recent days.  It has introduced a process whereby if an application comes in and the officials feel the medical information is not sufficient, they will go back to the carer and seek more information before they stop the payment.  That is a welcome improvement in the system.</p> <p>  We have highlighted many of the issues I have highlighted to the Department and we are working closely with officials, particularly on the daily diary.  We feel that would improve the position of family carers and the Department is keen to work with that.  We discussed that at the recent annual forum for carers and there seems to be a positive move towards introducing something like that.  We welcome the improvements to the DCA process and those improvements should be spread out to the carer's allowance and carer's benefit processes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1309" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Joanne McCarthy" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042900002#C00500"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss this important issue.  The Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, represents the rights and expectations of those who live with disabilities to be fully included in Irish society.  We are an umbrella organisation that supports more than 130 member organisations and these support and provide services to all people with disabilities whether they are hidden, physical, intellectual, mental health, sensory, neurological or emotional.</p> <p>  This issue has been high on the DFI agenda for some time.  We have an internal network of interests.  The membership is drawn from people with disabilities and interested organisations around social protection and the issue we are here to discuss has come up through that</p><p>We participate on the Department's disability consultative forum and, along with other disability organisations, brought this issue to the Department and we acknowledge that the Department ran with an initiative to address it.  For all of us here, this has been an ongoing issue.</p><p> To epitomise some of the challenges we are facing, and I will refer only to the disability allowance because I do not want to go into all the payments to which this relates, we know from the Department's own statistics for 2014 that there were over 111,000 people on disability allowance.  In that same period, 27,000 decisions were made on disability allowance eligibility and over half of those were refused on the first application.  We know that during the same period almost 6,000 disability allowance appeals were heard and that two thirds of those were granted.  It is clear from that snapshot of the Department's own statistics that a disproportionate number of people are being refused disability allowance on the first application, which highlights to us that there are procedural questions that must be asked about protocols and the way systems are operated.  Members will appreciate the stress that is causing for the people with disabilities and their families who are involved in submitting these applications.</p><p> Drawing on our own work, which Ms Joan O'Donnell chairs, in terms of our network of interests and also the work that has taken place through the initiative of the Department of Social Protection we are using that as our raw data to support what we see as some of the core issues facing us when we talk about this issue.  First, we believe the decisions are made largely on a medical assessment.  In most cases, that is a desk-based analysis.  It does not give persons with disabilities or, as we heard earlier, carers the opportunity to describe the impact the disability is having on their capacity to work or otherwise.  It does not provide the opportunity to perform a holistic assessment on that person.  The members might use slightly different terms but we are looking for the opportunity of a much more holistic assessment that will examine not just the medical issue around disability but how that has an impact in terms of someone's physical or mental well-being.  I refer also to the family circumstances that person may be in or the other inter-relations that take place.  For example, if someone who wants to go to work it will vary depending on the educational capital that person has at hand.  That is the first issue that is arising repeatedly through our engagement on this issue.</p><p> Second, there is evidence to suggest that for the Department, the medical assessor's opinion is taking precedent.  This was substantiated significantly in recent case law in the case of a personal application for a domiciliary care allowance where it was found that the assessment did not give what they called due weight to the professional reports from other professionals or multidiciplinary teams that work with the claimant on an ongoing basis.  It found that the Department's mindset was that these professional reports were coloured in some way in favour of the applicant.  In their findings they said they felt that this was not an isolated case and an issue that was persistent.</p><p> What we are saying is that equal regard to all forms of assessment reports must be put on the table, not just the medical assessor's report but also other reports that support people to live with a disability on a daily or weekly basis.  Also, we need to highlight the fact that the way decisions are being made is inappropriate.  The concept of that desk-based analysis is inappropriate.</p><p> The third issue that arises repeatedly in this regard is the wide perception not just among people with disabilities but among general practitioners and other allied health professionals that, typically, people are refused at the initial application stage.  People often expect that their application will be refused so they withhold information to substantiate any appeals process.  There is also the sense, and we got this from our discussions with people with disabilities, that they believe the appeals officers operate more independently in their decision making, and that is fuelling a particular take within the system.</p><p> There are other concerns that interweave with what we would see as the three main areas.  For some people it would be the cost of the appeals process.  Often people are asked to get independent consultant reports which they have to fund themselves.  There is also widespread misunderstanding about the types of payments, how one can apply and the level of information required on the application form, and that is having an impact.</p><p> There is a much wider issue, which the OECD stated in 2008, that people with disabilities get parked on these payments.  They are not able to access activation measures, similar to people on the live register.  The members will be aware of the level of rejections of appeals.  Many people with disabilities are almost too frightened to take the risk and investigate whether they could go back to work or further education.</p><p> We have spoken a good deal about high level policy issues we believe must be addressed when discussing this topic but we are anxious that the members do not lose sight of who it is we are talking about in terms of the people making applications.  We know from the census of population that there are almost 600,000 people with disabilities in Ireland.  We also know that in 2014, just over 111,000 of those were on disability allowance.  This is a particular cohort of people who are seeking this support and resource from the Department.  They need to understand that those people probably feature in the statistics to which I am about to refer.  </p><p> We know that in 2010, 40% of people with disabilities do not go past first level education, as opposed to 50% of the general population.  Some 21% of people with disabilities aged between 15 to 65 are in work, compared to 50% of the population.  We know also that 53% of people with disabilities are living in deprivation.  That figure has risen significantly since 2009 when the figure was 36%.  Those people are bearing the brunt of the recession and are significantly dependent on social welfare payments to ease some of that burden.</p><p> In summary, the Disability Federation of Ireland believes there is strong evidence to show that it is time to review the medical eligibility criteria for illness and disability payments and that these claims are substantiated by a number of sources.  We know from our internal working group in the DFI, our network of interests, that there is an ongoing issue.  The Department's statistics bear fruit in that regard.  We also know, and it is now supported in case law, that if we are to be honest-----</p></speech>

We have a national disability strategy to protect and ensure that people with disabilities have access to appropriate income.  We have a Department that states it will ensure its systems of payment will support people to participate, and that includes back-to-work supports.  If we are to ensure that social welfare payments are part of those supports for people with disabilities, we must ensure also that we review not only the eligibility criteria but also the wider schemes.</p></speech>

I thank my colleagues in the Disability Federation of Ireland and the Carers Association for their comments.</p> <p>  Before I commence my presentation I would like to introduce myself.  I am Dr. Singh, deputy chief medical officer.  I am accompanied by Ms Catherine Kellaghan, principal officer, based in Longford, with responsibility for disability allowance, invalidity pensions and carer's allowance; and Mr. Tony Kieran, principal officer, based in Letterkenny, with responsibility for the domiciliary care allowance, DCA.</p><p> I will start by sharing with the committee some information on the main illness, disability and carers schemes provided by the Department of Social Protection.  The Department provides a wide range of income supports to people with illness, disability or caring needs.  The importance of these schemes is underlined by the fact that in 2014 more than &euro;3.4 billion was spent on the various illness and caring related payments.  This accounts for around 17% of the overall expenditure of some &euro;20 billion on social protection in 2014.  On average, some 330,000 people received weekly payments from these schemes, excluding the annual respite care grant, during 2014.</p><p> The number of beneficiaries on all schemes has been increasing steadily.  For example, the total number in payment increased from some 230,000 in 2004 to some 330,000 in 2014.  Medical opinions are provided to the Department's deciding officers to assist them in determining eligibility for the relevant scheme.  These opinions are provided by the Department's medical assessors who are fully registered medical practitioners with at least three years experience.  Several of the medical assessors currently working in the Department have post graduate qualifications and experience in relevant specialties.  All undergo a structured and focused training programme on commencing their duties as medical assessors and are involved in a continuous professional development programme.</p><p> At the outset, it is important to point out that medical assessors do not contest or refute the diagnosis provided by the customers doctor; the objective of the medical assessment is to ascertain the impact of the disability on the customer.  That is, to assess the ability for suitable work or the need for additional care due to the illness or injury and the expected duration of recovery.  Medical opinions are based on all available medical evidence submitted with the application and, if available, any prior medical evidence held on file is also taken into consideration.  The medical assessor uses his knowledge, skills, experience and evidence based guidelines and protocols to provide an informed and unbiased medical opinion.</p><p> In undertaking the assessment process the medical assessor considers the following: first, the customer's impairment, that is, the illness or accident, what symptoms they currently have, what investigations, treatments, medical or surgical, they have received and the prognosis of the condition; second, the customer's account as to how they consider themselves to be adversely affected by their condition, with special emphasis on how it affects their ability to cope with the activities of daily living, ADLs, and work related activities; third, the provision of additional medical evidence is encouraged and all evidence provided is considered in the assessment process, for example, specialist reports, results of investigations, X-rays, CT and MRI scans, and blood tests, etc.; and, fourth, the medical assessor also considers any stated or known co-morbidity, in addition to the primary condition.</p><p> The medical assessor&rsquo;s opinion is provided to the deciding officer, who then takes into consideration the medical opinion and all relevant criteria for eligibility to the particular scheme, including reviewing the medical evidence provided by the customer before making a decision on the application.  The Department accepts that some customers may find the process of determining eligibility difficult, and that a perception may exist that some schemes are hard to qualify for.  The following issues have been identified and are being worked on: familiarity or knowledge of the different schemes and the conditionality attaching to them; the level and type of information required at the initial application stage; the fact that it is not the diagnosis but rather the severity of restriction or disability and the expected duration of recovery that is taken into consideration by the medical assessment process; and issues relating to the communication content of decisions. </p><p> The Department continually updates information on its website on all schemes, ensuring that information on the purpose, conditionality and information required to be submitted with claims is available to potential customers.  Information on the Department's schemes is also available through a wide range of providers, such as, the Department's Intreo offices, citizens information centres and non-governmental organisations.  The Department continually stresses the importance of providing as much information as possible on the customer's medical condition with the initial application form.  All correspondence issuing to customers stresses this point and encourages them to submit any additional information they may have.  I avail of this opportunity to once again highlight to the committee that one of the main reasons for a claim being disallowed at the initial claim stage is that claimants and their doctors often do not provide full and comprehensive details of their condition or disability until they receive notification of a disallowance.  The Department has a series of stakeholder forums with disability organisations and representative groups and avails every opportunity to emphasise the importance of providing full information at the initial claim stage.</p><p> The Department accepts that it is difficult to get across the concept that it is not the diagnosis but rather the severity of restriction or disability that is taken into consideration by the medical assessment process.  To address this, the Department has undertaken a proactive engagement with medical stakeholders including meeting with general practitioners and their representatives.  The chief medical officer and deputy chief medical officer liaise regularly with individual general practitioners who have issues or need clarification on specific scheme conditionality.  This process is ongoing.  Furthermore, these issues are also discussed in ongoing liaison meetings with customer representative groups, that is, the Carers Association, the DCA support groups, and the Disability Federatiion of Ireland.</p><p> The Department endeavours to provide as much information as possible on the reason for decisions.  Specifically, in any case where an application is being refused additional information is now provided to the customer, which should assist them in deciding whether they should seek a review of the decision or appeal.  This process is kept under continual review, with the intention of improving the service and making it as supportive as possible to the customer.</p><p> Before concluding, I wish to highlight a number of recent initiatives.  The Department undertook a review of the DCA in 2012, all the recommendations of which have been implemented, a major service delivery modernisation programme was implemented in the past three years and a revised process to streamline access to invalidity pension from suitable claimants.  These projects have resulted in a substantially improved service to customers, including improved communication.  As always, the Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers and continues to review and monitor its processes to ensure it provides a quality service to customers with illness, disability and caring needs.</p></speech>

I thank particularly the DFI and the Carers Association for a number of useful suggestions they have made.  I am pleased the Department's officials are present to listen to them and understand the logic which underlies claims being made in the first place.  The major difficulty with claims based on a person's medical condition, as pointed out by the DFI and the Carers Association, is the number refused at first instance and which are successful on appeal.  It means that a person who is eligible for the benefit from the beginning suffers much anguish and distress for an indefinite period before he or she finally receives it.  That is and continues to be a very real problem.  We must consider the people we are talking about., people who qualify under the Department's medical criteria for disability allowance, people who are ill, people who are caring for those who are mentally or physically ill.  They have enough to get on with in life rather than go through all this hassle to obtain the benefit to which they are entitled.</p> <p>  I have a few specific questions.  Ms Catherine Cox mentioned the difficulty in obtaining a carer's allowance where the caree is a person who suffers from an intellectual rather than a physical disability.  We have all come across that problem.  When a person comes to my constituency office seeking to make an application for a carer's allowance for looking after a child, parent or sibling who suffers from a mental rather than a physical condition, I confess to getting a sinking feeling because the success rate in those cases is very low.</p><p>Is there a breakdown to hand of the percentage-----</p></speech>

I would welcome the Department's views in this regard.  </p> <p>  Another question that consistently comes up at ground level is about desk reviews.  Dr. Singh has explained clearly that the purpose of the medical assessment is to judge.  One does not question the medical diagnosis, but one's function is to assess the level of impairment resulting from the condition.  Dr. Singh has outlined a number of things one considers.  It is difficult to understand how one can properly consider these things simply by looking at a file in Dublin without talking to the individual in question.  If one were to go through all of the various criteria as set out in the presentation, no one could dispute that the person making the decision would be much better informed as regards the type of decision to be made, if he or she could see the person himself or herself and listen to what he or she had to say.  I realise the problem with manpower and do not know what ideas the Department may have.  The Disability Federation of Ireland made some suggestion as to how this issue could be tackled.  </p> <p>  As I do not wish to take up too much time, will Dr. Singh explain what exactly is the division of responsibility between the medical assessor in the Department and the deciding officer?  It appears as though the medical assessor looks at the medical evidence and decides, as Dr. Singh noted, the extent to which it impairs a person and by so doing the assessor judges whether he or she comes within the qualifying criteria.  What then is the function of the deciding officer?  Is it simply a rubber stamp or does the deciding officer who, after all, is a non-medical person have the right to overrule the medical assessment?</p></speech>

While this is not an issue for most people, it is an issue for anybody who makes applications for medical supports through the Department of Social Protection.  Probably in common with all of the Deputies and Senators present, I have come across absolute frustration among people who often are in stressful situations and trying to fill in forms.  Everyone accepts that there is a need for forms and that there is a bureaucracy that goes with making an application.  As one issue I had originally hoped to deal with today concerned general practitioners, GPs, and consultants, it is a pity the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, is not present because this is one cause of delays.  I note that one proposal - I believe it was put forward by the Disability Federation of Ireland - is that the Department consider ensuring GPs or consultants receive a payment for filling in the forms because I am aware that there is frustration on the part of some GPs and consultants who are asking why must they fill in forms repeatedly and what really is being sought.  I seek a reaction to the proposal from the Department's point of view.  </p> <p>  In addition, has the Department been in communication with the IMO or any other consultants' organisation to ascertain what is the problem?  If a person applies for carer's allowance or disability allowance, he or she is required to produce a consultant's report.  He or she attends the consultant and if he or she is lucky, he or she might be given an appointment after two months or might be on a list.  The consultant will meet him or her and agree to fill in the form at some stage, but it could be seven to ten weeks before he or she receives the form.  He or she is waiting for it in order to submit his or her forms.  I have sometimes found that people have submitted the form initially just to be on the record.  In some ways, they do not care that they will be refused because they know that by the time the appeal is heard, perhaps 20 weeks later, they might have the material they need from the consultant and that it will be backdated.  Consequently, they submit an incomplete form in order to have it as the date of their application.  What can be done to break the logjam?  It is not just consultants, the same applies to some GPs.  I am not having a go in this regard; I am merely stating there is a logjam that must be overcome.</p> <p>  The forms are substantial enough and can be onerous for somebody who is frustrated and stressed.  A person is 19 pages into the carer's allowance application form before the headings of medicine, medical condition and disability are even reached.  In the disability allowance section a person is 21 pages into it before his or her disability comes into it.  As for the questions asked, one should not need to ask half of them in this day and age.  The Department has all of the details, for example, of how many kids a person has because it is paying child benefit.  I refer to a way of cutting down on this.  Moreover, when a person applies for carer's allowance, he or she may be entitled to free fuel allowance or free travel.  Perhaps I am wrong, but in many respects, he or she must then fill in virtually exactly the same form again.  </p> <p>  I will ask one or two questions and then come back in.  Will the departmental officials explain why more than half of those who appeal are successful?  Members understand the substantial increase in the number of those applying which obviously has put a weight on the Department.  However, having found a rate of 55%, has an analysis been made?  Is it just a lack of understanding of the forms?  I note that two cases from the Ombudsman last year or the previous year involved forms not being sent between the Department and the Social Welfare Appeals Office, that is, the full file.  In this day and age, I would have presumed that the Department scanned everything.  What is the problem in that regard?  Is it simply a matter of computer systems not talking to one another?</p></speech>

I welcome the holding of this meeting which presents a great opportunity for members.  It is great to see my colleagues all going through the same issues and I back absolutely everything that has been said.  People with a disability have enough obstacles to face in assessing everything from housing, social welfare payments, medical cards, resources, education and therapies and many of the forms present further worry and obstacles.  Ms Catherine Cox who is representing the Carers Association has made the valid point that there must be clear communication with the applicant on what is needed to make the most complete application, as far as possible, to the Department.  People often approach me to tell me they applied for an allowance and then waited until they were refused before coming to me.  When I ask what they submitted and what they included in their application, they reply that they filled in the form and answered all of the questions asked.  When one sees the part about submitting extra reports, unless people are told specifically to include extra consultant or GP reports, many will decide to hold back the information until it is requested.  </p> <p>  The point has been hammered home today about the number of disability allowance applications that have been refused.  As has been noted, it amounted to almost half of such applications made in 2014.  Of 27,608 disability allowance applications, 13,732 were turned down on the basis of the qualifying criteria on initial assessment.  That is a huge number which I, too, question.  I reiterate that better communication is definitely essential.</p><p>Much of the confusion could be done away with if information regarding additional documentation was made available.  The DFI raises a valid concern regarding the domiciliary care allowance.  I have seen the transition from it to disability allowance result in difficulties.  I know of one parent last year who lost her carer's allowance, a payment she had received from the birth of her child.  The system is confusing for everybody, in particular when a child's situation has not changed from the last day of him or her being 15 years of age to the first day of him or her being 16 years of age.  It is a major issue.  When people are applying for a disability allowance where they used to qualify for domiciliary allowance once they turned 16 years of age, there now seems to be obstacles for other people trying to qualify for disability allowance.  </p><p> I take the point that the Department of Social Protection said it does engage with different departments and groups.  I would propose that visits are made to special schools.  I have experience of them.  Many parents whose children attend such schools find through word of mouth or remarks in class that when their children reach 16 years of age they can apply for benefits.  I have been amazed at the number of queries I have received in the past two years from people who were not aware of to what they were entitled.  It has been said that the information is on websites and available from Citizens Information, but we are talking about a cohort of people who are tending to families members for up to 24 hours a day.  Such people may not have the time or opportunities to sit down and source information on everything.  A very efficient way of getting the point across would be to provide information for the parents of children, in particular those in special schools or classes within mainstream schools whom we know will be entitled to disability allowance.</p><p> When the Department of Social Protection said it regularly engages with GPs, what kind of communication takes place?  Is it done by letter or are there formal information evenings for GPs?  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh raised a very valid point.  We all have experience of situations where there is a delay in getting reports or people cannot get reports because a GP is charging &euro;15 for a report and a person cannot pay until he or she receives money at the end of a week.  It is horrific that people are put through such a system and made to jump through all of the hoops.</p></speech>

As a practitioner in the area and like other colleagues, each of us who have been asked to comment could have raised the same issues as the delegations.  We know what is happening on the ground.  There are real concerns.  In fairness to the Department, it has argued in the past that the high success rate of appeals is down to insufficient evidence being presented at the application stage.  I know that to be correct in some cases.  I know of a recent case which went to an appeal and it turned out that almost no information was required at the application stage.  We knew that the presentation of additional evidence at appeal stage would almost guarantee success, and the person was successful.  There is a gap.</p> <p>  I refer to what the Carers Association has asked for, with particular reference to the success of the process around domiciliary care allowance.  What is required and what people are asking for is that there be a review process.  As a committee we could recommend that should happen.  Department officials have said discussions are under way with medical stakeholders, but the process needs to go beyond that and be formalised to a greater degree.  From the point of view of the departmental management of the process, it is absolutely inefficient to have a system whereby there is a significant level of success at the appeal stage.  If one was managing a system with such a lack of efficiency in the private sector, one would say it had to be re-examined.  </p> <p>  My recommendation is that we take on board the request from the Carer's Association that there would be a more formal review and the inputs from the various stakeholders would be taken on board.  If we could agree that today, we would have had a very successful meeting.  </p></speech>

I do not run clinics or deal with people in my local area.  Most of what I deal with comes from ten or 20 years ago when I worked in Citizens Information in Limerick.  I want the Department to address my point.  There was then and, from what I hear today, still is a suggestion that there is a lack of trust in the evidence submitted from GPs.  How does the Department assess on paper what a GP has assessed about a person?  An individual presenting with back pain, for example, can be found by one GP to be suffering from a debilitating illness, but can be assessed by another as capable of doing something.  A GP can assess that type of thing.</p> <p>  From what I have heard here, the default position seems to be to refuse an application and let the appeal decide.  I may be wrong.  </p></speech>

It seems as if waiting times are on the increase.  Has a staffing issue arisen due to the Haddington Road or Croke Park agreements which has made the Department's job more difficult in terms of dealing with claimants?</p> <p>  I read the two forms.  In 2015 I can walk into any bank or branch of the bank with which I deal and give my bank account number to the bank which is then able to pull up all kinds of details, including mortgages, car loans and insurance details.  I have a unique PPS number which works across all Departments.  If I am applying for a disability allowance and submit the PPS number of the person concerned, why can all of the relevant information not be automatically entered into the form?  Why do we have to put such an intimidating form in front of people?  I have come across people, as I am sure the delegations have, who decide the form is too much like hard work and do not bother with it.  Why can we not automate a lot of the information?</p> <p>  If I am a carer, I have a PPS number, as do, I presume, my partner and the person for whom I am caring.  If there is a proper database in place, I do not see any reason why the meta data cannot be automatically inputted into the form which is then sent out with only the information that is required, rather than people having to fill in all of the information.  Maybe there is a reason behind it, but I do not understand why it cannot be done.  That bothers me.</p> <p>  I refer to the assessment of disability.  Leaving aside what the Chair said, there seems to be a problem in making assessments based on information on paper.  I would like Dr. Singh to address that issue because as a medical practitioner he will know that an illness will devastate one person but not another.  </p> <p>  The area in which I have most interest is access to education.  For some reason, the back to education, VTOS and various other initiatives all seem to be aimed at work.</p><p>What is the Department's view on access to education for occupational therapy?  I refer to cases where one is not looking for certification and if one is then it is merely to reach a certain level.  The certification is not for work <i>per se</i>.  I wonder whether the Department has taken enough steps to encourage access to education.  Regardless of the disability, unless it is a severe mental disability, we can all benefit from education in some way or other.  Those are all my questions.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1079" speakername="Ray Butler" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042900002#H00200"><p>I welcome the officials from the Department of Social Protection and the groups that represent people with disabilities.</p> <p>  Politicians, in their constituency offices, receive a lot of representations from people who seek help to fill in these forms.  The Department has said to us that it has met or are meeting with consultants and GPs.  I would like forms to be given to GPs or consultants.   GPs and consultants are very busy people.  As a result, when a person applies for an allowance for the first time his or her GP or consultant might only write a one or two line letter.  Such a short letter has led to a lot of problems in the form of further information being sought by the Department or a claim being refused.  I propose that we consider creating a standard form to be filled in by a GP or consultant.  It would help the Department and move the process forward.  On a regular basis in my constituency  people are asked by the Department to seek further information from their GP or consultant.  It is on the second occasion that the applicant will receive pages full of information but when he or she started it was only a one or two line letter.  It would be an excellent idea to have a standard form to give to a GP or consultant. </p> <p>  My next issue is decisions made about desktops.  Can a decision be taken to view the customer with a system that was onstream before?  If a difficult decision must be made then I suggest that the patient or customer is viewed by the Department, consultants and doctors.  There is no reason that system cannot be reintroduced. </p> <p>  I totally agree with the Senators and Deputies that the forms are very strenuous.  One of the questions asks whether social welfare payments are being made to a family member or other people living in the house.  Surely a click of button on a computer can find out such information.  A 27-page form is very offputting.  The applicants already have lot of things going on in their lives and must survive from day to day.  How much does this toing and froing cost the State when decisions can be made by viewing the customer's records?   </p> <p>  I strongly appeal to the officials from the Department that we look at a system for consultants and GPs and suggest the initial form could be supplied to start the process.  I apologise for repeating myself but I have seen, on a regular basis, instances where a GP or consultant gives a two line letter on the first occasion but the application is returned.  When the patient or customer seeks further information he or she is supplied with pages of stuff.  Why can that information not be supplied at the start of the process?  It would save a lot of time if a GP or consultant used a standard form when a person seeks the payment.    </p></speech>

I apologise for being a little late.  The first thing that jumped off the page, when I arrived, was that &euro;3.4 billion is spent on various illness and care-related payments.  One must be specific when dealing with such a large amount of money.  Nowadays, it is important to ensure that every i is dotted and every t is crossed because that was not done in the past, leading to huge confusion and creating a lot of doubt among people.</p> <p>  I seek clarification of the following matter.  I deal with people who seek illness and disability payments.  I cannot understand why people must return to their GP or consultant three or four times and it leads to a lot of confusion.  The medical forms are very complex but I can understand why that is the case.  The Department wants to retrieve as much information as possible.  The way some questions are laid out can be very confusing for a lot of people and, therefore, simplifying the questions might be helpful. </p> <p>  I have never asked the following question before.  Are all applications viewed by doctors?  If so, how many people are granted their appeal following more evidence being submitted?  When applications are turned down people can lodge an appeal.  Are appeals successful because more information has been given?  Do appeals go through a different process?  If the information already existed then the initial decision must not have taken everything into account.</p> <p>  The form is frustrating to fill out.  It is a large amount of money and for transparency and everything else, I have no problem with a form being as much as 40 pages in length as long as the form and questions are simple.  I have noticed that some of the questions have been duplicated which can confuse a lot of people.  I suggest the questions are more simplistic.  </p> <p>  I agree with one of the other speakers that the people who look for a disability allowance, or whatever it may be, are already dealing with an illness.  The process of filling out forms can be complicated when one is not in the right place.  As a public representative, when people come into my clinic or visit me it takes me half an hour to go through each form with them.  Is there online assistance or a telephone helpline to assist people when filling out a form?  Yes, there is.  </p></speech>

What is of interest to me is that a lot of the questions are the same type of questions that we face as medical assessors.  I intend to give the committee the medical assessors' feedback from the perspective of the questions posed.  If there are any administrative-related issues then my colleagues will address them.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea asked pertinent questions.  The difficulty in getting claims processed and desk assessments were two of the issues he raised.  He sought clarification on how desk assessments could be perceived as providing an objective opinion.  The matter was raised by several other Deputies and speakers today along with queries about the role of the medical assessor and deciding officer.  From my own perspective, I have found it reassuring that the Department has not placed a cap on payments and no quota on the number of applicants for this benefit.  That means if every application medically qualified then all of the applicants would be paid and it would not matter if the whole population of the country applied, so be it.  </p> <p>  When it comes to difficulty in getting claims processed, I agree with Members.  There is an ongoing process to improve the application process, the assessment process and communication.  However, there is a complex process between the medical and administration elements.  It is not only medical criteria that an applicant must satisfy.  He or she must satisfy other non-medical criteria such as a means test and natural residence which takes a considerable length of time.</p> <p>  Desk assessments can be reasonable and objective way of assessing medical applications.  However, and I must reiterate, this is based on the quality and comprehensiveness of the medical information available to the medical assessor.  The committee must understand that what I have heard today is the same experienced by GPs in their day to day practice that initial applications are deficient, limited or restricted.  Reaching the right conclusion is also a struggle for us as well.  I have heard that a lot of applicants hold back information which does not do them any favours.  I take this opportunity to ask Members to convey to their constituents that applicants should do some good for themselves and the best chance is to give everything bit of information to us.  It would save on time, costs and mental stress faced by applicants.</p><p> I will move on to Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's remarks.  Communication with medical organisations has been an ongoing process.  In the last couple of years we have realised that we could do more and we have been addressing that.  There is no formal mechanism or platform for us to engage with them, but we do so at every opportunity, mostly when we find when processing an application that we need more clarification.  This happens nearly once a week and we make attempts to ring them and communicate directly.  The process is sometimes limited by the availability of the general practitioner.  My experience is that the doctor is often in a consultation and one must leave a message and wait for them to respond at the end of the day.  It is an ongoing process.  In terms of official contacts, the chief medical adviser has taken every opportunity to present the perspective of the medical assessment process at various medical conferences and forums.  For example, on 5 February, he presented to the national GP tutor network.  Opportunities and platforms like that help a great deal to get the message out.</p><p> The Deputy also asked whether the claimants' doctors get a payment for providing reports, which they do.  The Department spends at least &euro;18 million to &euro;20 million per year just getting reports back from GPs.  That is a significant amount.  In fact, last year it went up to &euro;21 million.</p><p> The form for the report is designed to give us enough information to make the decision, if it is filled in correctly and comprehensively.  There are two things we must ascertain, namely, the severity and duration of the condition.  Much of the time, it is the duration we are looking for.  For example, if somebody has severe back pain and has an MRI, which might show pathology, this might improve in a couple of weeks or months with treatment.  The duration is the information that we do not always get.  However, the form is reasonably well designed to provide the information we need.  I agree that the forms are lengthy.  There are many pages in the initial part of the form covering administrative and general information.  Why are half the appeals successful?  I cannot answer for the appeals office, which is a quasi-judicial and independent part of the Department, but I gather that if claimants are providing more information to the appeals office, that would dictate a difference of opinion.</p><p> Senator Moran's first question related to the large number of disability allowance applications that are turned down.  She stated that over 13,000 applications were turned down out of a total of 27,000.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1338" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Kellaghan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042900002#J00200"><p>I want to clarify that figure, because it has been mentioned a few times.  The figure of 27,000 refers to the number of discrete decisions made on disability allowance applications in 2014.  However, that would also include applications that were initially disallowed and subsequently allowed after more information was provided.  There was actually a total of about 21,000 discrete new applications for disability allowance in 2014.  The figures mentioned by the Senator are, therefore, is not exactly comparable.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Devesh Singh" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042900002#J00300"><p>There is probably a perception that a disproportionate number of disability allowance applications are turned down.  To some extent, the disability allowance scheme may have a higher proportion of claimants who are not deemed eligible when they initially apply than the other schemes.  This could relate to the issue with information.  If we get all the information in the initial claim, perhaps those figures could improve.  Senator Moran raised the example of the 16 year olds who are coming off the domiciliary care allowance and being turned down for disability allowance.  The disability allowance application relies on a GP report, whereas the domiciliary care allowance application contains a huge amount of information.  It is more exhaustive and there is more medical information.  This does not transfer to the disability allowance application.  They are two separate schemes.  Perhaps we could try to harmonise the information for those schemes.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked whether we engage with GPs.  In the last seven years, especially with the new certification process, we have been engaging much more with general practitioners, both formally and informally.  It is a helpful exercise because I can see some of the issues that general practitioners are facing.  It is up to us to engage with each other and get that message across because they are the ones we are depending on for the information.</p> <p>  Senator Craughwell made a very relevant suggestion about the perception that there is a lack of trust.  That was his experience, but it is not that we mistrust GPs or any medical certifier or doctor.  We look for information on both the severity and the duration of the condition, which is important.  General practitioners and certifiers do not seem to be aware of the Department's various schemes, so maybe they do not realise that information is essential for us to give an opinion.  The Senator gave the example of back pain, asking how a medical assessor can decide how severe the back pain is.  Again, I return to the composite form.  It not only has the diagnosis but also information regarding who provides the medical care, what investigations are done, what treatment is given and whether any other treatment is ongoing.  When I get a diagnosis of back pain, I do not look only at the back pain, but also at the treatment and the investigations.  If the claimant has had an MRI scan, I would be interested to see the result of this and whether it shows significant pathology.  Regarding treatment, I am interested in whether it includes several different types of strong medications or pain specialist involvement.  There is enough information in the form to extract how severe the back pain is, how long it will last and how it would affect the applicant.</p> <p>  The Senator also asked why so much general information is required every time an application is made.  That is relevant as the process of application is onerous and time-consuming.  It relates to the administrative side of the Department, but I know the Department has made huge attempts to modernise its processes over the last few years.  We have had the illness and disability scheme enhancement, which is a way to improve the services.  Technology was a major area for improvements.  Efforts have been made to streamline the information.  The Department has a huge amount of information and the aim is to make it easier to access.  The name of the project is BOMi4.  Hopefully it will be implemented shortly and we will get that information.</p></speech>

Besides the medical application form, we also introduced form MR99 in 2012.</p><p>The latter is sent to the claimant in order that he or she can outline how his or her condition affects him or her in terms of activities and daily living and the impact it has on his or her faculties.  This is a very useful form.  In the context of the domiciliary care scheme, we recently introduced the Dom Care 3 form.  This is issued to the care provider - the medical person - and he or she uses it to provide a comprehensive report on the person being cared for.</p></speech>

I led the review of the domiciliary care allowance and it was during the latter that the standard form to which Dr. Singh referred, form Dom Care 3, was designed.  We put that standard form into use - with the agreement of parents' representatives, the Carers Association, etc., who were involved in our group - but shortly thereafter we discovered that while it captured all the information required, it caused some issues for people who already had obtained consultant reports or whatever.  We were obliged to specify that we were not making this mandatory and, where it can be completed, it is a very useful form.  We had to clarify on our website that while the standard form is in use, we will also accept evidence in any format in which it can be presented.  There are issues with regard to the standardisation of forms, particularly as this might require someone being requested to return his or her GP or consultant in order to obtain specific information for inclusion on form Dom Care 3.  Whereas as matters stand, if we get the information, we will accept and process it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Catherine Kellaghan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015042900002#K00300"><p>I will expand somewhat on the issue of application forms.  The disability allowance, DA, form was revised and reprinted recently and has been distributed.  However, it will probably take some time before it comes into general use because even though people have been told to get rid of old stocks of forms, they may still be using them.  The new DA form requires people to give more detailed information in the context of their own assessment of their disabilities and how they are affected by them in their daily lives.  We are hoping this will assist us in making better and more appropriate assessments.  The form was also beefed up in terms of encouraging people to submit all relevant information at the outset.  Without seeking to bore members, I reiterate that we perceive the quality and quantity of the information supplied as being key to our ability to make decisions in the first instance.<br/><br/>Another point that was raised relates to the DCA review process and how this will benefit carer's allowance, one of the schemes for which I have responsibility.  As Mr. Kieran will attest, the group did a huge amount of work on this matter and put forward some excellent recommendations.  The Department has taken what was learned on board and is applying it in respect of carer's allowance.  We have already examined the procedures by means of which we review carer's allowance for carees or care recipients who are transitioning from DCA.  As already stated, what we learned from the DCA review has been used to revise the process in question.  All of our communications have been revised and updated in order that people will have a much clearer picture regarding what is happening, why it is happening and what is required of them.  In addition, we have changed the process so that if it appears that a person is not going to qualify at first pass, he or she will remain in payment while we explore with him or her whether he or she possesses other information which might be of assistance to us in the context of making a decision.  These developments, particularly that relating to the improvement in communications, have been quite well received because they have been of assistance to people.  Now that the revised DA form is in circulation, we are examining the position in respect of the carer's allowance form with a view, perhaps, to giving people more opportunities to provide details of their day-to-day activities in the form of a care diary.  Ms Cox referred to this in her opening statement.<br/><br/>The deciding officer is the key decision maker.  Deputy O'Dea requested clarification with regard to where these officers stand <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>medical assessors.  As he quite rightly pointed out, deciding officers do not have medical training.  The Department, therefore, considers it appropriate that a deciding officer should obtain the opinion of a medical assessor in respect of the clinical information provided by a claimant in support of his or her application.  To be absolutely clear, however, the final decision is made by the deciding officer.  A deciding officer will not always go with the view put forward by the medical assessor.  There are instances where, having reviewed the totality of the information provided, the officer will decide whether a person is eligible.  Obviously, the officer must also decide on the other aspects of the claim, namely, the person's identity, his or her means, his or her habitual residence, etc.  Deciding officers are, therefore, very much the key decision makers in the context of the medical and all other aspects of claims and they are supported in this regard.<br/><br/>On the issue of the high level of successful appeals, the appeals office plays a very important part in the decision-making process of the Department.  It is there as a final port of call for someone who is not satisfied with the decision relating to his or her claim.  The Department also has a decisions advisory office, the purpose of which is to consider the quality of all decisions - and not just those relating to medical matters - made by the Department.  This office is obliged to liaise with the appeals office on various issues surrounding quality of decision-making.  Information relating to any lessons learned is then fed back to deciding officers and they take it on board.  I reiterate that an analysis of the numbers has not been carried out but that, as far as the Department is concerned, additional evidence which we did not get to see in the first instance is generally provided at the appeal stage.  People who are called for oral hearings may bring with them additional information that can swing the decision in their favour on the day.  I repeat that the Department takes on board all information garnered by means of the liaison process involving to the decisions advisory office and the appeals office.<br/><br/>On processing times, the numbers applying for disability allowance and carer's allowance are increasing.  For example, the number of carer's allowance applications received in 2014 was almost 20% higher than that received in 2013.  The figures continue to increase in 2015.  This has placed a little extra pressure on us but we have allocated additional resources and we are working on reducing the amount of time it takes to process claims.  However, some claims take longer than others to process.  Again, it all depends on the quality and the quantity of the information we receive and the standard of the supporting documentation provided.  We are working as hard as we can to improve the position for people.</p></speech>

Going back to Deputy Catherine Byrne's question, I am happy to say that we have a care line for family carers.  If a person is filling out an application form, the person can ring the care line and get support.  This is one of the services it provides.  Anyone dealing with clinics can be referred to this care line.  If they need further help, we will provide it through our local staff.  We are examining the possibility of online tutorials.  There is an issue with a lot of online information in terms of access, literacy and so on.  We are looking at the possibility of providing video tutorials to help.<br/><br/>I do not want to go over everything, but I will mention the domiciliary care allowance reforms because it is being referred to consistently.  That was a very useful, albeit stressful, process.  A lot of improvements came out of the process which are slowly percolating through.  As Ms Cox stated at the outset, we acknowledge the situation but it is not foot dragging.  It is moving carefully in what we think is a very good direction.<br/><br/>Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned people putting in a form as a marker.  I can understand the logic of that from their point of view.  From the point of view of an organisation which is trying to monitor carefully the level of delays, I would not be happy holding anyone to account for a delay in processing an application form which has a name and address and nothing else on it.  We have spoken to the Department about making a distinction between what is clearly a <i>bona fide</i>, albeit perhaps inadequate, application and one that is clearly not a serious attempt at all by not putting the latter into the process and sending it back and asking the applicant to do it again.  I understand the logic of the other side but from our point of view, it is a dilemma.  <br/><br/>There is nothing inherently wrong with desk reviews.  They are normal international practice.  The practice becomes slightly problematic and challenging for people on the receiving end who are told, having had this anonymous review, the form they submitted in a <i>bona fide</i>way and which they thought was a good case, which if we are being honest is most cases, has been overruled and they cannot understand the connection.  Deputy O'Dea asked how one gets past the resource questions.  First, only cases which are being rejected are examined.  Second, the Department has improved the process, as was stated earlier.  In the old days, the applicant would have lost the application because of inadequate evidence and would have had to come back and appeal.  Nowadays, the applicant is more or less told beforehand.  That is a major improvement in the way it is being dealt with.  <br/><br/>I share some of the reactions of the committee members to the issue of payments to GPs.  It is not something that was on my radar before today.  I do not know if, in the overall scheme of looking at the total costs and expenditures, there are economies or efficiencies to be made, but it will not be easy to take fees away from anyone.  The other side of the coin is that we have separate assessments.  This committee deals with education and social protection.  That is fine and it is the Department of Social Protection which is here.  However, a carer may be dealing with the Departments responsible for health, education and social protection and could be dealing with three separate medical assessment processes.  In some cases, the Departments are quite explicit in saying they do not care what the HSE says; the person has to pass its criteria.  From the customer-client point of view, that is a challenging agenda.  However, from a Government point of view, it is a challenging agenda too.  However, I wish to make the point on the record that there are three separate sets of obstacle courses which cover much the same ground and they are all problematic in their own way.</p></speech>

The biggest surprise and shock was that this had become a deliberate strategy, not only by GPs and psychiatrists but by disability organisations which were routinely helping people to fill out forms.  The issue seems to be cropping up here again today.</p> <p>  We have done an awful lot of work via the disability consultative forum in conjunction with the Department to address this issue and many improvements have been made.  It will be interesting to see, with the improvement in the forms and, looking down the road, with the creation of a better balance between medical assessments and self-reporting, how much better the picture will look in 12 months time.  We hope there will be a significant improvement.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's asked about a more holistic process of assessment and there is a couple of things I would like to point out about this.  It needs to be done in conjunction with the person him or herself.  Our colleagues in mental health in particular would say, on self-reporting in episodic conditions, that predicting over a period of time how well or not someone might be is something patients might know best themselves.</p><p> We would also say that our members, disability and carers' organisation often have lifelong relationships and professional interaction with many people with disabilities and can provide very insightful information that could aid applications.  We see that communications is one of the major issues.  The issue of communications not only applies to forms but the relationship between the applicant, or those acting on behalf of family member with a disability and the Department.  There is a need to create a trusting relationship whereby people can rely on the fact that if they supply the correct information they will get the correct response.  That is a relationship issue and a matter of trust.  It is of major importance because the numbers on disability allowance have been rising and this is largely due to demographic changes, changes in population but also changes in eligibility for conditions such as autism.  The purpose of disability allowance in particular has changed from when the disabled person's maintenance allowance, DPMA was the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children and the number of people in receipt of that allowance was between 26,000 to 28,000 people up to 1997 when it became the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection.  We recognise the value of having a payment such as disability allowance but we also recognise that it is a contingency payment.  People are living on this means tested payment as their primary income and therefore it is hugely important that there is the least amount of stress involved in the application process..</p><p> Disability allowance is a payment that is predicated on one's capacity to work not on one's medical condition.  Dr. Singh has eloquently pointed that out.  That needs to be communicated.  I know the Department will be profiling all people on disability allowance during the course of the year to look at people's capacity to work.  We hope that will encompass a broader sense of what people's capacities might be.  We have to recognise that four out of five people acquire a disability during their working life.  This is a societal issue.  It is an issue that concerns all of us, not just the cohort of people who sit in a space that we do not interact with every day.</p></speech>

On the question of forms being filled in as a holding position, the frustration is that it will take two or three months in some but not all instances to get the form filled, yet those concerned want to ensure they may get cover.  One needs practical solutions to get around this difficulty.</p> <p>  In fairness to the group that dealt with the domiciliary care allowance form, they raised the question as to how one gets a practical solution.  If the applicant presents a form that is incomplete, one tells them that the form is incomplete.  If one goes to an Intreo or a Department of Social Protection office, where the form and documentation is scanned in on the spot, the applicant will be told that he or she need to fill out parts of the form.  In this day and age when the documentation can be scanned, whether it comes by post or handed in by the applicant, the original can be sent back to the individual.  That would mean that throughout the system, whatever stage the application is at, be it the initial stage, or on appeal, the staff member can press a button, the full file goes to the relevant officer and there can be no loss of documents.  The investment in technology should be done at this stage and I hope that will help address some of the problems that arose in the past.</p> <p>  During the debate on recent social welfare legislation, provision was made for additional medical assessors.  Do the departmental officials wish to take the opportunity to tell us what has happened in dealing with case files since the provision of staff to deal with delays was made?</p> <p>  The Carers Association made the point in  its document that there is a perception that the system is weighted in favour of those with a physical disability over those with a mental disability.  How can that be overcome?  Is there a need for education of or provision of guidelines to GPs, psychiatrists, medical assessors or where should we focus attention?  The idea is not to be critical of the Department but to try to come up with practical solutions to issues that come up continuously regarding delays in medical assessments.  I support the point made by Deputy O'Dea on the need to have an input from the IMO, a delegation from which was to be here today, as it represents both the GPs and a good number of consultants, and-or other medical organisations.  It might have a better view of the issue from its perspective.</p></speech>

The normal appeal system is conducted on the desktop, but the applicant has the option to look for an oral hearing.  Would it be practical in terms of manpower, for the deciding officer at the initial assessment stage, to have the option to entertain a request from somebody who wanted to see him or her?</p></speech>

The Department's view is that the review is ongoing.  We are using much of the learning from the domiciliary care allowance review.  I do not think it is necessary to go through that process again.  Many of the issues are common.  I am looking at my scheme in light of the domiciliary care allowance recommendations.  I have made changes already and others are in train.  We certainly intend to move forward with that.  We are in regular consultation with the Carers Association.  We keep in touch there.</p> <p>  I would like to address the perception that a greater weight is assigned to physical disability on the forms.  While just one, two or three questions on the ability-disability profile might relate to mental illnesses or learning difficulties, etc. - Dr. Singh can give the committee more information in that respect - the medical assessors have many protocols on the various types of mental illnesses, learning difficulties or intellectual disabilities.  There is an a lot underneath the ability-disability profile that is used to guide the medical assessors in their assessments.  There is a perception that it is weighted towards the physical rather than the mental, but it is just a perception.</p> <p>  It is the European norm to do assessments at the desk rather than in person.  We receive a huge number of applications every year.  We receive between 80,000 and 90,000 applications across carer's allowance, invalidity pension and disability allowance each year.  It is very large.  The suggested change would not make the best use of medical assessors' resources.  The Department believes appropriate determinations can be made at the desk where it receives sufficient information, where reports are filled in by general practitioners or doctors and where applicants supply everything available to them in support of their applications.  As each deciding officer is independent in his or her views, he or she can suggest there might be an in-person meeting if he or she feels that is needed for decision-making purposes.  Generally, there is no requirement for that.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea asked why or how a deciding officer might overrule a medical assessor.  When a deciding officer is considering a person's eligibility, he or she makes a holistic decision on all aspects of the claim.  The officer takes everything into account, whereas the medical assessor might give his or her opinion on a more limited set of criteria.  The opinion of the medical assessor is just one part of the evidence that the deciding officer takes into account.  That might account for occasions when the deciding officer makes a decision that would be in favour of the claimant.  I want to make it absolutely clear that it is not the practice for a deciding officer to overrule a medical assessor in terms of medical eligibility where it is not in favour of the claimant.</p></speech>

We were asked why we cannot populate forms automatically.  The Department as a whole is looking at the use of online applications.  Obviously, the biggest hurdle to be jumped in that regard relates to identification.  We need to have appropriate ways of ensuring the person making the online application is the person he or she claims to be.  Such issues are being examined by the Department.  The use of online applications is something we will look at in the future.  I do not know how far into the future it will be when they are used.  If online applications are used, there will be more scope for much of the form to be automatically populated with the information we already have.  It could then be amended, where necessary.</p></speech>

Senator Craughwell spoke about shortening forms.

Such policies are applied to all schemes in the Department to ensure people stay eligible.  There are two aspects to medical schemes, one of which is medical eligibility and when it should be reviewed.  In the case of a person who has a medical condition which is very unlikely to change, the medical assessor might recommend that it should be reviewed after two, three or five years and we would go along with that.  The person might have a much shorter review period in terms of his or her means if there is some indication that his or her means might change.  It is basically done on a case-by-case risk basis.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting me together with Mr. Peter Sutherland, Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations for Migration and International Development, whom I have had the opportunity to follow constantly in the media these past days.  Allow me to mention the particularly pertinent article of his which appeared in <i>The Irish Times </i>last Saturday.  Mr. Sutherland is without doubt one of the greatest experts in matters concerning migration and knows full well the multiple facets that make the current situation a two-sided coin, whereby on the one hand Europe finds itself having to confront an astonishing flow of migrants while on the other it also must realise it will require a workforce as a result of its ever-growing ageing population.  Ireland is perhaps the only country in Europe that does not have this immediate preoccupation to face.  I am certain Mr. Brian Killoran, chief executive of the Immigrant Council of Ireland, will provide a whole series of relevant details of interest to the committee.<br/><br/>I would like members to convey my thanks to the Irish Government for the decision adopted on the occasion of the EU extraordinary summit in Brussels on migration to send a fully crewed ship to the Mediterranean, in the very near future, to work alongside the personnel of Operation Triton.  Members might recall that last year, at the beginning of the semester of the Italian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I had the opportunity to brief them on the main objectives and priorities of our Presidency.  I quote what I said then:<blockquote>For Italy, Europe must also become a place of the future, not only as an ideal border but also as a physical and geographical Europe.  On the one hand, Europe must work to stop the tragedies of victims in the Mediterranean Sea caused by the difficulties in countries of northern Africa, particularly Libya, through the Frontex operation.  On the other hand, Europe must overturn its approach and demonstrate that it is an active protagonist in the economic framework and, above all, in the human context.</blockquote>Just a few days before that, in the offices of the Taoiseach, on the occasion of Italian Presidency briefing to European Movement Ireland, I illustrated the priorities of the Italian Presidency.  There was a focus on a stronger role for Europe in the Mediterranean in order to prevent the increasing tragedies in that sea.  However, that was at the beginning of the summer of 2014 and the problem has become much worse since then.<br/><br/>Italy&rsquo;s geopolitical role and location make it a leading player in this struggle.  Our rescue and patrolling efforts have saved thousands of lives.  We witness the horror of overcrowding and decrepit trafficking vessels sinking in the Mediterranean, drowning their passengers.  These boats represent only the end point of massive illegal migration flows that are run by brutal organised crime networks.  When migrants are rescued from these boats, we discover they are not only from African countries such as Nigeria, Senegal, Ethiopia, Mali and Eritrea but also from Syria and Iraq, where brutal civil and religious wars are raging, and from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, to quote only those countries with the greatest numbers of migrants.<br/><br/>As stated by the Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Renzi, Italy&rsquo;s contempt for this unfolding drama goes beyond our role in operations.  Human trafficking tramples on the values and riches that our sea has contributed to civilization.  Millennia ago, our ancestors lived amongst those shores, celebrating the diversity, richness and fullness of their identities.  Italy and its culture are largely the product of these values and of the labour they spurred.  My country will not turn a blind eye to this history.  Italy will not allow these principles to be defeated. <br/><br/>Following the tragedy in September 2013 on the coast of Lampedusa, Italy initiated Operation Mare Nostrum with the support of the European Union, but bearing the bulk of the weight on its own shoulders.  Operation Mare Nostrum, at a cost of over &euro;100 million, saw Italy rescue and assist approximately 170,000 migrants, who arrived mainly from the Libyan coasts.  We must not forget that, at that same time, more than 700 persons were arrested on the charge of human trafficking.  Unfortunately, only one in four boats used during the crossings was destroyed. <br/><br/>Mare Nostrum saw units of the Italian military marine patrol the Sicilian Channel, on the edge of Libyan territorial waters.  The criticism laid at Italy&rsquo;s door by some political leaders of the European Union and by public opinion was that these operations so close to the coast of Libya were an incentive for migrants to leave that country.  Mare Nostrum was mainly a search-and-rescue operation.  It was suspended last November and replaced by Operation Triton, under the supervision of Frontex and which was designed primarily to choke off smugglers.  Funding for the latter operation was tripled on the occasion of last Thursday's summit in Brussels, when it was also decided to study a series of other measures.  By contrast with previous operations, both naval vessels and aircraft from several European countries will be involved in this operation.  We thank our European friends and partners for this.  The units involved will operate on the edge of Italian territorial waters making it more difficult for decrepit boats and dinghies to make the crossing and will act as a disincentive, in some way, to their departure.  However, are we sure of this?  In 2013, it is calculated that there were approximately 1,500 recorded deaths in that stretch of sea.  In 2014, there were over 3,500, and at the beginning of this year there have already been over 1,500.  The summer season is still ahead of us and it is the time when the greatest number of migrant crossings takes place.  This is compounded by the fact that since the beginning of the year, Italy has rescued and assisted over 30,000 persons.  As both Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Killoran will surely relate, the situation is very difficult and it is not easy to find solutions.  Many issues must be faced by all the countries of the European Union, such as the distribution of migrants who cannot be accommodated in only some of the 28 countries of the Union.  Allow me to refer to a few figures which speak for themselves.  In 2014, four countries in Europe accepted the greatest number of asylum requests: Germany, approximately 200,000; Sweden, over 81,000; Italy, over 64,000; and France, over 60,000.  It is surprising that a country such as Hungary, with a population of only 10 million, has accepted over 40,000 requests whereas the United Kingdom, a country with over 64 million inhabitants, has accepted just over 30,000.</p><p>I am sad and astonished that an agreement was not reached last Thursday in Brussels to relocate even 5,000 of the recently arrived migrants.  If this number were to be divided equally among the 28 member states, it would mean only 172 migrants per country.</p><p> This is only one aspect of the problem.  A series of extremely complex responses are being studied to best tackle it in its complexity.  As committee members well know, most of the people who arrive in Italy do not intend to remain there and they state this openly in the many media interviews which committee members will have had occasion to see in recent days.  I say the responses are complex because in a very complex region, Libya presents a crucial challenge.  At least 90% of the migrants reaching Italian soil pass through that country.  Libya is prey not only to endemic instability but also to international terrorism.  Islamic State operates there, adding to the chaos of civil war.</p><p> If we are to intervene in Libya to create reception centres and shelters for migrants, and to destroy unseaworthy trafficking vessels taking care not to affect fishing boats, we can only do so under the umbrella of the United Nations and with the agreement of the Libyan authorities, which does not exist at this time.  The presence yesterday in the Sicilian Channel of the Secretary General of the UN, Ban Ki-moon, with Prime Minister Renzi and the EU High Representative Mogherini is a positive signal.  Other measures could be the revision of the Dublin regulation to improve the burden-sharing of costs and responsibilities and freeze the assets derived from trafficking, in a way similar to what was done in the case of the Somali pirates.</p><p> Italy is open to any suggestion and it will not fail to shoulder its responsibilities as a country with a sea border with Libya, but it is best not to forget this is not just a national border but a European border, shared by Spain, Greece and Malta.  It is therefore a problem which, given the biblical proportions of the size and the speed of the exodus of migrants, requires a response that can only be European.  As stated by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni, we cannot have a European emergency with an Italian answer.  I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1416" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Sutherland" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042900002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for this opportunity and I will begin with some preliminary observations.  It is very important that we draw a distinction between refugees and economic migrants.  Refugees are people who are trying to escape from persecution, as defined under the 1951 convention and supplemented by subsequent protocol.  The reality is every member state of the European Union has agreed it has an obligation to accept those who seek sanctuary and who are refugees.  A great number, perhaps 40%, of those who recently died in the Mediterranean were refugees.  The refugees come from Syria or Eritrea in particular, Syria in the main, and they are entitled to refuge.  The rest of those who cross the Mediterranean are economic migrants who seek a better life, and come from conditions of great poverty and distress but not persecution.  The distinction between the two is important to bear in mind at the outset.  In 2014 more than 276,000 irregular migrants crossed the Mediterranean.  Irregular migrants are those who do not come with an agreed acceptance from the European Union in the first instance and most of these are simply seeking a better way of life.</p> <p>  I will focus on refugees in the first instance.  The obligation we have, and which the European Union has a role in harmonising, has not been fulfilled by many of the member states, including Ireland, with regard to the number of refugees we have taken, for example, from Syria.  A number of countries have taken significant steps to take in migrants who are refugees and they do not merely fulfil their obligation but perhaps surpass it.  These include Germany, Sweden, Italy and Hungary, which have been mentioned.  Germany and Sweden in particular are exceptional in terms of the numbers they have taken.  The Italian contribution, and I do not say this because I am in the presence of the ambassador - I was in Rome last week with two of the Ministers from departments concerned with this - has been enormously constructive through Mare Nostrum, which was intended to save lives and succeeded in doing so.  The Italian navy continues, notwithstanding the fact that Mare Nostrum no longer functions as such, to save far more lives, ten times more lives in fact, than Frontex and Triton, which are the EU mechanisms for saving lives in the Mediterranean.  Italy has played a very important role.</p> <p>  It is important to say Italy dedicated its navy to saving lives.  The recent decision by the EU Council, and the ten point plan which preceded it, and I will put this bluntly, represents more of an obsession with stopping smugglers and traffickers and, incredibly, sinking boats that might try to bring people across the Mediterranean than it does to saving lives.  It has increased the amount of money available for the process of saving lives and for the substitution of Mare Nostrum with an EU collaboration, including Ireland, but it does not give anything as much, I believe, as the Commission would have wished.</p> <p>  I want to draw a distinction between the Commission and the member states.  The member states have, under the treaty, an intergovernmental responsibility in this area and the responsibility and authority of the Commission is extremely limited.  I am not an automatic advocate of favourable comment on the Commission, but for years it has produced papers on what could or should be done about migration and it has been ignored.  A significant number of member states, and I am proud to say Ireland is not one of them, are so focused on the short-term negativism of accepting migrants that they effectively block any movement to ameliorate the position as it is today.  We have seen this in the island nearest to us.  The United Kingdom has great difficulties in discussing this issue, and this is shared by many others.  Now we have the rising spectre of Le Pen in France and Wilders in the Netherlands.  Even traditionally liberal societies such as Denmark and the Netherlands have political issues with this particular problem, which makes forward mobility on the issue difficult.</p> <p>  What should be done?  There is no silver bullet to the issue of the huge number of people from Africa, Asia and the Middle East who might like to live in Europe.  There is no simple answer of opening borders and finding a solution which everybody can immediately accept and agree.</p><p>Unfortunately, regardless of whether we like it, we have to move incrementally, step by step, and improve what we have.  We must improve the numbers we are taking, both the refugees we are obliged to take and economic migrants we actually need because of the demographic challenges much of Europe, although not particularly Ireland, as the ambassador said, is facing.<br/><br/>We also need to agree things at European level.  For example, there should be some quota distribution of refugees based on objective criteria such as GDP <i>per capita</i>, total population or a combination of both.  There should be a fair distribution, as otherwise we will inevitably find ourselves in a position where many countries, some of which are represented here, will simply receive hundreds of thousands - I will not use terms that will inflame public debate - or very large numbers of migrants that they will simply wave through.<br/><br/>Second, we need joint processing of refugee applications.  This is more difficult to achieve because the laws of various countries are different.  We probably need to process in a different way and jointly the applications of individuals who claim to be refugees and are, therefore, escaping persecution.<br/><br/>Third, we have to look at whether some of this processing could take place in more remote destinations, that is, outside the European Union.  For example, would it be possible for the European Union to consider establishing in countries such as Egypt a processing centre or a mechanism to process asylum applications?  These applications could be shared out, rather than forcing people at enormous cost to travel across the Mediterranean in boats that are capable of sinking and resulting in the horrendous number of deaths we are seeing on a yearly basis, a multiple of the number following the sinking of<i>Titanic</i>but which receives far less publicity.<br/><br/>There are things that should and can be done.  With others, we can do more than what we are doing.  We are fortunate in Ireland that our political class, represented at this committee, does not contain the rabid, anti-immigrant minority parties evident elsewhere.  That is good and understandable because, regrettably, this is a country which over a period of 100 years has provided more emigrants <i>per capita</i>than most in other parts of the world.<br/><br/>As regards leadership, I am not suggesting Ireland has not played a constructive role, but I think it can do more, particularly in dealing with asylum seekers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1418" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Killoran" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042900002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to address the joint committee.  The Immigrant Council of Ireland is a non-profit NGO and independent law centre which has, since its inception in 2001, supported, guided and advocated for migrants and their families in navigating Ireland's immigration system.In our analysis we have continuously advocated clear, transparent, safe, and rights-based immigration policies and procedures which must be set out in legislation, well administered and allow those within the system fundamental rights such as the right to an independent appeal.  We believe that overwhelmingly people from a migrant background contribute in an exceptionally positive way to Ireland and Europe and that migration is a success story which has enriched our lives and contributed to our development.  This spirit of viewing migration as a human process, one that should be governed by a rights-based approach, has guided our analysis of and position on the current migrant crisis in the Mediterranean. <br/><br/>What is happening in the Mediterranean is, first and foremost, a humanitarian crisis, the biggest Europe has seen in decades.  That men, women and children are prepared to risk their lives, often exploited and preyed upon by people smugglers and traffickers to try to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe is testament to the desperation, lack of choices and fear that is driving them onto the boats.  The composition of those seeking to enter Europe is dominated, as previous speakers said, by nationals of Syria and Eritrea, two countries with different but deep-rooted and undeniable problems.<br/><br/>The protection issues have been described in great detail by our colleagues in UNHCR Ireland and the Irish Refugee Council, among others.  The push factors are real and endemic and, as such, will take time and a clear strategy to address.  However, the pressing need is for action that will have an impact right now, that will save the lives of those on boats in the Mediterranean.  What can Ireland do?  As has been said, it is a multi-faceted problem which requires a multi-layered response.  We believe Ireland can:<blockquote>1. Stand with our European colleagues in Italy, Malta and other countries in demanding that all of Europe share responsibility for responding to this situation.  If we were in their shoes, we would be seeking exactly the same thing, rightly so.<br /><br />2. Use our leadership in Europe to ensure the day-to-day response in the Mediterranean is not limited to border control measures and deterrents but is a real, robust and far-reaching search and rescue operation, with the primary aim of saving lives.  Ireland is contributing equipment and people to this process and, therefore, can have a say in how it is deployed.<br /><br />3. Ireland must be clear in the message to Europe that this is a humanitarian crisis which needs a humanitarian response, including safe, legal and transparent channels to migrate, about which I spoke in my introduction.</blockquote>There are many options available to expand legal routes for vulnerable migrants such as looking at study permission, work status and expanded, targeted family reunification processes which have been set out in great detail by our colleague organisations.  I acknowledge the work of the UNHCR, the Irish Refugee Council and, at a European level, the Fundamental Rights Agency in setting out many of the existing options.  To a certain extent, the thinking has been done as to how these things can be achieved.  What is lacking is the will to do it.<br/><br/>While the problem in the Mediterranean is being fuelled in large part by those seeking international protection, in many ways, the overall issue is larger &ndash; the lack of a coherent European position on immigration.  If policy formulation in Europe continues to be based on deterrents, bigger, metaphorical and real walls, perceived anti-migration sentiment among the public, a preference for economic over humanitarian considerations or for push-back policies over legal routes, we will simply see the problem recurring in different ways. <br/><br/>In summary, migration is a positive, permanent reality for Ireland and the European Union.  We require no less than a fundamental shift in our thinking on how it is to be administered in moving from a fortress mentality that tries to use the Mediterranean as a moat to one which sees migrants as human beings, net contributors to society and people with rights.  Ireland has a long and proud history of standing up when humanitarian crises strike.  We appeal to the Government and the people of Ireland to do the same in the current circumstances.<br/><br/>I again thank the Chairman for giving me this opportunity to address the committee.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I also thank the organisations and individuals outside the Houses who have made submissions on this issue in recent days.  In particular, I thank the UNHCR for its contribution.  The contributions received have been circulated to individual committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042900002#D00400"><p>I welcome all of the contributors and will keep my comments brief.  Mr. Killoran asked what Ireland could do and spoke about migration being a positive and permanent reality.  Perhaps the contributors might explain how we could persuade the public that migration was a positive and permanent reality.  That links with Mr. Killoran's point about ensuring the responsibility to accept migrants is shared among European countries.  For example, many will have seen what happened in the Mediterranean and thought it was a tragedy.  They are sympathetic and appalled, but they might not associate it with a humanitarian crisis.</p><p>When it comes to the question of accepting migrants they would perhaps shirk away and say, "Maybe not at my door".  How do we persuade the public in a positive way that we should accept migrants?  This communication is important because it is the public who ultimately put pressure on political leaders to ensure that migration is viewed in a positive light and that we should actively share the responsibility.  This leads to consideration of a quota system as suggested by Mr. Sutherland.  It cuts out that short-term negativism that he mentioned.  How could migration be integrated into Ireland's future development policies and strategies?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1110" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kyne" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042900002#E00200"><p>I welcome the ambassador, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Killoran to the meeting.  I acknowledge the difficulties faced by the ambassador's country and also the significant role it plays and the measures it has implemented to tackle the very pressing humanitarian crisis on its shores.  All countries in the European Union must participate and assist Italy in taking these measures.  One cannot blame migrants or refugees for wishing to find a better life.  As Mr. Sutherland said we have a history of seeking better lives for ourselves and we must acknowledge that people regard the European Union as an attractive destination.  No one can blame anyone for wanting to better his or her life.  Those of us in politics try to encourage people to find ways of bettering their lives.</p> <p>  Every country has a responsibility.  Ireland has a target of providing 0.7% GDP for overseas aid.  While we have maintained the monetary supports we have not quite reached the target of 0.7% but there is an onus on countries to continue to support overseas aid and to continue to improve the economic lives of those countries where migration begins.  This would be a means of limiting the desire of people to leave those countries.  We must acknowledge that the unrest in Syria and other places has added to the humanitarian crisis and the resulting movement of people.</p> <p>  However, we cannot have an open-door migration policy.  Mr. Sutherland referred to the UK and UKIP and the other extreme right-wing parties which are using immigration as a means to stir up fears.  They talk about the shortage of housing because immigrants are being housed or the shortage of jobs because immigrants are getting jobs.  We see the concern in the UK which might explain its reluctance to take in more people.  I agree with Senator Reilly about how that message should be sold.  If one can argue that one's country cannot afford to do things because we have to spend the money on other people, that is the politics of this issue.</p> <p>  The ambassador referred to Germany and Sweden in particular.  Germany has a need for workers as its population ages.  Does this type of economic rationale explain why Germany is taking in more people?  If a country needs more workers will it open its doors to immigrants?  I refer to the time of the Celtic tiger in this country when we were regarded as an attractive country and there was an influx of people.  I acknowledge that this country and all countries in the European Union need to do more to deal with this crisis.  It cannot be left on the shoulders of one country.  I commend Italy on the role it has played over the past months.</p></speech>

I apologise that I had to leave the meeting as a vote was called in the Seanad.  Mr. Brian Killoran referred to the lack of a coherent EU immigration policy.  I refer to my experience of having served in the European Parliament and on its foreign affairs committee and human rights sub-committee.  Would he agree that there is also a lack of a coherent EU policy on the sale of arms and munitions?  Destabilisation in areas has been fuelled to an extent by the lack of a long-term European Union policy.  Some countries in Europe have technically contributed to the crisis because of the lack of an overall policy on what is being sold to these regions.  This will be a long-term problem because of destabilisation.</p> <p>  In 2008 I visited refugee camps in the Sudanese border area where very little has changed since that time and likewise in Gaza where very little has changed over 20 years.  Will the same scenario occur with regard to the current crisis over the next 20 years?  Is a more coherent, comprehensive EU policy required now so that we do not look back in five years time and ask why this was not done five years ago?  What is the ambassador's view?  How does Ireland as a small country influence European Union policy to come up with a more comprehensive solution to this issue?  Recent decisions do not convince me that this is being dealt with in a comprehensive way.  Many other issues which we seem to have ignored need to be dealt with as well as the migration issue.</p></speech>

It is really disappointing that the European Union has not been able to address this issue satisfactorily.</p> <p>  Among the values set by the European Union is that it should provide leadership.  I do not think it is appropriate for people to be overly concerned about UKIP or anybody else.  Mr. Sutherland has identified the different places where that right-wing agenda is emerging.  Some of the larger countries, as well as smaller countries like Ireland, will need to take a leadership role in addressing the concerns and bringing others with them and doing so on the basis of our shared values.  This is a crisis on a large scale.</p> <p>  Mr. Sutherland suggested the introduction of a fair quota system with a base established in Egypt.  From Mr. Sutherland's insight, how close or how far are we from reaching that kind of a solution?  He has identified some of the log jams and some of the potential impediments that need to be overcome.  What would be his advice to this committee, to our representatives who are dealing with this crisis or to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  What more can we do?  It is nice to have a conversation among ourselves and all agree that the situation is terrible.  What can we do in our small way as a committee of the Irish Parliament to advance the case of providing some dignity for these people who are in a dreadful situation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1425" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042900002#E00500"><p>I thank our guests for their attendance.</p><p>It is an important subject and I congratulate the Chairman on having the vision to have this discussion now.</p><p> I agree with the views expressed by my colleagues and our guests.  Italy should not be expected to handle what is essentially a European problem.  Every country has a responsibility, whether we like it and regardless of whether some countries have xenophobic tendencies, not for the first time over the course of history.  This must be taken on board.  Also, each country must focus on its own responsibilities, what it is expected to do in a humanitarian crisis and whether it should do nothing, wash its hands of the matter and opt out.  That appears to be the case in some instances.</p><p> We must encourage our colleagues across Europe, but we must also show example.  We must encourage our colleagues in Europe to recognise that people are in a desperate position, between the proverbial rock and a hard place.  It is not only an economic problem but a true refugee problem.  All of us as public representatives have dealt with refugees from these regions in the past ten to 20 years and some desperate cases have been brought to our attention.  It would be really embarrassing if a humanitarian Europe were not to open its eyes and recognise that it has responsibilities in dealing with this issue.</p><p> I agree with Mr. Sutherland that a base must be established where there can be some order in the way this issue is tackled.  People's lives are being put at risk as a result of being controlled and handled by traffickers who put them on the high seas.  There is no attempt to deal with the issue other than to ensure the boats are taken from the traffickers or that no boats will be available in the future.  That is a load of nonsense.  It is irresponsible of European countries to even think in that fashion.  We all have an obligation which must be spread across Europe and it must be met in the short rather than the longer term.  Enough discussions have taken place.  </p><p> Reference has been made to those countries that are reluctant to accept what they consider to be economic immigrants.  They never speak about the advantage of having extra people in their countries.  It is something they should consider.  Every country has benefited in one way or another from an influx of people.  There are different age profiles and so forth.  In particular, in the case of women from countries that obviously have bad human rights records who land in Europe, it should be natural to assume that they come with good reason.  They are afraid to remain in these countries where their quality of life is appalling.  They may not have been directly and daily under threat, but they can certainly see a threat to their families in the future and know what they have lived through themselves.  Some of the things they have lived through are not repeatable, as we know from what they have told us.  We must focus on these issues.  </p><p> I am also concerned about euroscepticism and the role eurosceptics are playing in the xenophobic theme that is emerging.  It is dangerous and Europe must address it.  As the Chairman knows, we have discussed this issue previously and intend to deal with it in a report to the committee.  It is related to this subject.  If Europe does not address it, with each country in Europe taking on its own respective share of responsibilities, the Europe we envisaged and the Europe we saw evolve in the past 65 years or so will disappear.  If that happens, there will be consequences and they will not be nice.</p><p> We should never be surprised when people wish to improve their way of life.  I recall meeting an American Congressman who was very traditional and had the idea of building a wall at the border to keep out certain nationalities to the south of the United States.  A group of us tried to explain to him that one could not do this.  If there is a high standard of living on one side of a barrier, be it visible or a line on a map, people will automatically want to go there.  That is the nature of the individual and he or she cannot be blamed for this.  We must recognise that there are people in vulnerable positions outside the borders of Europe and it should not be left to one or two countries to deal with the problem.  We should give them support and recognise our responsibilities.</p></speech>

I also welcome Mr. Sutherland back to the Oireachtas which has changed a little since he was last here.  I was a Member of the Oireachtas was he was Attorney General and a former very successful European Commissioner.  I also welcome Mr. Killoran.</p><p>The issue is very serious.  I noted Mr. Sutherland's point in comparing it with what happened to <i>Titanic</i>and the international reaction to that event.  There has not been the same reaction on this occasion.  People are escaping from Africa and trying to get some support to remain alive.  At the Interparliamentary Conference on the Common Foreign and Security Policy held in Rome last November my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, made the point that the downscaling of the scheme in place at the time to the new European scheme was a disaster.  That is a fact.  The Italian Government and people saved 100,000 shipwrecked refugees, an incredible number, and had a tremendous operation in place.  It involved the use of helicopters, naval vessels, five aircraft, two submarines and 900 personnel.  It should be reinstated but supported by the European Union and the American Government.</p><p>The American Government has an involvement because of the destabilisation of Libya and the Middle East through the action taken in Iraq by the American and British Governments.  They had no solution, just a wish to get rid of Saddam Hussein.  Overall, the situation in the region has been seriously destabilised and we must secure the lives of the maximum number of people.  Mr. Sutherland has spoken strongly and very well about how we should do this and I am very impressed by his statements and presence here.  I hope he will be successful.  An international effort is required.  It is not just the Italian Government that carries this responsibility; one country cannot carry it.  If it is possible to provide ships to rescue people who are in distress, it would be better than leaving them left in the middle of the high seas and trying to rescue them at that point.</p><p>I thank the Chairman for organising this meeting and the delegates for attending to discuss the issue.  Frankly, we feel rather helpless.  We look back to when the coffin ships were leaving Ireland and foundering.  We were delighted when those who reached the shores of Canada and the United States were given refuge.  From a humanitarian point of view, we should have the same feeling for the people from Africa that was shown for the people from Ireland who were in distress and fleeing hunger and starvation in Ireland.</p></speech>

The last speaker referred to the coffin ships from our history.  I never thought we would experience this in the world we are living today, but, unfortunately, it is happening in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>  We are approaching the summer season.  Does the ambassador believe the ten point plan being put forward is sufficient?  I presume a huge number of people will try to cross the Mediterranean.  Does he believe the plan the European Union is putting together will work?  I imagine the debate we are having this morning is being replicated at the meeting of European leaders.  I am sure there was huge support for Italy and the work it was doing, as well as for Greece and other Mediterranean countries.  That support is being articulated, but the issue concerns following through on it.</p><p>I do not know whether there is the stomach for it if we are talking about huge numbers of refugees coming to Ireland.  I think Sweden's population is double that of Ireland.  A total of 81,000 people were admitted to Sweden in 2014.  I do not see any politician in this room suggesting that Ireland takes half that number.  We are articulating a view emotionally that we want to do more and I have no doubt that we will but the reality is that we will not do a huge amount.  We can see the real attitude of the Irish towards refugees through the direct provision centres.  People have been in the system for the past ten years.  They are still trying to get through the system from one end to the other and are living in appalling conditions with no recognition of their culture or different backgrounds.  We say we will take on more but are we going to put them through the same hoops and difficulties?  Yes, we are.  It is very easy for us to say we want Europe to do more but it is different when it comes to us.  Under the Dublin Regulation, the EU member state which was first entered by an asylum seeker is responsible for processing their application.  Does the ambassador agree that this regulation is in need of major updating as it places major pressures on southern European countries?  Is he aware of any proposals concerning it?  </p><p> In respect of a humanitarian, policing or border control response, which countries suggest that there is a "pull" factor if we save people's lives?  This is the "Fortress Europe" nonsense about pulling back and how we will not encourage them by going out to save them.  Where does this come from?  The ambassador mentioned a number of countries.  People wonder whether it is the Germans or French.  The French have taken in huge numbers.  It is not a trick question but where does this idea come from?  </p><p> I presume there will be a need for a UN resolution about blowing up smugglers' boats.  Will that happen?  How will they distinguish between a fisherman's boat and a rusty wreck that they will push out to sea?  It is a nonsense.  It was best summed up by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron.  In an interview, he said that the UK would send in the Royal Navy to patrol the seas but would bring them back to Malta because that is the nearest country.  The UK had no responsibility in that regard.  We will all congratulate Italy for the work it is doing and the lives it is saving but it is Italy, Greece and Portugal's problem.  This is the hypocrisy of it.  There is a smattering of that here this morning.  We are all concerned but the next step is too difficult to swallow.  </p><p> In respect of the point that we do not have right-wing parties in Ireland, there are racists in Ireland.  I do not know how many doors I have knocked on where I have heard "I'm not racist but...", which is part of the response to what we are doing in respect of people in direct provision.  I know it sounds like a speech but I am just expressing the frustration that is there.  I do not think we are coming up with the answers.  A total of 50 million people have been displaced.  Many European countries were cheerleaders for regime change in many of the countries whose inhabitants are coming to Europe.  They want to settle.  We have wrecked their countries.  We have encouraged, trained and bombed.  People want to come to Europe and we say that we want them to stay in their devastated countries.  It is wrong.  </p></speech>

In 2011, we were aware that helping the Libyan Arab spring might have caused a lot of problems.  We have known the reality of Libya for decades.  Libya was an apparently stable country under Colonel Gaddafi but following the destruction of our consulate-general in Benghazi a few years ago, we became aware that there was a very big difference between different tribes in Libya.  We were very sceptical about the NATO intervention in Libya.  Our impression was that first, there was no "plan B" if something went wrong.  Second, it was a very difficult situation because Libya is not a united country.  The result is before our eyes.</p> <p>  Something is happening because our prime minister was able to call for a European summit at very short notice.  Extraordinary summits are very rare in Europe and have happened on only a few occasions.  It was accepted that this is something positive.  Of course, it is such a complex problem, as was highlighted by Mr. Sutherland, there are political refugees and those looking for jobs and there is the role of national public opinion.  There are many people in Italy who are not happy at all with the large numbers of refugees and who want to send them back to Libya, which is not a solution.  The UN Secretary General has come to see what is going on and the way the operation is going ahead.  Measures are being undertaken to set up camps in Egypt and on the borders of Libya and other African countries to examine the demands.  I know that Morocco and Spain and Morocco and Senegal have done quite a good job in this regard to exert better control over those people.  </p> <p>  The Dublin Regulation must be reviewed because it does not make sense that the countries which first receive all those people must take them all.  The burden must be shared.  A process is underway that must also take public opinion into consideration but I think there is a change in public opinion.  These tragedies had been happening for months but suddenly everyone woke up a few days ago.  We must maintain a significant focus.  It cannot be a case of focusing on one thing until a new crisis comes along and we forget the first thing and have to wait for another boat with hundreds of people to sink.  There is a first response and the issue is very complex.  We would like to see a government installed in Libya with which we can talk.</p><p>That is one of the big tasks for the United Nations and the special representative and we will do our best.  In Italy we have a special sensibility due in part to the fact that it is a country which, like Ireland, has exported its people for decades or centuries.  It is a complex phenomenon.  Italians are coming to Ireland because Italy is facing a difficult economic problem.  We know that the people arriving in Italy do not want to stay there because they will not find jobs and many of them have relatives in France or Germany.  We can try to keep them, but they will do everything they can to reach these countries.  What is going to happen then?  Some of them are going to be accepted, while the police will bring others back to Italy.  It is not the solution, but there is more sensibility and concern about this issue at European level.  Our Prime Minister who is facing a difficult internal problem in introducing reforms while leading a government that enjoys only a slight majority is keeping it in focus and will try to convince our European partners to share the burden.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1434" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Sutherland" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015042900002#H00200"><p>I will begin by addressing the points made by Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe because they are relevant to the broader debate.  The ten point plan and the conclusions of the European Council will not work as they do not go far enough and are not clear enough.  They are an attempt to stem the flow of migrants in a way that, in the case of activities such as sinking boats, will require a resolution of the UN Security Council.  Libya has made it clear that it will not accept any intervention in its territory.  That country is in major political turmoil, but in so far as it is possible to ascertain its government's position, it is understandably opposed to any such external intervention.  I have issued a statement, with the heads of the UNHCR and the IOM, indicating that this is not an adequate response to a very serious problem.  I am afraid that is the reality.</p> <p>  With regard to the fact that people are kept in camps for prolonged periods, this is unacceptable.  The reason is processing is not carried out at a sufficiently rapid pace and often is focused on particular countries which have to bear the greatest burden without help from others.  Front-line states, including Italy, are left to process everybody because the country of first landing is obliged to provide refuge for the asylum seeker.  Once processing has been completed and the individual is certified as a refugee, that is, somebody who is avoiding persecution and cannot be sent back, he or she becomes part of the same economic community as the rest of us, with all of the rights of travel, etc., that go with it.  Something has to be done about this in terms of the sharing of responsibility.  The question arises as to whether we will have that sharing of responsibility instead of people in the north of Europe claiming it is not their problem simply because refugees are landing on Lampedusa rather than Ireland's Eye.  I understand the argument that it is easy to say but not as easy to do, but the fact is that others are doing it.  Even allowing for population differences with Germany and Sweden, the figures for these countries are telling in comparison to those for Ireland.  Last year the Netherlands took in 10,620 refugees.  Denmark, with a population comparable to that of Ireland, took in 3,360 refugees.  We would not be dealing with hundreds of thousands of refugees, which I recognise would create massive political uproar, if we were to take our fair share of what was required.  Even Malta took in 1,610 refugees.</p> <p>  A number of members asked how we could convince people this was necessary or desirable.  The only way they can be convinced is by articulating the facts.  Britain, where I spend my time, has failed to do this because the subject is virtually taboo among a political class which fears that it will translate into lost votes at the general election.  The issue was not explained, even though the British Department of Economic Affairs had clearly established that the net contribution of migrants was significantly positive in economic terms and that much more was paid in tax than what was paid out in benefits.  There are also more entrepreneurs and innovators among the immigrant community than among the national community.  In this country attention could be drawn to the fact that during the period of severe economic crisis post-2008 we still received large numbers of immigrants, particularly from central and eastern Europe.  They found jobs that were available to Irish people but which were not being taken up.  They were badly needed.  In this and other cities in Ireland one can be served by excellent immigrants who are working in restaurants or our homes.  The evidence indicates that, while there was emigration during that period, there was also a significant flow of immigration.  Immigrants were generally welcomed.  I have never heard negative comments about the immigrant community.  Perhaps there are negative comments, but I think immigrants make a great contribution to Irish life.  </p> <p>  Germany has a need for migrants.  It faces a demographic problem we do not have.  Europe will require an additional 60 million workers between now and 2050 to maintain the current worker-retiree balance.  To achieve this figure, it will need to attract millions of immigrants annually rather than the relatively paltry numbers currently immigrating.  Perhaps it is less than generous to say Germany is motivated more by filling its demographic hole than by doing the right thing.  There is a fair amount of doing the right thing in Germany's policies, as well as in what is being done in Sweden, Italy, Spain and France.  There are differences in attitude, but some countries are doing the right thing.  The issue has been elevated in Germany to a level of political discourse that makes me wonder about what is happening in other countries.</p><p>For example, migration was one of the main subjects at this year's annual meeting of all German ambassadors.  I was at the meeting.  It has been elevated to the highest level.  The government responsibility for migration and development, which are inextricably linked, is organised in a way that requires interdepartmental structures.  In Germany that is done under the Chancellor.  There is a strong argument for the department in charge not to be a silo but an intergovernmental group.  In most countries the business of migration is handled by the department of justice, home affairs, homeland security or the interior, as it is described in many European countries.  We need some structure which brings together development, foreign affairs and different aspects, including - this is important - homeland security or border control. to get a proper policy mix.  I am not saying there is none here, I do not know.</p><p> The point is made that part of the problem is of our own making, that is, of some European countries or, one might say, Europe as a whole, the United States or others, in terms of the diabolical situation in some of the north African countries, including Libya and Syria.  Who is responsible for that and what role can we play?  I am not going to get into an issue about whether Ireland can play any role at all having regard to its traditional positions in matters of foreign affairs on these issues and how it does it through the United Nations or whatever.  That is a big issue which would require a debate in itself involving issues such as arms sales etc., which are outside the general questions we have been asked.</p><p> In conclusion, the European situation is required to go much further than it has done in the recent conclusions.  The Commission is about to have another discussion which it is hoped will bring forward another series of proposals on this issue.  The Dublin regulation is inadequate and needs to be reviewed and refined.  It has to include explicit responsibilities being shared in the European Union.  It may be difficult to do that as the committee has suggested but that is what parliamentarians are for.  We have to do it.  It is easy to say that I am talking from outside and not dealing with political realities.  Maybe I am not but this is a political reality that is not going away.</p></speech>

Although we have weathered a difficult economic situation, the opinions around migration remain very positive.  There are two main ways to impress on the public the benefits of migration in general.  From a cultural point of view, migration is a success story for Ireland and a sign of a healthy country.  We have come to a stage where we celebrate our new citizens through the citizenship ceremonies.  This is a massively positive manifestation of how we see the changing diversity in Ireland.</p> <p>  The biggest gap between facts and public opinion is on matters such as the economic benefits of migration and, as Mr. Sutherland set out succinctly, these are proven again and again in Ireland and across Europe through deep and exhaustive research and campaigning by organisations such as ours.  Whether that is translated into public opinion is questionable.  Much of the time we repeat the message but the Government needs to take that on board too and say it is not that we do not talk about migration but that we talk about it in a positive way and show the benefits.  It is really important to impress on people that the complexities of immigration are very difficult for lay people to get their heads around.</p> <p>  It is important to recognise that in the present situation many of those we talk about are programme refugees, not necessarily people coming into the asylum process here to spend possibly years going through a determination process and ending up in direct provision and so on.  Programme refugees are entitled to work.  They can use their skills and abilities to contribute to Irish society, the economy and our development.  Many people do not recognise that when they consider immigration status.  They do not know the difference between someone with student status or in the asylum process and someone with refugee status.  It is important to be very clear about how Ireland would receive people in these circumstances.</p> <p>  There is also a question of values.  Even though we have gone through economic difficulty, we must not lose our humanity, our long and strong tradition on humanitarian issues, and we must show that we will do what is necessary and play our part, which will be proportionate.  No one is saying it has to be disproportionate.  Some of the questioners mentioned that there cannot be an open door policy.  No one in our contributions, or those of any organisations that talk about immigration here or at European level, is talking about open door policies.  We are talking about legal channels that allow people a path to a very secure situation.  Those can vary.  They can be student status, work permit status or, for example, the Syrian humanitarian access programme whereby family members of Syrian nationals were allowed to apply to come to Ireland.  The time and numbers were quite limited.  Approximately 110 people were granted access.  That is an example of using the discretion within the immigration system to come up with a way to allow people a clear channel to enter the country.  We refused maybe two thirds of applications for economic reasons, for the most part because the people did not have enough finance to support themselves.  That puts an economic lens on a humanitarian issue but it is an example of the type of thing we can do.  There is no reason a scheme such as that could not be revisited or expanded.  We have the ability to do that.</p></speech>

We employ over 5,200 people, have a network of 175 branches and serve almost 2 million customers.  We have lent in excess of &euro;31 billion across the island of Ireland and hold &euro;26 billion in customer deposits. </p> <p>  In 2014 lending activity increased by 38% with &euro;1.4 billion of new lending facilities to business customers and a further &euro;900 million in personal lending.  I am pleased to say this strong performance has continued into 2015.  We have submitted our responses to the committee's questionnaire and look forward to discussing this over the course of our appearance here.  Before we go into further detail, I would like to make a few comments regarding mortgage arrears and our standard variable mortgage interest rates, areas which are of particular interest to the committee.</p> <p>  Ulster Bank has made significant progress in helping 22,000 customers resolve their mortgage difficulties.  Approximately 2,000 customers, however, will neither pay their mortgage nor engage with us.  We believe this group of customers can be helped if they can be persuaded to engage with us.  As members have seen in our submission, we have published our commitments this week to encourage engagement and emphasise to customers in arrears that we have solutions, will help them and treat them fairly.  We can all agree that there is a cost to living in a home and that it is unacceptable for a borrower to make no payment whatsoever towards the cost of his or her accommodation.  Therefore, the mortgage payment must be regularised or we must enforce our security.</p> <p>  It is Ulster Bank's belief that its standard variable rate, SVR, is not overpriced.  The current narrative that the SVR minus the European Central Bank, ECB, rate equals margin is simply incorrect.  There is a range of other costs that must be factored into the SVR and these costs are substantially higher in Ireland when compared with other markets in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate.</p> <p>  Ulster Bank recently recorded an operating profit of &euro;752 million for 2014, representing the first annual profit since 2008.  This performance was driven by the underlying strength of the core Ulster Bank franchise, increased lending to customers, proactive management of our legacy issues, coupled with an overall improvement in the economy and the property market.  Our customers' requirements are also changing with digital transactions now representing 57% of our total transaction volumes.</p><p>We are also investing in our physical distribution, including a recent announcement with our arrangement with An Post providing customers with an additional 1,100 new points of presence.  </p><p> We have made significant progress in addressing and resolving our mortgage arrears issues.  From the outset our objective has been and is, to keep customers in their homes.  We have achieved month-on-month reductions in mortgage arrears every month for the past 25 months.  To date, 10,000 customers who were in arrears are now up to date and paying and a further 12,000 customers are on alternative solutions.  Of these 22,000 cases only five personal insolvency proposals were vetoed by Ulster Bank in 2014 and these were due to their specific circumstances.  It is disappointing, however, and notwithstanding the progress made to date, that approximately 2,000 customers will neither talk to us nor pay their mortgage, despite our efforts and the efforts of the Government, the Central Bank, the insolvency service and the courts, to encourage engagement.  In a further effort to engage with these customers, we have recently launched our commitments to customers in arrears which give specific assurance that these customers will be treated fairly.  With engagement we believe that satisfactory arrangements can be found for the vast majority of these customers.  There are no circumstances where we or society in general can sustain or justify a situation where a mortgage holder continues to make no contribution towards the cost of his or her accommodation.  As I said earlier, there is a cost to living in a home and this must be recognised.</p><p> In the absence of engagement and where no repayment is being made, we are left with no alternative but to continue with legal proceedings.  This is not a good outcome for anyone as the legal process does not generally provide any realistic alternative other than repossession.  Any further initiatives in this area must ensure that secured lending remains prioritised over unsecured lending in all repayment situations.  If secured mortgage debt is treated with similar or lesser status to unsecured lending, then inevitably the cost of mortgage lending will increase as it becomes quasi-secured debt.  In making this argument we recognise and accept that unsecured lending by banks should be treated in the same way as all other unsecured lending.</p><p> Within the wider RBS, mortgage lending is an important part of our offering in all our main markets, including England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland.  Broadly speaking the interest margins in all of these markets is similar.  However, unlike the other markets, our mortgage book in Ireland has been loss-making.  Notwithstanding this fact and reflecting our commitment to the market, we have been progressively reducing our variable interest rates to both our existing and new customers.  Separately, the cost of providing mortgage finance reflects the cost of our capital funding, operations, compliance, management of arrears, credit losses and levies.  Virtually every one of these inputs in Ireland is substantially higher when compared to other markets in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate.  In this context, we do not believe that our SVR is overpriced.</p><p> I reiterate that we continue to make significant progress in helping customers in financial difficulties and we are confident that we can help any remaining customers who are in difficulty if they are prepared to engage.  However, in the absence of engagement and where there is no regular payment, we are left with very little alternative but to go through the court process.</p><p> Second, our standard variable rate is not overpriced.  The cost of providing mortgage finance in Ireland is substantially higher than in other jurisdictions in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate.  Third, RBS is committed to Ulster Bank and it is unique in the market as an internationally owned systemic bank that operates across the island of Ireland.  Ulster Bank looks forward to continuing to support personal and business customers and the broader economy, both now and into the future.  I am happy to take any questions from members.</p></speech>

I wish to deal with the point made by Mr. Brown that the cost of providing mortgage finance in Ireland is substantially higher than in other jurisdictions in which Ulster Bank and RBS operate.  It is my understanding that the lowest three-year rate for a borrower in the Republic is 3.65%.  However, a person in the same loan-to-value can borrow at 1.49% fixed rate in Northern Ireland.  Is that correct and can there be that level of a difference, which is more than 100%, going from 1.5% to 3.5%?</p></speech>

The comments I made were with regard to standard variable rates and there is a consistency in rates between the two markets for fixed rates depending on the term of the loan.  It is correct that depending on the loan-to-value ratio and other credit criteria there can be differences in rates.</p></speech>

It also depends on the loan-to-value ratio, the value of the lending against the home, the underlying security.  The risk can be higher or lower so that impacts pricing as well.  It also depends on the customer's individual credit criteria.  There are a number of criteria that could impact on the difference in rate.  This also applies to our standard variable rates here in the Republic of Ireland.  Our standard rate is 4.3% but customers can get lower interest rates depending on the loan-to-value they borrow against.</p></speech>

There is very little difference between the rates that we charge and there is very little difference between the cost of funds across those lines.  The margin is more or less similar.  However, there is a distinct difference in terms of providing the cost of the mortgage to customers here.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, capital operational costs, the cost of servicing arrears, the cost of funds, etc., are all significantly higher in this market.</p></speech>

When banks are looking at the capital they have to put behind particular assets, they have to look at the historical performance of the business.  It is a regulation and accounting requirement matter.  It is not something we choose to do, it is a matter that is required of us as a prudential institution.  Looking at the loss history and the loss performance of the portfolio in the Republic of Ireland, we end up with a significantly higher risk-weighted asset percentage applying to a mortgage in the Republic of Ireland than we do in Northern Ireland, England, Wales or Scotland.  That is effectively something that will change over time as the historical loss performance washes through, but at this point in time, the models we are using and the calculations we are making require us to hold multiple times the capital more for the same risk in the Republic.</p></speech>

I am pleased they have restored the bank to profitability and I hope they will stabilise matters at the 175 bank branches.  I hope Ulster Bank will not close any further branches.  I do not think they anticipate doing that.  Ulster bank has 2 million customers.</p> <p>  A major issue for the committee has been the difference between the SVR and the ECB rates.  I accept the point that interest rates range from 3.5% to 4.3%.  What are the specific component parts?  Are the 2,000 customers who will not engage with the bank being prosecuted for recovery of the money?  Do I understand from the replies that in the case of somebody who voluntarily surrenders the house, the bank will go after the client for the residual debt, even where the individual may not be able to afford it? </p> <p>  How does Ulster Bank handle the case of clients who did not engage until they had been prosecuted, but following prosecution they engage with the bank?</p></speech>

We are on record as saying that we will not close any more branches this year.  We recognise the importance of a physical distribution network, hence the reason we enter into what we think is a very important relationship with An Post so that our customers have access not just to the 175 branches but now have access to another 1,100 outlets as well.  I cannot say that we would never close any more branches further out into the future because it does depend on customers preferences and behaviour but what we can say is that we will respond to that and make as many points of presence available to our customers as we possibly can.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Bell to address the specific points.</p></speech>

We have stated our policy that where a person who is 90 days in arrears and has not engaged with the bank, we would have to initiate legal action.  It is the responsible thing to do.  We are using the commitments we made on Monday to encourage people who may have thought it is too late, because the legal process has commenced that it is not too late to deal with the bank.  We want to encourage them by saying it is never too late.  It is only too late when the judge finally announces an eviction date, which is something we want to avoid at all costs.  We have ensured that at every court hearing there is a representative of the bank available so if the customer arrives at the court process wishing to engage we can pick up with them there and then.  We have adjourned hearings in the past because the customer has approached us prior to the hearing, saying they would like to talk to us about a solution.</p> <p>  The overwhelming message about the commitments we made is that engagement is critical and it is never too late to engage.  We think it is important to recognise that the kind of payments we are looking for when a restructured home loan repayment is agreed will be substantially less, by some margin, than an equivalent private rental cost.  The reason for our comments regarding eligibility for social housing is because of the income level that would be relevant for that consideration.  There is absolutely no way we are able to restructure the mortgage so that it becomes affordable for somebody at that level of income.  We think it is the responsible thing to do to say that if somebody's financial circumstances have deteriorated so much that they are reliant on the State to provide housing, it would be irresponsible of us to pursue them for a shortfall after the property has been sold.  Where somebody in our opinion is perfectly able to service a restructured home loan and simply does not wish to, then if the end of that process is the sale of the property, we would look at recovery of the shortfall.  We think that is the right thing to do because if the customer had engaged, we believe we could find a solution which would have kept them in the home, which is absolutely our first priority at all times.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1503" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Stanley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#D00400"><p>I will take that question.  One of the specific components would be the capital.  During a previous response to questioning, I spoke about capital.  The other component is funding.  Let me clarify a point on funding.  We are a subsidiary bank of a parent and as part of our financial disclosures, we do not have the same levels of disclosures as one would see in AIB or Bank of Ireland.  AIB would have given a fair bit of detail on its funding rate.  We have indicated in the response that, given we are in the same market, our funding levels are not that dissimilar from those that are disclosed by the other banks.  Our parent will obviously have a full disclosure similar to the likes of those banks, and that is available in their accounts.  That is a matter for their operations but we have to fund ourselves in the Irish market.</p> <p>  When we take those funding costs away from the 4.3% standard rate, taking the standard variable rate as an example, the margin we end up with in the market will be about 300 basis points before we take all our other costs, capital and everything else from those.  That is a very similar margin to what we are earning in the North of Ireland in Ulster Bank's own operations.  It is a similar margin to what RBS earns in its domestic markets.</p> <p>  The other component elements would be standard operation costs for running the mortgage areas and running the arrears areas as well.  We have to attribute a portfolio element of credit losses.  We do not make an assumption, despite the difficulties that may exist from a legal perspective, in terms of recovery in the market.  We make a run rate or normalised assumption as to what the portfolio would attract by way of credit losses in a normal market.  These are probably the main principal components, and while there is a little bit for levies and other items, these are the principal items.</p></speech>

That seems a remarkable admission.  Is it the case that the mortgage business as it currently stands is unsustainable?  Does that mean that in the short to medium term there is no proposition of a cut to the rate for mortgage holders?</p></speech>

The losses have been significant.  We have experienced losses across the various types of mortgages, be it trackers, fixed or variable rate mortgages.  With regard to the standard variable rate loans, the rate we are charging coupled with the cost we are incurring, assuming a normal regularised market, is such that we can probably make a reasonable return on shareholders' funds.  Unless any of these other costs come down, be it the cost of funds, the amount of capital we have to have, the credit losses and so on, the standard variable rate will not come down.</p></speech>

I think it was the right thing to ask about 18 months ago if there would be a viable business for Ulster Bank in this market.  A review was undertaken over a 15-month period and there was a very clear commitment from RBS that they are committed to Ulster Bank.  We think there is an opportunity for Ulster Bank to be a competitor in the market and to contribute to the economy.  We are looking for the market to rise over time, which is what we would expect.  The members should put out of their mind any questions or doubts about our commitment.  We are here to stay.</p></speech>

Is the Ulster Bank policy to write off residual debt for those who are eligible for social housing, having surrendered their home a new policy?  Is it available to people in the North of Ireland?  With regard to residual debt for others, the bank will still seek to chase it, but is there a seven-year or other timescale when it will come to be considered at the end?</p></speech>

Non-performing loans, which is the measure of cases 90 days or more in arrears, never peaked beyond 4.5% in Northern Ireland whereas here it peaked in the high 20%.  The nature of the problem is very different and therefore the nature of the solutions we offer are different in Northern Ireland from the Republic.  The legal system that applies in Northern Ireland is based on the system in the United Kingdom and as such there was no impact on Northern Ireland from the Ms Justice Dunne ruling which in effect meant for two years, between the middle of 2011 and the middle of 2013, there was no meaningful threat of repossession.  I say that upfront because it is probably not helpful to try to compare the mortgage arrears activities between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  In fact, the regulatory view of what are appropriate solutions between the PRA and FCA and the Central Bank are quite different as well.</p></speech>

It is not really necessary to address the problem in the North based on our experience.  Where we believe a person has the capacity to pay for a restructured home loan but chooses not to and works to sell the property, we would look at the residual debt on a case-by-case basis.  We recognise that in some instances we may achieve a better outcome through the co-operation of the customer than if we had to go through a lengthy court process.  We would typically not look to go beyond seven to ten years in any kind of arrangement because that would be consistent with the personal insolvency Act.  We do not want to put people in a position whereby in co-operating with the bank, they put themselves in a worse position than if they had gone through a personal insolvency process.  We would typically base our expectations on affordability and their individual circumstances.</p></speech>

That is the level of repossessions that most economies would see as they correct from a severe economic contraction.  The level of 150 repossessions a quarter, which is the most recent figure we quoted, would seem to be a more normal representation of what will be needed to see this problem work through the courts system.  The difficulty is that for the period from mid-2011 to the end of 2013, the average number of repossession was 26 per quarter, not 150.  One has seen quite a dramatic difference.  In effect what happened was that cases that could not be heard for two years or more are now having to hit the system.</p></speech>

Let us suppose a debtor is trying to negotiate a better deal on a particular debt and he makes an offer to pay back 30% of the debt to the bank.  He is refused and then the debt is sold to a third party for maybe 20% of the value, etc.  I am not saying this has happened with Ulster Bank.  Is it the case that debt is sold to third parties for less than the negotiated offer from the dweller or business person?</p></speech>

The last question relates to one of the points Mr. Brown made in his presentation.  He mentioned the fact that if secured debt were no longer secured it would have an upward pressure on the cost of lending.  Is Mr. Brown averting to a situation whereby the banks would no longer have a veto in a negotiated settlement?  Is he saying that taking away the veto from a bank would have the effect of increasing the cost of debt?</p></speech>

What we are saying is that if any further measures are introduced people need to be mindful of the fact that the rights of secured lenders need to be preserved.  The reason interest rates are relatively low on mortgages is because of the right to enforce that security.  If that right were over-ridden or if it became quasi-secured then the reality is that the interest rates would reflect the increased risk we would be running on the portfolios.</p></speech>

This is to reflect the fact that there is no real security for lenders to rely on in those cases.  The reason for standard variable rates being at comparatively low levels is because of that effective security.</p></speech>

What we are saying is that because we operate Ulster Bank in Northern Ireland and we also operate in the rest of Great Britain, we can say to the committee that, based on our experiences in those markets - we operate in all of them - the amount of capital that we have to deploy against each mortgage that we issue is higher in terms of risk-weighted assets.</p></speech>

However, we continue to monitor the rate based on competition, clearly.  Importantly, as we were saying a moment ago, it is also related to the cost of paying the mortgage.  That is made up of a number of components, be it cost of funds, capital operating costs, mortgage arrears, credit losses, levies and so on.</p></speech>

They would not be short-term interest-only arrangements.  They would be longer term periods of lower interest, capitalisation of the arrears or an extension of the term.  These are arrangements that are far more permanent in their nature.  It is fair to say that there is ongoing work involved in working with these customers.</p> <p>  This goes back to the point about engagement.  We do not have a once-and-done approach to engagement.  We ask customers to keep talking to us because we recognise that mortgage arrears typically mean general financial distress.  Unexpected events can occur which may make a payment difficult to make in a particular month.  We still work closely with customers who are on arrangements even though the arrangements are functioning effectively.</p></speech>

Short of the kind of situation that always happens or that can happen where a person loses his job, these are reasonable solutions from the point of view of the person who is the borrower.

As part of the mortgage arrears process and in the event that a customer took the view that the arrangement he was offered was unfair, he has a statutory right to appeal.  He could appeal to an independent body within the bank which then looks at the circumstances of the case.  The levels of appeals that we have experienced within Ulster Bank Ireland Ltd. has been extraordinarily low.  We take this as a sign that the customer is broadly happy with the proposal that has been made.</p></speech>

It appears, on the face of it, that the steps Ulster Bank has taken are positive.  How does Ulster Bank propose to proceed?  Is Ulster Bank treating it without discernment?

As I said in my opening statement, although we, the Government, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the Financial Regulator have been trying to encourage engagement, it has not happened.  That is why we have come out with our commitment to make it very clear to customers that we want them to engage, we have solutions and we will treat them fairly as we go through it.  If those people are apprehensive about dealing with the bank, the commitment spells out how we will deal with it.  If there is no engagement, we cannot offer solutions.</p></speech>

In many of the instances there had not been adequate engagement by the customer before a relatively late appeal by the personal insolvency practitioner for a solution.  One of the essential aspects of the personal insolvency process when it was launched was that it was for people who had engaged meaningfully with the institution, could not reach an agreement and were insolvent.  We have seen some cases, and they are representative in the five cases, in which there had been no engagement until the very last minute.</p></speech>

Is there much room for objective judgment?  A person resident in a house such as Gorse Hill might or might not automatically be on the social housing list.  If the bank judges a person to be a significant earner, how severe is the assessment?  Could the bank use the eligibility for social housing to put a line through many of the 2,000 and prevent them from getting what they thought they would get?</p></speech>

The significant majority of our customers have a home loan balance that is considerably less than &euro;200,000.  Even at the standard variable rate, the capital and interest repayment would be well within the affordability of somebody who has an income of &euro;35,000, based on tax deductions, etc.  In many counties and for the vast majority of people, social housing eligibility is within the &euro;30,000 to &euro;35,000 range, although it is less in certain parts of the country.  We thought it was an effective commitment to make because above the levels that would typically qualify a person for social housing, it provides the kind of income that would allow a person to service a restructured loan.</p></speech>

I would like to discuss the variable rate mortgages and the apparent differences in the rates here compared to those in the UK.  While profiles of borrowers can vary anywhere, variable interest rates seem to be higher here than in Britain and the North of Ireland.  The witnesses referred to greater risk in the South.  Could they elaborate on it?  Is the greater risk to do with what we have just been through, namely the bubble, the crash and the unprecedented mortgage arrears crisis?  Does the bank constantly factor it in and recoup its losses?  Is that the reason rates are higher here?</p></speech>

Separately, a dialogue has been going on in the market that somehow the standard variable rate, SVR, is tied to the ECB rate which then determines margins.  This is not the case.  A number of factors need to be taken into account when determining the profitability or otherwise of a mortgage.  Because we operate on both sides of the Border and in the UK, we know the SVR for a similar type of product to a similar type of customer is very similar in Northern Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales and the cost to fund it is very similar.  Although the rate might vary by 20 basis points, so does the cost of funds.  Clearly, we do not have the same information about Europe.  The margin on all those loans is very similar, as Mr. Stanley said earlier, approximately 3%.  A number of costs are incurred in providing mortgage, including capital, the cost of funds, operating expenses, the cost to service mortgage arrears, credit losses and levies.  Despite the fact that the margins are the same, the cost to provide all of those imports in terms of servicing a mortgage is higher in this market than in other markets in which we operate.</p></speech>

There has also been clear communication from Government, the Central Bank, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and even the court process and despite all of that, there is a group of customers that still will not engage, even through to the court process.  It has been reported that only one in five turn up in the courts, for example.  I cannot explain that but in recent days we have come out with our commitments to customers in arrears in terms of how we will treat them so that they can see that the process we would be putting them through will be fair.  We would rather that those 2,000 customers engage with us because if they do we believe we have got a solution that will help them, just as we have helped the other 22,000 customers, but we need to engage.  As to why they are not, I cannot answer that.</p></speech>

I am disappointed that has not materialised to a greater extent because it is potentially the solution to many of the most difficult cases that one would imagine, that is, people who have lost their jobs and those on low income.  Mr. Brown might answer that but I will ask him one final question given that my time is running out.</p> <p>  A big issue that has dominated the agenda in recent weeks is the events around Siteserv, and it has opened a window to the bigger issue of big write-downs for corporate and commercial interests.  While Mr. Brown is not involved in the Siteserv issue, has he any opinion on the scale of the write-downs being handed out, and what is Ulster Bank's record in regard to big write-downs?  The Minister is now saying, after the event, that he wants to know about any write-down over &euro;10 million and so on.  Can Mr. Brown tell us anything about the volume of big commercial loans his bank has written down and the writing down of loans in those type of circumstances to that extent, which is arguably of significant benefit to the companies that get them?</p></speech>

We have virtually disposed of all of that; the majority of it will be done by the end of this year.  We have taken some gains back in terms of realising slightly more for the assets than what we had marked but, generally for us, the situation is that the majority of those loans have been disposed.</p></speech>

We stick to our distinction between write-downs and write-offs.  There will have been large write-offs as a consequence of disposing of assets at today's market prices, which would be substantially less than the price at which we financed the transaction, but we have not done large-scale write-downs for companies that have continued to trade as normal.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions primarily on the standard variable rate.  First, in response to question No. 4 Mr. Brown said that a permanent interest rate reduction has been invoked in zero cases.  That strikes me as strange.  In most cases the mortgage holder is endeavouring to do their best but often it is the marginal difference that determines whether they can make a payment in terms of the higher or lower rates Ulster Bank charges on mortgages at various stages, be it on the basis of their loan to value, fixed or variable rate.  Mr. Brown might comment on that and also on a comment by the previous speaker with regard to mortgage to rent.  What is the impediment to that being used more widely?</p> <p>  Second, in respect of the fact that Ulster Bank operates in Northern Ireland, what is Mr. Brown's experience there of the bankruptcy regime, which is a one year bankruptcy term, and how that impacts on its mortgage book?  Where it is invoked, what has been the outcome for the family home in those situations?</p> <p>  Third, Mr. Brown made reference to the factors that impact on the bank's variable rate including capital levies, taxes, compliance costs, credit losses, operational costs, etc.</p><p>I presume these factors also impact on the bank's credit rating.  Does Ulster Bank have two separate credit ratings for its operations in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland?  Are the two credit ratings different, and if not, does it suggest that those who operate the ratings see no significant difference in the operating risks of loan books in the two jurisdictions?  How active is the switching market in Northern Ireland?  How many competitors does Ulster Bank have in Northern Ireland compared with here, and is the relative lack of competition here a factor that enables the bank to charge a higher interest rate here?  Does Ulster Bank have a profile of the 2,000 non-engagers in terms of age, employment and loan-to-value ratio?  I appreciate that if a person does not open his or her post, the bank has a difficulty.  On the basis of other products that exist regarding switching, loan-to-value ratios and appreciating property prices, could the non-engagers become compliant mortgage holders?</p></speech>

Whatever the period, those customers will not engage with us, and changing the bankruptcy period will not cause them to do so.  Unless customers respond to the commitments we have just launched, the only tool we have is the court process.  The standard variable rates are very similar in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and the margins are virtually identical.  We have four or five key competitors in the mortgage market here.  Although the competitors in the North are different, competition is equally active, and there are competitors there from the rest of the UK and Europe.  The number of competitors is similar in round terms.  We are rated by Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.  Although I do not have the ratings here, we are happy to provide them.</p></speech>

Our Northern Ireland company, UBL, holds the investment in UBIL, which is the Republic of Ireland company.  The liquidity regime for UBL is very much wrapped up in Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, and there is a look through to that linkage to the parent, whereas UBIL is increasingly being regarded by the rating agencies on a standalone basis.  Given that Moodys is reviewing its methodologies and reinforcing this approach, I expect to see the existing differential widen.</p></speech>

It is very positive and I hope it continues.  I recognise the efforts Ulster Bank has made in the mortgage arrears crisis.  People who work on behalf of borrowers have said positive things to me about Ulster Bank and told me the bank is making genuine efforts to keep people in their homes, where possible, and come to reasonable agreements.  I also welcome the fact that the interest rate fell by a few basis points in March.</p> <p>  I will pick up on Deputy Boyd Barrett's line of questioning.  Although Ulster Bank has nothing to do with Siteserv or the IBRC sales processes, let us say a company with a market capitalisation of approximately &euro;50 million owed Ulster Bank &euro;150 million, but an agreement was reached that the company would be sold and the amount raised returned to Ulster Bank, which would write down approximately 65%.  In this case, would the shareholders ever get a multi-million euro pay-off as part of the transaction, thereby reducing the amount Ulster Bank would receive by several million euro?</p></speech>

I very much welcome Monday's statement that, in particular situations, the residual debt after a voluntary sale would be written off.  On the last occasion we spoke, Mr. Brown said where Ulster Bank had a controlling vote on a proposed personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, if the arrangement included the write-down of debt on the part of Ulster Bank, the bank's policy was to vote against the PIA.  Now that the very welcome precedent has been set in limited circumstances, would Mr. Brown envisage Ulster Bank, where it has a controlling vote, being open to PIAs that may include some write-down of debt as part of a reasonable solution?</p></speech>

What we have done, in a last ditch effort to get that clear message out to customers, is to come up with a customer commitment that clearly states how we will engage with customers and that we will treat them fairly.  It reiterates many of the points that were mentioned previously but it set them out in a way that is very clear and transparent for customers.  I will ask Mr. Bell to comment on specific examples.</p></speech>

What we said, with respect to those commitments on Monday, is that in the event of a write-off at the end of a sale process, we will not chase the residual shortfall for those people who are at a sufficiently low income that they would be eligible for social housing.</p> <p>  In terms of our approach to the personal insolvency process, we are still of the view that the vast majority of cases can be resolved without the need for a principal write-down.  Our concerns around that are that it is not a solution that could be offered to everybody.  We, as an organisation that has said we wish to be known for trust, service and advocacy are deeply uncomfortable to offer solutions to some people that we cannot offer to very many people.  We are in a position where the Irish real estate market is recovering from a very low base but offering somebody a write-down of principal and leaving the contractual interest rate the same simply extracts profit in a different way and creates a capital gain at the end of the process for which there is no real justification.  Our preference is to regard arrears as an affordability issue, to work on reducing the monthly payment as far as we can through either extending the term of lowering the rate for a period of time which can be quite lengthy.  However, for us, the consequence of writing down debt seems to create something of a moral hazard concern because, in reality, what it is doing is potentially rewarding those who borrowed most aggressively at the peak of the market as opposed to those who were more prudent in the run up to the peak.  The difference between policy and practicality-----</p></speech>

Various proposals are currently being considered by the Government on accelerating the pace of the mortgage crisis.  It has gone on in Ireland far longer than it has gone on anywhere else.  I tabled a motion in D&aacute;il last night that raised a few possibilities.  Can I get a quick response from the bank as to whether it would support the following four proposals?  I will go through them and Mr. Brown can then respond to them.  The first proposal is to move the bankruptcy period from three years to one year, at least for a term-limited time until the mortgage crisis is resolved.  The second is the provision of financial expertise, be it a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, or a personal financial adviser, to those who cannot afford them.  The third is the provision of legal representation.  What struck me about the process in the Circuit Court recently was that the borrowers who did turn up did not have a lawyer.  Borrowers were not turning up with legal representation in court.  The fourth proposal is a recommendation from the committee last year that the restructures offered by any lender would be stress-tested in the same way that new lending would be stress-tested.  Can I get Mr. Brown's response to those four proposals?</p></speech>

Therefore, the responses I will give may not be exact.  On the first issue, as I mentioned, I do not think that moving the three year period to one year is the issue in terms of speeding the resolution.  The key here is that there are two or three elements that make the process lengthy.  The first is that there is a code of conduct on mortgage arrears process, which we need to go through with customers.  That can be quite protracted.  Getting into the court process and getting a case through the system, heard and finalised is also very lengthy.  In my view the only way to shorten the process is to address both of those.  At present the only tool we have available to us, due to lack of engagement, is the court process.  Therefore, we have no choice but to go through that protracted process to get those 2,000 people to engage.  In terms of financial expertise, we already advise customers of that.</p></speech>

Repeated adjournments and extension of the situation simply adds to the balance, the cost and the losses that everybody will face.  We would be fine with bankruptcy periods of whatever length but what would make a huge difference is the ability for the court process to be speeded up in those cases where we agree this cannot be allowed to continue.  The measure of that can be seen in England and Wales where the court system is faster.  The most serious arrears have hovered between 0.2% and 0.25% of the total mortgage stock while in Ireland that equivalent number is nearly 10%, which equates to 50 times higher levels of serious arrears.  The simple answer for that being the case is that no repossessions are taking place.</p></speech>

We have another product, the economic concession, which operates similarly but we think it is actually better for the customer.  The Deputy will note from the numbers that we have provided that a significant number of customers have taken that solution.  Approximately 4,500 have taken up that product.  Mr. Bell might go through that and explain it.</p></speech>

The way it works is that we will agree to lower the interest rate and it can go as low as 0.5%, although not all cases are at 0.5%.  That concessionary rate can be for a period as long as seven years but they are not necessarily all for that period.  We picked seven years because we try to be complementary to the work of the personal insolvency service and we wanted to ensure that at the period end the customer would be able to resume normal service.  Because of the way that works, the vast majority of the customer's monthly repayments goes towards paying down capital.</p><p>They will not service interest unduly because the interest rate has been set at such a low level.  What one finds, therefore, over a medium to longer term forbearance period is that the balance the customer owes reduces and when the forbearance period ends the balance he or she must service on the original interest rate has been substantially reduced. </p></speech>

Given that some of these customers were on tracker rates of 1%, an arrangement under which the rate is reduced by 0.5% will not exactly allow them to see light at the end of the tunnel.</p></speech>

My fear concerns young families in a certain age bracket who are offered a restructured mortgage arrangement.  By the time their children start third level education they will be barely hanging on and will be unable to afford to pay the costs of putting their children through college.  I am afraid this will result in another dramatic event.  I discussed this issue with representatives of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service who expressed considerable concern that many people will encounter serious problems with third level education because they are barely hanging on under the current arrangements.</p></speech>

If one takes an average mortgage of &euro;170,000, in the case of a customer who is offered an interest only period at an interest rate of 2%, the monthly cost of his or her mortgage will be &euro;300 per month.  It is impossible to rent anything in Dublin for &euro;300 per month, whereas we can put in place a solution that keeps a customer in his or her home, provided there is co-operation and engagement.</p></speech>

This option removes the fear element.  While I appreciate that every case is different, I am not a fan of the concept Mr. Bell outlined.</p></speech>

Under our approach, the customer could pay down as much as that part of the debt that would have been warehoused during the forbearance period when the interest rate has been set low.  The net economic effect is, therefore, the same.  As we indicated to the joint committee in one of our first appearances before it, when we did the total cost of credit for a split mortgage against an economic concession for the same rates and terms, we found it was cheaper for the customer to have the economic concession than the split mortgage.  The reason is that typically the market construct for the split mortgage is that the contractual rate applies on the non-warehoused portion and a zero rate applies on the warehoused portion.  Net of those two factors, the customer can end up with a higher total cost over the life of the loan.</p></speech>

In such cases, Ulster Bank will already hold the title, for example, where the person is a farmer.  Does Ulster Bank ask customers in such circumstances to bear the full costs of perfecting the title for a second time?  Does the customer have to pay the bank's legal fees?  While I accept this is not directly related to mortgages, it also involves restructuring.  </p></speech>

Approximately 80,000 homes were being built annually a decade ago.  If Ulster Bank and all the other financial institutions are providing only 10% of the construction finance they were providing at that time, only 8,000 houses will be built annually.  This figure is nowhere near what the market needs.</p><p>Ultimately, if one is to look at how this will affect supply and demand for the housing market, it will reduce the amount of supply while demand increases.  Accordingly, the price of the houses goes up.  The value of Ulster Bank&rsquo;s loans and balance sheet will improve as a result of the restriction of the marketplace.  I have a problem with this and believe the Central Bank has a larger role to play in this.</p></speech>

However, this is all to the detriment of those who want to get on the housing ladder, particularly for first-time buyers who are down to 80% LTV, loan-to-value, ratios as opposed to the 100% RBS, Royal Bank of Scotland, introduced back in the day.</p> <p>  I am pressing upon Mr. Brown the need for Ulster Bank to give more money to site finance.  I have worked in this area in the past and I accept some of the lending then was over the top.  Ulster Bank&rsquo;s 10% of lending to this sector is going nowhere towards meeting current demand, however.</p></speech>

Across the island of Ireland, two thirds of our lending goes to the Republic.  Last year, we lent &euro;1.4 billion to business and gave &euro;900 million of new lending to mortgages.  We are active in supporting businesses and the mortgage market too.  That trend in lending has continued into this year.  We are looking to increase our lending by another 30% over and above what we lent last year.</p> <p>  However, we will be very prudent about the lending we will be doing.  We realised the role we play in the market but we do not want to get ourselves into the situation that we were previously.</p></speech>

In the Dublin area and other cities, I have seen many cases where there is a demand for housing but it is not being met by the banks.  It will be to the benefit of the banks&rsquo; shareholders to complete the circle.</p> <p>  How would reducing the bankruptcy term from three years to one year affect Ulster Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet?</p></speech>

Despite all the efforts we have made to engage customers, as well as the efforts made by politicians, the Government more broadly, the Central Bank, the Insolvency Service of Ireland and the courts, we still have 2,000 customers who will not engage with the bank.  We came out with our customer commitments earlier this week to make it clear as to how we will work with customers in this situation.  The bottom line to resolve this issue is to find a way to engage those 2,000 people.  Today, the only option we have if they do not engage is the court process.</p> <p>  I am less interested in the term going from three years to one.</p></speech>

There is a stigma attached to it with an unwillingness to declare it publicly and admit what is perceived as a failure when it is a consequence of something greater than the individual or the bank.</p> <p>  The one-year element will encourage many people to go down the route of bankruptcy.  I would like to see an arrangement put in place whereby a line is put in the sand after the term is over, meaning an individual&rsquo;s creditworthiness is fine and they are not excluded from the mortgage market, small business loans or car finance loans.</p> <p>  However, this will cost the banks money.  With the price of property going up, the banks are getting back towards equilibrium and hoping to get repaid the money they lent.  If people start pressing the eject button with the bankruptcy arrangement of one year, however, it will have a negative effect on the banks.  Ulster Bank is one of the better banks for dealing with customers and helping them with mortgage problems.  There is still a long way to go, however.  The numbers involved in negative equity, in arrears and distressed mortgages is enormous.  I am of the generation that is affected.  I would encourage the banks to facilitate the one-year term for bankruptcy.  The banks should allow for credit ratings to be renewed without the baggage of the past.</p> <p>  Has Ulster Bank engaged with the Department of Finance, the Central Bank or Financial Services Ireland on the idea of the bankruptcy period being reduced from three years to one?</p></speech>

In terms of risk appetite, to have the weighting of our balance sheet towards that one specific sector of the economy is not prudent.</p></speech>

However, I draw from that response that given everything that happened, if other banks are likely to have a similar concern about going down that road again, the current housing crisis will not be resolved - at least alone - by the finance that might be provided by the banking system in this country and that we are going to have to look elsewhere.</p> <p>  I understand Mr. Brown was not involved in Siteserv but if I may pursue the question I put to Mr. Brown about Siteserv-type scenarios.  If I understand him correctly he said that he cannot imagine a situation where a commercial loan of &euro;150 million would be written down by &euro;110 million where that company would continue in business.  I think that is what Mr. Bell said.  If I understand him correctly, Mr. Brown followed on from that to say that he cannot envisage circumstances where such a company that was being sold off that the shareholders would be allowed walk away with &euro;5 million.  That is fairly damning opinion in terms of what happened in Siteserv, even if Mr. Brown is being moderate in his statement of it.  I have one further question for Mr. Brown in the Siteserv case scenario.  Can he envisage a situation of that sort where the buyer of the company that is being sold off was somebody who also had a number of other companies that between them had a controlling share in a number of other companies and between them owed Mr. Brown's bank hundreds of millions of euro in other arrangements and that he would offer a write-down of that sort in that kind of arrangement?</p></speech>

Most of the losses that we have experienced have been on commercial real estate.  Over the past two to three years in particular, but before that, our exit strategy on those loans has been to take them to the market and either sell the loan or the underlying asset.  With regard to the specifics on Siteserv we were not involved with it so I cannot answer that question.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Boucher and his staff for their responses in writing to these queries, which we received last Monday.  The responses have been distributed to members.  Together with the input of our witnesses today, I hope all the key topics will be covered.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1734" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#O00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for introducing my colleagues.  I will be brief but on occasion I might ask my colleagues to speak on a couple of the items.  I propose to give an update on the group's strategy and financial performance, reflecting among other things that taxpayers have a 14% shareholding in this large pillar bank.  I will make a powerpoint presentation, one component of which will concentrate on matters that were particularly pertinent in the questions, that is mortgage interest rates and the group's management of challenged mortgages.</p> <p>  In slide 5, we give the key highlights of our financial performance for the year ended December 2014.  We have achieved a significant turnaround in the group's trading performance, approximately a &euro;1.5 billion turnaround.  What is particularly gratifying for us and I hope our customers, is the significant increase in new lending.  We did &euro;10 billion of new lending in 2014, which was drawn down last year.  We are the largest lender to the Irish economy.  Our UK mortgage business also contributes to the growth in new lending.  Primarily due to a reduction in the cost of money to the bank, reflecting a strategy the bank has pursued, our net interest margin improved during the course of 2014 to 2.11% for the year as a whole and the exit margin, that is the margin in the last quarter of 2014 was 2.22%.  We made further progress on our strategy of reducing defaulted loans and they came down by &euro;2.8 billion, that is 22% below their peak, but nevertheless it is still at a significant level of &euro;14.3 billion.  </p> <p>  During the past few years, but in particular with the coming of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, there has been a big focus on the bank's capital.  The bank's core equity tier 1 capital ratio improved significantly during 2014 to 14.8%.  We passed all the ECB stress tests with significant capital buffers and the intrinsic value of the group, that is the tangible net asset value per share increased by 13%.</p> <p>  On slide 6, we demonstrate that Bank of Ireland is a leading bank in the Irish economy.  We hold the No. 1 or No. 2 positions in all of our principal product lines.  In the 12 months to the end of December 2014, we provided one in three home mortgages in the Irish market.</p><p>We have 27% of the cash savings market.  We are the only bancassurer in the market.  We have 24% of the life assurance market.  We are Ireland's number one business bank based on Central Bank of Ireland verified statistics, where we did greater than 50% of new business lending and agri-lending, and we are the number one corporate bank. <br/><br/>Slightly differentiated from some of our competitor banks, we have retained a significant presence outside of Ireland, which is focused on Great Britain.  We have a partnership with the UK Post Office which has substantial market presence.  In Northern Ireland, which we view as part of our Irish-type operations but it is obviously in sterling, we have a universal bank offering.  We have an acquisition finance business, which operates internationally and primarily out of the United States.<br/><br/>I touch on the contribution to the economy on slide 7.  We lent &euro;5.7 billion into the economy in 2014.  I advised the committee at our last meeting that our ambition was to lend and to have drawn down &euro;33 billion in new lending into the Irish economy between 2013 and 2017.  The 2014 figures show we are on track to meet this target.  I will not continue with the advertorial in respect of the rest of the statistics.  <br/><br/>Our view is that the economy is picking up.  This is depicted on slides 9 to 10.  We are trying to demonstrate in slide 9 is that there is a classic investment-led recovery path coming from the export sector.  We have seen a pick up in consumer confidence and consumer spending money in the economy in 2014, which is particularly relevant to our business.  That has fed through into other confidence levels and an increase in the total number of people employed.  Slide 11 explains the same thing in a slightly different way.<br/><br/>Slide 13 is a brief summary of the breakdown of the financial performance.  Our income level and our net interest margin grew.  Our costs were broadly flat.  They were slightly up, which primarily reflects investments we are making in our businesses, in particular in our branch network in Ireland and our IT and digital banking infrastructure.<br/><br/>Reflecting the reduced level of defaulted loans, the restructures we put in place for customers, which are sticking, and a general improvement in collateral values, our provisions, that is, the loan loss charges we took, had a significant improvement in the year 2014.  That flowed through on the profit and loss to our accounts.<br/><br/>It might be useful to pause on slide 14, which focuses on the bank's net interest margin.  I draw the attention of the members of the committee to both graphs, but in particular the graph which is in the bottom left hand corner.  This graph shows the progression in customer pay rates, that is, our customer charge rate and the pay rate.  The lightish blue line is the pay rate we pay for funds and the dark blue line is the charge rate.  The improvement in our net interest margin has come primarily from a reduction in the cost of money to us rather than a change in charge rates.  We anticipate that, as we put on new lending at slightly higher margins and the tracker element of our book reduces as a proportion of the overall book, net interest margin growth will be primarily on the asset side.  <br/><br/>Slide 15 gives a little more information on the mix of new business and the mix of new lending that we are doing, broken down between Republic of Ireland mortgages, Republic of Ireland business banking, Republic of Ireland corporate banking, our UK mortgage business and our acquisition finance business.  That table shows that in each of our main business lines we have seen good growth in customer demand and our ability to satisfy it.  <br/><br/>Given the time, I will skip slides 16 and 17.  Slide 18 is a reminder that the taxpayers have been repaid and are in a substantial profit<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their investment in Bank of Ireland.  Slide 19 gives a very quick pictorial overview of our market shares and our presences in the Irish economy.  Slide 20 is a pictorial representation of our UK businesses.  <br/><br/>In summary, the group has continued to deliver on the strategy we set when we recapitalised from the private market in 2011.  Our strategy has been focused on an Irish business and our ability to lend money in that Irish business.  We do not make money until we lend it and the growth in lending has been a particular stand out feature along with the reduction in the impairment charges, which came into the bank's capital.  Our overseas businesses are self-funded.  The group provides them with capital but they fund themselves.  These businesses are performing in line with our expectations and that has been reflected in our share price and the share price available to taxpayers. <br/><br/>I will ask my colleagues to address the committee on the mortgage issue.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1736" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam McLoughlin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#P00200"><p>I will cover briefly the situation in relation to mortgage pricing and will focus on presentation slides 51, 52 and 53.  We keep pricing of all our products under ongoing and active review.  Products, including our mortgages, are priced to reflect the cost of funds to the group, operating costs, including regulatory costs, and the estimated potential loan losses from the portfolio as well as capital and liquidity costs.  These are all factors the bank as a responsible lender must consider.  The structure and liquidity risk the bank takes against mortgages is a significant factor.  We must remember that the bank is providing a 25 to 25 year commitment of money to the customer and we cannot fund for that duration.  In accordance with commercial realities and Central Bank and single supervisory mechanism, SSM, macroprudential policy decisions, pricing is risk based using the the loan to value, LTV, band as a proxy.<br/><br/>As recently as January of this year, we announced a suite of attractive fixed rates ranging, depending on risk or loan to value, from 3.7%.  These fixed rates are available to both new customers and, importantly, existing variable rate and standard variable rate, SVR, customers.  Our costs of funds, as Mr. Boucher noted when dealing with slide 14, reduced by 23 basis points during the course of 2014.  This reduction is more than reflected in our revised fixed rate pricings announced in January.  In addition, while not a feature across the Irish market, we also give customers, from February of this year, the option to move to a lower LTV band and thus a lower fixed rate pricing on the provision of an up-to-date home valuation.  This feature is available to existing variable rate and SVR customers.  <br/><br/>The decision to take a fixed rate mortgage, which is always the customer's decision, gives certainty to the customer and the bank for periods of up to ten years, which is the longest term for which we will provide a fixed rate, at a time when fixed rates are at the bottom of an interest rate cycle.  At the end of 2014, fixed rate mortgages account for 9% of outstanding mortgage balances.  During the first quarter of 2015, circa 50% of new mortgage customers chose a fixed rate draw down.  In the month of March 2015 alone, more than 55% of new first time buyers chose a fixed rate.  Mortgage markets differ very significantly in structure and features across all EU member states and this prevents an accurate and transparent comparison.  <br/><br/>Slide 52 shows that the average SVR we charge in both Ireland and the UK are similar.  Our analysis shows that both our fixed rates and variable rates would result in mortgage repayments being less than rental costs.  Using publicly available data on <i>www.daft.ie,</i>we will look at a typical three bedroom semi-detached property in, say, Lucan in Dublin or Douglas in Cork.  We calculate annual savings for customers of more than &euro;2,000 per year against rental costs.  <br/><br/>I will pass over to Mr. Stephen Mason who will cover briefly the mortgage challenge portfolio. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1737" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mason" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#P00300"><p>A consistent application of our policies has meant we continue to make very significant progress in the management of mortgage arrears.  Full details are in the presentation but I will make some brief comments.  Starting with slide 25, we note that nine out of ten of our owner-occupier mortgage customers are fully up to date with their mortgage payments.  Nine out of ten of our owner-occupier customers who were in financial difficulty were offered a sustainable solution and nine out of ten of those customers are meeting the terms of their new arrangement.  All of our activities in our approach to mortgage arrears recognise the fundamental importance of the family home.  By the end of February this year, the number of owner-occupier accounts in arrears had dropped by 33% from peak levels seen in May 2013.  At the end of December 2014, 5.5% of our owner-occupier accounts were in arrears of greater than 90 days.  That is materially better than the industry average, excluding Bank of Ireland, where the figure was 11.6%.  Slide 25 of the presentation shows that we provided 32% of new owner-occupier mortgage lending in Ireland in 2014.  We hold 19% of the national stock of owner-occupier mortgages.</p><p>We have some 10% of the national stock of owner-occupier mortgages in arrears, some 9% of the national stock of these mortgages greater than two years in arrears, and we have issued just 6% of the civil bills issued nationally in 2014.</p><p> We have included an analysis of the repayment patterns of owner-occupier customers greater than two years in arrears, which shows, regrettably, that half of these customers paid nothing towards their mortgage in 2014.  This analysis also shows that the expected monthly payment for these customers averaged &euro;890 a month, less than the average monthly rental cost in Ireland of &euro;950.  Further analysis in the presentation shows that uniquely in the market, our owner-occupier mortgage balances greater than two years in arrears fell in quarter four 2014, whereas they rose at industry level.  The difference here is quite significant.  Some 3.6% of our book is greater than two years in arrears, whereas at industry level, excluding Bank of Ireland, the figure is 8.8%.</p><p> On slide 49, we show we have concluded significantly more of our owner-occupier solutions under the mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, process than the rest of the industry.  We have reached a conclusion with 83% of cases, whereas the industry, excluding Bank of Ireland, achieved a conclusion with 61%.  Again, the loss of ownership, as part of these concluded solutions, is significantly lower in Bank of Ireland.  We also provide significant detail in our pack in regard to personal insolvency, where we show we have voted in favour of 84% of the arrangements that have been proposed to us, higher than the overall Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, approval rate of 76%.  We fully engage with the ISI, as can be seen from the fact we have a participation rate of 36% or 363 protection certificates issued to the end of March 2015.  We provide details of the 18 cases where we were a secured creditor and the client proposed arrangement on slides 37 and 38.</p><p> I will now hand back to Mr. Boucher.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1741" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#Q00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Boucher and his colleagues.  We are in the process of meeting with the key banks to discuss the current situation, particularly in regard to mortgages.  I noted two bits of good news in the presentation from Mr. Mason.  First, I noted that 92% of Bank of Ireland owner-occupier mortgages are not in default and second, that of all the civil bills issued last year, Bank of Ireland was involved in only 6% of them.  This is quite a low figure for a big bank.</p> <p>  However, I have a question in regard to unsustainable mortgages, namely where there is an unsustainable mortgage and the mortgage borrower continues to be liable for the recovery of any shortfall between the sale proceeds and the mortgage loan, the negative equity part.  When people lose their house, they are homeless.  Does Bank of Ireland chase up homeless people for money? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1742" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mason" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#Q00500"><p>We answered that question in response to the questions submitted to us.  What we said is that mortgage lending is full recourse lending and that after a property has been disposed of, we will engage with the customers to come to an arrangement as to what they can pay in regard to the residual balances.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1743" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#Q00600"><p>I take it that is a "yes" therefore that the Bank does follow after homeless people for the balance.  The answer is that it is full recourse lending on the property and the person is liable for the recovery of any shortfall between the sale proceeds and the mortgage loan.  I am surprised, but Bank of Ireland seems to suggest it does follow up on homeless people for the negative equity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1744" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Mason" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#Q00700"><p>That is the nature of full recourse lending.  If there is a residual balance when the asset has been disposed of, on a case by case basis and understanding the new circumstances of the customer we look to see what contribution they can make towards the outstanding balance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1745" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#Q00800"><p>Bank of Ireland got off to a great start here, with a positive presentation.  However, it is now saying it will chase up homeless people.  I am amazed it would not leave homeless people alone.  Does it not think homeless people have enough trouble, without following them for negative equity?  I take it as a "yes" that it will follow up on them, because it cannot say it does not.</p> <p>  On the bank finances, impairment is a significant issue.  In the accounts for 2014, how much of a write-back was there in terms of previous impairments?  Obviously, the bank has been taking a prudent view each year and as values have improved and the number in default has decreased, I presume it has been able to write back some of what had previously provided for?  What is the figure for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#Q00900"><p>The provision to write back a recovery in the accounts was &euro;280 million.  That reflected the changes in our financial models and, in particular, reflected a change in house price assumptions.  Up to June 2014, we had been making a conservative assumption that the peak to trough fall in house prices was 55%.  Then as we considered our provision, we said there was probably another 10% on top of that for cost of disposal and cost of sale etc.  As the market improved, from an accountant point of view an ability to continue to maintain a 55% assumption was no longer correct and that was reflected in &euro;280 million of a provision recovery.</p></speech>

As we know, the market is made up of a number of micro markets.  Dublin is different from Kerry, for example, and we try to look at the price in the various markets.</p></speech>

I would say we may be slightly more conservative than some of our competitors.  If we look at the relative performance of our Irish mortgage book, as outlined by Mr. Mason, our provision in coverage would be higher than that of most of our Irish competitors.  We believe it is appropriate to maintain conservative coverage ratios, because while we have a strong view the economy is recovering, we must learn the lessons of the past.  Things go the wrong way.</p></speech>

I know it has been said people can switch to fixed mortgages, but very few have switched.  Why have we such a variation between the cost of funds at 1.03% and the standard variable rate of 4.5%?  I know Bank of Ireland took a strong view on this at its meeting this morning, but I would say it is making it easier for the Minister for Finance to come down stronger on the banks by its resolute action.  Ministers are under significant pressure to exert what influence they can through the Central Bank and Bank of Ireland is making that job easier.  AIB was before the committee last week and it suggested there was a possibility of a reduction, but Bank of Ireland has taken a harder line.  I suggest that is not helping the bank's case when it comes to time for negotiation with the Minister, but perhaps Mr. Boucher thinks that does not matter anyway.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1761" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#Q02400"><p>Okay. The last topic I want to touch on is one Mr. Boucher may find easier to deal with.  Question No. 34 in the document asked about the various issues that go into the costs in determining interest rates and the list included funding costs, operating costs of the bank and credit risk costs.</p><p>This is the bit I found interesting because we had Ulster Bank in earlier.  Its representatives talked about the historical performance of the mortgage loan book in Ireland as having to be taken into account in determining the interest to be charged on new couples.  I accept that Mr. Boucher may not have the answer for me today.  If not, he might send us a note.  What additional costs are there in Ireland which the bank must take into account in charging interest rates on mortgages that do not apply in other jurisdictions?  In thinking about that matter, I note the historical cost of previous performance.  We were told an hour ago by another bank that must be taken into account.  There are also the capital and liquidity costs.  I also see in the document mention of regulatory costs.  Is it possible to give a note on the bank's cost structure in arriving at the standard variable mortgage rate?  To what extent do the extra regulatory costs in Ireland add to the rate versus other countries?  I ask Mr. Boucher to set out the additional costs.  The bank still has eligible liability guarantees of approximately &euro;1 billion, although I know it paid some off since year-end, as stated in the document.  The preference dividend payments are factored into the cost as is the bank levy.  Can Bank of Ireland give us a note of the costs it must take into account, including those imposed on it by the Central Bank and regulatory bodies in Ireland that may not be of a similar scale in other countries?  Looking at the document, it appears the bank has to take all of these into account, which adds to the costs.  It is very easy to blame the bank for the high variable rate but if that is due to the high costs being imposed as a result of bank levies, regulatory costs and the historical performance rules of the Central Bank, it would be nice to know.  How much of the extra cost is being imposed by the State with the bank just happening to pass it on to the customer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1763" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#R00200"><p>I understand the Deputy's point but there are a couple of things to say.  We will come back to him with more detail, particularly about the capital.  As we identified in slide 2 - as a public company, any announcements I make must be made publicly and verified - we have a similar sized mortgage book in the UK to Ireland.  They are roughly &euro;26 billion to &euro;27 billion.  The exchange rate will have an effect but they are roughly of similar size.  We have different product offers and fixed rates and a SVR or base rate concept in the UK as well as in Ireland.  Trying to look at a comparable product, which is a variable rate product, where the rate can be adjusted at the bank's discretion, in the second half of last year, our charge rate to the customer in our UK business for our variable rate mortgages was, across all of the variable rate offers - because we have different variable rate offers in Ireland - 4.49% whereas for our Irish book it was 4.3%.  As such, there is a slight misnomer that our charge rate is different in Ireland to the UK.  We compete aggressively in Ireland and the UK.</p> <p>  To come to a couple of the other points, I could not put my hand on my heart and say we suffer higher direct regulatory costs on our UK or Irish business.  Much of the servicing for our UK mortgages is done out of centres we have in Kilkenny and, as such, that provides employment in Ireland.  Wage rates are not hugely different between our Irish and UK businesses, broadly speaking.  The big difference between our Irish and UK business in mortgages is the historic loss experience, which has been considerable.  We have had to have provision charges over the last six years of roughly &euro;1.1 billion on our Irish mortgage book whereas it has been roughly &euro;150 million in the UK.  One has to build that into one's capital both for existing and new business.  The big difference is the loss experience, which comes into one's capital charge, and also the anticipation of the time to recovery where a customer defaults.  The time to recovery is dramatically different in our UK and Irish businesses.  I will come back with a more detailed explanation to the Deputy.</p></speech>

It is fair to say the bank is doing better than its competitors overall.  The bank is only responsible for 6% of the whole process of attempted repossessions.  When does the bank anticipate a pay off to the taxpayer of the remaining 14% or thereabouts?  There is public concern at the gap between ECB interest rates and standard variable rates.  Where there is severe hardship in the case of some families, is the bank open to third party review of the applicable standard variable rate in circumstances where the customer can demonstrate that the rate is inflicting hardship?  Would the bank accept an external agency to arbitrate on that matter in much the same way as the Credit Review Office assists SMEs with credit challenges?</p> <p>  I understand what Mr. Boucher said to Deputy Fleming about full recourse lending.  Where a repossession is voluntary with assisted sale or surrender and the bank knows the borrower has nothing else, I presume the bank will not pursue the person with regard to the outstanding debt.  There is nothing to pursue.  Has the bank analysed those in persistent arrears and established why they are failing to engage with the bank?  Engagement is the big thing.  What is the total amount of the current level of loans in arrears?  Has the bank sold any non-performing loans to debt investors, or vulture funds as they are more commonly known?  What steps has the bank taken to ensure that customers are protected where such a transfer takes place?  Perhaps, it does not arise.  I thank the witnesses.  That is my lot.</p></speech>

I will work backwards.  We were required under the restructuring plans with the EU to sell certain assets and loan books, but I cannot recall any Irish mortgage books being part of that sale.  We have, in fact, bought performing books.  We bought &euro;250 million of performing mortgage books from the IBRC receiver.  With regard to a customer with repayment challenges, for nine out of ten of our customers who come to us and fill in the standard form a solution can be provided with a restructuring option.  That may take a number of different forms.  It can be an extension, split mortgage, etc.  In nine out of ten cases, we can do that.  If some change in the interest rate is part of the solution, that is part of what we do.  Following engagement with and feedback from the committee approximately 18 months ago, we reduced the rate we charge on a split mortgage.</p> <p>  The State's ownership of the Bank of Ireland is a discretionary ownership by the Minister for Finance.  That is not something we have control over.  Our share register has changed a great deal since 2011 and the type of investor in the bank has changed.  At the end of 2013, our top ten investors accounted for 50% of the ownership of the bank, excluding the State, and that is now approximately 34%.  Large investors have been able to exit the bank stock as things have evolved at a discount of approximately 4% or 5% for chunks of 5% or 6% of the bank to the prevailing market price.  The Minister's decision is the Minister's decision, however.  He made a decision in 2011 to follow the taxpayers' money, in effect, and invested in the bank at that time when the stock price was 10 cent.  The stock price is now in excess of 35 cent, so the Minister looks to me like he knows what he is doing in terms of that investment.</p></speech>

We have a number of strategies in place.  We try to engage with customers from the start of the process, including by telephone and in writing.  If that does not work we then move to what is called the non-co-operating phase with customers, as provided for under the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA.  Under provisions 28 and 29 of that code, a series of letters are issued in which we warn customers of the implication of non-co-operation with the bank, following which they move into the non-co-operating phase.  If they continue not to engage, they then move into the legal process.  What happens, typically, is that as this process evolves we get engagement at each stage from customers.  Why some customers have not engaged with us, I cannot say.  I cannot explain why the small percentage of customers who have not engaged with us have not done so.  They will ultimately end up in the legal process.  We are open to them engaging with us at any stage of the process.</p></speech>

We hear regularly from banks that they deal with people on a case-by-case basis.  There are cases where an individual or family would be able to deal with, say, two thirds of the debt owed but cannot deal with 100% of the debt owed.  In some of those cases, the persons involved may go bankrupt or pay no money back to the bank.  There would be a net benefit to the bank in writing down the debt in those cases.  Why, in those cases, does the bank not allow for write-down?  In a similar corporate scenario the decision is made positively for a write-down.  There has to be a net cost to the bank in living up to its no debt write-down rule in certain cases.</p></speech>

We look at developments in the market that might work.  We recognise that there are unique situations in Ireland.  We have a large business in the UK, with a mortgage book which we manage.  If there is some solution whereby we could take an equity in a property and we think that would enhance the value, we would look at that.  However, I must reiterate that a mortgage is to an individual.  Clearly, one cannot take equity in an individual.  The property rather than the lending is the security.</p></speech>

Is it the case that the bank entered this phase with that advantage or is it the case that the manner in which the bank has managed the process has given it that advantage?</p></speech>

As we entered the crisis Bank of Ireland had a lot of problems, although probably slightly fewer problems than some of its competitors.  If we look at other metrics like, for example, the haircuts we took on loans transferred to NAMA, they were significantly below the industry average and provisions we have taken in business and other corporate books have been less than our competitors.  Our books may have been better positioned coming in, including our Irish mortgage book.  I think that was probably a factor.  We probably focused on this earlier than our competitors did.  However, in terms of the thrust of the Deputy's question, I think the consistency of our policies and procedures has been a feature of our relative performance.  There is confusion as to what some of our competitors do and do not do.</p></speech>

Allied Irish Bank appeared before the committee last week, at which time its representatives indicated that zero mortgage to rent cases have been concluded by that bank.  I note from Bank of Ireland's results that it has completed five cases.  Where does the problem lie and how can it be fixed?</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct that we have completed five cases.  Nine are sale agreed and contracted.  It is hoped that they will complete shortly as well.  There are another seven in respect of which we have accepted the offer made by the approved housing body.  It is now with the customer to accept what has been proposed.  There are five completed and a number of others close to completion.  There are 50 awaiting confirmation of demand from the local authorities and AHB.  There are a number of others that for various reasons did not proceed, including a lack of demand for social housing and the customer opting not to participate in the scheme.  I agree that the numbers completed at this point are disappointing.  We are great supporters of mortgage to rent.  It appears to us to be a very good solution to the problem for people whose properties are suitable for social housing, and for the people themselves.</p> <p>  We wrote to the committee 12 months ago, outlining details of how we thought the process could be improved.  There have been some changes made recently.  A new protocol, while it has not been signed off on, is in the process of being agreed.  It deals with some of the issues around timelines and the amount of hand-offs that are in the process.  There are a number of things that we believe need to be done to improve the process, including the establishment of a centralised dedicated agency to deal with mortgage to rent.  The eligibility criteria undoubtedly needs to be revisited.</p><p>For example, if customers had any small equity in the property they would not be eligible and if there was no local demand for social housing, they would not be eligible.  They would be ineligible if incomes were over a small threshold and the types of family unit in a property sometimes cause the property not to be eligible for social housing.  They are among the bigger issues but there is nothing that could not be overcome with the right people in the room.  The process could be made to work.</p></speech>

Allegations have been made that banks have sold loans to third parties for far less than what the debtor was originally happy to agree in an arrangement with the bank.  The logic is that the debtor - the householder or businessperson - would be in the property and the third party would receive a very cheap loan.  There have been allegations that there are not enough checks and balances within the system to prevent insider dealing between a bank and third party in such a scenario.  Are there enough checks and balances to ensure, from the Central Bank perspective, that if loans are sold for values lower than a potential arrangement with a debtor, it would be done in a manner that would safeguard shareholders' interests?</p></speech>

Up to recently we were on the New York Stock Exchange.  There are very strict requirements around connected parties.  We must disclose any transaction of anybody who is a material shareholder.  The materiality definition is someone who owns probably more than 5% of the company.  If we do a transaction and there is any indication that it might not be a commercial transaction, it must be disclosed to all the shareholders.</p> <p>  I have an example, although it is not related to what the Deputy outlined.  The Deputy might remember, for example, that our shareholders had to vote to allow us do the promissory note transaction with the State for the IBRC notes in 2013.  That was because we must have transparency among all shareholders if we are doing what could potentially be perceived as a non-commercial transaction with a connected party, or somebody who has a shareholding in the banks.  The rules are very strict and the board has a very high requirement in that regard.</p></speech>

It is quite shocking that Bank of Ireland is chasing residual debt, potentially, from a homeless person.  Is there a cut-off period?  For example, if I surrendered my home and there was residual debt of &euro;100,000, would Bank of Ireland after seven years come to an understanding that there is no logic to pursue the residual debt?  Will the individual have that hanging over him or her for a lifetime?  Representatives from Ulster Bank were here earlier and they indicated that between seven and ten years is as long as they would chase residual debt.</p></speech>

In general, we recognise that there must be an incentive for the customer to support a proposal.  We are pragmatic business people.  We are commercial and recognise that in a commercial world if we would like somebody to do something, there is incentivisation.  That incentivisation can be either that after a certain period of performance, there could be a period of further enhancement from the customer's perspective.  It is a commercial arrangement with a customer but we recognise that there must be an incentivisation for somebody to co-operate.  It could be a disincentivisation of going legal or a positive disincentivisation, putting something in it for the customer in order to co-operate.  That is the way we try to operate.</p></speech>

Why would they provide this when the law of supply and demand would mean they would only bring down the value of the property that is ultimately backing their loans?

The more liquidity is in the market, the more we have certainty about our provisioning and our comfort levels.  I do not think there is an association.</p> <p>  We do see that there is a business opportunity for us in providing money to housing finance.  Our biggest single issue is the customer's ability to provide equity.  For example, we will provide about 60% of site finance and about 70% to 75% of the working capital for the development.  Then, by definition, the customer has to produce equity.</p></speech>

What I am concerned about is people who are trying to get on the ladder.  The 80% loan-to-value, LTV, ratio and the decrease on the affordability cashflow means that the price of housing is beyond the reach of many people.  Supply is probably the biggest way of correcting that as it would create competition within the market, as Mr. Boucher acknowledged earlier when discussing his own variable methodology.  What is Bank of Ireland going to do?</p> <p>  Looking at the reports the bank has provided to the Central Bank historically, one would have to find exactly how much money it used for site finance, agriculture and so on.  The fact that this sum has significantly decreased is, in my opinion, improving and helping the share price of the bank.  I want to see more houses being built and I need the banks to provide more site finance and working capital.  I am here to explain that we need more engagement from the banks.</p></speech>

I would like to start with Mr. Boucher's thoughts on an issue that is not related to Bank of Ireland but rather concerns IBRC.  Imagine if there was a company that owed Bank of Ireland &euro;150 million and the market value of the company, which was insolvent and could not pay its debts was approximately &euro;50 million.  If the bank decided to sell the company and the &euro;50 million was realised, that would leave the bank with a write-off of &euro;100 million.  Is there any situation in which the bank would condone a payment to the shareholders of several million euro which the bank would forgo as part of the total sale price?</p></speech>

In particular, this would apply to construction or continuous process-type companies.  For companies with dead assets where we do not need the co-operation of the management, we have a different view.  In situations where the company must be kept alive to enhance or maintain its value, one might need co-operation.  These are different situations which primarily reflect the nature of the company's business.  I get criticised for that but our job is maximise recovery and in some situations we would have to do things we would prefer not to do in order to maximise value.</p> <p>  In answer to Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question earlier, in certain situations one does recognise that incentivisation or disincentivisation is an appropriate part of commercial negotiation.</p></speech>

In his time as chief executive of Bank of Ireland since 2009, has the bank ever allowed a deal where a substantial amount was written off by the bank - up to &euro;100 million or more - and where part of that deal was a multi-million euro payout to the shareholders of the insolvent company?</p></speech>

I would guess in some work-out situations we have had to incentivise either management or existing shareholders.</p><p>Sometimes existing shareholders control certain patents.  That might be an example, they have certain controls over the company that they are not going to surrender.  The alternative is to put a receiver and liquidator in or the equivalent, Chapter 11 in the US, for example.</p></speech>

I would like to move on to mortgage arrears.  As Mr. Boucher knows, I have been consistently very critical of Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s approach to mortgage arrears.  We will go into the numbers in a minute but I want to talk about the tone.  When I talk to people involved in helping borrowers, be they commercial, not-for-profit or statutory operators, or at least funded by the public purse, and Bank of Ireland comes up, the words used for the bank&rsquo;s approach to borrowers are &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo;, &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; and a word used to me this morning was &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo;.  I know there are several personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, who refuse referrals on Bank of Ireland cases because they say Bank of Ireland is impossible to deal with and they will not spend any time on it.  As chief executive and senior manager of a bank with a very long tradition in this country, which has always had very positive relationships with the private sector and the community sector, and which was rescued at a particular point, how do Mr. Boucher and Mr. Mason respond when the bank they run is consistently, and pretty much unanimously, singled out for this sort of criticism, with words such as &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo;, &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo;?</p></speech>

The statistics show when talking about mortgages that in nine out of ten cases and this is verifiable information, we can provide a solution to the customer that is a higher proportion than our competitors, despite the fact that our book is demonstrably better performing.  In nine out ten cases where we have offered a restructure, it has been accepted and they are performing.</p></speech>

They show the outcome.  A perfectly reasonable response is that borrowers are signing on the dotted line because they are scared of Bank of Ireland in a way they are not scared of the other banks because they consistently see it operating in a much more aggressive manner.  We do not know.  That is the realm of speculation.  What is not speculation is that any Deputy, or anybody working to help borrowers, will consistently single out Bank of Ireland, which has a proud tradition in this country, from the main banks &ndash; I am not talking about the sub-prime lenders who do not always act responsibly - and use words such as &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo;, &ldquo;unreasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;deplorable&rdquo;.

The fact that other banks have confused messages and approaches and some kind of a lottery system for what happens, the consistent application of our policies, processes and procedures, has us where we are and the inconsistent lack of policies, processes and procedures has our competitors where they are.</p></speech>

The expert review on repossessions states the following as Government policy:<blockquote><br /><br />The Government&rsquo;s paramount objective in the context of resolving the mortgage arrears problem is to keep borrowers in their homes wherever feasible; repossession of private residences is a last resort when all other options have failed. The statutory and regulatory frameworks have already been strengthened in order to achieve this objective.</blockquote>Two weeks ago I spent the morning in Bray Circuit Court.  One of the repossessions granted was sought by Bank of Ireland.  The lawyer representing the bank admitted in court that repayment had been made the previous month.  My understanding is that the amount was above the level of interest.  The payments of the mortgage were occurring and mortgage arrears had built up in 2014.  I know Mr. Boucher does not have the specifics of that case in front of him and he cannot comment on it yet it appears blindingly obvious that Bank of Ireland is moving to repossess houses when all other options have not been exhausted and when borrowers are making payments.  What does Mr. Boucher say to that?</p></speech>

I note the example the Deputy gives.  We have to go through a very significant route to get a repossession.  Repossession is a last resort.  In our presentation we show that of the civil bills sought by banks 6% are from Bank of Ireland, the other paragons of virtue are at 94%.  As a proportion of our book and as to where we are, we do not use the threat of court proceedings as a negotiating tactic.  The other banks the Deputy describes clearly do.  They bring people to court as a negotiating tactic.</p> <p>  I cannot talk about the anecdotes the Deputy hears.  All I can talk about is the verifiable available information, which is that Bank of Ireland accounts for 6% of the civil bills despite having 21% of the mortgage market.  I can only deal with the facts as I see them.  It disappoints me.  I do not like the image of our bank being given in the terms the Deputy describes.  It is not an appropriate image.  I have 500 colleagues who are trained to do their job for the bank but to do it in as empathetic way as possible.  We do not use pejorative words around our customers as other people do.  They are our customers and they have challenges.  We do have practices, policies and procedures.  Some people do not like them but they are consistent.</p></speech>

I understand that Mr. Boucher&rsquo;s job under law is to return value to his shareholders but the bank&rsquo;s SVR mortgage is higher than that of several of its competitors.  The verifiable word in the market is that if a borrower gets into trouble he or she will be treated in a much less reasonable and humane way by Bank of Ireland than by its competitors.  If it turns out that the word is the bank is more aggressive, and if it is more expensive, that begs the question why would anybody take out a mortgage with the bank.  With that in mind, would Mr. Boucher be open to reviewing testimony with a view to changing the tone and approach Bank of Ireland has taken consistently over the past few years when working out mortgage arrears problems, as I am told every day by people working in the field?</p></speech>

He has given a very robust defence of the bank and the statistics make for interesting reading.  I have to say I concur with the latter point made by Deputy Donnelly.</p> <p>  Mr. Boucher is ahead of the posse.  He has made reference to the other banks, in somewhat pejorative terms, and how they might manage their business.  Undoubtedly, we have learned the following from our engagement with people like MABS, personal insolvency practitioners, New Beginnings or whatever.  The overwhelming body of evidence, and this is from people whom I would deem to be reasonable and impartial observers, is that the Bank of Ireland is back to business as usual.  Given what we have been through, and given the fact that the taxpayer bailed the bank out, although I appreciate that the money has been paid back, there was a naive expectation that it would never be back to business as usual - that which preceded the crash that we have been through - and that there would be some moderation on the worst excesses of the profit motive in the bank.  I am a capitalist and support the bondholder.  In that milieu it must be possible to have a more humane approach to clients, particularly mortgage holders, who are in difficulty.</p> <p>  I suspect the following will inevitably be the case and is where the bank should be concerned.  People will not forget how they were treated.  There is a lot of people who feel they are not being treated very fairly.  In response, the CEO will resort to statistics and dismiss anecdotes.  From the wide range of people who have expressed such a view, and I would suggest if one canvassed the views of all of the Oireachtas Members, one would get significantly the same point of view that has been made by Deputy Donnelly and I, the view is that the Bank of Ireland would be perceived as the most difficult bank to engage with now.  I understand the points that have been made by the CEO and he may wish to repeat them.  It might be best if he took on board what has been said.  The bank is ahead of the posse and has repaid its dues to the State but its obligations to change practice does not end there.  I know the bank has a responsibility to its shareholders to maximise returns for them.  Somewhere in between the bank's customers must receive due consideration.  That is the end of my opening remark.</p> <p>  I will now ask a few questions.  Credit rating agencies have given the bank a particular status or standing and it operates in the Republic and in the UK.  Can the delegation give us information on its credit rating by the rating agencies?  They take into account all of the risk factors that impact on the bank's cost of funds, etc.  Do they say the Republic of Ireland is a more difficult place to do business, relative to Northern Ireland?  Do they say it is the same risk rating?  Do they say it is a different rating for the UK?  What is the Bank of Ireland's credit rating where it operates?</p></speech>

Before I get to our own, I will talk in a general attitude because that is much of the thrust of the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  Different agencies look at things differently.  Standard &amp;amp; Poor's, in its rating, places a huge emphasis on what it calls the systemic related issues.  That means a bank is very tied with the sovereign ceiling and then the systemic issue.  The organisation is very open and provides a very clear methodology.  There is a high emphasis on the system so one cannot consistently outperform the system.  I can see the sense in that because no matter how good one is, if the system is problematic and the country has issues, then one's own creditworthiness is impacted by that.</p> <p>  Moody's operates a slightly different position.  It places less emphasis on the system but a big emphasis on the macro or the performance of the economy when it looks at banks of our size.  Fitch is much more focused on the individual bank.  For each of the credit rating agencies, our own rating has improved.  We are still below investment grade for long-term debt but for short-term debt we are above investment grade.  It does vary depending on short-term or long-term deposits.  In general terms, the bank's improvement has contributed to that situation.  Probably the biggest factor that influences our credit rating today is the perception of the sovereign.</p></speech>

The regime here is quite different, with unsecured debtors given a higher proportion of consideration than they are in the UK.  In the case of a lot of PIAs in this jurisdiction, the mortgage is left aside.  Moreover, the repossession process is different in the two countries.  We have a better-performing book in the UK than in Ireland.  While we will repossess approximately 600 properties in the UK next year for a similar-sized book, I expect our figure for Ireland will be approximately 300.  It is a different process, approach and attitude in the UK.  Different markets will always have different cultural issues, different prices and different capital.  I said earlier in response to a question from Deputy Fleming that we have to put more capital against an Irish mortgage than we do against a UK mortgage because of our loss experience here and because the process of recovery is different.</p></speech>

Was that partly because of the personal relationship between bank personnel, particularly bank managers, in branches across the country and their customers?  Is there a risk now, as the bank seeks to drive down costs and increase profitability at branches, that those personal relationships will be lost?  Is there a danger, in short, of throwing the baby out with the bath water?</p></speech>

However, let us not take away from the fact that we did not come into the downturn well positioned.  The fact that our competitors were in a far worse position is not anything for us to be particularly boasting about.  We were relatively better but in a field where others were very badly positioned.</p></speech>

Was that in some part because of the personal relationships that were built between personnel and customers?  The bank maintained those personal relationships for longer than other lenders before decisions were effectively made to conduct business remotely.</p></speech>

In all that time, no member of staff, from the chief executive down, has had an individual discretion.  There always has been the requirement for a second sign-off.  I ask my colleague, Mr. McLoughlin, who runs our Irish business, to explain the structure and strategy for our branches.</p></speech>

That number remains the same today.  We see the engagement and outreach between branch and local community as being fundamentally important to our business.  We are the only institution that has not reduced its branch footprint.  In fact, we continue to invest in it quite significantly in terms of both resources and branch layout.  We have arrangements in place across the country to facilitate very significant investment in local enterprise.  We have conducted enterprise week events, for instance, where the local branch and staff work very closely with the local community.  In the past 18 months we have invested in an initiative called Enterprise Town, which is another way of supporting local businesses.  So far this year we have held Enterprise Town events in Ballincollig, Oughterard and Callan, and we intend to invest in 40 other towns across the country in 2015.  That engagement, involving branch managers and staff working with the local community, is of vital importance to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.1925" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015042900002#X01100"><p>I was aware that Bank of Ireland had not reduced the number of branches in County Clare, but I did not know this was the case nationally.  I also am aware, however, that the bank has hugely reduced the services available at all local branches in Clare.  There was a time when people going into their bank could expect to talk to a human being rather than having to interact with a machine.  Automated services reduce costs, of course, but there are major problems when the machines break down.</p> <p>  Mr. McLoughlin spoke about Bank of Ireland's commitment to local communities.  In a context where the Central Bank is trying to move us all towards a cashless society, ATMs have become more and more important.  When they break down there is a serious problem, particularly for businesses which are reliant on cash.  In my home town of Scariff, the machine breaks down every Christmas and is not fixed until the new year.  It is an issue I have raised with the bank's staff.  The problem is especially serious because Scariff is served only by Bank of Ireland, a scenario that applies also to three other Clare towns, namely, Tulla, Milltown Malbay and Kilkee.  When the machine breaks down and there is no possibility of fixing it over a holiday period, this impacts negatively on the bank's customers, including business customers who rely on people having cash to spend it in their pubs, shops, restaurants and so on.  When no money is available from the ATM, people simply move on to the next large town where the ATM facility of AIB or another of Bank of Ireland's competitors is actually working.  That leaves a very poor impression.</p> <p>  I was contacted by a solicitor in Scariff recently who, although he is not reliant on ATM services as he is not a retailer, recognises how damaging this is for the businesses on which he relies.  Furthermore, he pointed out, one cannot drop a letter into the bank's letter-box, because it is screwed shut.  If one tries to contact the branch by telephone, one is put through to a central telephone service somewhere in the country.  In other words, the branches are no longer bank branches as people would always have understood that concept.  We are heading into a bank holiday weekend and there undoubtedly will be issues.  Will Mr. McLoughlin come back to me next week with information on how many of the bank's ATMs did not work for the duration of the weekend, including the status of the facilities in Scariff, Tulla, Milltown Malbay and Kilkee?  In the case of those four towns, as I said, the Bank of Ireland ATM facility is the only one.</p></speech>

If the machines are not working, the branches will not be commercially viable.  I will follow up on the cases to which the Deputy referred.</p> <p>  Our focus is very much about enhancing our customers' experience and there is a significant investment going into ensuring that is the case.  While the branch footprint has been maintained, there has been a significant shift in the types of services offered.  Customers do a lot of their transactions now using the self-service machines.  When people go into the branch, there is always a welcome adviser to meet them.  Customers across all demographics tell us they like using the self-service machines.</p></speech>

It is disappointing when that happens and I will follow up on it for the Deputy.  In a range of our branches, certainly in the more rural locations, we have put in place lodgement ATM machines, which means the opening hours are effectively now 24-7.  Our focus is on increasing customer service and enhancing customer experience.  I am disappointed to hear about the issues the Deputy raised, and will follow up on them.</p></speech>

In particular, does he have a breakdown of inside-the-farm-gate lending in the various sectors?  Particular areas of interest at the moment are the dairy sector and the dairy processing sector.  Can he give us some information on that, and on lending being made to the agricultural sector for land purchase and overdrafts?</p></speech>

We did 50% of the new lending to the agricultural sector last year.  That excludes the very large co-ops and so on, so it would primarily be farming, but could also be small food manufacturers - craft food and so on.  I do not have the figures off the top of my head, but we will come back to the Deputy on that.</p></speech>

I am sure many of the issues regarding variable rates and so on have been discussed.  Mr. Boucher will be aware that the events around Siteserv have dominated media debate over the last week or two.  That has opened up a debate around big write-downs on commercial loans.  The figure the Minister is looking at now is loans over &euro;10 million where there were significant write-downs and so on.  What has Bank of Ireland's attitude, policy and practice been with regard to big loans and write-downs of the magnitude that we are seeing in the Siteserv case, where somebody owes &euro;150 million and &euro;110 million is written down?</p></speech>

We seek to maximise recoveries.  There are certain situations where there is limited liability.  In a personal situation if someone goes bankrupt, whether court-enforced or through a liquidation process, there is no money and nothing to collect, so the entity itself is gone.  In other instances, we will convert a portion of our debt to equity.  Indeed, when we were recapitalising the bank, some of the bondholders converted some of their bonds to equity in the bank.</p></speech>

Deputy Donnelly asked me a slightly different question.  I speak in general terms because I cannot talk about an individual situation with which Bank of Ireland had nothing to do.  I have seen instances where management or shareholders have to be incentivised in very tricky situations.  This is particularly the case in continuous process companies, where ultimately one needs co-operation to keep a company alive because if the management walked out or the shareholders stopped being involved for some reason, the company would collapse and one would be in the middle of a continuous process.  That can happen in construction companies, in companies with continuous processes or where companies have certain types of contracts.  That is a general comment, but I have to be careful, as do committee members, of identifying a particular company of which I have no knowledge.  If the Deputy is asking about my corporate experience, I have seen situations where management teams or other persons have to be incentivised because that is the way to maximise one's recovery.</p></speech>

I do not have the figures but it will be available on the independent Newspapers website as to the debt for equity conversion, which I think was done in 2012.  It is publicly disclosed information because it was a public company, in terms of the quantum of bank debt that was converted for equity.  I do not think it was broken down on an individual bank basis, and we do not disclose those figures, but as a matter of public record and as disclosed by the company, it has been converted.</p></speech>

It is unfortunate that the same four lines were put at the very end of it, as were in the reply given to the parliamentary question tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in last Tuesday.  I fail to understand how Ireland cannot take a position until there is international consensus on the matter.  The Pope represents 1 billion people.  The European Union has a few countries involved and the European Parliament has managed to pass something and yet we are waiting like sheep to follow everybody else.  I wonder if we could get whoever it is in our esteemed Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to allow us to take a position on the issue and not allow us to be sheep.</p></speech>

The UN General Assembly does not recognise it but I think a UN special rapporteur's report in 1985 agreed that what happened to the Armenians in 1915 met the criteria of genocide.  It is almost as if our position is that we are not taking a position, which is sad.  If we are to wait on international consensus on issues, we will wait a long time.  We pride ourselves on having a different view.  It is understandable that some countries would not adopt a position, in particular NATO countries.  The US, for instance, has not adopted a position but 43 of the 53 states have adopted positions in relation to it.  I do not know if the Chairman wants to get into the details of the note as it is probably private.  Is it on the public record?</p></speech>

We are dealing with the minutes of the previous meeting, so we do not wish to have a comprehensive discussion on it.  However, I will allow members to comment.  The most important point is that we have got a much more comprehensive reply on this occasion.  Reconciliation between both countries is the best way forward.  Does Deputy Crowe wish to add anything else?</p></speech>

We must talk in terms of the Ottoman Empire, when this happened.  I would like to think that the committee could be proactive in terms of inviting some experts in the area in.  I accept it would put extra work on the committee but it would be appreciated.  Turkish citizens have spoken publicly on the matter.  The difficulty the two countries have at the moment would be improved considerably by a recognition of what happened.  Initially, when the Turkish state was set up, it was planned to have a recognition and then the position changed to it being the case that anyone who said genocide had taken place would end up before the courts.  The situation is bizarre.  In other countries one can be brought to court for not recognising genocide.  I suggest that we look at the matter again and put time aside to examine the matter in the future, with the possibility of inviting in speakers.</p></speech>

In 1915, a total of 1.5 million Armenians were specifically targeted and eliminated.  People are now prosecuted within Turkey for arguing that it is a genocide.  A German officer was in Turkey during the period of the genocide.  Subsequently, in the 1930s he wrote to Hitler to say that if Hitler was not careful, they would find themselves in the same situation of genocide.  It seems to me that it is a very cowardly position for Ireland to take, to sit on the fence and not to make the clear decision that this is genocide.</p></speech>

I was surprised that the members of the Opposition were pushing so hard for a vote.  I was disappointed that they pushed the matter to a vote, in so far as it deferred another vote on the issue for six months.  The reason I raise the issue in conjunction with what we just heard is that it is an historical fact that has to be decided by historians and we must be cognisant of that.  What was amazing, retrospectively, because I did not know it at the time I spoke, was that the President of Ireland was on his way to Ankara that very day.  I do not understand why the Opposition would wish to embarrass the President on this very important commemoration of the victims of the slaughter in the First World War in Gallipoli.  It is beyond belief.  The very same day, or the very same week, the Turkish ambassador to Austria was withdrawn and the net result of Opposition members playing politics with the issue would have been a disgraceful position to force-----</p></speech>

We are not going to have a discussion on this.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe has some constructive ideas on the way we should move forward.  Members should go along with that in a constructive way to see what the committee can do to work towards reconciliation and normalisation of relations between Armenia and Turkey.  Maybe we can do something small on this as a committee.  I thank Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe for bringing that up this morning.  Are the minutes agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Before we commence the meeting, I want to welcome our new adviser from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Ms Laoise Moore.  She is taking over from Ms Olive Hempenstall on a temporary basis.  She comes to us from a posting in Malaysia.  We are delighted to have her here as a link between the Department and the committee.  Both the secretariat and I insisted we have an adviser as quickly as possible.  We look forward to working closely with her.</p> <p>  I want to give members an opportunity to talk on the tragic events in Nepal over the weekend when an earthquake devastated Kathmandu and other areas there.  We have seen reports that over 5,000 people have died with over 10,000 injured.  This morning I telephoned a friend of mine who is the chief executive officer of the Nepal Institute for Strategic Studies in Kathmandu to get an update on the situation there.  He said there is terrible chaos there.  Most people are without water and electricity and are sleeping on the streets because of the fear that many of the remaining buildings are unsafe.  Along with the huge loss of life, much of the Nepalese culture has also been destroyed, such as their temples.  While many supplies are coming in, the airport is still congested as people rush to leave the country.  Our thoughts are with those people affected, particularly those in the higher regions which many of the emergency services have still not reached.  We do not know the extent of the damage in those areas or how many deaths or injuries have occurred there.  My thoughts are with them.  I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister of State, for the allocation of &euro;1 million towards the relief fund for Nepal.  Hopefully, it can be increased as we get more information from Nepal.</p></speech>

If further assistance can be given, it would be very welcome.  I heard an appeal by GOAL this morning from one of its personnel out there.  Again, we should commend and support the work of our non-governmental organisations.  I am sure they are working with their sister organisations.  I hope the Department will be able to give them some assistance towards their work on the ground.</p> <p>  This morning on my local radio station, I heard a person from County Monaghan who is in Nepal and has thankfully made contact with his family through an e-mail earlier this morning.  He is safe.</p></speech>

I hope the ten Irish people who have not been accounted for are not actually missing but are alive and well.  I know this area attracts very experienced travellers from Ireland.  They are well used to travelling to obscure and remote regions.  Telecommunications are obviously down and mobile telephones are useless at this stage, even the ability to power them has gone.  We have to live in hope that these adventurer tourists from Ireland are not injured in any way.  I thank the Government for its contribution and fast response to disasters like this.  As the tragedy unfolds, I hope we will be there to assist the people of Nepal in the rebuilding of their infrastructure for housing, electricity and water.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact extra funding has been agreed for the area.  What is facing the people in Nepal is our main concern.  Like in all disasters, there is the initial interest to help but then much of the support is gradually withdrawn.  The likes of China and India responded immediately by sending helicopters and other aid to the area.  We have seen the relief efforts in Kathmandu and other major cities.</p> <p>  The devastation will have a serious impact on rural areas, as well as roads and other infrastructure.  There are also serious after-shocks.  The committee should write to the Nepalese embassy in London on behalf of the committee and the Irish people as a whole to express our deepest sadness the loss of life.</p></speech>

We should communicate our support for them in any way we can.  It is to be welcomed that the Government responded quickly by pledging &euro;1 million and I hope additional resources will be found.  It is particularly worrying that so many remote areas of the region have not yet been reached and the situation could prove to be much worse than we imagine.  We can hope that the power of communications and social media will alert all countries to the plight of these unfortunate people and that the response from other countries and Governments will also be generous.  I have no doubt the Irish people will respond to the various NGOs which are fundraising for the victims at this particular time and that the response will be as generous as it always has been.</p></speech>

We seem to be going from one disaster to another - the tsunami, the disaster in the Philippines and now what is happening in Nepal.  These disasters push the other humanitarian crises further down the agenda.  If we think about what is happening in Gaza, there is no rebuilding going on.  Equating it with our country and imagining whole areas being wiped out brings home the horror of what has happened.  I hope the committee writes to the Nepalese ambassador but I ask that in the letter, special consideration would be given to people with disabilities who get caught up in disasters such as the earthquake.  Sometimes they do not have sight, speech or hearing and however bad it is for able bodied people, it is worse for children and people with a disability.  I ask that this point be made.</p></speech>

I heard his cousin on a wireless yesterday and, to be quite honest with the committee, I thought he was gone.  I welcome the fact the Government is providing &euro;1 million but I hope  the figure will be kept under review.  In terms of the scale of the tragedy, it is pretty small beer.  I, therefore, hope it will be kept continually under revision so that, as more funds are needed, they will be provided.</p></speech>

We will offer our deepest sympathy and outline to the ambassador what the Government has done in respect of this terrible tragedy.  We will also keep ourselves updated on the situation.  The media will move on after a few more weeks to some other crisis.  As in Haiti and the Philippines, people will have to rebuild.  The Nepalese Government is probably getting good help at the moment.  I am told it is getting good help from their neighbouring countries, including China.  We wish the NGOs, in particular Irish NGOs, working there well and hope that the casualty list will not increase as time goes on.</p></speech>

We are delighted welcome Mr. Hugh Kelly, president of the Irish Exporters Association, and Mr. John Nevin, chairman of the Asia trade forum of the Irish Exporters Association, to discuss trade links with the ASEAN countries.  The purpose of this meeting is to provide a greater understanding of trading between the ASEAN countries and Ireland and the possibility of further inroads in developing trade to a market of more than 600 million people.  There are 500 million people in the European Union and yet there is huge potential in the ASEAN countries.  We will have an opening statement from Mr. Kelly and we will then take questions from members.</p> <p>  I remind members and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even when on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I call Mr. Kelly to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2035" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015042900002#C00700"><p>To set the scene, I will explain the basis on which we are making our submission.  I note many members will know about the Irish Exporters Association but it is the independent representative body for all exporters and we offer a range of practical help and support to Irish exporters under three main pillars.  We act as the voice of the Irish export industry, we are a source of practical knowledge and we are a connecting force for Irish exporters.  What sets us apart from some of the other agencies which act in this space is that we represent the whole spectrum of companies within the export industry, including SMEs, which are beginning to think about exporting for the first time, right through to global multinational companies, which are already exporting extensively from Ireland.</p> <p>  The Asia trade forum was an initiative we established within the IEA in 2011.  Its strategy supported a clear vision to help promote and increase two way trade between Ireland and Asia.  It was funded by partners from the private sector such, as Ulster Bank, Etihad and FCm Travel Solutions.  The forum was, and continues to be, a successful example of collaboration between the private sector, led by ourselves at the IEA, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and State agencies, in particular, Enterprise Ireland.  </p> <p>  We all want to see Ireland emerge as one of Asia&rsquo;s preferred trading partners.  In 2011, only 4% of Irish exports went to Asia compared to exports of between 20% and 25% which went to our EU neighbours.  We suggested a target of 8% by 2016.  We set out a plan and learned from it.  There were three elements to our strategy.  The first one was to help Irish businesses to get to know Asia better and for Asia to get to know Ireland better.  The second was to connect experienced practitioners to inspire and assist others to realise their potential in the markets and to build efficiently on their success without repeating too many failures.  The third was to highlight to Government the obstacles to Irish trade growth and to work closely with policy makers and State agencies to remove them.   </p> <p>  What have we learned and what have been our successes?  More than 1,000 companies have attended and participated at Asia trade forum events over the past four years.  We have organised business visits to China, Malaysia and India and we have worked with the Asia-Pacific Irish business forum to increase collaboration.  We have also worked with local chambers in Asia to unlock what we believe are powerful networks for Irish businesses.  We have also supported and worked closely with UCD, UL and UCC on student programmes to increase knowledge of Asian languages, culture and business.  With some success, we have helped lobby for improved visa access for Asian visitors.</p> <p>  Most important, and something from which we have learned, is that these initiatives have introduced practitioners to practitioners and provided a soft introduction so that off stage they can then talk one on one and share real stories about what they have done in Asia.</p><p>They can talk about the mistakes they have made.  We all learn far more from failure than we do from success, or apparent easy success.  That is a key element and an important point to consider in any initiative in which we are trying to learn from each other.  We are delighted that by the end of 2014 Ireland's total exports to Asia passed the 8% target.  We hope and believe we have played a part in that.  There is room for much greater growth in our trade with Asia.  New Zealand is a example of that and we want to champion and work with Government to achieve more ambitious goals and to develop and extend that Asia trade forum template.</p><p> We have a unique opportunity to reflect on the successes, feedback and learnings that we have gleaned from the past four years and to target more effectively opportunities in the emerging ASEAN bloc.  While much of focus on trade with Asia to date has been on China, most Irish exporters are SMEs.  Certain markets in the ASEAN bloc are arguably more accessible to SMEs than the larger single Asian markets.  I have done business in Asia for more than 20 years, in India, China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand and what those experiences have highlighted to me is that English speaking ASEAN countries, which have laws with which we would be more familiar, provide the logical starting point for many Irish SMEs venturing into Asia for the first time.  The progression of the ASEAN economic community integration will now also provide a pathway for growth.  In our written submission we state the Government, in difficult circumstances, is providing good leadership in assisting Ireland Inc. to increase its share of the Asian trade opportunity.  The opening up of the new embassies in the ASEAN bloc, the increase in reallocation of State agency resources to the region and the increased number of high level State visits are all good for business.  We also believe that the trade support being offered by our ambassadors overseas is already delivering dividends.  We need to raise our ASEAN trade figures further and we are grateful for this opportunity to propose and discuss our learnings, experience, suggestions and recommendations with the committee.</p><p> With the permission of the Chair, I would like to ask my colleague Mr. John Nevin, who is the current chairman of the Asia trade forum to brief members on the proposals.  We will then be pleased to take any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2037" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Nevin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015042900002#D00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to speak to them.  As Mr. Kelly has outlined, I took over as chairman of the Asia trade forum in July last year, having done eight years of work in Asia when I was in industry.  I have identified two key elements.  The Government is doing a great deal of good work on the ground but at the same time there are significant opportunities to improve, given the current level of resources, if we manage and plan better.  Having said that, when one looks at the prize which trade with Asia or with the ASEAN region could generate, the resources are not nearly what they might be.  Bord Bia has one office in the region.  Tourism Ireland has two offices, one in Australia, if one includes it in the region.  My colleague and I have come from a round-table discussion with the Japanese ambassador at which the IDA presented.  The IDA has two people in Japan, which is still our largest export market and where we have a strong presence.  We all understand the difficult times of the past five years from which where we have come but we must look at how we allocate resources versus what can be achieved on the ground.  As I said at the launch of our recent Asia trade forum programme for 2015, if one builds it they will come.</p> <p>  We come before the committee today to ask for further leadership from Government in bringing us to where we need to be in the next 40 years.  I was around when we passed a referendum to join the then European Economic Community in 1972 and look at what we have achieved in the past 40 years or more since then.  We are looking to the future and what we need to do is put ourselves out 40 years from now and ask ourselves where we need to be in Asia in 40 years time because it is the next opportunity.  If we are not in the same space in Asia in 40 years as we are within our traditional markets, we will not be the success we are at present.</p> <p>  The recommendation we make in our submission are reasonably clear.  We are looking for leadership, commitment, a strategy and a cohesive plan between Government, the State agencies and business.  As an SME representative, we know we have many large successful companies that have gone from Ireland to Asia and succeeded with the help of the State agencies.  They are large enough to go in on the ground, assess and decide if there is a market and they have the resources to do so.  As SMEs, the hardest part of what we do is trying to find a partner on the ground that will bring us to market.  Enterprise Ireland is great at getting us introductions to the telcos, the utilities and the major players, but for businesses to be successful on the ground they need to find a small partner that is already succeeding.  We believe the best way to do that is to follow the British model, which is to use chambers and to bolster the Irish chambers on the ground.  We need a format and a structure so that we utilise the diaspora.  We all know of the Irish diaspora but we are not accessing or using Irish people as well as we could be.  It has been offered to us on regular occasions.</p> <p>  We have set out in our recommendation what we think needs to happen for Ireland Inc. to succeed.  We must appoint a Minister of State for Asia.  We have a great chance to use ASEAN as a case study in how to do business better in the Asian region.  There is no reason that Ireland Inc. cannot put a strategy together for those countries, look at the resources, the target markets, the sectors we wish to target and the resources that will be needed to back it.  We need to bring in businesses so that they are linked into it and we would know what we would do in target markets in different countries and drive it home.  The Government's Food Harvest 2020 is one of the better strategies I have seen that has been delivered on and is ahead of target.  When Government and business sit down together and look at what is possible, we can achieve more together.</p> <p>  We are in the enviable position of having access to Government and have great relationships with Government and yet - it is an Irish characteristic - we are not utilising those relationships as well as we could be.  We could bring more structure to those relationships and use that access to Government to drive initiatives and to bring business forward for the whole of Ireland.  </p> <p>  Let me revert to what happened this morning at the meeting with the Japanese am ambassador.  Brand Ireland is not nearly as visible in Asia as we need it to be.  There is a job of work to be done in penetrating that market.  Let us look at the role of Tourism Ireland.  I alluded to the figures that of the 12 million visitors from China last year, we got 20,000 to 25,000 visitors.  Tourism Ireland, if we are honest, does not have Asia on the map.  There is good reason for that in light of its current resources.  The low-hanging fruit is in the core markets in which we are strong in getting growth, but now we need to be sowing the seeds for growth from the tourism in that region.  More importantly if we are to increase awareness of Brand Ireland in the region, we need to have tourism as a core building stone.</p> <p>  There is a significant opportunity for growth in education.  We all know we have many Asian students in our universities but the feedback we are getting on the way we are selling our education offering to Asia is that it is not structured or cohesive and the universities are competing against each other rather than offering their own specialty services.  They are tripping up over each other - I am sorry to use that terminology - but the visits to Asia are not as co-ordinated as they should be to get the best offer.  We have had overseas delegations to the offices of the Asia trade forum, who have come through London and the United Kingdom and they are advising us that we are not hitting the targets that we should be hitting when compared to how successful they are in the United Kingdom.  We have a preponderance to look back on year-on-year growth and see the improvement rather than to look at the size of the market and what our share of it should be.  The education sector needs to work on that.</p> <p>  Chairman, if I may as this point is a little off the track but we found out yesterday that the funding for UCC's east Asian diploma programme has been pulled.  University College Cork had the only programme available in Ireland that was training Irish students in Asian culture and business in order to do business in Asia.  We in the Asia trade forum had linked in with UCC and had placements with Irish companies for the 25 students on the programme over the next three months.  Irish companies are contacting UCC asking the college to provide more students with these skills in the following years.</p><p>If we are to build on our capability to do business in Asia, we will need to have Irish students coming through similar programmes with the competence to go to Asia and promote our companies well.  I would urge the committee to have a look at the UCC situation to see if it can be reversed at this early stage.  It is only the first year of the programme and it has been successful.  The Korean Government has provided funding for it, in terms of lecturers and so on, and the Japanese are very much involved in terms of the provision of Korean, Mandarin and Japanese language and cultural studies and business awareness studies.  It is a key programme.</p><p> To return to the core argument, we need a strategy and greater leadership.  Government has done a good job but we need a strategic plan for Ireland Inc. for Asia and ASEAN, which comprises ten countries.  We need to what we are doing in each of those ten countries over the next five years worked through to a business level.  Government introduces us to the markets.  It opens the doors for us to be able to trade in those places.  The State agencies then link us up with the major businesses.  For Irish businesses to be able to do business in Asia we need to work with the Chambers and give them a chance to learn the mistakes that have already been made in trying to do business in Asia.  In other words, we need to link in with the people who have already made the mistakes and use those volunteers to help us bring business forward.</p></speech>

Before I hand over to members, I would like to raise two issues.  Both witnesses mentioned the scarcity of personnel on the ground, particularly from our development agencies and, possibly, from our embassies.  Reference was made to a meeting the delegation had earlier with the Japanese ambassador.  Japan and Korea, in terms of the Japan Export Trade and Research Association, JETRA, and KOTRA, the Korean trade investment promotion agency, have many people on the ground.  The British also have a huge number of people in their embassies dealing with trade.  Is our lack of personnel on the ground a hindrance to our developing trade?</p> <p>  The fact that we do not have a direct air link into Asia was not mentioned.  I understand that efforts in this regard have been under way for some time.  We currently have an air link into China through Ethiad and to the Middle East through Emirates.  Is the lack of a direct air link into Asia hindering our development of trade, be that in respect of cargo or passengers services, with Asia or the ASEAN countries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2040" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015042900002#E00300"><p>On the air link, we have seen a transformation in the number of companies travelling to the Middle East because of Ethiad and Emirates establishing direct links.  It has been remarkable.  When I engage with and encourage companies to look to more distant markets very often in their view the nearest distant market is the Middle East because it is so accessible.  I do not know how practical it is, but there is no doubt that a direct air link with Asia would help.  Already, the Ethiad and Emirates connection through the Middle East has helped greatly.  It is a 14 hour journey from London to Singapore, which is probably the maximum amount of time anybody would want to fly anyway.  Personally, I do not think one stop in the Middle East is too onerous.  However, a direct air link would help.  It would show a greater commitment to this area.  It would certainly make Ireland more accessible coming the other way, which is very important.  In view of the situation as it existed some years ago, we had to send people to see our competitors before they could come to see us.  It was a crazy situation.  We need to make it easy to invite potential partners in these markets to come meet us and understand what is different about us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2041" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015042900002#E00400"><p>Perhaps Mr. Kelly would elaborate on the scarcity of personnel on the ground issue in the context of Japan and Korea having a huge abundance of agencies in Asia.</p></speech>

It is not practical for us to compete at that level.  This is the reason we are recommending the continued and vigorous exploration of more collaborative partnerships.  Unlike when one goes to America and one is just another Irish person, when one goes to Asia and reaches out to other Irish people the amount of support one gets its phenomenal.  My office was arranging a visit for somebody to Korea, which I know is not ASEAN but the learning is the same.  We were really struggling.  The GAA produced a book of Irish people in Asia who are happy to support Irish companies.  My CEO wrote to 16 of them randomly and then went home to his wife thinking he probably looked like a very lonely person.  By the next day 12 of them had replied.  Two more replied two days later, apologising for having taken two days to get back to him.  The good will among Irish people in Asia is incredible.  We need to reach out to them.  They are waiting for us.  In due course, when we are very successful in Asia, they will get fed up with us, as in the case of Britain and America where people believe we should be able to find our own way.  Irish people in Asia are crying out for us to link it all together.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2044" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/970" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015042900002#E00700"><p>I welcome the contributions by Mr. Kelly and Mr. Nevin.  Mention is made in the briefing provided that product exports to the ASEAN countries has decreased by 4% since 2011 while service exports have risen by 22%.  Perhaps we could get a breakdown in regard to the product and service exports, including financial, ICT and insurance services.  It was also stated that there is an opportunity to follow the British example and bolster the Irish chambers abroad.  In this regard, are the witnesses speaking of direct financial assistance from Government to enable Chambers to have more personnel working directly at the coal-face?  Also, has consideration been given to the promotion of Ireland on an all-island basis, rather than Ireland seeking extra market opportunities for this State while the Northern Ireland agencies do likewise?  Surely, we are so distant from those countries there is merit in an all-Ireland promotion from the point of view of specific target areas.  Has that been considered?</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 9 is that there be better top level cross-agency interaction to leverage off our collective strengths.  That could be said by anybody about anything.  If the delegates were in a position to lay out what promotional and State agencies we should have supporting our businesses in Asia and elsewhere, what proposals, in terms of structure and architecture, would they put in this regard to Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade?  We could all call, and have done so, for better leverage, co-operation and collaboration between all the different agencies.  The word "silo" was mentioned.  We are very conscious of that.  Every Department and statutory agency wants to work in a silo.  They are all empire builders in their own way.  They are very protective about their own boundaries.  That has been the way since long before the foundation of the State and it will be the way in generations to come as well.  If the delegates were to get what they believe would be the preferred structure of our existing State agencies, what would it look like?   </p> <p>  From my limited experience of trade missions and so on, companies and industries do a huge amount of work themselves.  Governments and embassies can only open doors, which is also the message from the delegates today.  During some of the trade missions I was on I met individuals of small, medium and large companies who to their credit had been doing huge work in uncharted fields long before the State.  Is there merit in the provision of direct subvention to companies to support their own marketing efforts while trying to source new markets in the emerging markets from our point of view?  In regard to the ASEAN countries, I note the current population is 609 million and is projected to reach 680 million within the next five years.  As such, it is an area of huge economic growth in most of the countries and an area of huge population growth as well.</p> <p>  An issue of concern to many of the civil society organisations is the need to be conscious at all times of human rights and industrial relations.</p><p>Taking the ASEAN countries, including Myanmar-Burma, there are major concerns about human rights and industrial relations.  In the development of trade, we must be conscious that we are not dumbing down workers' rights and human rights.</p></speech>

We cannot do the job of the witnesses but they can tell us what we can do to make their jobs better and easier.  The witnesses can decode No. 9 as a very polite way of saying: "Let us not offend them".  However, if the witnesses do not tell us the truth, we cannot fix it.  There are silos and complications and we are not getting the best return.</p> <p>  Would the following suggestions help in the area of education?  I was very concerned to hear the comments by Mr. Nevin on the closing down of the UCC Asia programme, with which I was not familiar but which is essential.  Enterprise Ireland was given responsibility for promoting Irish education abroad by the then Minister, Batt O'Keeffe.  It was a good decision at the time and I supported it in opposition and in government.  How do we say that at one level and say to the seven universities and the institutes of technology, particularly the bigger ones, that they must co-ordinate activities and co-operate rather than compete?  How do we say to UCC that it should concentrate on south-east China?  The market is so big.  How do the witnesses suggest we, as politicians, the Minister for Education and Skills and Enterprise Ireland reach an agreement with third level institutions that this vast market of over a couple of billion people be carved up in a systematic way?  In this way, Trinity College, Dublin and UCC would have a certain area.  Is that what the witnesses are asking us to do?  How could it be done within reason?  How do we maximise efficiency and respect the right of people to make individual choices if they see an opportunity?</p> <p>  The Departments of Justice and Equality and Education and Skills, particularly the former, have set the criteria for bogus English language colleges in Ireland.  These were backdoor access to a rich European market and nothing else.  The message has got through.  That side of it has been cleared up.  There is a vast demand in the emerging middle class of ASEAN countries for quality European English language education for their teenage children or young adult children at third level.  What barriers exist in access to visas and speed of visa applications?  What can we do, given that we have an enormously positive product in Irish education to export?  There is a hunger and a demand for it.  What barriers exist?  If the witnesses can bring them to our notice, we can remove or streamline them to remove the irritation. </p></speech>

From my visits there, I know they are keen to do business with Ireland.  The witnesses referred to the goodwill in the south-east Asia area, which is similar in Africa.  One of the reasons is their respect for Ireland and their expectation that, when we do business, it will be in an ethical way rather than an exploitative way.  There are grave issues of tax justice.  A recent report showed that illicit tax flows from Africa amounts to between $50 billion and $60 billion annually.  What is the commitment, on the part of Irish businesses doing business in south-east Asia, to doing business in a fully transparent way, to a register of owners and to country-by-country reporting?</p> <p>  Deputy Brendan Smith referred to human rights issues and some of the countries the witnesses hope to do business in carry out severe abuses of human rights.  This morning, Indonesia used the death penalty against ten people caught trafficking drugs.  I am not condoning drug trafficking but using the death penalty in that instance was barbaric.</p> <p>  We know the issues in Myanmar with certain ethnic groups and Laos is the poorest country in the region.  It is open to exploitation by people.  The witnesses are driven by profit and I am not saying anything against that.  However, for Ireland to have a respectful and respectable position, we must be conscious of it.</p> <p>  I was at a meeting with a group from Colombia yesterday.  Other free trade agreements have been disastrous because big businesses have come in, resulting in serious land displacement and land grab.  Land that was used for food to feed the population was taken over for the profit of multinationals.  Colombia was a major exporter of coffee but is now importing coffee.  I am not saying that the witnesses should shout from the rooftops about human rights but, in our own way and in an Irish way, we can make these points forcibly and contribute to a better standard of living in those countries.</p> <p>  Another aspect is gender equality.  Women are the poorest paid, most vulnerable and most easily exploited.  I am interested in the response of the witnesses to these points about tax and human rights. </p></speech>

The former Minister for Education and Skills highlighted the issue of education.  I am not familiar with the 25 students in UCC and the closing down of the course in its first year.  I was involved in the twinning arrangements between Dublin and Beijing.  In terms of the universities and institutes of technology, there was definitely a very divided approach to recruitment.  The universities did their own thing and there was no co-ordination with Tallaght IT and DIT, which had stands at the same function.  With regard to No. 6, the review of Irish education institutions' market approach in these regions, perhaps the witnesses can explain the loss of the course in UCC.  We know what the Confucius society has just obtained in UCD.  What is the role of the Confucius society in Asian education?  DIT has Chinese staff members doing Chinese studies and I presume the same is true of Trinity College, Dublin.  I refer to the loss of the school in UCC<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the range of courses provided through UCD, Trinity College, Dublin and DIT.  What failed in UCC?  </p><p>The easiest way to target and create wealth in this country is in recommendation No. 4, with the emphasis on tourism, food and education.  We spoke about education.  Food is the jewel in the crown.  With Asian food, there may be some competition to produce.  In a market of 800 million people, there must be potential for food but Bord Bia only has two members in the field.  I am disappointed to hear that Tourism Ireland is not milking its position in Asian countries because more and more Chinese visitors are coming here.  I have entertained a number of them.  We have a successful and sophisticated tourism industry and we are doing some work with DIT in Laos.  It is trying to build infrastructure in tourism and it is being assisted by DIT in developing a college.  I met some students.</p><p>We can build on such relationships and give assistance.  In Laos, for example, we can assist it in catering for its the growing hospitality industry.</p><p> I wish to make a final point about education.  I met a huge group of Omani students.  I know this matter is not connected to the delegation but I want to use it as an example.  The Omani Government has decided to send lots of Omani children to Ireland to learn the English language initially in order to access courses, although not PhD courses.  They are being educated so they can be trained as electricians and motor mechanics to replace the foreigners who provide these services in Oman.  These students are being upskilled when they come here.</p><p> The delegation has made excellent recommendations.  I also wish to compliment the diaspora in Korea and its embassy.  When I visited the embassy it had a wonderful female ambassador.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember her name but she was very facilitative.  I found there was a great relationship between the Koreans and us and it was not just because they like to drink a lot of good quality beer.  There is a commonality between the Irish and the Koreans that we should exploit.  Those are my questions or approbations.</p></speech>

The Confucius Institute in Ireland is Chinese-funded, so its focus is exclusively China.  The UCC school programme may still go ahead but funding has been pulled from the Higher Education Authority.  The news is so fresh and I am not sure what the exact implications are for same.  That programme is the only one which teaches Asian languages.  Mr. Nevin referred to the Korean embassies which funded a lecturer to teach the Korean language.  The course contains language modules and cultural training which is so important.<br/><br/>In terms of tourism, there is a connection between education and tourism.  Last year a programme was mooted in UCC.  It was not approved for various reasons but it should be explored.  It was an idea to run a third level programme to train the Irish hospitality industry how to welcome Asian visitors.  The Lonely Planet guides advise anybody from Asia planning to come here to bring their own noodles because the food here is unpalatable.  I know from travelling overseas that there would be reluctance to visit certain markets because one has to think  ahead about food, comfort and everything else.  We need to make Ireland welcoming to Asian visitors.  <br/><br/>We were asked how to divide education and how to be more effective.  Uversity is a model that promotes Ireland as a place for education in the arts.  All of the participating colleges have worked together and have decided among themselves which college is better at teaching certain subjects rather than using geographical location.  The Royal College of Surgeons has had huge success in Malaysia and when its sends a delegation to Asia, its value proposition is very clear - it is medicine.  When Trinity College, Dublin, UCD and UCC travel to the same region, their value proposition is not so clear.  Prospective students have the following questions.  What is the speciality of each college?  What sets them apart?  To start with, how does one pick between UCC and UCD to start with, let alone between Ireland and England?  Making it easier for students to reach a decision is down to good business.  We must convince everyone involved that dividing the sector and working together to offer a total value proposition is more powerful than competing individually.  <br/><br/>In terms of food, we are doing an awful lot right.  Bord Bia is doing an excellent job but we need to have the confidence to do more and to commit more deeply.  We will succeed - the evidence is there.<br/><br/>In regard to the all-Ireland question and whether we promote the whole island, I see no reason for not doing so.  It is worth noting that the industries in Northern Ireland are incredibly different from ones in the Republic.  The North has a lot of heavy industry and mining and the offerings complement each other.  I know from my experience that when one gets to Asia, and perhaps a little bit out of sight of Ireland, one can see they work closely together and its great.  Former employees of Enterprise Ireland who now work with Invest Northern Ireland are still available and willing to help Irish companies and <i>vice versa</i>.  There is great co-operation in the markets.  Based on witnessing what these organisations have been able to do, I would advocate an all-island context as it has more positives than negatives.  <br/><br/>The UK has put in place a chamber of commerce model in order to stretch its resources and that is why we think it is clever.  With a bit of funding, the chambers of commerce here could look after certain markets which would allow Enterprise Ireland to concentrate its resources on other markets.  The problem is Enterprise Ireland is spread too thinly.  When we say to the Asian nations that we want to increase trade with them, they ask about our commitment.  They ask how many people we have concentrating on this market to try to improve trade but the numbers are not credible and there is a mismatch.  We need to give them evidence that we are serious.  I suggest we organise public private partnerships or semi-public private partnerships by bolstering the local chambers of commerce, which are largely funded by subscriptions paid by local businesses.  If we just top that up, then we will stretch our resources further.  We cannot print money and we appreciate resources are limited.  That is why we are pushing so hard for a more co-operative approach.  That goes to the heart of the query about recommendation No. 9.  We want more public private partnership, consultation and working together.  There are a lot of private companies willing to contribute their time and resources to the cause but they need to be let in and trusted.  The Asia trade forum has led to an increase in trust over the past number of years and we have what we consider to be a good relationship with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  The relationship is far better now than when we started so the forum has been a success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2054" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Nevin" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015042900002#G00400"><p>I will respond to a couple of the other queries.  In terms of direct intervention with companies seeking to do business and Deputy O'Sullivan's comments, we strongly advocate that a good business must be doing good business in the region.  Therefore, businesses have a responsibility to stand up and perform correctly before receiving hand-outs or supports.  We would be better trying to support the market entry service companies that exist and to enable their facilities to be available to the companies going out to do business in the region at a better rate.  Also, companies seeking to get access to those skills should be validated as making the commitment that is required to get to market.  Too often companies say they are going to be in Asia.  They visit the region and think they will do business there but they really have not made a commitment to do so.  We must validate the commitment of a business before giving it supports to go on a journey that it may not pursue.</p> <p>  Deputy Smith raised another issue.  To reiterate a point made by Mr. Kelly, we have a working relationship with Invest Northern Ireland.  When we host and run events, we invite it to present at our events, education seminars, etc.  </p> <p>  In terms of a silo approach, we do not oppose such an approach.  We think the silo and focused approach of the agencies has been very successful in its own right.  The work that IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland do on their own is very good.  In fairness to them and the other agencies, we can see from the outside looking in that there is a continuous onus on them to evolve and develop themselves.  In terms of the major corporations, the buzzwords are cross-matrix structures within the business.  Therefore, one still needs to bring the agencies together at a top level in order to utilise the knowledge available within the different agencies to penetrate the tourism market, for instance.  We have a lot of businessmen who have top level relationship in many of the Asian countries.  If we brought that back to the tourism industry, we might be able to help it see why it should focus more on the region and fast-track its ability to take business from where it is currently to where it needs to go.</p> <p>  Mr. Kelly has already talked about the food industry, which is good.  However, the tourism industry is very much behind the food industry at the moment.</p><p>I sat with the ambassadors and tourism people in Dublin Castle in January, and they pretty much said that Asia is not on the radar, that we have markets closer to home that are more important to us and that we do not have the resources to focus on Asia.  We are not here to address the resources issue today.  As businesses, we must make the best use of the available resources and that is the key message we must bring, that we have a huge amount of capability in the market place, so let us harness it better.  However, we need more resources in the tourism sector.  It is not an either-or scenario.  We need to look after our existing markets, but we must put resources behind growing those markets because there are large travel markets that are bypassing Ireland.</p><p> Many of the committee meetings we attend are quite difficult, but this one is about asking for money where the payback is obvious.  We have gone from 4% to 8%, in terms of our exports to Asia and Enterprise Ireland has said there is more positive news to come from the region and will make an announcement on that tomorrow.  We are on a growth trajectory with the work we are doing there.  It is now a question of how we can fast-track that further.  The payment is obvious for the commitment to resources required.</p></speech>

The World Economic Forum discussed the ASEAN and the main message was that it was all about potential.  The focus was on the market of 600 million people.  The forum highlighted the area had 100% mobile telephone coverage and 30% Internet coverage, the young age profile of the population and the projected increase in the next 20 to 30 years of the middle class.  I suppose the region ticks all the boxes and we would all agree we need to expand our exports to this developing market.</p> <p>  What we plan should be based on mutual beneficial trade and should also focus on areas such as human and workers rights, environmental sustainability and fair taxation.  There are difficulties in this regard when we consider the countries involved.  For example, Cambodia and Laos are renowned for land grabbing from subsistence farmers and Myanmar is emerging from a military regime.  One of the issues that arose was the importance of ensuring the forthcoming elections in Myanmar in November are free and fair.  Do Mr. Kelly and Mr. Nevin concur on this?  How important is it that there is greater confidence in the region as a whole, not just in Myanmar, and how important is this for exporters and people who travel into these areas?</p> <p>  Mention was made of education and the pulling of funds by the HEA.  Were there enough people signing up for the course or were the funds cut on the basis there was no demand for the course?</p></speech>

The drop-out rate on the course was 20% and I am told that it is 50% on average in other courses.  The numbers signing up and the numbers sticking at the full course were strong.  Also, a strong proposal was submitted In order to get approval for the course initially.  To a certain degree, this came out of left field.  It is a competence building course that helps Ireland trade in Asia in the future.</p></speech>

Is anybody else taking up the slack?  Are there other courses for exporters or those travelling to the region?  In particular, are there cultural briefings in regard to how to meet and greet, etc?  I know of other European countries that have specific hotels for Asian tourists.  Are there similar hotels in Ireland where we can be assured there will be no major <i>faux pas</i>made in regard to cultural issues or food?</p><p>In regard to Asian students coming to Ireland, are there any links cultivated with them when they return to the ASEAN countries?  Do you see that as an important link?  People have suggested they might have a gr&aacute; for Ireland and might look back fondly on their time here.  Along with the Irish diaspora, are these students seen as a possible link?  </p><p>It has been mentioned that of the 12 million Chinese tourists that came to Europe, only a very small percentage came to Ireland.  I understand there has been some movement in regard to visas and there is an agreement with the British Government, India and China.  Do we need to develop this area further?  In regard to clients coming to Ireland, has there been a difficulty with regard to visas for them?  Is this a problem and should it be considered for recommendation by the committee?</p><p>I understand exports of goods to Asian countries are down 4% and services exports are up 22% since 2011.  I presume this relates to IT and accountancy services and so on.  However, do some of these services exports relate to multinationals putting services in regard to other Irish companies on the books?  Can you explain why this is happening?  In which services was their an increase and why has there been a reduction in goods exported?  Is it due to the cost of getting to the market?</p><p>The Philippines have not been mentioned, but we did mention the earthquake in Nepal.  Did the typhoon that devastated parts of the Philippines have any impact on colleagues working in the region?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I was trying to fly two kites at the same time.</p><p>I wish to raise the issue of trade with China and the potential for growth.  I realise there has been discussion on this already, but can our visitors give us some indication as to areas of opportunity.  We are aware the food industry, IT and financial services provide opportunities for growth for this country.  What other examples are there?  With the current situation regarding the value of the euro <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>other currencies, is this not a good time to establish markets in a way that will be sustainable?  We do not expect the euro will remain in the same position indefinitely and expect it will fluctuate somewhat.  To what extent can provision be made for changes in the market value of the currency at a given time?  What impact are changes likely to have in China and in south east Asia in general?</p><p>About 15 or 20 years ago a businessman said to me that the entire global investment would divert into south east Asia in the future.  Much of it did, but not all of it.  What advantages do we have when competing for investment with places like south east Asia?  Our education system has already been mentioned in this regard.  I am aware various universities have had an association with their counterparts in China over the years.  I live in Maynooth and Maynooth university has had such a liaison in the past.  To what extent can this area be developed further, with consequential benefits for both China and this country?</p><p>My final question relates to tourism.  China has a huge population and is hugely important in terms of tourism.  Is there a particular market we should target in China with a view to expanding tourism facilities here to meet the requirements of that market?</p><p>What do they go for, most importantly?  The Chinese have done a fair bit in promoting their own heritage and archaeology is one avenue in this respect.  We do not do enough in this country in that area despite having a rich culture.  We could do much more.  It is important to identify the countries and regions with similar interests.  I remember visiting the rock of Masada a long time ago and that was most interesting.  A great deal of work has been done there without disturbing the site in order to make it attractive to visitors, including those from colleges, schools and tourists from other countries.</p></speech>

Given that we have opened two new embassies in Thailand and Indonesia, with a counsulate general in Hong Kong, what is the importance of having a resident embassy?  It is something that cannot be emphasised enough.  There were ten ASEAN countries mentioned so where is the real growth potential for Ireland to do business?  We did not mention Vietnam; the embassy there was traditionally an aid embassy but as Vietnam's economy improves, there will probably be far more emphasis on trade.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2062" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kelly" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015042900002#J00300"><p>Ambassador Damien Cole, based in Vietnam, is looking after a number of countries under that remit.  The easiest countries to enter and those with immediate opportunities for Irish business to grow in are Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.  We have called for an ambassador to be appointed to the key country of Indonesia and we were delighted that the decision was taken.  It is a huge market with great growth potential.  For the average small and medium enterprise, there is no doubt that entering a market like Singapore or Malaysia is easier and is probably a wise first step before trying to crack some of the other countries.</p> <p>  People can do this and naturally pick markets that are better established and generally supportive of human rights.  That goes back to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, which we have not really addressed.  Business naturally gravitates towards markets where it feels safer, there is a strong rule of law and where personnel can be comfortable in visiting.  Business would naturally endorse countries moving towards more openness and forward thinking in terms of human rights, including equality between genders, although that may come later.  My reading of why the authorities in Myanmar are making such an effort to open up is because they see the commercial dividend to be gained from improving the country's image abroad.  There is no doubt that at the macro level, at which individual small and medium enterprises have limited ability to make an impact, there is a responsibility on the Irish Government to fully support a continued push for improving human rights.</p> <p>  Deputy Crowe asked who else is running courses.  We ran many seminars in the Asia trade forum and collaborated with the younger cohort through the universities like UCD, where we have run a programme for four years.  We have run a programme with the University of Limerick for two years where students are encouraged to develop market entry strategies for members of the Irish Exporters Association to learn about doing business there.  The question was asked if any hotels in Ireland specifically cater for Asian facilities.  I do not believe there are any, although the property at Fota Island has been bought by a Chinese company.  Perhaps it will address the issue.  Members asked if returning students are a valuable asset.  They definitely are.  There is the oft-cited example of ESB International sponsoring a student from Vietnam many years ago who returned to become deputy prime minister of the country.  That connection is still invaluable to ESB International and it was a great investment.</p> <p>  The China opportunity is definitely significant but it is difficult because it is a big market.  This goes back to State agencies and how they might work.  I am a big believer that all of our incentives and programmes put in place must not just hand out money or encourage people through singular actions like attendance at a trade show but should be geared around supporting the right behaviour.  The Dutch have done studies on how long it takes for a small or medium enterprise to break even in China, and the average is four years.  If a company commits &euro;50,000 to entering the Chinese market just in case it fails, it will fail.  A trade fair is excellent for researching the market but it is not necessarily going to deliver the right partnership.  Essentially, a company would be standing against a wall hoping that somebody will ask to represent the company.  That is instead of working out what the company needs and going out.  It is a superb forum in which to research and understand a market but it is only part of a strategy.  There must be multiple visits to a market, a commitment to follow on and the securing of a trade partner, but that is the first rung on the ladder.  People then have to visit the market regularly.  I would like to see more support being directed to companies that truly commit to the market, as that is how success is delivered.  It is not about getting more companies out there; perhaps there should be fewer companies but with deeper commitment into the market.</p> <p>  There was a question of what sets Ireland apart to position it for growth in the Chinese context.  The Irish Government has done an excellent job building our relationship with China and it regards Ireland very warmly.  Consider peripheral countries and what is happening in Greece and Italy.  I had a report from our director from China a while ago and he mentioned the huge investment from China in Ireland.  I asked him why this came about and he told me it is because the Chinese like Ireland.  We have done the diplomatic part very well and we should continue to make that investment.</p></speech>

They are very commercially focused and they know they are there to help Ireland Inc. succeed.  It is great to see that.  We would like to see a bit more collaboration between ambassadors and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as State agencies and business, in order to drive this forward.  We do not have the resources of other countries but we can be smarter about how we use resources.  We are not as smart as we could be yet.  We are relying on relationships and, to a certain degree, the journey we have ahead is different to what we have had in the past.  When we brought American businesses here, we had geography on our side as we are on the way to Europe.  We had low-cost labour, the English language and well-educated people, as well as access to Europe.  We are now a high-cost society in the value-adding area.  Culturally, it is a different market.  Government and business must learn about doing business, trading and engaging with these countries.  We have spoken about ambassadors being prepared and in some cases in the UK, ambassadors do nine months of training before going to certain market so they are up to speed on how to engage and work through bureaucracy like that in India, for example.  There is an education part from ambassadors through to business on doing business in Asia.  As the numbers show, we can succeed and we can win.</p></speech>

I have come from a scaffolding company which did business in India - a traditional manufacturing business.  We had a &euro;40 million order backlog with India in 2011 and it was zero by 2012 because the Indian Government did not deliver on its part of the deal.  The power stations were built but the interconnectors were not put into the power stations to take the energy away.  That was the frustration of India.  Under Prime Minister Modi, all that has now been addressed and that scaffolding company is now back doing consistent, good business with India.  The country is complex but Prime Minister Modi is making a difference and businesses engaging with India are seeing the benefits.</p> <p>  India has 900,000 engineers coming out of college every year.  A million jobs are being created there every month and the plan is to create 120 million jobs over the next ten years.  That is happening.  It is different from what it was four or five years ago.  Like all of these places, there will be bumps in the road but the progress is almost inexorable and we have to stress the need to be in that space.</p></speech>

The case was heard on Sunday, 26 April and bail was refused for all the applications.  Part of the reason it was adjourned was that some of the lawyers for the defendants were looking for additional time to prepare more information on the cases.  The good news we are hearing is that Ibrahim will probably be tried for the minor charges rather than some of the more serious charges proposed.  We do not have concrete evidence of that but we believe he will be charged with minor charges relating to incidents in the mosque.</p> <p>  The next hearing will be on 3 June.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, met with Minister Shoukry in New York last Monday and raised the Government's concerns about Ibrahim Halawa's welfare.  They have been taken on board by the Minister.  The one thing we have to realise is that the case will probably go ahead.  There has been a lot of misinformation about the case of Peter Greste.  He was tried and got a presidential pardon afterwards.  A presidential pardon can only happen before charges are brought against an individual or after a verdict has been reached.  The Government and the embassy are keeping a very close eye on it.  There have been 37 consular visits to Ibrahim Halawa and we will have to wait to see what happens on 3 June.  Would members like to comment on that?</p></speech>

It is important we keep pressing the Egyptian authorities.  I am glad the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, met with his counterpart and pushed the case.  We are disappointed that the bail hearing was not successful and I wondering  if there is an opportunity for another bail application to be made in light of the fact that he is facing more minor charges than some of the 426 people in this mass trial.</p> <p>  There is a lot of information and misinformation about what happened in the cases of other nationals.  Pushing for bail for Mr. Halawa and asking that he be allowed to leave the prison, as his sisters were, is not too much to ask of the Egyptian authorities, particularly in light of the fact that he is not facing the more serious charges regarding the storming of the police station, which is going to carry a far more serious penalty for those involved.</p></speech>

It is good to hear that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has met his Egyptian counterpart.  I am very disturbed to read the detail of the report from the Department.</p><p>It suggested that joining a protest in a mosque, a place of religious worship, was deemed a crime in Egypt.  I suppose the big concern we all have relates to the idea of a mass trial of defendants.  I do not think there is a belief among the Irish population that this type of mass trial leads to a just outcome.  I do not see any reference in the report to the fact that Ibrahim Halawa was charged as an adult, even though he was 17 years old when he was arrested.  We need to keep reiterating the important point that he was put into the adult system, even though he was a minor.  It is important that we continue to call on the Taoiseach to talk to his counterpart, President el-Sisi, to outline at the highest level the importance of this case to the Irish people.</p><p> We have been told that the Egyptian authorities have changed the charges.  Have the new charges been clarified?  Do we have any idea of the possible sentences that are associated with these new charges?  We know that when the previous charges were in place, people were talking in terms of the death penalty and so on.  It has been suggested that there has been a reduction in the charges, but it would be helpful if we could get some sort of sense of them.  I welcome the fact this committee is continuing to monitor the situation.  I would like to think we will discuss the case again after the date of the next legal proceedings.</p></speech>

As we have been told, they cannot give concrete or firm answers in relation to the minor charges.  We know that Ibrahim Halawa was not involved in storming the police station.  It looks like the charges are going to be minor.  His solicitors are working on that closely with the embassy.  They are keeping the embassy staff briefed on that.  The refusal of bail, which was mentioned by Senator Daly, is obviously a matter for the courts.  I presume Ibrahim Halawa's solicitors are working on that.</p></speech>

I want to put it on the record that I believe the Department, representing the Irish Government, has done a phenomenal job of work on behalf of an Irish citizen.  Notwithstanding the negative positions that are being alleged - the situation has been inflamed by incorrect information about torture, etc. - it is clear when one reads the report that this is a victory for diplomacy.  I want it to be recorded that we are reading today about the service being provided by our Government to an Irish citizen.</p></speech>

The committee has received a total of 137 petitions to date since the launch of the petitions system.  The secretariat has been examining them, first, to establish the admissibility of the petitions and, second, to assess how best to progress a petition for consideration by the joint sub-committee.  A total of 126 of the petitions received have been brought before the committee on at least one occasion.  Of these, the committee has disposed of 95; 53 were admissible, dealt with and closed, while 42 were inadmissible.  There are five petitions to be discussed today and two further petitions to read correspondence into the record.</p> <p>  The first petition before us is No. P00062/12 of 2012, which is Enda Kenny and the Irish Government: Introduce Equality Budgeting, from Dr. Clara Fischer.  The Equality Budgeting Campaign is a broad-based coalition of trade unions, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and concerned individuals who are seeking the introduction of equality budgeting in Ireland.  The campaign was founded in July 2012 in light of increases in inequality and poverty.  This petition was discussed at meetings on 27 November 2013 and again on 22 January 2014, and the petitioner addressed the committee on 2 April 2014.  This group also met with the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection in 2014, whose report is noted in the committee's summary document.</p> <p>  We have agreed that we will write to the Department of Finance attaching a copy of the petition and requesting that in view of the proposal within the Department to set up a budget office, this committee would urge the Minister to establish an equality budget advisory group which could be made up of officials and representatives working in this sector and stating that we support the objectives in the petition.  We will also write to the petitioner advising of the decision of the committee and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00015/13 relates to extending the Freedom of Information Acts to include the Data Protection Commissioner and the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The petitioner is Mr. Niall Kelly.  The petitioner is calling for the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner and the Financial Services Ombudsman to come under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Acts.  The joint sub-committee considered this petition at its meeting on 22 January 2014 and it was then referred to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, recommending that the Minister fully include the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Data Protection Commissioner in the freedom of information legislation which he was preparing.  As the Freedom of Information Bill was enacted on 14 October 2014 and both the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Data Protection Commissioner are now included under its remit, it is proposed that we forward a copy of the correspondence received and a link to the Freedom of Information Act 2014 to the petitioner and close the petition.  We also noted that there are some caveats there that might limit the oversight and if that is the case, we will keep an eye on this into the future.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00024/13 relates to recruitment policy within RTE from Mr. Kevin Sharkey.  This is a decision on which a previous meeting of this committee deliberated in private session and it was to be read into the record in public session, which we are doing now.  The petition was about a perceived policy that within RTE the station only employed white people.  The petitioner would like to see a more diverse RTE, with the station hiring people based on what they can do, not the colour of their skin.  The committee discussed this petition on 25 March following research and e-mails from the petitioner.  I forwarded the material and the response received from RTE to the petitioner and closed the petition.  We understand that the petitioner is happy that the issues he raised have been addressed, so it is a satisfactory outcome.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Petition No. P00012/14 calls for a sworn inquiry into the appointment of two senior planning inspectors to the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It is from Mr. Jim Connolly.  The petitioner is calling for an independent inquiry into the appointment of two senior planning inspectors to the board of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in January 2002.  He is claiming there was alleged collusion by the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, senior officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, ICTU, Impact and a Government Minister to allow the appointments to be made in the first place.  This issue was discussed in 2008 by the Joint Committee on the Environment with the Irish Rural Dwellers Association, IRDA, and also with the then Minister.  The Minister outlined the nominating and appointments process and stated that these had only recently been endorsed by the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, it appears from transcripts of this meeting that no follow-up action was recommended.</p> <p>  This was discussed by this committee on 25 March this year and it was agreed to write to the petitioner asking him to identify clearly where the Minister breached the legislation.</p><p>A response was received by e-mail, which was forwarded to members.</p></speech>

There is not much more our committee can do about it.  However, we have said that we have some interest in the issue of appointments to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and if the petitioner has issues about that more general question, that might be something he could consider petitioning on to examine ways to improve the appointments process for the board.  That might be an interesting discussion for many people but there is not much more further we can go with the previous decision.  It was a long time ago, which added to the difficulty and the issue also came before the environment committee in the past.  That is the best we can offer the petitioner in this case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015042900002#G00300"><p>Is is agreed to close this petition?  Agreed.  It is open to Mr. Connolly to accept the invitation to discuss the broader issue of appointments if he wishes to do so.</p><p>Petition No. P00022/14 is the need for provision to be made for the compensation of victims of uninsured aircraft operators or other third parties suffering personal injury or loss as a result of air accidents where there is no insurance policy or the insurance policy has been repudiated.  This is from Mr. John Dunphy and deals with correspondence No. 540 on our list.  At the joint committee meeting of 14 January, it was agreed to refer this to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and close the petition.  We have received welcome confirmation from the joint committee that at its meeting of 21 January, members agreed to consider the issue in the context of the committee&rsquo;s work programme.  We will forward a copy of the correspondence, which is positive news, to the petitioner and maintain it as a closed petition.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</p><p>Petition No. P00031/14 seeks the restoration of self-builds in Ireland and is from Mrs. Amanda Gallagher.  The petitioner is requesting the joint committee to call on the Government to repeal Building Control (Amendment) Regulation SI 9, which came into force on 1 March 2014, under which all construction of homes and extensions must go through a main building contractor.  The committee has agreed following deliberation two issues.  This petition is deemed inadmissible, unfortunately, under D&aacute;il Standing Order 165(1)(<i>h</i>) because the matter has gone before the Ombudsman.  The Standing Order states:<blockquote>(1) A petition is admissible unless it&mdash;<br /><br />(<i>h</i>) requires the Committee to consider an individual complaint which has been the subject of a decision by the Ombudsman, by another Ombudsman, or by a regulatory public body or a body established for the purpose of redress.</blockquote>We, unfortunately, cannot accept the petition on that basis.  We will write to the petitioner informing her that the Department is currently undertaking a review of SI 9 of 2014, which includes a public consultation process that is open for submissions up until 15 May 2015.  That is important because it gives her time to have an input into that.  As the review is addressing the issues raised, the petition is now closed.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>Our final petition is No. P00008/15, retain tariff C for taxi journeys, from Mr. James Waldron.  The petition background is there will be changes to the taxi tariff applied by taxi drivers from 30 April 2015.  From the information supplied by the petitioner, it appears tariff rate C will be reduced by 32 cent per km.  However, this is in the context of an approximate overall 4% increase and takes into account the use of new technologies such as taxi apps. The petitioner is also looking for meters to be amended free of charge to allow for the inclusion of tolls and tunnels on receipts.  He is also suggesting the introduction of a charge for the carriage of luggage.  We have deliberated on the petition and I invite Deputy Boyd Barrett to comment on our decision.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015042900002#G00400"><p>I have been in considerable communication with a number of taxi drivers.  The petitioner is a member of the National Private Hire &amp;amp; Taxi Association, NPHTA, which is one of the largest taxi driver representative organisations.  They are annoyed over the manner in which this tariff change has been implemented and they have cause to be.  There were protests about this a while ago because they say the change to tariff C, which relates to long journeys outside the normal locale of a driver for which there is a higher charge because they are not allowed to pick up outside their normal locale, would affect them adversely.  They also have to have their meters recalibrated and resealed and so on, which is a cost to them.  They had not asked for this and they are not happy.  They feel the majority of taxi drivers are opposed to this and the public consultation process relating to this was inadequate.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, in the correspondence dealing with the petition, said that it followed the rules of the public consultation and submissions process but the drivers say that while that may be the case, it is an inadequate process.  There may have been many other submissions but they point out, for example, that they alone submitted a petition signed by 500 taxi drivers opposing this change.  They say the majority of taxi drivers oppose it and they do not believe these submissions were adequately taken on board or treated seriously by the NTA in making its decision to change the tariffs.</p> <p>  In my experience, their concerns have been borne out because I tabled a parliamentary question on their behalf to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to view the public submissions on this to see what they said and I asked whether the NTA took on board the views of stakeholders.  The NTA wrote back to me and said it would not give that information because it is not the authority's practice to do this and it is not required to do so.  That is unacceptable.  In many other processes which involve public consultation, we can read the submissions, objections and so on and we are able to adjudicate in an open and transparent way whether the statutory body or group is taking stakeholders seriously.  If we believe in public consultation and participation and democratic revolutions and all that stuff, then what the stakeholders say should be taken seriously.  It appears that has not been the case here.  We do not even know what the story is because the NTA will not tell us.</p> <p>  There is a problem in that the petitioner is asking us to retain tariff C.  We probably cannot do that but it is within our remit to examine the public consultation process and whether it is adequate and whether changes need to be made in the context of transparency and accountability.  We should ask the petitioner to resubmit his petition, foregrounding the issue of the inadequacy of the public consultation process, the lack of transparency and the need to have a better, more transparent process.  That would us give the opportunity to examine the issue and hear the different sides of the argument.</p></speech>

The purpose of this morning's meeting is to engage with representatives of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann as part of this committee's pre-legislative scrutiny of the heads of the road traffic Bill 2015.  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Paddy Doherty, CEO and Mr. Phil Donohue, head of human resources and development with Dublin Bus.  We also welcome Mr. Martin Nolan, CEO and Mr. Joe Kenny, chief human resources manager with Bus &Eacute;ireann, who will make a joint presentation.  Could I remind members that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann representatives are here to discuss the heads of the road traffic Bill, not industrial relations issues at the companies which are at a sensitive stage at the moment?</p><p>I wish to draw your attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise you that any submission or opening statements you have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name, or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I now call Mr. Joe Kenny to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

We operate a transport network upon which our customers make many millions of journeys every year.  We interface with members of the general public on buses and in a whole range of places.  The road passenger transport industry is of significant importance to the people and the economy of Ireland.  It provides an essential service to the community at local and regional levels.  Its continued success depends on the people who operate the service and can only be achieved through their efficiency and teamwork.  Consequently, a high standard of commitment is expected from everyone involved, irrespective of what his or her particular job may be.  <br/><br/>The safety and comfort of our customers is of vital importance to Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus and it must be the prime consideration of all drivers.  By boarding our vehicles, customers indicate they have confidence in the drivers' skills and competence to get them to their destinations, safely and in comfort.  It is the responsibility of the driver to ensure, by every means at his or her disposal, that this is achieved satisfactorily, ensuring a consistent and high quality service.  In accordance with section 8 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus have a legal duty to ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare at work of all its employees.  Under section 13 of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 all Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus employees have a legal duty to ensure that they take reasonable care to protect their own safety and welfare and that of any other person who may be affected by their acts or omission&rsquo;s while at work.  This duty, under section 13(1)(<i>b</i>) extends to ensuring that they are not under the influence of an intoxicant while at work, be it alcohol or drugs or a combination of both, to the extent that they are likely to endanger their own safety, health or welfare at work or that of any other person within the workplace.<br/><br/>Section 13 of The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, provides that &quot;An employee shall, while at work if reasonably required by his or her employer, submit to any appropriate, reasonable and proportionate tests for intoxicants by, or under the supervision of, a registered medical practitioner who is a competent person, as may be prescribed&quot;.  I now hand over to my colleague Mr. Phil Donohue from Dublin Bus.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2120" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil Donohue" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015042900002#E00500"><p>Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus had envisaged the introduction of intoxicant testing as provided for in section 13(1) of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  We have had discussions with workplace representatives to reach agreement on the introduction of random testing for drugs and alcohol in the workplace.  This was subject to the publication of a code of practice on foot of the Health, Safety and Welfare at Work Act 2005, through the enactment of a statutory instrument.  Unfortunately, agreement could not be reached regarding random testing for alcohol and drugs, as no regulation was in place to cover such testing and the Health and Safety Authority issued guidelines saying that random testing was not provided for under the 2005 Act.  This continues to be a barrier to reaching agreement with employees for random testing for alcohol and drugs.</p> <p>  Section 88 of the Railway Safety Act 2005 requires rail companies to draw up a code of conduct for safety critical workers in relation to intoxicants and sampling procedures in that regard.  As a result of this legislation both Irish Rail and Luas services have implemented a system of random intoxicant testing.  The Railway Safety Act not only places an obligation on the employer but also on the employee.  Despite the lack of regulation, and following discussions with employee representatives, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus effected a detailed policy in relation to drugs and alcohol.  The policy describes how the two organisations manage the impact of drugs and alcohol within the workplace and identifies appropriate rules, both legislative and self-imposed.  We clearly explain the processes for invoking those rules, the subsequent actions and identify who must carry them out.  We also make clear the obligations of all employees in this regard.  The proposed legislation will provide a mechanism where we can introduce random drug and alcohol testing for all employees.</p> <p>  In conclusion, we urge the committee to give serious consideration to the legislative support required to introduce a testing regime that covers all road transport providers and sets an industry best practice standard for all.  This would be in keeping with other European member states and is welcomed by both Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus.  It would underpin the safety culture in our organisations, act as a preventative measure and as a deterrent, and would ultimately lead to an improvement in overall road safety in Ireland.  We thank the Chairman and members of the committee.</p></speech>

I welcome the deliberations of the gentlemen and thank them for their presence.  Mr. Donohue stated:  "Unfortunately, agreement could not be reached regarding random testing for alcohol and drugs, as no regulation was in place to cover such testing and the Health and Safety Authority issued guidelines saying that random testing was not provided for under the 2005 Act".  Am I to understand from the witness that he is happy this proposed legislation would address the issue of reaching agreement with worker representatives? Is he confident the legislation is robust enough to meet the difficulties that arose in those negotiations?</p></speech>

This area needs to be looked at - there needs to be an obligation on both sides.  Legislation which just legislates for the employer to put testing in place, without an obligation on the employee to co-operate with that regime-----</p></speech>

One of the big differences between the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act  and the proposed legislation is that the proposed legislation applies to critical safety tasks.  One of the difficulties with the original 2005 legislation is that it covered all employees whereas this proposed legislation is more focused on HGV and PSV drivers, and for that reason it is more amenable to people to accept it.</p><p>It also gets over another hurdle, which is that it would be a level playing field for everybody, which is one of the difficulties we experienced, both from a corporate point of view, because we would like everyone to be subject to the same rules and regulations, and also from the employees' point of view, because they would like to see that they are not being singled out in any particular employment.  So, for that reason, we welcome it as a single piece of legislation rather than as an addendum to the 2005 Act.</p></speech>

I could accept the Acting Chairman's suggestion if there was an attempt to hijack Mr. Kenny or Mr. Donohue, which I would not do, but as Mr. Nolan is here, I think it is appropriate that we at least enter into discussion, if he is okay with that.  I assume, as chief executive, he has full knowledge of what is happening on the IR side and I think it is appropriate for us to put a number of questions, perhaps at the end of the discussion of this particular legislation.  I make that proposal and seek the agreement of the committee on it.</p></speech>

There may be many members of this committee who are not aware of Deputy Dooley's proposal and there may be many members of the Oireachtas who are interested in having the same discussion but are not aware of the Deputy's proposal.</p></speech>

If people choose not to be at the committee, that is their loss.  Deputy  Ellis and I are here.

There is a strike about to take place and tens of thousands of people will be discommoded as a result of what is happening.  I think there are people who are looking in today who will find it farcical that the parliamentarians cannot have a conversation about it when the forum is in existence and the personnel are here.  I think it would make a laughing stock of the notion that somehow we have reformed the way we do our business in the national parliament.  I will make a proposal that we enter into a discussion afterwards, in a respectful way, with Mr. Nolan, if he is prepared to take some questions.  He has been very forthcoming in the past when he has come before us and I would be surprised if he was not prepared to avail us.</p></speech>

To come here and meet with representatives of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and not even to get a briefing on what is happening with the workers and what is going on is wrong.  I would like to know whether there is a possibility of averting this or a possibility of further negotiation?  I make the same request that, if at all possible, at the end of this meeting, we do that.  I am subject to what the representatives say.</p></speech>

First, as I have said, it is not an agenda item, so other members who may have been interested have not been notified.  The second point is would we then have to bring the unions in?  Let us be clear about this now.  This is what I am concerned about.  This is not a judgment committee, court, labour court, labour relations commission, or anything else.  It is a public forum.  I am concerned about having questions answered by somebody on one side of the dispute and the committee being accused of favouring one side over the other.  That is a concern I have.</p></speech>

I think it would be an outrageous situation if the chief executive of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the representative of the company, is with us today, when we are on the verge of a strike during which tens of thousands of people will be discommoded, and we do not enter into a dialogue.  I do not expect Mr. Nolan to say something that he had not intended to.  I expect him to be briefed, as he would be as chief executive, and I think it would assist in the process so that we do not end up with so many people being discommoded.  I ask the Acting Chairman to consider what he has said.  I will make it a formal proposal.  I prefer not to have to go down that route and put it to a vote but if the Acting Chairman forces me, I will.  If he accepts the proposal that I am making, I think we can do it in a respectful way that seeks to have a discussion or dialogue around an important issue.</p></speech>

It is not about the committee taking a position.  It is not about filing a report at the end of it.  It is not about making a judgment or issuing some kind of an opinion.  It is a discussion where members of a diverse group of people from different parties have a conversation with the chief executive of Bus &Eacute;ireann about an impending strike.  It seems to me to be a fairly straightforward proposal.</p></speech>

Rather than getting into a question-and-answer type situation, the CEO might inform the committee what the situation is and if we need to have a subsequent meeting with the company and the relevant stakeholders we could do that.  I accept where the Acting Chairman is coming from.  We would not like to be seen to have any degree of bias, but I also accept what Deputy Dooley is saying, because this is unprecedented, as the Minister has said.  We have gone from a situation where there was an afternoon strike threatened to a situation where there are days of strikes threatened.  Maybe rather than getting into a question-and-answer type situation, the CEO might be able to provide us with an update as to what is happening, and afterwards, if there is a requirement for a subsequent meeting, the committee can make the relevant arrangements.  I think it might be a bit unfair to proceed today in the absence of the other stakeholders.  I understand where the Acting Chairman is coming from but I think it would be no harm to get an update rather than having adversarial questions and answers.  Perhaps if Deputy Dooley would accept a statement from the CEO on the situation, we could leave it at that until a subsequent meeting.</p></speech>

It is not as if other people do not get access to the airwaves.  It is not as if we live in Stalinist Russia and other representatives, be they union representatives or whatever, do not have access to the public airwaves.  We have an opportunity to have a discussion and dialogue and to put a number of questions to Mr. Nolan about this issue.  I do not think that, in any way, limits the extent to which others have a voice.  We have had the unions here to discuss issues before and we would welcome them again.  I do not think that anything that I will say will be at variance with their position on this particular issue.  At the end of the day, I am here to try to contribute in so far as I can to this situation which will impact on tens of thousands of people over the coming days and if any bit of wisdom that I have available to me can help to bring a resolution then so be it.  Hopefully others are of a similar mind.</p></speech>

I will not delve into the question of the unions or anything like that.  There are issues that the public need to know.  There are issues over contingency plans and getting the message out there.  I do not know what the intentions of Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are in terms of giving information out to people on the ground about what will happen during the strike.

When reading the report I noticed that Irish Rail employees are subject to random testing under railway legislation, but the same powers or conditions do not apply under road traffic legislation.  It is important not only for Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus but for all road transport users, haulage companies and bus companies that these safety measures apply across the board.</p> <p>  I can understand why some people might be reticent.  Representatives of the Automobile Association were before the committee last week.  From memory, Conor Faughnan expressed some reservations on behalf of motorists who might be subjected to random tests.  There is an understandable fear among people who might be on medication of some kind to the effect that if they are stopped and tested, they might fail the test.  This probably needs to be clarified in the Bill.  All road haulage companies and bus operators and their employees should be subject to the safety procedures in place in the interests of the safety of the public, passengers and the employees themselves.</p></speech>

Applying the provisions across the public transport sector and the road freight sector and making it applicable to all would certainly make it far easier to get a group of people in a particular workplace to accept the policy.  The absence of the legislation was a stumbling block within Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann when we were trying to negotiate for random testing in the workplace.  If we can get in place legislation that will overcome that, it will be far easier to apply these testing procedures.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015042900002#G00500"><p>I thank the bus companies for the presentations.  Mr. Donohue suggested it was a good thing that we have legislation in place but I believe there is a concern.  A number of groups have appeared before the committee expressing a concern about the major emphasis being put on employers in terms of their responsibilities.  Let us consider the case of a family businesses that runs haulage.  It may have one, two or three people involved.  That could be a tricky situation.</p> <p>  I assume the practice in the past was that if someone was identified as being intoxicated or was falling or seemed to be behaving in a certain way, then a practice was put in place such that the person would be requested to have a test.  Have there been many incidents whereby people have been forced or asked to be tested as a result of an observation from a manager or someone else?  There is an issue of citizens' rights as well.  If we put in place legislation and we are dealing with people, we need to be mindful that we cannot impose things constantly and force employers to do this.  Is the proposed legislation as close as one could get to international best practice?  I am keen to hear the position of the bus companies in that regard.</p> <p>  I believe a code of practice is important, but I am concerned in case every time a person came in he was asked to do a test without any reason.  Something should have to trigger the call for that test in the first place.  I have a problem in the way this is being proposed at the moment.  It looks to me as though a major emphasis is being put on employers.  We have seen many cases where it is tricky to make a judgment.  If a person is taking drugs one may not see it as much as if someone had taken a great deal of alcohol and is falling about the place.  In the case of someone who has taken drugs, one may not really know.  Are we considering putting in place a practice whereby once a month or once every six months a random test is carried out on employees?  I am keen to get a feel for the way the bus companies see this going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-29a.2157" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Joe Kenny" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015042900002#G00600"><p>There are a number of points that we can address.  First, our policy is already well defined in terms of how we test for drugs and alcohol.  We do not actually carry out random testing at the moment because of the absence of legislation, but our policy is in place to allow for it.  International best practice suggests that somewhere between 5% and 10% of the workforce should be tested annually on a random basis.  That is regarded as best practice internationally.</p> <p>  In the case of small businesses only a small number of people would be tested.  The company could have a choice on whether the person tested is taken out of the testing, but normally the person is kept in.  One could have a situation whereby someone is tested more than once on a purely random basis, for example.  Anyway, the service provider we have uses what is called a randomiser.  Our company has no input into who is selected for that.  The process is clear to the staff as well as any other interested parties.  It is completely transparent.  We would not get a situation whereby someone would be victimised, for example.</p> <p>  There is another way that people are called for testing and that is using for-cause testing.  This is what Deputy Ellis was referring to.  This is where someone displays behaviour consistent with being under the influence of a substance and a manager or supervisor finds that someone is displaying certain behaviours.  Under those circumstances we can have a for-cause test.</p> <p>  In my experience we have had no real cause to suspect that anyone is turning up for work under the influence of anything.  However, as Deputy Ellis rightly pointed out, the movement is now away from alcohol it seems and more towards drugs, which are more difficult to detect.  I do not necessarily mean so-called illegal drugs, they could be dispensed drugs that have an effect on people's capability to drive.  Some of these are even over-the-counter products that indicate they may cause drowsiness and that users should not drive.</p> <p>  This brings me to the other point Deputy Ellis made, that is, the responsibility being put on employers to carry out this.  There is a responsibility on employees to look after their health and welfare and that of those around them as well.  This is encapsulated in the 2005 Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act.  I envisage the two Acts working in tandem to show that there is shared responsibility.</p> <p>  My last point is that education is very important.  Before anyone implements a policy within this company or any company there should be a full education programme.  Since the introduction last year we have produced good quality education pamphlets, like the one before the committee now, which tell people all about the potential effects and what they should be looking out for in order that they do not accidentally contravene any of the policies we have on drugs and alcohol.  For example, we tell people the position if they are going out for a night before they are expected in work the next day.  They need to be conscious of the fact that alcohol can stay in the body for a number of hours and that each unit of alcohol takes at least two hours to get out of the body.  That sort of education helps.  In this way the responsibilities are therefore shared between employee and employer.</p></speech>

We have 850,000 customer journeys over these strike days and Dublin Bus has more than that.  We have made huge headway over the past number of years with 4 million additional passenger journeys last year.  We are getting the companies back on the financial straight and narrow.</p> <p>  This weekend is one of our busiest of the year.  Following detailed discussions with the Minister, the Department and the National Transport Authority, we gave a renewed commitment yesterday that no staff will have to transfer out of our company into another as part of the 10% tendering and that terms and conditions will be protected.  There will be details around that which we need to get back to the Labour Relations Commission to discuss.  The strike action will have dire financial consequences for our company and for Dublin Bus.</p> <p>  Once again, we need to get back around the table to discuss matters.  I know there is much work in getting that to happen.  If we go out on strike, public sympathy will disappear fairly quickly and we live on our reputation.</p></speech>

I do not want to stray into the direct industrial relations issue as that is a matter for the company and the unions.  However, there are a couple of fundamental points involved.</p> <p>  This situation has arisen as a result of the Government&rsquo;s ideology where a decision was taken in the belief that there would be greater value for money achieved if there were competitiveness to make Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus do their business more efficiently.  Does Mr. Nolan accept this has now failed when the Minister, as of yesterday, gave assurances to the workers that in the event of 10% of the business being transferred to private operators, Bus &Eacute;ireann will still have to carry the drivers associated with that?  Does that not undermine the economics of the argument and that ultimately this is ideology over economics?  Does it further not put the company and Dublin Bus under considerable financial strain as they move towards 2017 at a point when a further decision will be taken by the Government as to whether it will privatise further routes?  If in 2017 the Government decides to privatise 40% to 50% of the company, the expectation will be that Bus &Eacute;ireann will have to carry all of the staff affected.</p><p>What has arisen makes a farce of the decision to enter into this privatised regime.  Does Mr. Nolan not think it would be better for the Government to instruct the NTA to go back to the direct award model set out and provided for in the 2008 Act?  Does he further agree that the 2008 Act made it very clear that only new routes would be handled under the competitive tendering process?  That would have allowed for compliance with the 2007 directive from the European Union in terms of competitiveness.</p></speech>

It is in all our interests to find out as best we can what is going on between Bus &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus, the NTA and the unions, although I am not going to delve into certain issues.  While I see Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann as belonging to the State, what we have is the Minister blaming the NTA and saying it is offloading routes and putting them out to tender.  It is a drive towards privatisation and I sympathise with the workers who see it coming down the road.  This is only the beginning in the offloading of routes.  Had they been looking at new routes and following some of the directives from the European Union that might have been one thing, but we are talking about existing routes.  In the case of Bus &Eacute;ireann, we are talking about 100% of routes in Waterford.  I do not know how Bus &Eacute;ireann has interacted with the NTA on this issue.  Has it been totally opposed to this plan or is it going along with it because it is being forced to do so by the NTA and the ideology of the Government?   We have been seeing huge increases in the numbers of passengers and income.  Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are becoming more economical in managing funding.  The PSO levy has stabilised - at the least the Government has stopped cutting it - and we are still managing to deliver a good service.  </p> <p>  In London, in contrast to what the NTA is proposing, routes are being taken back and subsidised more.  I would like to get a feel of the interaction between the NTA and Bus &Eacute;ireann in this regard.  I would also like to find out what Bus &Eacute;ireann is going to state to commuters about how they should handle this issue.  What are their alternatives if the strike goes ahead?  I hope we will negotiate up to the last minute.  My worry is that although the parties involved are in negotiations on existing workers, they may not negotiate on conditions for future workers.  We are talking about protecting workers, but protecting workers into the future is also very important.  The parties involved should not just seek to do a deal for a certain number of workers.</p> <p>  Two options were being proposed in terms of workers keeping their jobs, but I do not know how we can guarantee even these two options when we are dealing with private companies.  If they win the contracts, how can we say workers can transfer to them and retain the same rights and rates?  Furthermore, down the road when there is a new worker, the position will have changed.  That is wrong and it should not happen in the first place.</p></speech>

That is something we intend to do and we have a number of strings to that bow.  One is that we are tendering for the work that is being put out to tender.  There is also growth in public transport which we can all see, as well as the easing of congestion.  Even the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, talked yesterday about additionality in public transport.  The third string to our bow is the timescale envisaged for these changes.  There will be a transitional period, which will give us a chance to deal with residual issues.  What we said yesterday about the commitments we could give to our staff, who have done a great job in recent years, was significant and based on detailed discussions on funding.  We need to get back into the talks on that issue.  We implement Government policy and are here to give our views on the road traffic Bill.  Once it is enacted, we will implement it.  That is our job.  There have been a lot of meetings and we need to get back to having them.  </p> <p>  On the PR side, we have ramped up our media presence.  We are on radio and our website includes all of the necessary information.  We advise people to keep an ear to the radio and watch our website and that of Dublin Bus.  We will be fighting until the last minute to keep people working on the inside rather than on the outside.</p></speech>

It is fundamentally an issue for the Government in terms of the ideology it is pursuing in its agenda to privatise initially 10% of the route network.

There are no winners in strikes.  As regards holding on to the extra staff, is Bus &Eacute;ireann projecting an age profile that would see enough people retiring to facilitate this?</p> <p>  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann taken a look at public transport services around the country?  There are counties in which there is no public transport system.  There might be a system in Dublin and the cities, but in ordinary rural parts of Ireland the company is cutting, not increasing, services.  Is it going to try to be more expansive and work with communities to provide a better service?  If we are talking about congestion or whatever else, it should apply to all parts of Ireland.  We should not concentrate on just four or five parts of the country and to hell with the rest.</p></speech>

There is additionality in public transport services around the country.  We have an infrastructure that caters for services to a certain level.

It seems to be a rushed decision by the Minister to try to quell the strike.  It has not been properly though out, no more than the privatisation agenda has been properly thought out.  The long-term implications for Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus are that they will end up with a higher cost base which will be used against them as they face into the next round of competitive tendering.</p><p>The legislation provided for the direct award in line with the appropriate activity the NTA has put in place for Bus &Eacute;ireann, with service level agreements, value for money audits and all of that, but, unfortunately, this is just this Government driving a privatisation agenda and the Labour Party has gotten off scot-free.</p></speech>
