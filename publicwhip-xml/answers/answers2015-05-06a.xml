This includes time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant and time in the Department for review and preparation of its appeal submission.  The system is flexible and accessible and <font color="#2F2F2F">allows multiple reviews and submissions of fresh evidence at all stages.</font>For logistical reasons the process takes longer when an oral hearing is required.</p><p>Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process to manage the significant increase in its workload since 2009, while, at the same time, ensuring that quality and fairness are not compromised.  In addition to the introduction of a new operating model, the appeals officer cadre increased to 41 officers in the last four years.  </p><p>Any person whose means are insufficient to meet their needs while awaiting an appeal decision may apply for supplementary welfare allowance.  This means-tested payment is the &ldquo;safety net&rdquo; within the welfare system providing assistance to eligible people in the State.  The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance to persons in need who do not qualify for social welfare payments under any other scheme.</p></reply>

Participants benefit by being involved in work.  They improve their work readiness and are able to apply their existing skills and learn new ones.  The scheme is also intended to assist the personal and social development of participants with the objective of bridging the gap between unemployment and re-entering the workforce.</p><p>Funding of the order of &euro;22.4m is being provided in the Department's Vote in 2015 to cover placements under the scheme.</p><p>Gateway was introduced in line with the commitments set out in the Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work and the overall aim is to provide 3,000 work placement opportunities.  While progress was initially slow, I am delighted to confirm that over 70% of the placements available have now been taken up.

The jobseeker's transitional payment also enables a lone parent to work part time without restriction, provided they satisfy the means test and to participate in education while receiving this payment.  This allows these customers to balance their caring responsibilities while supporting them to engage in employment or education should they wish to participate.</p>  <p>  Recipients of the jobseeker's transitional payment can also apply for the SUSI grant and, if eligible, this grant is not assessed as means by the department providing the maximum benefit to customers from that financial support which may help towards childcare costs.</p>  <p>  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs provides subsidised childcare for customers on Solas or education and training boards courses under the childcare education and training support programme.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills provide a wide range of flexible education and training options including online options.  Online courses delivered by Solas are designed to give a flexible response to the specific skills needs of individuals who require training interventions with certification to assist them to re-enter the labour market.  Courses are available free of charge to unemployed clients.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-06a.16.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600050#WRA01400"><p>The Irish contribution to Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduce by a minimum of 200,000 the population in 'combined poverty' (i.e. either consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or basic deprivation) between 2010 and 2020.</p><p>In 2013, the at-risk-of-poverty rate fell from 16.5% to 15.2%, the first reduction in three years.  In comparative terms, Ireland is below the EU average and ranks 8<sup>th</sup>lowest of the 28 EU member states.</p><p>A key reason for Ireland's low rate of income poverty is the redistributive impact of social transfers.  In 2013, social transfers lifted almost a quarter of the population out of at-risk-of-poverty.  Ireland is among the best performing EU member states in its policy efforts to alleviate poverty according to Eurostat data. </p><p>In Budget 2015, the Government provided an additional &euro;160 million for welfare measures to support families and the most vulnerable.  A social impact assessment of the Budget, including the water charges, found that for the first time since the economic crisis, welfare and income tax policy will result in an increase in average household incomes of 0.7% (equivalent of almost &euro;6 per week).</p><p>Growing employment and providing the supports needed through activation to get people back to work will have a direct impact on poverty.  Through Pathways to Work and the Action Plan on Jobs, the Government is putting people into real jobs.  I am confident that Government policies, as set out in the Spring Economic Statement, will continue to improve income and living standards.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-06a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600050#WRA01700"><p>The Department is committed to providing a range of supports and measures to encourage and facilitate people with disabilities to avail of employment opportunities.</p>  <p>  For people who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit for a minimum of six months, the partial capacity benefit scheme, which was introduced in 2012, provides an opportunity to take up employment and continue to receive an ongoing portion of the weekly social welfare payment, including any increase being paid in respect of a qualified adult or qualified children.  There are currently over 1,400 participants on the scheme with a budget of over &euro;11.5 million for 2015.</p>  <p>  The partial capacity benefit explicitly recognises and responds to the reality that some people with disabilities will have a capacity to engage in open market employment while continuing to require some income support from the State.  The objective of the scheme is to incentivise such people to return to the workplace without fear of loss of their disability related social welfare benefits.  If a person becomes unable to continue in employment, s/he may at any time revert to the full rate of illness benefit/invalidity pension, provided the qualifying conditions for that scheme continue to be satisfied.  </p>  <p>  Moreover, some people with a disability in receipt of social welfare income supports can work and retain a portion of their payment.  For example, if a person's doctor recommends that the work is of a rehabilitative or therapeutic nature, recipients of disability allowance (DA) can work and earn &euro;120 per week without affecting the rate of DA being paid, while if the weekly earnings are between &euro;120 and &euro;350, fifty per cent of the earnings will be disregarded in the DA means test.  </p>  <p>  While I appreciate concerns expressed on this matter, I can assure the Deputy that while the Department is conscious of the need to facilitate people with disabilities moving into employment where possible, access to social welfare supports will continue to be available should  efforts to return to employment not work out.</p></reply>

In every case where a one parent family payment (OFP) is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) in order to ascertain whether he/she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the OFP.</p><p>The issuing of a maintenance contribution assessment under the social welfare legislation does not alter an individual's obligation to discharge maintenance payments pursuant to an order of the Court. </p><p>A liable relative is given the option to commence making payments to the OFP recipient or directly to the Department.</p><p>In 2014, the Department issued 2,586 determination orders for maintenance.  As a result of the impending transfer of claimants from OFP to jobseekers transitional payments (JST), 134 of those determination orders issued to liable relatives in 2014 will no longer have a liability to the scheme from June 2015.  This represents approximately 5% of the determination orders issued in 2014.  As indicated at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Social Protection on 18<sup>th</sup>February, where this matter was also raised, my Department is aware of this issue and will be considering an amendment to the JST arrangements in the future to pursue these liable relatives.</p></reply>

These changes were designed to spread the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members and beneficiaries in any consideration of an application by the trustees of the scheme to restructure scheme benefits.  It is a matter for the trustees of a scheme, who are required under trust law to act in the best interests of all scheme members, to determine how the provisions in section 50 of the Act might be applied.</p>  <p>  The most recent analysis was carried out in November 2014 and indicates that over the period since 2009, there were 106 applications made by the trustees of a defined benefit pensions schemes to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits.  78% of these applications related to an adjustment to post retirement increases in benefits; 8% did not impact on the benefits of existing pensioners; the remaining 14% of applications adjusted the normal pension age or the lump sum at retirement.  In one case the core pensioner benefits were reduced.</p>  <p>  At end of 2014, there were 778 active defined benefit pension schemes subject to the funding requirements of the Pensions Act.  The application of section 50 impacted on less than 14% of these schemes.</p>  <p>  While I will continue to monitor the application of section 50 of the Pensions Act on an ongoing basis, I expect that the measures I have put in place will support schemes achieve a sustainable position and decrease the likelihood of recourse to its provisions.</p></reply>

FIS also preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming social welfare.</p><p>At the end of March 2015, there were 50,452 families including 111,693 children in receipt of FIS.  Expenditure on FIS for 2014 was of the order of &euro;297.7 million in respect of some 50,300 families.  The estimated expenditure for 2015 is expected to be &euro;349.2million.  The number of families in receipt of FIS increased by 13% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 &ndash; from 44,159 families to 49,860 families.</p><p>The Department does not maintain statistics in relation to the number of hours worked by each individual adult who is part of a family in receipt of FIS.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.  A couple may combine their hours of employment to meet the qualification criteria.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.</p><p><font color="#2F2F2F"> New claims for FIS and annual renewals continue to be processed without delay.  </font>Creating jobs and reducing unemployment are key challenges facing the Government.  The tax and social protection systems have a part to play in addressing these issues and in ensuring work pays.  In this regard, the department is carrying out a focused policy assessment of FIS examining the role of in-work benefits in supporting people to move from welfare to work.</p></reply>

The time-lag in terms of ramping up supply to match demand is fuelling an increase in rents, especially in Dublin and the major cities.  Policy in relation to rent controls is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, who is considering a number of policy options in relation to achieving greater rent certainty.  The Government's objective is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.</p>  <p>  In relation to the rent supplement scheme administered by this Department, over 4,700 claims have been awarded to date in 2015.  Officers administering the scheme will continue to provide for flexibility in assessing customers' accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.  The Department is also working with Threshold's Tenancy Sustainment service in the Dublin and Cork city areas where supply is most acute.  The primary objective of these initiatives is to ensure a speedy intervention for families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy through rising rents.</p>  <p>  I am keeping this matter under review and am satisfied that this flexible approach is the appropriate response at this time which has assisted in excess of 1,500 rent supplement recipients to retain their rented accommodation through increased rent limits.</p></reply>

In the case of jobseeker's allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker's allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person's income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker's allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker's allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p>  <p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.</p>  <p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker's allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker's allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker's benefit. </p>  <p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points. </p>  <p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  The Actuarial Review found that the effective annual rate of contributions needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%. </p>  <p>  My colleagues in Government and I will continue to reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

It is a universal payment paid in respect of all qualified children up to the age of 16 years, or to the age of 18 who are in full-time education or who have a disability.  It is paid to over 615,000 families in respect of almost 1.2 million children, at a cost of &euro;1.9 billion.</p>  <p>  School attendance up to the age of 16 years is a statutory requirement under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000.</p>  <p>  Consequently, all recipients of child benefit are legally required to attend school up to this age.  There is a national monitoring system for statutory school attendance via the National Educational Welfare Board, which is now part of Tusla, the child and family agency.  Policy responsibility for school attendance rests with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p>  <p>  For children over 16 years and less than 18 years, the continued payment of child benefit is dependent on the children attending school for these two years.  Parents with children aged 16 and 17 years must return a form confirming school attendance, signed by their school, to the Department of Social Protection on an annual basis.  </p>  <p>  If the Deputy has specific concerns about school absenteeism, the competent authorities to address these are the National Educational Welfare Board/Child and Family Agency. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied with the existing steps that require children in receipt of child benefit to attend school up to 16 and to 18 years of age under both education and social protection policies.</p></reply>

For that reason, the Department in conjunction with the D/CYA, introduced a range of measures in Budgets 2013 and 2014 to assist lone parents to enter or re-join the workforce &ndash; namely the after-school child care scheme and the community employment childcare programme.  Both of these schemes were funded by my Department from savings from the child benefit scheme and are part of the 25,000 subsidised childcare places which the D/CYA fund for low income parents each year.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015 I introduced increases to the child benefit rate, as well as the new back to work family dividend (BTWFD), both of which are designed to provide some additional financial assistance to parents.</p>  <p>  The D/CYA has also established an inter-Departmental group at senior level in order to carry out an economic and cost-benefit analysis of policies and future options for increasing the supply, accessibility, and affordability of quality child care, including early years and  school-age care.

It provides employers with two levels of payment - &euro;7,500 or &euro;10,000 over two years - paid in monthly instalments provided the employment is maintained.  The rate of payment depends on the length of time the person is unemployed.  At the end of March 2014, the Department made payments of just over &euro;1.69 million to 3,279 employers in respect of 4,424 employees.</p>  <p>  The Department undertook a review of the pilot phase of JobsPlus covering the period July 2013 to June 2014.  The key conclusions of the review was that the aim of putting in place an easily identifiable and user friendly scheme targeted at employers had been achieved.  The Department identified that, during the pilot period, some 9,700 jobseekers has checked their eligibility for JobsPlus and that a greater proportion of jobseekers more than 24 months on the live register benefitted in this period, contrary to expectation prior to launch.  The initial target of 2,500 supported positions had been exceeded at the end of June 2014 with the number of positions registered by employers exceeding 4,000 during the pilot phase.  The review noted that the average level of subsidy paid at the end of June amounted to just over &euro;373.78 per employee per month and that there was a net benefit to the Exchequer from each employee maintained in employment.</p>  <p>  The Department is now updating the review to cover the first 18 months of operations of JobsPlus, in line with commitments in Pathways to Work.

The impact of increasing limits will yield only a very marginal increase in available supply for rent supplement recipients, if at all, with the only certainty that raising limits will increase costs disproportionately for the Exchequer with  little or no new housing available.</p>  <p>  The Department will instead continue to provide for flexibility in assessing customers' accommodation needs through the National Tenancy Sustainment Framework.

However, a small minority is not and a range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.</p><p>Since 2011 there has been a number of significant measures undertaken which have enhanced the prevention and detection of social welfare fraud.  These measures are being progressed under the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018.  The Strategy builds on the approaches that had been successfully rolled out over the past couple of years.  These include the continued roll-out of the Public Services Card, enhanced data sharing with other Government Departments and Agencies and a number of significant legislative measures.</p><p>The Department recognises that fraud investigation and control can be assisted through the application of a range of new technologies.  In this context, the Department has recently commenced a project utilising analytics technology to predict which claims are more likely to be fraudulent.  When this technology is in place, it will enable the Department to target higher risk cases for investigation and to do so faster.  </p><p>In addition, since early Dec 2014, 20 Garda&iacute; have been seconded to the Department's Special Investigation Unit.  These officers will ensure a greater presence on the ground and will increase the investigative capacity and expertise of the Department to prevent, detect and deter social welfare fraud. </p><p>The emphasis continues to be on preventing fraud and error from entering the system in the first place.  However, where fraud is discovered it is important that there are appropriate sanctions in place.  In this regard, the Department is proactively targeting persons with overpayments to ensure all persons who have a social welfare overpayment are making a contribution towards the repayment of the debt outstanding.  A number of legislative provisions have been introduced to strengthen the Department's capacity to recover debt and, in addition, a new debt management system went live in November 2014.  It is also the Department's policy to consider for prosecution cases of fraud against the social welfare system.</p><p>The value of the Department's control work is measured in terms of control savings.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities and are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  They refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work, social welfare expenditure would increase by this amount over time.  </p><p>The table provides the details of the control savings achieved and the number of control reviews undertaken for the past 5 years:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Achieved 2010 &euro;m</th><th>Achieved 2011 &euro;m</th><th>Achieved 2012 &euro;m</th><th>Achieved 2013 &euro;m</th><th>Achieved 2014 &euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>SAVINGS  </td><td>&euro;483.20</td><td>&euro;645.57</td><td>&euro;669.69</td><td>&euro;631.66</td><td>&euro;504.62</td></tr><tr><td>REVIEWS </td><td>929,383</td><td>982,580</td><td>1,196,184 </td><td>1,105,197 </td><td>1,148,354</td></tr></table></p><p>The outcomes demonstrate that the Department's more intense control focus in recent years is having a positive impact on the level of fraud and error in the social welfare system. </p><p>Fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced in recent years and are subject to continuing review.  Overall, I believe that this is resulting in less opportunity to commit fraud and less chance of claims being in payment at an incorrect rate through fraud or error.</p></reply>

These supports play an important role in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  The Department provides a range of specific employment-related supports for people with disabilities.  These supports include the wage subsidy scheme (WSS), the EmployAbility (supported employment) service, the reasonable accommodation fund for the employment of people with disabilities and the disability awareness training scheme.  For those who are in receipt of invalidity pension or illness benefit (for at least six months) and who feel they now have some capacity for work, the partial capacity benefit (PCB) scheme allows them to work and retain a portion of their social welfare payment. </p>  <p>  In addition, now that the Intreo service is established, the Department is providing full activation support to people with disabilities who wish to avail of the service, initially, in ten locations.  It is planned to expand the number of locations over time based on operational experience, but any person with a disability is at all times free to contact the Intreo service. </p>  <p>  Unlike job-seekers where participation in activation measures through the Intreo service is mandatory, in the case of persons in receipt of disability/illness support payments, engagement with the Intreo service is on a voluntary basis.  The Department is also currently considering how people with disabilities might best be included in the Momentum programme. </p>  <p>  Therefore, taking account of the above I do not believe that persons with disabilities are discriminated against when they seek activation and employment opportunities on a par with their non-disabled peers.</p></reply>

Since publication, a range of measures have been taken to deliver on the report's recommendations and work is ongoing in this regard.  For example, in line with the recommendation that the implementation of the Consumer Protection Code should be monitored, the Central Bank has undertaken a number of themed reviews aimed at ensuring this is the case.  This includes a recently published review of annual pension statements which found the vast majority of firms were in compliance with the code.  Where the Bank identified a small number of firms where the format of annual statements were not as required, those concerned were required to submit implementation timelines for full compliance.</p>  <p>  In parallel, my Department is involved in complementary EU negotiations on a revision of the IORPs (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision) Directive which lays down basic requirements for occupational pensions.  It is anticipated that the final provisions will result in improvements in the areas of transparency, trustee competencies and scheme governance and which will promote competitiveness in charging structures.</p>  <p>  Under the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 the Pensions Board was restructured into the Pensions Authority and the Pensions Council.  The purpose of the Pensions Council is to provide advice on pensions and to give a much stronger prominence to consumer concerns.  I have previously highlighted that there a number of specific matters which I want the Council to focus on and this includes the area of pension charges which, following its recent establishment, the Council has now begun to consider.</p></reply>

While work is underway exploring how to optimise resources and governance arrangements to the greatest extent possible, I can also assure the Deputy that there will be no diminution of locally-provided services to the public, no closure of service locations, and no staff redundancies.  In fact, the aim of this exploration is to ensure that any efficiencies and savings achieved in governance arrangements can be used to expand and enhance local service delivery.</p>  <p>  The Citizens Information Board (CIB) is the statutory body responsible for providing information, advice (including money and budgeting advice service) and advocacy services on a wide range of public and social services.  CIB delivers on this remit through a network of delivery partners which includes 51 local Money Advice and Budgeting Services (MABS) and 42 local Citizens Information Services (CIS).  In 2015 the CIB has been allocated a budget of &euro;46m of which some &euro;17.9 million is allocated to the MABS network of companies.</p>  <p>  There are over 600 permanent staff, approximately 200 scheme workers and an estimated 2,000 volunteers working for the 93 independent companies in the network (51 MABS and 42 CISs).  Each of these companies has a separate voluntary Board of Management, comprising an average of over 9 members per Board resulting in a governance structure of over 800 people.  The maintenance of such an unwieldy company and Board structure is no longer sustainable from an organisational or governance perspective and the resource effort required could otherwise be directed towards improved service delivery to citizens.  Therefore, as part of the implementation of its Strategic Plan 2012-2015, CIB commissioned a feasibility study to identify options for dealing with this issue through greater organisational consolidation and/or integration of its delivery partners.  This work was carried out by a company called Pathfinder and overseen by a Steering Group, comprising national representatives from MABS staff and Boards, Citizens Information Services staff and Boards, and staff from the Citizens Information Board.  The work included extensive and comprehensive consultation with all stakeholders, including representatives of CIB's delivery partner services (MABS and CIS) at local level.  It identified a number of options for consideration.  Following on from this, the Board of CIB agreed to the establishment of a Design Group tasked with outlining and recommending possible new structural models.  The Design Group includes members of the voluntary boards and staff of a number of the MABS and CIS services, together with representation from CIB management.  Submissions were sought by CIB from the representatives of Boards and staff of MABS and CIS, to inform the deliberations of the Design Group.</p>  <p>  The Design Group recently furnished a progress report on its deliberations to the CIB executive, which in turn communicated an update to its network of service delivery partners.  The Design Group has identified, as an option for consideration by the Board of CIB in due course, that the 51 Boards of MABS companies and the 42 Boards of CIS companies could be consolidated across six (6) regions, resulting in six (6) independent MABS companies and Boards, and six (6) independent CIS companies and Boards, all reporting to the board of CIB.  However, it is important to note that any such consolidation would be at the Board level only.  All existing MABS offices would remain unaffected. Local service delivery and personnel would not be impacted and would continue as before.

The Department introduced a new CE Childcare Strand at the beginning of 2013 under which there is a dedicated childcare educational programme at FETAC Level 5 for CE participants who work directly with children.  This programme has led to the re-structuring of CE childcare provision which will improve the career path for participants who wish to pursue a career in childcare.  These improvements provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community childcare.  The FETAC Major 5 Award is the entry level requirement to work as a basic practitioner in childcare.</p>  <p>  Due to legislative changes regarding childcare provision, due to come into effect from September 2015, the Department is currently seeking clarification from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the status of CE participants in these settings.

I am also happy that the report, while making a number of recommendations for change, acknowledges that JobBridge &ldquo;has been of benefit to many&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  As the report acknowledges, the scheme was introduced in 2011 when the country was in the middle of the worst recession in living memory: a Live Register of nearly 460,000 and trending towards 500,000; unacceptably high levels of emigration; and negative economic growth. </p>  <p>  In this context the purpose of JobBridge was twofold &ndash; to help jobseekers break the vicious cycle where they cannot get a job without experience but they cannot get experience without a job, and to encourage and support employers to take on staff from the live register in a situation where access to working capital was very constrained.</p>  <p>  Since its launch JobBridge has provided over 38,500 unemployed people with the opportunity to gain valuable work experience and over 16,000 host organisations &ndash; mainly SMEs to expand capacity.  It is not surprising therefore that Dr Murphy's report acknowledges that &ldquo;the programme has been of benefit to many&rdquo; and that the largest independent evaluation of the scheme (by Indecon) indicated that 6 out of 10 participants progressed into employment. </p>  <p>  The Impact report, which is based on a small number of interviews with interested parties together with a review of relevant literature, makes a number of recommendations with regard to the future development of State supported internships.  Many of these recommendations are already incorporated into the terms of the existing scheme (e.g. relating to written agreements, duration of internships, non-compulsion, monitoring).  Other recommendations relate to the introduction of different versions of state-supported internships to cater for different types of Jobseekers, payment rates for internships, social insurance status of interns and evaluation/value for money assessment of the scheme.</p>  <p>  With regard to this latter recommendation the Department will during 2015 commission a second independent evaluation of JobBridge using econometric techniques to provide evidence based  insights into the effectiveness or otherwise of the scheme.  The other observations and recommendations of the Impact report will be considered in the context of the findings of this evaluation.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were first introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes.</p>  <p>   To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must -</p>  <p>- have at least 520 paid contributions, and</p>  <p>- satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages). </p>  <p>  The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person's contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker's scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC.  The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied.  These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. </p>  <p>  The Government has no plans to backdate this scheme prior to 1994 as it was previously estimated that this could cost up to approximately &euro;160 million annually.  In any event, under the current rules, the costs of the scheme are expected to increase in the coming years due to the increase in female employment rates since 1994. </p>  <p>  For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support.  If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).</p></reply>

The Government is committed to delivering improved living standards to ensure that this recovery is felt by all families.  These recent measures taken should be reflected in future poverty statistics.</p>  <p>  Social transfers have provided a hugely important buffer in reducing poverty.  Expenditure on the scheme is estimated at &euro;607million in 2015 with almost 70,000 recipients.  However, despite significant investment in the past, lone parents remain particularly at risk of poverty.</p>  <p>  The one parent family payment (OFP) was a passive scheme with limited engagement by the State with recipients.  For many lone parents this has meant long-term social welfare dependency and associated poverty for them and their families.</p>  <p>  In 2004, OFP was payable until the youngest child turned 18 or 22 if they were in full time education.  Yet despite this support lone parents were over four-and-a-half times more at risk of consistent poverty than the general population.  This is why we need to reform the scheme. </p>  <p>  The reforms provide lone parents with improved access to the Department's range of Intreo services, which will allow them to create a personal development plan.  Access to these supports is imperative for lone parents, to ensure that their prospects of securing employment and financial independence are improved.  Any reversal of these reforms would delay this critical interaction and would potentially increase lone parent's distance from the labour market. </p>  <p>  I therefore have no plans to reverse the OFP reforms.</p></reply>

However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the Ballymun Youth Guarantee (BYG) pilot project was to test key elements to inform the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee.  It built upon recent broader reforms, such as enhanced employer engagement and earlier and more intensive engagement with young jobseekers through Intreo.</p>  <p>  The project officially finished on the 31st December 2015.  It will take time to see whether the opportunities taken up by young people through the BYG project have had a positive impact in terms of improved employment and other outcomes.  The local Intreo office continues to work with participants (through the Ballymun Job Centre Guidance Counsellors) to progress them towards employment opportunities that continue to emerge as the economy recovers.  It is recognised that the shortage of private sector job opportunities for young people (and older people) in Ballymun was a significant issue during the course of the project.</p>  <p>  It is clear that the project has been highly successful in building the participants' confidence and ability to move towards employment.  From the perspectives of both the participants and the staff involved in the delivery of the service, the BYG approach has contributed towards the development of career identities, improved self-esteem and human and social capital.</p></reply>

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of  right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life, or may not be in a position to benefit from one or more such payment.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  Similarly, there will be many contributors who would not require coverage for Maternity Benefit, but who nevertheless continue to be levied PRSI at the full rate during their working years.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners etc. could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit at half-rate at the same time.</p>  <p>  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  </p>  <p>  The social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  In the context of the difficult fiscal environment in recent years and the Government's commitment to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients, the concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker's Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensions etc. was discontinued from January 2012.</p>  <p>  It is realistic and prudent to maintain the underlying principle of entitlement to only one payment at any one time, that is, one person, one payment.  To do otherwise could potentially involve very significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long-term. </p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, published in 2012 found that Fund has a strong redistributive nature.  This is demonstrated by the fact that those on lower incomes fare considerably better than those on higher incomes and the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.</p></reply>

Farm assist recipients retain the advantages of the jobseeker's allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.  The 2015 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure this year on the farm assist scheme of almost &euro;89 million in respect of an estimated 9,440 recipients, down from 9,809 for 2014.</p>  <p>  All recipients of farm assist have benefitted from the Christmas Bonus in December, 2014 and all recipients with children are benefiting from the increase in child benefit announced in Budget 2015.</p>  <p>  Changes introduced in Budgets 2012 and 2013 have brought farm assist into closer alignment with the jobseeker's allowance scheme's treatment of self-employed persons.</p>  <p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.  Also any farmer experiencing lower levels of income can ask for a review of the means applying to their claim.</p></reply>

The purpose of this payment is to assist these households with their energy costs.  The allowance represents a contribution towards the energy costs of a household.  It is not intended to meet those costs in full. Only one allowance is paid per household.</p>  <p>  My Department also pays an electricity or gas allowance as part of the household benefits package to 415,000 customers, at an estimated cost of &euro;227 million in 2015. </p>  <p>  This compares favourably with the winter fuel payment for the elderly in Northern Ireland which ranges from &pound;100 (&euro;126) to &pound;300 (&euro;379) per year depending on age and household composition.  There is no equivalent in Northern Ireland to the free electricity allowance. </p>  <p>  The Government's affordable energy strategy &ldquo;Warmer Homes&rdquo; indicated that the best measure to address energy poverty is to continue to improve the thermal efficiency of people's homes.  The &ldquo;better energy warmer homes&rdquo; scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households that are vulnerable to energy poverty at no charge to the householder.  Since 2000, when the scheme began, over 105,000 homes around the country have received energy efficiency measures under the warmer homes scheme, with a total spend of over &euro;116 million.</p></reply>

The resolution is grounded in the key principles that transgender people should be protected from discrimination and enabled to have their preferred gender formally recognised under law.  The approach being taken in Ireland is, in my view, consistent with those key principles.</p>  <p>  The Equality Acts prohibit discrimination in the areas of employment and the provision of goods and services on nine grounds including gender.  The Equality Tribunal has found that discrimination on the basis of transgender status amounts to a breach of rights under the legislation as it is encompassed by the ground of gender.  </p>  <p>  The Gender Recognition Bill 2014, once it is enacted, will provide that transgender people will be enabled to have their preferred gender recognised by the State for all purposes.  If the referendum on marriage equality is approved by the electorate, the Government has already stated its intention to remove the requirement from the Gender Recognition Bill that a person seeking a gender recognition certificate be single. </p>  <p>  It is my intention and that of the T&aacute;naiste that this important legislation will be passed this year.</p></reply>

The first is the statutory urban school meals scheme, operated by local authorities and part-financed by the Department.  The second is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects. There are currently some 2,600 food clubs in operation under the scheme of which approximately 650 are breakfast clubs. Details of the breakfast clubs and associated costs for each of the last five years are being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p>  <p>  The school meals programme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement by children especially those from the most disadvantaged background. Funding the provision of food services in schools guarantees on-going positive returns on a public investment in the health and educational performance of future generations. There is a particular focus on the provision of breakfast clubs within the programme which provide very positive outcomes for vulnerable children in terms of their school attendance, punctuality and energy levels. </p>  <p>  Priority for funding under the scheme is given to DEIS schools for identified disadvantaged pupils and is not restricted to those in junior classes. In recognition of the benefits that the scheme provides and despite severe pressure on the social protection budget, the Government allocated an additional &euro;2 million for the school meals programme in 2015, providing a total allocation of &euro;39 million. It should be noted that the provision for the scheme was also increased by &euro;2 million as part of Budget 2013 which was used to extend the scheme to some 100 additional DEIS and special schools benefitting over 9,800 additional children. </p>  <p>  Facilities required for the provision of a breakfast club are primarily determined by the type of service provided by an individual school.

In summary any income, with some exceptions, belonging to the person and his/her spouse, partner or cohabitant is assessable as means for disability allowance purposes. It is the nature of means tested schemes that there is no entitlement to a payment once means exceed a given amount. There is no discretion allowed as deciding officers are obliged to follow the legislation when assessing means.</p>  <p>  DA scheme rules allow for a disregard of the first &euro;50,000 of a person's means from capital, which is the most generous capital disregard of the Department's working age schemes.  The next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per week per 000; the next &euro;10,000 at &euro;2 per week per 000 and the remainder of capital (in excess of &euro;70,000) is assessed at &euro;4 per week per 000.</p></reply>

There has been a steady growth both in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure as set out in the table.  </p><p>Expenditure in 2014 on the FIS scheme was &euro;297.7 million (provisional), an increase of  &euro;36 million on 2013.  Estimated expenditure on FIS in 2015 is approx. &euro;349 million.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Recipients Families</th><th>Recipients Children</th><th>Expenditure  (&euro; Millions)</th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>28,875</td><td>65,281</td><td>204.5</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32,310</td><td>73,238</td><td>223.6</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>44,160</td><td>97,858</td><td>261.5</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>50,306</td><td>111,583</td><td>297.7*</td></tr></table>*provisional</p><p>The Department avails of every opportunity in its engagement with employers and jobseekers to build awareness of the availability of FIS and how this payment may benefit potential employees with children.  The increasing numbers of families in receipt of FIS is testament to the effectiveness of the Department's information strategy for the scheme and the significant improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers. </p><p>The Department's web site www.welfare.ie has full information on the FIS scheme and provides typical family scenarios to aid understanding and provide comparisons.  This information is also available in all the Department local offices, citizens information centres and information offices.  </p><p>In addition a series of road-shows were held around the country designed to inform employers about the wide range of employment support services provided by the Department, including FIS.  Case officers in each locality use FIS as an incentive to move people from the live register to employment.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department's Benefit of Work ready reckoner gives an indication of the difference between a person's potential in-work payment, including FIS, and current out-of-work payments.  </p><p>The Department has also launched a poster campaign in its Intreo centres and local offices in Mid-Leinster and North Dublin to further promote FIS. This campaign will be rolled out to all offices nationwide during 2015. </p><p>The Department has also recently been in touch with Trade Unions representing in excess of 260,000 employees (in both the Public and Private Sector) and provided them with an article on FIS for inclusion in their upcoming publications for members.  This article explains in detail the qualification conditions for the scheme and gives relevant supporting examples of families that could qualify.</p><p>In conclusion, I am satisfied that the FIS scheme is being  promoted and evidence shows that it is fulfilling its role in assisting employees to take up employment opportunities and to remain at work.</p></reply>

A person may qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. The housing need criteria, as prescribed in the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, include a household that has a mortgage that is deemed to be unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process. In addition to the housing need requirement there are a number of other conditions that a person must satisfy in order to be eligible for rent supplement. I can assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to ensure that the necessary funding for the scheme is in place. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that where the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is in operation, administered by the housing authorities, customers requiring social housing support would be accommodated under HAP rather than rent supplement. HAP is currently being administered in seven local authority areas and will be rolled out to further local authority areas during the year. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-06a.222.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600052#WRC03600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 81 and 120 together. </p>  <p>  The rent supplement scheme provides support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source. There are approximately 70,000 rent supplement recipients, of which over 3,600 are in Kildare, for which the Government has provided a total of over &euro;298 million for in 2015. Statistics in relation to persons in receipt of rent supplement in lieu of local authority housing are not available.</p>  <p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is generally made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. The information requested in relation to arrears is not available.  It is open to any landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement may be suspended and the matter investigated. </p>  <p>  Any person who is dissatisfied with a decision on their rent supplement claim, including the decision regarding an overpayment, may appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The appeal must be in writing and within 21 days of the date they were notified of the decision on their claim. The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p>  <p>  The primary responsibility for a disclosure of a change of means rests with the social welfare recipient. Notwithstanding this, there is ongoing dialogue between staff in the community welfare service and the housing authorities to ensure that a person's accommodation needs are appropriately addressed and, where necessary, the provision of relevant information. </p>  <p>  The Department's strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system which will provide for a number of positive improvements. New applicants with long term housing needs will be considered under HAP in these local authority areas rather than rent supplement. As part of the implementation of HAP, the Department is working closely with the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), on behalf of the local authorities, to agree data sharing protocols and to develop a new technical platform. </p></reply>

This group is led by the D/CYA and includes representatives from a number of Departments including the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The Government's Spring Economic Statement also acknowledges that a successful childcare policy helps people make the transition from welfare to employment.  The interdepartmental group's report will be a key input in determining the future of childcare provision in Ireland. </p></reply>

The Universal Retirement Savings Group (URSG) has been established to consider the constituent factors involved in constructing an efficient and effective universal retirement savings system and to bring forward a recommendation in the form of a roadmap and estimated timeline for introduction. </p>  <p>  Membership of the URSG does not include industry/employer representatives with a commercial interest.  Rather it consists of senior officials from a range of key Government departments and those public bodies with a particular policy responsibility and expertise in the area.  Membership also includes international representatives from the UK's Department for Work and Pensions and the OECD who bring significant expertise in designing, delivering and assessing supplementary pension systems.  </p>  <p>  Development of a universal supplementary pension scheme would be the fundamental reform of pensions policy in a generation.  As such, it is appropriate that the URSG consult with all parties with an interest and expertise in this area.  In undertaking specific or specialised areas of its work programme the Group may engage with, and invite submissions from, pension's experts external to the Group.  This will include a diverse range of interests including representatives of employers, trade unions, consumer/interest groups and those from the pensions industry. </p></reply>

This year, the Department of Social Protection will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions, i.e., 34.4% of all welfare expenditure, and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014.  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible. Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  The most recent change in the core rate of State pensions was in Budget 2009, when the State pension contributory was increased by 3.1% to &euro;230.30, and the non-contributory pension by 3.3% to &euro;219.00.  Both of these are the maximum personal rates, and there are increases for dependant adults which attracted similar increases at that time. </p>  <p>  Core pension rates were not reduced in the period since then, despite significant pressures on Exchequer spending, and a period of significant deflation which has protected those increases in real terms from erosion by inflation.  This has had the effect of protecting older people from poverty, and all CSO figures show that those over 65 are significantly less likely to be at risk of poverty or deprivation than those aged under 65. </p>  <p>  The recovery has also allowed some leeway to increase spending in targeted areas, which is why I was able to restore a partial Christmas bonus last month, benefitting over 575,000 pensioners and 1.23 million welfare recipients in total.  I also increased payments for certain pensioners by increasing the rate of the Living Alone Allowance in Budget 2015 to &euro;9.00. This increases the maximum personal rate of the State non-contributory pension for a qualified person living alone to &euro;228 per week, and the maximum rate for the State contributory pension to &euro;239.30, when both the basic pension and the allowance are taken into account. </p>  <p>  I have no plans at this time to increase the rate of pensions. Any decision to increase the rates would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations.</p></reply>

It is acknowledged that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I approved measures to facilitate engagement between the trustees of a pension scheme and groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members.  I signed the Occupational Pensions Schemes (Section 50 and 50B) (Amendments) Regulations, 2015 and approved Pensions Authority guidance to facilitate this change. </p>  <p>  The change to regulations will require the Pensions Authority to notify groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members in situations where the Pensions Authority is proposing to issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B.  This requirement will afford the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the Pensions Authority in relation to such proposals.  The Regulations also give the representative group the right to appeal such a direction by the Pensions Authority to the High Court on a point of law. </p>  <p>  I also approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority on this matter. This change to guidance will require the trustees of a pension scheme to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members of proposals by the trustees of a defined benefit pension scheme to issue a direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to restructure scheme benefits.  This requirement will afford the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of a pension scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits. </p>  <p>  These changes will facilitate engagement between groups representing the interests of pensioner and deferred scheme members and the Pension Authority and the trustees of a pension scheme. </p>  <p>  I would expect that any group that is recognised for the purposes of collective representation with the trustees of a pension scheme could seek to engage voluntarily with the enterprise involved in talks or trade dispute with employees.</p></reply>

Before a PPS Number can be allocated, the person making the application must provide evidence of identity and demonstrate a valid reason for the application.  PPS Numbers are issued by the Department following checks on an individual&rsquo;s identity.  In addition, acceptable evidence of address must be provided.  The process of allocating a PPS Number includes the capture of a photograph and signature.  Photographs captured are compared with other photographs previously captured in order to detect any possible duplicates.  The requirements are the same for all persons regardless of nationality, i.e., whether EU citizens or not.</p>  <p>  When a person is refused the allocation of a PPS Number, it is because s/he failed to provide acceptable evidence of identity or address, and/or to demonstrate a valid reason for seeking the Number. </p>  <p>  I understand the Department has contacted the Deputy&rsquo;s office and requested details of the specific cases that have led to this question.

These outlets included large stores, large low cost stores, medium sized stores and convenience stores. </p>  <p>  The research showed that the average costs across all of the retail outlets of the diets supplemented under the scheme can be met from within one third of the minimum personal rate of social welfare payment, i.e. the SWA rate of &euro;186 per week.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  This is particularly important given the challenge that increased longevity is posing for the future sustainability of the State pension.  Consequently, when assessing whether an individual is entitled to a State pension, and to ensure that they can maximise such entitlement, all contributions (paid or credited) from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account. </p>  <p>  The State assists those with caring roles to qualify for a State pension (contributory).  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  Given the valuable nature of the State pension (contributory), those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for that scheme, and have at least 520 paid contributions over the course of their working lives. </p>  <p>  However, for those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. If someone has been a carer for nearly all of their adult life and has paid little or no PRSI, they may qualify for a means tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum personal rate for which is &euro;219, which amounts to just over 95% of the maximum rate of the State pension (contributory).  Alternatively, if their spouse or civil partner is in receipt of a State pension (contributory) they may instead qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult of up to &euro;206.30, which is just under 90% of the maximum personal rate of the State pension (contributory).</p></reply>

In 2012 the average processing time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  Further improvements were achieved in 2013, when the average appeal processing time reduced to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.  In 2014 the average appeal processing time reduced to 28.6 weeks for an oral hearing and 21.1 weeks for a summary decision.  Processing times continue to improve in 2015 as the current average processing time for an oral hearing is now 25.6 weeks and 18.2 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The reduction in processing times reflects the significant resources which have been invested in the Social Welfare Appeals Office over the last number of years.  </p><p>In addition the Department has undertaken a process of reform in many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing the time taken to respond to requests for submissions in relation to appeals. Appeal processing times are kept under continual review in the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</p><p>In addition to the improvement in processing times, these measures have also led to a significant reduction in the number of appeals on hand from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 9,537 at 1<sup>st</sup>May 2015.</p><p>Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.

However, in some cases, where there is clearly nothing to be gained from an oral hearing, for example when a decision relates to a question of social insurance contributions or means which is not disputed, the Appeals Officer may decide the appeal on a summary basis.</p>  <p>  As reported in the 2014 Annual Report of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, 24,081 appeals were finalised by appeals officers in 2014, and of these  7,523 (31.2%) appeals were decided following an oral hearing.  Of these 4,868 (64.7%) had a successful outcome for the appellant while 2,655 (35.3%) were disallowed.  16,558 (68.8%) appeals were decided by summary decision and of these 7,462 (45.1%) had a successful outcome for the appellant.</p>  <p>  Of the 6,456 appeals decided by appeals officers to date in 2015, 2,316 (35.87%) appeals were decided following an oral hearing.

The reasons for this will include the level of complexity of the issues, conflicts in the evidence, or the need for elaboration by the appellant on the grounds of appeal.</p></reply>

However, despite considerable investment, the scheme has not succeeded in preventing lone parents from being significantly more at risk of consistent poverty than the population as a whole.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the phased OFP scheme age change reforms that were introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012, is to reduce long-term social welfare dependency and poverty among lone parents, and to ensure that they have improved access to the Department's range of education, training, and employment support programmes, in order to assist them in securing employment and financial independence.</p>  <p>  The final phase of the OFP scheme age change reforms will take place on 2 July, 2015, when the maximum age limit of the youngest child at which an OFP recipient's payment ceases will be reduced to 7 years for all recipients.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 29,400 OFP recipients will transition from the scheme on that day.  These customers will be supported by the Department to transition to an alternative income support payment &ndash; as appropriate.  </p>  <p>  Approximately 20,000 affected lone parents will experience no income changes or will gain after the transition.  The gain for individuals in this instance will be in the range of &euro;10 to &euro;150 per week, depending on their level of earnings and, also, on the number of children that they have.</p>  <p>  The remaining lone parents are in employment.  Approximately 6,000 of these will have an immediate incentive to increase the number of hours that they work to 19 in order to claim the family income supplement (FIS) payment and the new back to work family (BTWFD) dividend.

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.</p><p>However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by jobseekers and young jobseekers in particular. This is the rationale behind the Government's Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>The Youth Guarantee sets a medium-term objective of ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment within four months of becoming unemployed. The main plank of the guarantee is assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs. For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for. Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training. Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p><p>Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, youth unemployment continues to fall (with a rate of 21.1% in March 2015 estimated by Eurostat, as compared to 25.9% in March 2014 and a peak of over 30% in 2012).</p><p>Pathways to Work 2014 targets with respect to the Youth Guarantee have largely been achieved. In addition it the following targets in Pathways to Work 2015 have been or are expected to be met:</p><p>- Roll out the First Steps developmental internships programme for 1500 &ndash; 2000 young people.</p><p>- Introduce JobsPlus for Youth</p><p>- Allocate 1,000 places on the T&uacute;s scheme to young people.  </p><p>- Introduce a pilot programme to support young unemployed people to take up opportunities under schemes such as Your First EURES Job.  </p><p>- Ring-fence a minimum of 2,000 training places for under-25s by the Department of Education and Skills, under a follow-up to the Momentum programme.  </p><p>I am satisfied these measures, together with the continuing economic recovery, are having a positive and beneficial impact on young people, and will enable the young unemployed to avail of employment opportunities now and into the future.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people. </p>  <p>  In addition, there is a wide range of employment services, along with programmes of training and education, work experience, and recruitments supports that address the particular labour market issues facing young people. These are set out in detail in Ireland's implementation plan for the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee, and involve other Departments &ndash; most notably the Department of Education and Skills &ndash; as well as the Department of Social Protection. </p>  <p>  In support of the recommendation for a Youth Guarantee, the EU council agreed that a total of &euro;6bn would be earmarked within EU funds to support approved Youth Employment Initiative projects over the course of the seven year Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) 2014-2020. This &euro;6bn comprises &euro;3bn from within the existing European Social Fund (ESF) and an additional &euro;3bn in the form of Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) funding. </p>  <p>  The EU Institutions have now agreed that YEI funding should be reserved for use in those regions where youth unemployment levels exceeded 25% during the reference year of 2012 (since extended to include regions where youth unemployment was over 20% in 2012 in Member States where youth unemployment had risen by more than 30% over the previous year). Both regions within Ireland satisfy the original 25% threshold. Ireland's allocation is &euro;68.14 million.</p>  <p>  The YEI fund is to be allocated to approved projects on a proportional basis. Expenditure on ESF actions will have to be matched by national funds, in accordance with normal structural funds rules. Member States can then access a share of the additional &euro;3 billion. Where ESF-supported projects are eligible for YEI as well, the YEI funding will be equal to and additional to the ESF support.</p>  <p>In 2014 alone, the costs for implementing the programmes for the young unemployed in Ireland's Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan were &euro;336 million, or &euro;528 million if the costs of PLC courses and the apprenticeship system are included. Similar costs are likely be incurred, on an annual basis. These costs, in the first instance, are borne by the Irish Exchequer.  It is anticipated that a sufficient share of this expenditure will meet the relevant  eligibility criteria, to allow a full draw-down of Ireland's YEI allocation and the related ESF funding.</p></reply>

From an Irish tax perspective, the position is that if the Standard Life return of value payment is received as income by an Irish resident taxpayer it will be taxed under Income Tax rules. If it is received as capital it will be taxed under the Capital Gains Tax rules. </p>  <p>  In last year's Finance Act, I included provisions allowing for a measure of tax relief to the many thousands of Irish shareholders with a small shareholding in Vodafone plc who inadvertently found themselves subject to an unintended liability to income tax, PRSI and USC rather than a nil capital gains tax liability arising from a return of value payment from that company. I did this because the shareholding of very many of those individuals arose originally from their investment in Eircom plc and, as a result of which investment, they continue to carry capital losses. I considered, given the particular background in this case, that to leave those shareholders with income tax and other liabilities on foot of a decision they inadvertently made or did not make at all would have been inequitable.  This particular background is not a feature of the Standard Life return of value case.</p>  <p>  The fact that notifications of the options made by individuals in the Vodafone case last year were delayed in the post beyond the deadline date in that case or were otherwise not dealt with by the company as shareholders would have wished were not factors in my decision to provide the relief, the reason for which I have outlined above.</p>  <p>  I will continue to be advised by my officials, in liaison with the Revenue Commissioners, in relation to the issues raised by the Deputy in the case of the Standard Life return of value. However I am not convinced of the appropriateness of the State, as a matter of practice, addressing by way of legislation the difficulties of shareholders in commercial public companies arising from a failure either to make decisions in relation to their commercial investments, the timely communication of decisions or arising from problems caused by the administrative arrangements put in place by those commercial companies. </p></reply>

When computing its profits for an accounting period, any company is entitled to claim capital allowances in respect of the wear and tear on plant and machinery owned by it and in use for the purposes of its trade at the end of that accounting period. In the case of an aircraft leasing company, this means that the company could claim a capital allowance in respect of the cost of acquiring the aircraft. The allowance is granted over a period of 8 years at a rate of 12.5% per annum.</p><p><b>Stamp Duty</b></p><p>The sale, transfer or other disposition of an aircraft is exempt from Stamp Duty as is the issue, transfer or redemption of an &quot;Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate&quot;. These certificates are a mechanism by which leasing companies raise the necessary finance to acquire aircraft for their leasing fleet.</p><p><b>VAT</b></p><p>Irish VAT is not charged on lease payments in respect of an aircraft where the aircraft is effectively used wholly outside the EU. The leasing of aircraft to qualifying international airlines is subject to VAT at the zero rate. </p><p><b>Cost to the Exchequer</b></p><p>There is no overall costing of the value of the Stamp Duty exemption referred to above. The sector is in a net repayment position in respect of VAT as a result of the zero rating of services.  <b></b></p><p><b>Tax Payments from the aircraft leasing sector 2005 to 2014</b><table><tr><th></th><th>VAT*</th><th>Employer's PAYE</th><th>Income Tax</th><th>Corporation Tax</th><th>Capital Gains Tax</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>-6</td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>-10</td><td>12</td><td>0</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>-13</td><td>16</td><td>1</td><td>27</td><td>1</td><td>32</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>-11</td><td>24</td><td>0</td><td>22</td><td>0</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>-19</td><td>21</td><td>0</td><td>19</td><td>0</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>-16</td><td>25</td><td>0</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>-19</td><td>32</td><td>0</td><td>20</td><td>0</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>-22</td><td>37</td><td>0</td><td>36</td><td>0</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>-16</td><td>51</td><td>0</td><td>29</td><td>0</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>2014 (provisional)</td><td>-15</td><td>55</td><td>0</td><td>23</td><td>0</td><td>63</td></tr></table>*The Aircraft Leasing Sector was in a net repayment position in respect of VAT for each year.</p></reply>

For example, the Ready Reckoner shows the impact of reducing the lowest USC rate from 1.5% to 0.5% as having an estimated cost of &euro;235 million in a full year. The impact of reducing the rate from 1.5% to 1.0% as suggested by the Deputy is around half of this, approximately &euro;118 million.</p><p>These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax forecasting model using latest actual data for the year 2012, adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are estimated by reference to 2015 incomes and are provisional and may be revised.</p><p>In relation to the third question, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the number of income earners currently exempt from paying the Universal Social Charge is estimated to be in the order of 648,700, already in excess of the numbers noted by the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is generally known as the "ARF Option" and the conditions that must be met are that the scheme member is in receipt of guaranteed pension or annuity income for life of &euro;12,700 per annum at the point of retirement or,  in the absence of that, that he or she invests up to &euro;63,500 of the balance of the pension fund (or the whole of the remainder of the fund after taking the retirement lump sum, if less than that amount) in an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund or an annuity.</p>  <p>  In the case of personal pension arrangements such as Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs), in general a lump sum of up to 25% of the value of the fund can be taken from age 60, with the remainder of the fund used to either purchase an annuity or avail of the ARF Options described above.</p>  <p>  I am further advised by the Commissioners, that the maximum cumulative tax-free total of all retirement lump sums that an individual can take from all pension arrangements since 7 December 2005 is &euro;200,000. Any lump sums taken in excess of this cumulative life-time limit are subject to taxation at a ring-fenced rate of 20% on the next &euro;300,000 and at the individual's marginal income tax rate plus USC on any balance. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to change the current retirement lump sum rules or the life-time tax-free limit.</p></reply>

Dealing with the consumer is credit servicing and the definition of credit servicing is broad. Owners of loan books who deal directly with consumers, that is, who are servicing their own loan books, will be regulated. Otherwise they can have the loan book serviced by a regulated credit servicing firm.</p>  <p>  The Bill was published in January and second stage of the Bill was taken in the D&aacute;il on 4 February. Since then, my officials have been in contact with the Central Bank and with the Office of the Attorney General to further progress the legislation. The Bill will continue its progress through the legislative process and I look forward to further discussion of the Bill at Committee Stage. </p>  <p>  The Mortgage to Rent Scheme comes under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for Environment, Communications and Local Government. I understand that there is no criterion under the Mortgage to Rent Scheme that would prevent a household remaining in the scheme even if mortgage provider changes. However it is a matter for the mortgage provider to agree that a property is suitable for inclusion in the scheme in the first place. There are then other eligibility criteria, in respect of household income, property size, household need and value of the property, which are applied independent of the mortgage provider. The purchase of properties under the Mortgage to Rent Scheme are financed by an Approved Housing Body (AHB) using a combination of State funding and the Ahab's own private finance arrangements.  This financing remains in place independently of the household's mortgage provider.</p></reply>

Indeed, if public spending had not been reduced, the impact on the labour market would have been even larger, with enormous consequences for the living standards of the Irish people. </p>  <p>  Putting the public finances back on a sustainable footing has laid the foundation for economic recovery and is yielding positive dividends in the labour market.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-06a.426.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600055#WRF03300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 and 151 together.</p>  <p>  At the outset I would like to confirm that the lending institutions in Ireland - including those in which the State has a significant shareholding - are independent commercial entities. I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in relation to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. </p>  <p>  Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, the issue of regulation of interest rates remains a policy area under active review. The current position is that the Central Bank does not have new proposals for the additional regulation of interest rates. However, a former Deputy Governor indicated that, within its existing powers and through the use of persuasion, the Central Bank would continue to engage with specific lenders which appear to have standard variable rates set disproportionate to their cost of funds and this is a course of action I expect the Central Bank to continually appraise.</p>  <p>  I meet regularly with the Governor of the Central Bank. The latest of these meetings took place on 2 April where we discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates. We noted that the SVRs charged in Ireland are higher than other euro area countries and have not fallen in line with ECB wholesale rates. </p>  <p>  As a result of this meeting the Governor of the Central Bank is currently reviewing the cost of mortgages to banks. The Governor should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the next 10 days or so. I will then meet the six principal mortgage lenders in order to  discuss this issue. </p>  <p>  I think that we need to bear in mind that the Financial Institutions Levy announced as part of Budget 2014 is a revenue raising measure which allows for a contribution from the banking sector to Ireland's economic recovery. The levy will be in place for three years with an anticipated annual yield of &euro;150 million. The imposition of the levy is a proportionate measure on a domestic banking sector. The entire banking system has been underpinned by the strong Government support provided both here and abroad and it is appropriate that the banking sector should make a contribution to the State's economic recovery. </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there have been moves on interest rates. As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 May AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner occupier and buy-to-let mortgages. These included a cut of 0.25% for AIB Standard Variable Rate (SVR) customers and 0.38% for EBS and Haven SVR customers. The Bank also announced reductions in Loan to Value (LTV) and Fixed Rate mortgages across AIB, EBS and Haven. These rate reductions will apply to both new and existing customers. </p>  <p>  This is the second time in the past six months that AIB Group has reduced its mortgage rates for new and existing customers. The latest move significantly benefits approx. 158,000 mortgage account holders. Individual SVR Customers will be advised of the changes in writing by AIB group.</p></reply>

The primary focus of this strategy is to support those homeowners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments and, in so far as possible, to avoid repossession of the family home.  </p>  <p>  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence.  The CCMA provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long-term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers.</p>  <p>  I am strongly of the view that where a borrower engages with his lender with a view to putting in place a restructure arrangement to address his/her mortgage arrears situation, repossession of the family home should only be considered as a last resort.  The Central Bank's most recent quarterly release on Residential Mortgage arrears and Repossessions (Q4 2014) indicates that almost 115,000 restructure arrangements have been put in place.</p>  <p>  Where a mortgage in arrears is deemed to be unsustainable by the lender the mortgage to rent scheme, administered by my colleague, Alan Kelly, TD, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, may be a viable alternative which will keep the borrower in the family home. </p>  <p>  The effective management of the mortgage arrears issue is, however, an area that remains under continuous review.  More and concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears and, as the Taoiseach has previously announced, the Government is considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions.</p></reply>

This date was again extended to 9 January 2015 in light of the high volume of payments being received at that time.  Revenue has confirmed to me that the payment compliance rate in respect of 2015 exceeded 75% by 9 January, which is an outstanding achievement for a relatively new tax.  As of April 2015, the LPT 2015 compliance rate is estimated to be 94%.  </p>  <p>  As part of the 2015 campaign Revenue wrote to all property owners in October 2014 who either paid their 2014 LPT liability in a single transaction or by way of regular cash payments through one of the approved Payment Service Providers advising them of their 2015 LPT liability.  Revenue did not write to property owners who availed of the various phased payment options in 2014 such as Direct Debit and Deduction at Source from salary or pension because these methods automatically carried on into 2015. </p>  <p>  The letters confirmed that any property owners choosing to meet their 2015 liabilities in a single payment were obliged to do so no later than 7 January 2015.  7 January was also confirmed as the latest date to inform Revenue of the intention to opt for the Single Debit Authority payment method even though it would not be debited until 21 March 2015 unless an earlier date was specified by the property owner.</p>  <p>  In regard to property owners who paid their 2014 LPT in full by a single transaction but wished to change to a phased payment option for 2015 (Direct Debit or Deduction at Source) the letter requested that they inform Revenue of their preferred choice no later than 25 November 2014.  This lead in period was necessary to allow Revenue time to put the various debit arrangements in place before the start of the calendar year.</p>  <p>  In February 2015 warning notice letters issued to the minority of property owners who did not meet their LPT obligations by the extended due date.  I am aware that these notices were clearly worded so that there could be no doubt as to the possible consequences of continued non-compliance.  However the letters were balanced in that they also allowed a further 14 day grace period before any debt collection/enforcement action was started so that property owners who might have inadvertently forgotten to pay the outstanding liabilities by the due date were afforded ample time to get their affairs up to date.  This was a proper approach for Revenue to adopt in fairness to the vast majority of people who met their LPT obligations on time and is one that I fully endorse. </p>  <p>  In regard to Revenue's customer service provision for LPT, the online system is the simplest and most efficient way to access records and submit returns or payments as required.  The system is available 24 hours a day and can be accessed using the secure PIN and Property ID codes that are provided to property owners.  The system can also be used at any time to check balances due, change payment methods or submit queries to Revenue by secure email.  I am assured that where the online system is used to its maximum potential there should be very little requirement for property owners to make any direct personal contact with Revenue. </p>  <p>  Where direct contact with Revenue is required, the LPT Helpline should be the first point of contact. Revenue assures me that the Helpline is fully resourced to meet demand but has also acknowledged that on occasion the service did temporarily fall below normal Revenue customer service standards due to unusually high levels of demand.  This mainly occurred in the earlier phases of the tax as Revenue tried to gauge the level of service required.  However, these shortcomings were always quickly rectified through additional deployments, extended opening hours and call back services as required.</p>  <p>  Revenue has assured me that the officials operating both the external and internal elements of the LPT Helpline are fully trained to the same customer service standard that applies to all other taxes and that the individual performance of each operator is fully monitored to ensure the high level of service is maintained.</p></reply>

It should also be noted that solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels.  As a result they are considered the dirtiest fuels and given the environmental impact it is important that they are taxed.</p><p>Carbon Tax was introduced in Budget 2010 but its application to solid fuels was delayed to allow for the development of a robust mechanism to counter the large scale sourcing of coal from Northern Ireland where lower sulphur standards apply. Such a mechanism is in place since June 2011.</p><p>The carbon tax on solid fuels was introduced in two phases i.e. &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>from 1<sup>st</sup>May 2013 and a further &euro;10 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>from 1<sup>st</sup>May 2014 thus bringing the carbon tax on solid fuels in line with that on all other fossil fuels i.e. at &euro;20 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>.  In 2014 the overall carbon tax yield was &euro;385.36m of which the carbon tax on solid fuels accounted for &euro;17.2m.</p><p>While tax increases are unpopular, it makes sense to increase taxes in areas where some benefits can arise, in this instance a carbon tax promotes energy efficiency, reduces emissions and reduces our dependence on imported fossil fuels.</p><p>As a matter of principle the reliefs from the carbon tax are limited to ensure as wide an application as possible.  Placing a carbon tax on solid fuels also offers an opportunity to develop cleaner more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative fuels.</p><p>Accordingly I have no plans to reduce the level of carbon tax on solid fuels.</p></reply>

Throughout this period however, it was also clear that the Bolton Library collection continued to be under direct threat of damage arising from its being housed in very unsuitable accommodation in a building next to the Church of Ireland Cathedral in Cashel and that a viable solution to its future care needed to be found urgently.</p>  <p>  Following further consideration of the position in 2012 and 2013, the Office of Public Works advised the Church of Ireland that it was not in a position to proceed with the proposal outlined by the previous Minister and indicated that it would be withdrawing from direct participation in it.  However, understanding that the Church was proposing to return to an earlier proposal of its own to secure the future of the collection with the direct assistance of the University of Limerick, the OPW also agreed to assist practically in any way possible and to work with the owners of the collection, once it had been safeguarded, to facilitate the exhibition of parts of the Library and allow the public to access it.</p>  <p>  I understand that at this stage, the owners of the Bolton Library are in discussions with the University of Limerick in relation to the future conservation of the Library.

Public Procurement savings are necessary to enable public service organisations deliver much needed services within the tighter budgets that they must now operate.</p>  <p>  However, I would point out that reforms in this area are being carried out in a manner that recognises the importance of SMEs.  The Government acknowledges the significant role that SMEs play in the Irish economy and is committed to ensuring that SMEs are fully engaged with public sector procurement and the opportunities presenting.  Circular 10/14 issued in 2014 by my Department is aimed at opening up opportunities for small businesses that want to tender for public contracts and also to ensure that engaging with government procurement is easy and low cost.  This guidance set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises as well as highlighting practices that are to be avoided because they can hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.</p>  <p>  In terms of revising the procedures that govern public procurement, the Office of Government Procurement is in the process of transposing three Directives into Irish Law.  A public consultation process in respect of the three new EU public procurement Directives was initiated at the end of October 2014 and 43 submissions were received by end January 2015.  The issues raised in these submissions are undergoing consideration at present.  The transposition process is on track to meet the deadline of April 2016.  </p>  <p>  I would add that the OGP supports the work of Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland in building awareness of public procurement and supporting training for small suppliers in bidding for public contracts.  For example, last year the Office of Government Procurement supported two "Meet the Buyer" events in Belfast and Dublin which were attended by over 1,100 suppliers.  The Office of Government Procurement also supported the 'Go 2 Tender' programme run by InterTrade Ireland which was attended by approximately 400 SME's.  This year InterTrade Ireland also delivered a programme on consortia building to assist SME's to jointly bid for state contracts.  </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work with suppliers and business representatives to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

Appointments to the wider Public Service are a matter for each individual sector. <font color="#2F2F2F"> The management of performance, including identifying and fostering high performers and dealing with underperformance, is a major priority under the actions included in the Civil Service Renewal Plan. </font>Civil servants may be recruited on a permanent or temporary basis.  In the case of an appointment to a permanent established position, section 5(A) of the Civil Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005 provides for completion of a one-year probationary contract.  During this period, performance is subject to review by the local management to determine whether or not the officer(i) has performed in a satisfactory manner,(ii) has been satisfactory in general conduct, and(iii) is suitable from the point of view of health with particular regard to sick leave.  Prior to completion of the probationary contract, a decision is made as to whether or not the officer will be retained for permanent appointment.  This decision is based on the performance as assessed against the criteria set out in (i) to (iii) above.  In the event that the officer is not considered suitable, notification in writing of the action to be taken will be issued to the officer prior to the expiry of the contract.  Civil servants may also be employed on a temporary unestablished basis on fixed-term contracts.  Fixed-term contracts are issued for a number of reasons including to meet seasonal peaks of demand and to provide cover arising from family friendly policies across the Civil and Public Service.  A fixed-term contract, in the normal course, may be terminated for a number of reasons such as the arrival at a specific date, the completion of a specific task or the occurrence of a specific event.  The employing Department or Office reserves the right to terminate the employment prior to the date of cessation on giving the appropriate notice set down in the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Acts 1973 to 2005.  The employing Department or Office also reserves the right to terminate the employment for stated reasons.  In the event of serious misconduct, the appointment may be terminated without notice and no remuneration or compensation is payable other than that applicable to work carried out.  Also, the person appointed may terminate the appointment by giving appropriate notice.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds such as nationality, geographic location or organisational size, and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p>  <p>  I would point out that the reform of public procurement in Ireland is being carried out in a manner that recognises the clear importance of small and medium-sized enterprises in this country's economic recovery.  The recently published report by the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) "Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013" showed that 93% of public service procurement expenditure was with businesses in the Republic of Ireland.  This was based on an analysis of &euro;2.742 billion expenditure across 64 large public service bodies involving over 35,000 suppliers.</p>  <p>  The OGP is working with industry representative bodies to promote the engagement of Irish business in public procurement (including ISME, IBEC, SFA, Chambers Ireland, and CIF) as well as the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, InterTrade Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland.  Last year, for example, the OGP supported two 'Meet the Buyer' events - one in Belfast and the other in Dublin attended by over 1,100 businesses.  In addition, the OGP proactively launched a campaign to get more businesses to register with e-tenders (the national tendering portal) which resulted in 12,300 new supplier registrations in 2014.</p>  <p>  It is also important to realise that open tendering is a two way street and provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete in an EU market estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion per annum.  The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.   </p>  <p>  The OGP will continue to work with industry to ensure that winning government business is done in a fair, transparent and accessible way and to ensure that Government procurement policies are business friendly.</p></reply>

This process is facilitated through the national eProcurement portal .  This portal is the Irish Government's public platform for advertising public sector procurement tenders.  All tender notices entered into eTenders are advertised on this national system but notices greater than a certain threshold value must also be advertised in the Official Journal of the EU (OJEU).  Under EU Directives on public procurement, public works, utilities, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised (tender notice) and details of the contracts awarded also published (contract award notices) in the OJEU.  </p><p>The OJEU is an electronic publication where all public procurement tenders above the EU Thresholds, from across all member states must be published.  Non-OJEU refers to the tender notices that are below the OJEU public procurement thresholds.  The eTenders system facilitates the entry and publication of tender notices and contract award details for both national and EU procurement opportunities.  eTenders is set up and approved to automatically send notices of tender notices above threshold estimated values to be published in the OJEU.  This allows Contracting Authorities to meet national and EU guidelines for publishing notices and awards in a single system. The current EU thresholds are:<table><tr><th>Works</th><th></th></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice &euro;5,186,000 </td><td>Threshold applies to Government Departments and Offices, Local and Regional Authorities and public bodies</td></tr><tr><td>Supplies and Services</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice &euro;134,000 </td><td>Threshold applies to Government Departments and Offices</td></tr><tr><td>Contract Notice &euro;207,000</td><td>Threshold applies to Local and Regional Authorities and public bodies outside the Utilities sector</td></tr><tr><td>Utilities</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Works Contracts/Prior Indicative Notice &euro;5,186,000</td><td>For entities in Utilities sector covered by GPA</td></tr><tr><td>Supplies and Services &euro;414,000</td><td>For entities in Utilities sector covered by GPA</td></tr></table></p><p>While the EU Directives require publication of tender and contract award notices for above threshold activity, below threshold notices are governed only by national rules.  Following the introduction of Circular 10/14: 'Initiatives to assist SMEs in Public Procurement', the entry of contract award details for all contracts above &euro;25k became mandatory since August 2014, however prior to this date it was not mandatory.  </p><p>The OGP recently published a report titled &quot;Public Service Spend and Tendering Analysis for 2013&quot;.  It reported that eTenders contained details of 627 contracts awarded by Public Sector Bodies in 2013 for tender notices published in 2013. This is approximately 18% of the 3,518 tender notices published during 2013.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-06a.543.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600057#WRH03200"><p>The Living Wage concept is grounded in the idea that a person&rsquo;s wage should be sufficient to maintain a safe, decent standard of living.  At an individual level the resources required to achieve a minimum essential standard of living is very dependent on family circumstances and thus the interaction of individual earnings with household income and supports such as Child Benefit, Family Income Supplement and housing, education and health supports all contribute to an individual's standard of living.  In the UK, it is a voluntary code that some employers, who pay in excess of the UK national minimum wage, are keen to be associated with.  However, the UK does not have the Joint Labour Committee framework or Sectoral Employment Order framework that in the former case has been re-introduced and, in the latter case, is due to be put on a statutory footing very shortly.</p>  <p>  Both frameworks provide or will provide for the setting of wages above the NMW.</p>  <p>  In addition, it should be borne in mind that the National Minimum Wage (NMW) in Ireland is relatively high by international standards.  The most recent figures published by Eurostat show that Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the fifth highest among the 22 EU Member States that have a National Minimum Wage.  When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland&rsquo;s rate is the sixth highest.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s decision to restore the NMW to &euro;8.65 per hour with effect from 1 July 2011, together with the decision to put the Joint Labour Committee (JLC) on a more secure legal and Constitutional footing represents a significant commitment by this Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a Low Pay Commission is one of the key commitments in the Statement of Government Priorities agreed in July 2014.  The Commission was officially launched on 26th  February 2015 to operate on an interim administrative basis.  Legislation to provide for the establishment of the LPC on a statutory basis will be published shortly with a view to its enactment by mid-2015. </p>  <p>  The principal function of the Low Pay Commission will be, on an annual basis, to examine and make recommendations to the Minister of the day on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. </p>  <p>  I am conscious of the need to balance a basic statutory minimum pay rate that is fair, with one that is sustainable and which allows employers to continue to create quality jobs.</p>  <p>  Alongside examining the National Minimum Wage, the Low Pay Commission will also be tasked with examining matters related generally to the functions of the Commission under the Act.  This work programme will be agreed by Government and presented to the Commission in February of each year.</p>  <p>  The Commission has already commenced its work: submissions were sought recently and I expect that the Commission will submit its first report by the middle of July.</p>  <p>  A key focus of the Government&rsquo;s strategy is to protect the most vulnerable workers and to assist those on low and middle-incomes.  In this context, 410,000 low paid workers have been removed from the USC charge over successive budgets.  The Government is firmly committed to continuing this policy of targeted tax reductions for workers in the next budget.  </p>  <p>  At the same time, the Government has introduced targeted welfare supports for people returning to work, and particularly for the low-paid.  The Government will pay &euro;30 a week to mothers or fathers returning to work from long-term unemployment for each child for the first year, and &euro;15 per week per child for the second year.  The scheme was open to applications from 5 January 2015.</p>  <p>  For those trapped on rent supplement that cannot go back to work because they will lose their housing support, a new Housing Assistance Payment is being rolled out.  The assistance from the State will be based on how much you earn and not by your employment status.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection also supports low-income families in work by means of Family Income Supplement (FIS).  That Department avails of every opportunity in its engagement with employers and jobseekers to build awareness of the availability of FIS and how this payment may benefit potential employees with children.</p>  <p>  I have a deep interest in the Living Wage initiative, and as I have previously stated, I will host a Forum on the Living Wage later this year, where I will invite employers, trade unions, civil society actors, academics and key organisations involved in this voluntary initiative to examine the concept from an Irish perspective.</p></reply>

I understand that Proof Houses are normally only established in States where firearms are manufactured.  In that context, I understand that Ireland does not have any firearms&rsquo; manufacturers. </p>  <p>  Such Proof Houses have been set up in a number of EU Member States which have firearms&rsquo; manufacturers.  These Member States are signatories to the Commission Internationale Permanente pour l&rsquo;epreuve des armes feu portatives ("Permanent International Commission for the Proof of Small Arms" &ndash; commonly abbreviated as C.I.P.) which is an international organisation which sets standards for safety testing of firearms.  I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, have no proposals for Ireland to join the C.I.P. </p>  <p>  The establishment of any such Proof House in Ireland would have security implications which would be a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Overall responsibility for firearms importation into Ireland, and the licensing thereof, are also the responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality.  In this context, I note that the Department of Justice and Equality application form for importation of firearms by a registered firearms&rsquo; dealer into Ireland includes a requirement to declare if the firearm has a C.I.P. proof status or not.  I would remind the Deputy that the Department of Justice and Equality undertook a public consultation earlier this year in relation to the licensing of firearms in Ireland.</p></reply>

IDA Ireland has visited the facility with the developer to assess the plans for the future development of the site and has provided inputs on the marketability of the site for future FDI to Carlow.  I understand that IDA will be in a position to actively market the site once minor upgrade works are completed.  It is anticipated that these works will be completed by mid-year.  In the meantime IDA Ireland has provided information on the facility to a number of potential clients, who are currently assessing Ireland as an investment location.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, officials of my Department and its agencies are actively engaged with regional stakeholders in the development of individual Action Plans for each of the regions, including the South East Region, which will be published in the near future.</p></reply>

Roscommon in connection with Sliabh Bawn Wind Farm. Both licences are valid for 2 years from the date of issue. FL15842 carries an obligation to replant alternative specified sites in counties Limerick, Leitrim, Galway and Mayo, while FL15842 carries an obligation to replant the area felled under that licence.  There are 7 other General Felling Licences clearfell licences as listed below. These all carry a compulsory replanting condition. There are 2 thinning licences currently in effect for this property, viz. GFL9544 for 0.42 hectares in respect of a forest road, which expires 30 October 2015; and GFLRN09 which is a 5-year licence for the entire Coillte forest RN09, which expires on 31 December 2015. While GFL9544 will result in minor loss of growing stock, this is part of normal forestry operations. The thinning operations under GFLRN09 are to improve growing stock yield.</p>  <p>  In relation to all of these licences, the authorised utilisation of these licences is as specified in the licences, with conditions also specified in relation to replanting of the land felled and planting of alternative land (except for the 2 thinning licences); utilisation is therefore governed and limited by the authority granted in the licence and no felling beyond that authority is allowed. Due to the planting conditions, there will be no net loss of growing stock as it will be replaced at the Doughall Forest site and the alternative planting sites.</p></reply>

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production. In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of seed production, grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector. The long-term average cereal production in Ireland is in the region of 2.2 million tonnes per annum and it is desirable to sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.</p>  <p>  The 2014 harvest was estimated in the region of 2.5 million tonnes, well above the long-term average production of 2.2 million tonnes. Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies. Cereal prices are highly sensitive to global supply and demand, and volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies.   </p>  <p>  Fertilisers may constitute up to 50% of input costs for tillage farms, and despite the decrease in the cost of fuel, prices are expected to remain high due to tight world supplies and the falling fertiliser manufacturing capacity in Europe over the past 10 years. World fertiliser supply is tightly matched to demand for 2015 and for the foreseeable future and it is anticipated that world demand will continue to increase into the future, maintaining upward pressure on prices to the final consumer in Ireland. </p>  <p>The fall in the value of the euro against the dollar is also exerting upward pressure on prices. Teagasc estimates that fertiliser costs for Irish farmers will be similar for 2015 to 2014.   </p>  <p>  Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land. However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade. It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses. In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further.   </p>  <p>  The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed, given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020 and the recent lifting of milk quotas which is expected to give rise to a considerable expansion in the dairy herd, as well as an increased level of feeding and production per livestock unit. However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential. Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome. </p>  <p>  A consistent supply of protein, grown in Ireland, would give Irish livestock farmers the opportunity to use more natively produced protein feed and to access higher valued markets. Accordingly, I am pleased to confirm that from this year I have introduced a protein coupled aid scheme to expand production of protein crops. The rate of payment per hectare will be &euro;250  /ha with a ceiling of &euro;3 million for any scheme year. The protein crops eligible for aid are peas, beans and sweet lupins. Protein crops will also qualify under the Cap Reform Agreement as Ecological Focus Areas to meet environmental sustainability requirements. </p>  <p>  Further support for tillage farmers will be available through the provision of a Knowledge Transfer measure under the Rural Development Programme 2014 &ndash; 2020. I anticipate that the formation and administration of knowledge transfer groups a   cross the Beef, Dairy and Equine sectors in 2015 will extend to cover the Poultry, Sheep and Tillage sectors in 2016. The innovative scheme design of this measure will focus on key issues that affect profitability and sustainability of the farm enterprise. Other important issues such as farm safety and farm progression will also be covered by the measure. </p>  <p>  My Department also operates a range of services aimed at improving the level of production, quality and viability of the Irish cereal sector. These services include seed certification, seed testing, variety testing and the publication of recommended lists of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; competitive research programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers.</p></reply>

Current production of malt in Ireland is in the region of 120,000 tonnes from 160,000 tonnes plus of contracted malting barley.  Future prospects are very positive, primarily due to the growth of Irish Whiskey exports and interest in craft beers which is driving growth in micro-breweries.  The Tillage Sector Development Plan published in 2012 identified the potential for growth of the malting sector and an opportunity to expand production of native malting barley by upwards of 100,000 tonnes over time.  The extent of any increase will depend on the sustainability of the supply chain and on building strong relationships with customers and markets.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on developing an industry-led agri-food development strategy to succeed Food Harvest 2020 and this includes assessing the prospects for individual sectors and which measures would best promote sustained growth and a strong supply chain.</p></reply>

The distribution of staff is an operational matter for Teagasc.</p>  <p>  In light of the constraints on recruitment, Teagasc is re-configuring the way in which it delivers services to farmers through greater use of discussion groups and by leveraging more external resources through sub contracting certain activities to private providers. For example, they recently engaged an external strategic partner (FRS) to deliver GLAS planning services to Teagasc clients. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to work closely with Teagasc to evaluate requests for mission critical appointments. Over 50 permanent appointments were authorised outside the moratorium since 2009. A further exception to the moratorium permits Teagasc to recruit &lsquo;non grant in aid&rsquo; funded contractors. They currently employ 190 contractors working predominately in research and advisory services. Priority has also been accorded to the recruitment of 20 temporary teachers to meet the exceptional demand for Green Cert courses from young farmers. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the new Delegated Sanction arrangements may provide greater discretion to Government Departments and state agencies over staffing levels, but strictly within an overall pay framework.

This organism which is not a pathogen as such caused severe irritation to the gills of the farmed fish concerned. There were severe stock losses of the smaller sized fish as a result. This phenomenon had been observed previously in 1999 in Ireland but had not been seen in the interim.</p>  <p>  This phenomenon has also been evident in other jurisdictions and, in Australia, a treatment technique was developed which involved immersing the affected stock in freshwater for a short period. The fresh water kills and removes the amoeba by osmoregulatory stress on the organism but the salmon remain unaffected and are effectively &lsquo;cured&rsquo; by the treatment.   </p>  <p>  This treatment is now being used by Irish operators to deal successfully with the problem.

The new landing obligation will greatly help over time to underpin the sustainability of the Irish fishing industry and the coastal communities&rsquo; dependent upon it and lead to greater conservation of fish stocks to the benefit of all.</p><p>However, it is the fishing industry alone which will have to adapt its behaviour and practices in response to the implementation of the discard ban. It is the individual vessel operators who will have to abide by the new rules as they are phased in and who will ensure that the landing obligation is operated successfully. It is for that reason that the Discards Implementation Group, chaired by Dr Noel Cawley, is made up of fishing industry representatives and those who can provide expert advice such as the Marine Institute and Bord Iascaigh Mhara. </p><p>The key policy decisions with regard to the landing obligation e.g. what species are covered and when - have been and will continue to be made in the Regional Groups of Member States. Under the new Common Fisheries Policy the Regional Group <i>must</i>consult with the Advisory Councils (which include environmental NGO&rsquo;s). I fully support this and Ireland, as current Chair of the North Western Waters Regional Group has ensured that representatives of the Advisory Council have attended every meeting of the Group and their views have been fully considered. </p><p>The purpose of the Discards Implementation Group is fundamentally different to that of the Regional Group of Member States. Primarily, it is to consider the potential impact of the decisions already made at the Regional level and to consider what practical changes will be required to fully implement them. </p><p>Consequently, I do not consider it necessary that environmental non-governmental organisations, which will not have any direct role in implementing the landing obligation, become part of the DIG. As I have said previously, I have ensured that such organisations are kept updated on the Group&rsquo;s deliberations and this will remain the case.</p></reply>

There is always a strict separation between my Ministerial role as decision maker in respect of licence applications and my Ministerial duty to promote the sustainable development of the industry. This separation of duties is strictly observed.  These interactions with industry do not conflict with my role or the role of my Department in relation to licensing, which is set out in legislation.</p><p>The control protocols for the management of sea lice are operated by the Marine Institute on behalf of the State and are more advanced than those operated in other jurisdictions for the following reasons:</p><p>-  the inspection regime is totally independent of the industry</p><p>-  data obtained as a result of inspections is published</p><p>-  treatment trigger levels are set at a low level</p><p>These control protocols have been the subject of detailed investigation and testing by the EU Commission which has confirmed that it regards the sea lice protocols operated in Ireland as representing best practice internationally.</p><p>The potential for growth and job creation in the aquaculture sector has been widely recognised internationally over a number of years.  On 27 March 2015, I announced plans for a new &euro;241 million development programme for the seafood sector for the period up to 2020, co-funded by the EU through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. The draft Seafood Development Programme 2014-2020 proposes investment of &euro;30 million in a number of measures specifically intended to support the sustainable development of the aquaculture sector. Those investment plans will be supported by a new National Strategic Plan for Aquaculture, which I will publish for public consultation shortly. Through that National Strategic Plan and targeted investment under the Seafood Development Programme I will be seeking to identify all of the issues affecting the sustainable growth of the sector and the policy actions and supporting investment needed to address those issues.</p></reply>

This has now been received, in the form of a &lsquo;letter of comfort&rsquo; from the EU Commission. As additional functionality requested by users was being built into the online system, I decided not to activate the submit facility immediately, in order to give applicants and advisers as much time as possible to familiarise themselves with the scheme before finalising their applications. In addition, I also secured approval to extend the closing date for applications to 22 May, 2015.</p>  <p>  At this point in time, I believe the facility to formally submit applications can be activated, and it is my intention to do so this week. However, once an application has been submitted it cannot be recalled and no further changes can be made to it. Farmers and advisors should therefore satisfy themselves fully that applications are ready and complete before submitting same.</p></reply>

Our draft Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 states, &lsquo;Ireland will keep the possible use of financial instruments under review during the programming period&rsquo;.</p>  <p>  My Department and I have been active in exploring new and more competitive sources of funding and will continue to do so in the context of evolving market requirements. The recent announcement by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland of a new product, &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo;, is a welcome addition to the sources of funding currently in the market. This credit is available, subject to qualifying criteria, at favourable terms (i.e. longer term and lower interest rate) for investments by agricultural SMEs involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products. </p>  <p>  In relation to accessing finance and credit terms generally, I have recently been in contact with the main banks. I emphasised that this is a critical phase in Ireland&rsquo;s dairy expansion and that the increased investment and output from production and processing will have significant downstream benefits across the economy generally, including for the banking sector. In order to support the on-going development of the dairy sector and to mitigate the current difficulties caused by milk price volatility, I asked them to explore the full range of potential measures that could serve to alleviate the loan repayment burden facing farmers and offer maximum flexibility for dairy farmers in what will be a difficult year ahead. I believe that it is essential that short term cash flow difficulties are not allowed to undermine prudent investment plans or the longer term competitiveness of their operations. I will continue to communicate with the main banks on issues affecting the sector.</p></reply>

In December 2014, in addition to her existing responsibilities, the Government assigned Minister Phelan to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government with special responsibility for Local/Community/Rural Economic Development issues, including implementation of the CEDRA report.</p><p>The thirty four CEDRA recommendations are very wide ranging and cover issues that fall within the remit of a number of Government Departments. The recommendations cover areas as diverse as investment and finance, local enterprise support, community capability building, social enterprise, broadband, roads, water, rural transport, artisan foods, creative industries, tourism and recreation, marine and renewable energy.  Minister Phelan has established and chairs an Inter-Departmental Group to coordinate and oversee action on all these issues. This does not necessarily involve specific delegated functions. Insofar as my Department is concerned there are no legislative acts to be formally delegated to Minister Phelan.</p></reply>

These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force requires that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation as a whole.

This Government has also greatly reduced  the costs of bankruptcy -  from around &euro;1400 in total in 2012, to just &euro;270 euro from 1 January 2015. While bankruptcy used to be predominantly sought by creditors, since late 2013 almost all bankruptcies are sought by the debtor.</p>  <p>  Work is currently under way across Government Departments to develop a comprehensive and effective package of measures to help those trapped in unsustainable mortgage debt on their homes to arrive at sustainable solutions.  This is a priority for me and for the Government.  That work is now being completed, with specific attention to the personal insolvency legislation, and the Government&rsquo;s action plan in this area will be announced shortly.</p>  <p>  I am anxious to ensure that the immediate steps which are to be taken now will be ones which will directly assist those in extreme debt and mortgage difficulty, and which will service the very fundamental principle that loss of ownership of a family home through repossession should be a last resort.</p>  <p>  This is basic to our consideration and evaluation of all options which are available to us, legislative and otherwise, and including the reduction of the bankruptcy discharge period proposed by Deputy Penrose&rsquo;s Private Member's Bill.</p></reply>

Responsibility for coordinating policy on disability lies with my Department.  However, the implementation of sectoral policy is a matter for a number of Government Departments, with responsibility for provision of services resting mainly with the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government committed to publishing, "following wide consultation, a realistic implementation plan for the National Disability Strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable time scales and targets within available resources and ensuring whole-of-government involvement and monitoring of the Strategy, in partnership with the disability sector".</p>  <p>  The Implementation Plan was submitted to Government on 23 July 2013 and was published following Government Decision of that date. Considerable discussion was undertaken between the disability stakeholders and Government Departments to reach agreement on the suite of actions contained in the Plan and there are no outstanding inputs from Departments or agencies. The Plan sets out the practical measures across all relevant Government Departments to be taken to advance the National Disability Strategy over the period 2013 to 2015 and ensures that available resources are used to best effect to meet the needs of all people with disabilities. The Implementation Plan covers the period up to end-2015 and my Department will shortly commence a consultation process with all relevant stakeholders with a view to putting a revised Disability Inclusion Strategy in place as from January 2016.</p>  <p>  The focus in the follow-on Implementation Plan will be on the key themes that impact on the lives of people with disabilities, on identifying agreed objectives within each theme and on developing specific actions to be undertaken to achieve each of the agreed objectives, together with timelines and key performance indicators.</p>  <p>  The National Disability Strategy Implementation Group, which I chair, and which comprises representatives from across Government Departments, representatives from the City and County Managers Association, the National Disability Authority, a broad range of disability organisations, and a number of individuals appointed in their personal capacity to bring their lived experience to the table, will have a central role in shaping the new Implementation Plan.</p></reply>

For leases entered into on or after that date, section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 has the effect of providing that, in practice, upward only rent review clauses are no longer possible.</p>  <p>  In relation to so called "legacy leases", there was a substantial concern that any legislative scheme involving interference in the contractual relationships of private parties would find it extremely difficult to survive a Constitutional challenge.  In addition, the Government was advised that any model proposed would require the payment of compensation to landlords whose rights were infringed in order to ensure that the proposal would be compatible with the Constitution and with the European Convention on Human Rights.  As I have indicated in my replies to previous Parliamentary Questions on the subject of upward only rent review clauses, there are no plans to re-examine the decision  taken in 2011.</p></reply>

Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort that could not be justified where there are other significant demands on resources. However I can advise the Deputy that the number of sentenced and remand prisoner in custody in each prison is set out in Table 1 below. I am further advised by the Irish Prison Service that on the 5th May 2015 there were 61 sentenced prisoners aged 18 to 20 in custody in Wheatfield Place of Detention.  There were no prisoners in this age category on remand.  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that the number of persons aged 21 to 24 in each prison is set out in the table 2.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service provides a wide range of services to meet the therapeutic needs of persons in custody who require mental health services, or access to drug treatment services.</p><p>In relation to drug dependency the Irish Prison Service continues to seek to construct a range of programmes, support services and through-care options for prisoners demonstrating a commitment to addressing their substance misuse. In line with Action 43 of the National Drug Strategy the Irish Prison Service has an agreed protocol with the HSE for the seamless transition of prisoners established on drug treatment into community drug treatment settings. As well as this drug free units are operational in all closed prisons. These units accommodate and cater for the needs of both drug free prisoners and illicit drug free prisoners including those prisoners stable on methadone. All prisoners engaged in drug treatment have the support of healthcare staff and in reach services as required. Merchants Quay Ireland currently has a contract with the Irish Prison Service for the provision of addiction counselling services in all prisons with the exception of Arbour Hill.  The expansion of treatment and other health and social services in prisons continues. Drug treatment services are now in place all closed prisons.</p><p>In-reach mental health services are available in all Dublin prisons and in the Portlaoise Campus and Castlerea Prison by way of collaboration with the National Forensic Mental Health Services.  The Central Mental Hospital provides forensic mental health sessions weekly in these prisons, and provides an assessment and liaison service for all other prisons.  Specialist in-reach services are also in place in Cork Prison and Limerick Prison.  The Irish Prison Service has access to a limited number of places in the Central Mental Hospital for prisoners who require residential mental health treatment.  The IPS Psychology Service also provides mental health services to prisoners, and helps offenders address factors that put them at risk of re-offending. As well as this a Psychiatric In-reach and Court Liaison Service is available at Cloverhill Prison.</p><p>With regards to the Deputy's request for a breakdown of assaults among certain categories of prisoner, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that assault statistics are also not categorised by prisoner age profile. However, figures for assaults in our prisons for 2013 are set out in Table 3 below.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service has successfully introduced a number of measures across the prison estate such as, hand-held metal detectors, netting over prison yards, boss chairs and security screening machines to detect and prevent weapons from entering the prison to limit the scope of acts of violence. In addition, new prisoner programmes have been introduced such as the Incentivised Regimes policy which provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour. The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure.</p><p><b>Table 1</b><table><tr><th>Institution</th><th>Number in custody</th><th>Number on Trial/Remand</th></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (Male)</td><td>542</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (Female)</td><td>96</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>93</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>St. Patrick's</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>347</td><td>228</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>480</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>795</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>222</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>234</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (Male)</td><td>229</td><td>53</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (Female)</td><td>26</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>309</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>135</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>131</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>97</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>3,737</td><td>451</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 2</b><table><tr><th>Institution</th><th>Aged 21 to 24</th><th>Number on remand (aged 21 to 24)</th></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (Male)</td><td>92</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (Female)</td><td>7</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>64</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>66</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>106</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>30</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>39</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (Male)</td><td>54</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (Female)</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>46</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>8</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>15</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>544</td><td>77</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Table 3</b><table><tr><th>Prison/Place of Detention</th><th>Number of Prisoner on Prisoner Assaults by prison 2014</th><th>Number of Prisoner Assaults on Staff by prison 2014</th></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td>6</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td>95</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td>90</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>51</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>D&oacute;chas Centre</td><td>16</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (F)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (M)</td><td>37</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>77</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (Male) </td><td>96</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>St. Patrick's Institution</td><td>9</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td>11</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td>74 </td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>PSEC</td><td>2</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>564</td><td>144</td></tr></table></p></reply>

/><br />As outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012 - 2015, it is intended to align the bed capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system. This has been completed for 9 out of the 14 prisons in the State. The number in custody on 5th May (3,737) represented 94% of the Inspector of Prisons recommended total of 3,982.<br /><br />The Deputy will be aware that the average number of prisoners in custody in Ireland rose from 3,321 during 2007 to 4,318 during 2012, an increase of over 30%. Likewise the total number of committals to prison also rose sharply during the same period, from 11,934 in 2007 to 17,026 in 2012 &ndash; an increase of over 43%.<br /><br />2013 saw the first significant decrease in prison numbers since 2007. There were 15,735 committals to prison in 2013 which was a decrease of 7.6% on the 2012 figure. The overall daily average number of prisoners in custody has also dropped in recent years.  The average number in custody for 2014 was 3,916 a reduction of 10.8% on the 2011 average of 4,390.<br /><br />The Deputy may wish to note that the number in custody reached a peak of 4,621 on 23rd February 2011. Today there are 884 less prisoners in custody which represents a decrease of 18%.</p></reply>

The cells will be approximately 12 square meters each which is in excess of the Inspector of Prisons recommendations for double occupancy.</p>  <p>  Subject to the completion of the tender process and final sanction being obtained it is expected that the project will commence in mid-2016 with a completion date of late 2018.

The main reason for this is because there has been a significant increase in the number of older prisoners in the prison system. Information collated from the end of month snapshot taken by the Irish Prison Service on Saturday 31st January 2015, indicated there were 223 prisoners in custody aged 55 and over, 26 of whom were on remand.</p>  <p>  Work on the development and implementation of this strategy is underway and will be implemented over the lifetime of the Strategic Plan. In line with this commitment the Irish Prison Service is currently finalising a policy document for older prisoners.  The Policy will seek to ensure that older adults in prison are identified as specific groups of individuals who have particular needs within the prison population.  Central to the development of tailored services for older prisoners, is the development of a specific facility to better cater for the needs of older persons.  The Irish Prison Service is considering a number of options, and I understand that the publication of the Older Persons Policy and an announcement of proposals to develop a dedicated facility for older prisoners will be made later in the year.</p></reply>

The Deputy may also be aware of the ongoing process to civilianise border control functions at Dublin airport and the transfer of these responsibilities from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department.</p>  <p>  We will continue to maximise the number of civilian support staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that highly trained Garda&iacute; can be released from administrative tasks to frontline operational policing.</p></reply>

The law in this area was most recently amended by the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 which amended the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 with the aim of reducing access to alcohol and at the same time strengthening measures to tackle public disorder and antisocial behaviour.</p>  <p>  Under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 (as amended), it is an offence for a licence holder to sell or deliver, or permit another person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years of age.</p>  <p>  Under the 1988 Act it is also illegal for a person under 18 years to buy intoxicating liquor or to consume it in any place outside their home (or in another person's home where they are present by right or with permission). Where a Garda suspects that a person is under 18 years and that that person, or anyone accompanying that person, is in possession of intoxicating liquor for the purpose of consuming it in a place other than a private dwelling, the Garda may seek an explanation and if not satisfied with the reply, he or she may seize the intoxicating liquor if it is not handed over voluntarily.</p>  <p>  The Garda National Age Card scheme is an important mechanism to help verify age in relation to the sale of intoxicating liquor. The scheme is administered by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and has facilitated Garda&iacute;, in cooperation with the licensed trade, in addressing and combating the problem of underage drinking. The 1988 Act, as amended, also makes provision for the test purchasing of intoxicating liquor. The primary objective of the scheme is to enable the Garda&iacute; to target licensed premises which are suspected of engaging in illegal sales of intoxicating liquor to persons under 18 years of age.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 (as amended) also permits An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to seize bottles or containers containing intoxicating liquor where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder or damage to property and require a person to leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner. Incidents of public disorder and anti-social behaviour arising from the abuse of intoxicating liquor reported to the Garda&iacute; are the subject of investigation and dealt with appropriately, including by juvenile or adult caution, fixed charge penalty notices or commencement of criminal proceedings.</p>  <p>  The Children Act 2001, as amended, also provides for a number of measures in relation to parental responsibility in the case of children involved in anti-social behaviour and children found guilty of offences. These include parental supervision and compensation orders. These measures are fully operational and available to the courts. It should be noted, however, that the imposition of any particular sanction on the parents or guardians of an offending child is a matter for the courts.</p></reply>

It is important to note, however, that this is a remedy which applies in the main to commercial property, which may include &lsquo;buy-to-let&rsquo; residential property. It does not, therefore, apply to the principal dwellings of defaulting borrowers.</p>  <p>  The appointment of a receiver is normally an alternative to the lender seeking actual repossession of the mortgaged property. Instead of taking possession, a receiver is appointed to manage the property; in the case of commercial premises, the goal may be to achieve more efficient management and operation of a viable business; in the case of &lsquo;buy-to-let&rsquo; residential property, the intention is more often to collect rental income produced by the property and to divert it towards servicing the mortgage.</p>  <p>  I am of course conscious that the appointment of a receiver over mortgaged property is likely to be both traumatic and stressful for the borrowers involved or, indeed, for any tenants involved. I would therefore urge receivers to act with tact and consideration; above all, they must act within the laws governing their appointment and the law of the land.</p>  <p>  While I am aware from media reports of the incident referred to by the Deputy, it appears to be an isolated exception to the general rule. I am aware that the Banking and Payments Federation has published a "Residential Tenant's Guide to Receivership" which provides tenants of residential property to which a receiver has been appointed with useful guidance and information on the receiver's role and powers (available on www.bpfi.ie). I intend writing to the Federation to suggest preparation of a separate Guide to deal with the role and powers of receivers appointed to other categories of commercial property. I have also asked my Department to keep this issue under review.</p></reply>

The process leading to deportation is extensive with many avenues of appeal, including judicial review in the High Court, open to persons subject to Deportation Orders.</p>  <p>  In determining whether to make a Deportation Order, the Minister must have regard to the factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.</p>  <p>  This essentially means that the safety of returning a person, or refoulement as it is commonly referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a Deportation Order i.e. that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a State where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that there were three persons who initially claimed asylum as Liberian nationals deported in 2011 and one deported in 2013.</p></reply>

More than 100,000 children benefit from this investment each year. These programmes are in addition to the support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit.</p>  <p>  The childcare programmes include the universal free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  In the region of 67,000 children benefit each year from the free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50 with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families.  In the case of full day care, parents can have up to &euro;95 per week deducted from the overall charge. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  each year from the CCS programme.  </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the work force or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) programme providing &euro;145 per week for full day care where parents are availing of training and education courses provided by Solas or the Education Training Board (ETB).  An After-School Child Care (ASCC) programme was introduced and provides &euro;40 per week for after-school care, or &euro;80 per week where a pick up service is available, with &euro;105 per week for full day childcare during the holiday period.  A Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme has also been introduced and provides up to &euro;80 a week to support qualifying parents who are participating in Community Employment (CE) schemes.  </p>  <p>  The funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children.  The Group will submit its final report to Government in June 2015. </p></reply>

It was intended to visit Russia in January of this year. However it has been decided to liaise with officials in the Ministry of Education and Science in Russia to ensure that Irish proposals in regard the provision of post placement reports are acceptable to the Russian Federation.  </p>  <p>  The Irish Constitution protects the integrity of family life and that once adopted in Ireland the child is treated in the same way as other Irish children. This means that the ability of the State to intervene in a family, when a child&rsquo;s welfare and protection is not compromised, is limited. The Department has advised the Russian Federation of this Constitutional imperative in instances where families, who had given commitments to the Russian authorities in regard to the provision of post placement reports, fail to adhere to those commitments.  In these instances the State has no legislative power to enforce compliance with the commitments given by Irish families, legal or otherwise, to provide post placement reports. It is imperative that this matter is fully addressed so as to ensure that further discussions on other aspects of the bilateral agreement are beneficial.</p></reply>

Under these Acts, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The definition of a child contained in both Acts is that of a person under 18 years of age who is not or has not been married. A child may be brought into care in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 on a voluntary basis or, if necessary, a child may be received into care by Court order.</p>  <p>  Young people leaving the care of the State at 18 years of age are entitled to an aftercare service. Aftercare is the term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of such young people to assist them in making the transition to independent living. It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires.</p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.</p>  <p>  Current aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support. Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 are being introduced on a phased basis. The Act provides for a number of supports to those in care and care leavers. These include the introduction of &lsquo;continuing care&rsquo;, a new legal term to describe care leavers who remain in their &lsquo;looked after&rsquo; (care) placement up to the age of 21. Local authorities have a new duty to provide care leavers with a continuation of the kinds of support they received prior to leaving care. In essence, the young person has ceased to be looked after but the local authority continues to provide them with a looked after placement and any necessary support until their 22nd   birthday; akin to aftercare services for children leaving care in this State.</p>  <p>  Once a young person moves on from continuing care, they do not have the right to return to a continuing care placement. A care leaver who opts for aftercare upon leaving their looked after placement cannot subsequently claim continuing care support.</p>  <p>  93% of children in care in Ireland are in foster care. At the end of September 2014, 56% of the 1,698 young people aged 18 to 23 years in receipt of an aftercare service were in full-time education. A significant number of these care leavers are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.</p>  <p>  Young people who do not have family support from a foster carer or family base are assisted in finding accommodation in supported lodgings, sheltered housing or independent accommodation and encouraged and supported financially in furthering their training and education. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare in Ireland. The approach proposed is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person.  The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.</p></reply>

It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS Action Plan. It involves 124 locally managed projects and provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million was provided for the School Completion Programme. The Agency has indicated  a similar allocation for the programme in 2015.</p>  <p>  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year. The first two instalments of 2014/15 funding have issued to local projects, with a third instalment planned for this month.  </p>  <p>  The ESRI is currently reviewing the School Completion Programme, which will help in future decisions on its structure, governance and operation. Its final report is expected very shortly. The Minister for Education and Skills recently published an evaluation of the DEIS programme which was also prepared by the ESRI, and which refers to the School Completion Programme as an integral support within DEIS in improving attendance and engagement in education. </p>  <p>  I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services.The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency&rsquo;s educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving. </p></reply>

The programme constitutes a potentially significant step in achieving the policy objective of moving closer to a position where an enhanced focus of services is on prevention and early intervention rather than crisis management.  This was a key rationale for the Government's establishment of the Child and Family Agency at the beginning of 2014 and is clearly reflected in the statutory responsibilities the Agency has been assigned.  </p><p>On that same date I published the national High Level Policy Statement on Supporting Parents and Families (Parenting and Family Support).

The policy orientation is very much geared towards developing the prevention and early intervention capability at the services level.</p><p>In relation to the request for information about particular programmes, I would direct the Deputy to the Agency&rsquo;s website () where there is a range and variety of resource materials available in that regard.

The purpose of this VR Facility is to achieve a permanent reduction in numbers and to facilitate ongoing health sector reform.  Voluntary redundancy will give many managers greater flexibility in implementing the measures needed to remain within budget. It will provide scope to reduce employee numbers in the context of changing health sector structures and health reforms.  The VR Facility was made available by the HSE with effect from 1st January 2014.</p>  <p>  The VR Facility will be implemented on a rolling basis as appropriate areas and functions are identified.  It is important to emphasise that there is no automatic right to voluntary redundancy; staff may be offered voluntary redundancy in the context of current and future business needs and service provision priorities.  The HSE will continue to operate the Targeted VR Facility as a key element in the reform of the health service.  It will enable the HSE and other service providers to maximise the quantum and quality of services provided within the resources available. </p>  <p>  I have no plans to introduce any other redundancy measures at this time.</p></reply>

No. 366 of 2013 and S.I. No. 367 of  2013, which assign responsibility to HIQA for registering and inspecting residential services for children and adults with disabilities, including respite services.</p>  <p>  All HIQA findings are detailed in the reports as are the actions that must be taken by the provider or person in charge of a designated centre to ensure compliance with HIQA's National Standards for Residential Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities.</p>  <p>  HIQA published more than 550 inspection reports in respect of disability residential services in 2014.  The lessons learned from these inspections are continuing to improve the quality of services.  Clients and their families can be assured that this regulatory regime is being rolled out across all residential facilities for people with a disability. </p>  <p>  By the end of March 2015, HIQA inspectors had inspected 66.5% of designated centres.  In general, inspectors have seen examples of very good service provision where the support and care needs of residents have been clearly prioritised and there is evidence of a focus on the needs of service users.  However, I am also aware of the serious concerns raised by HIQA regarding the level of care that people with a disability are receiving in a number of disability centres, including St. Anne&rsquo;s in Tipperary.  The HSE is fully engaged with the Daughters of Charity and other service providers, to address the  issues raised in the reports. </p>  <p>  The purpose of the regulations is to safeguard and support the delivery of person-centred care to vulnerable people of any age who are receiving residential care services and ensure that their health, well-being and quality of life is promoted and protected.  Over 670 inspections have taken place to date.  Compliance with HIQA standards is a requirement under the Service Level Arrangements between the HSE and voluntary service providers under Section 38 and 39 of the Health Acts.</p>  <p>  The HSE is implementing a comprehensive change programme of measures to improve the quality and safety of residential services for people with disabilities.  Much work remains to be carried out to ensure all facilities comply with Disability Residential Standards.  While this is challenging, we must remember that the objective is to safeguard vulnerable people.</p>  <p>  I have asked the National Disability Authority (NDA) to carry out an independent review of the experience of interested stakeholders involved in the registration and inspection system, since it commenced in November 2013.  This will capture learning to date in order to ensure any issues emerging can be addressed and to promulgate good practice around the system.  The NDA is expected to have completed its final report in June 2015.</p></reply>

The infection is generally mild affecting only the skin, but can occasionally be more severe and debilitating.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis is a notifiable infectious disease, the notifiable entity being the more severe neurological form, Lyme neuroborreliosis.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collects and collates surveillance data on the condition.  20 cases of the condition have been provisionally notified in 2014.  This number is likely to fall following validation.</p>  <p>  Lyme borreliosis can be asymptomatic or have a range of clinical presentations.  Current best advice is that diagnosis should be made only after careful examination of the patient's clinical history, physical findings, laboratory evidence and exposure risk evaluation.  Exposure to ticks prior to disease manifestations is necessary for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Since an awareness or recollection of a tick-bite is not always present, however, this should not exclude the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.  Later stages require the use of antibody detection tests (or advanced DNA detection techniques).  Testing for Lyme Disease is undertaken in most of the larger hospitals in Ireland.  In undertaking Lyme testing, it is essential that the results are interpreted in the light of the clinical condition of the patient.  If the result of this initial screen is equivocal, the patient's samples are referred to the U.K.'s Public Health England Porton Down facility which uses a two-tier system recommended by American and European authorities.  This involves a screening serological test followed by a confirmatory serological test.  Because of the general availability of initial screening for Lyme disease in Ireland and the provision of a confirmatory testing service in the UK, there is no need for Irish citizens to travel abroad for testing.</p>  <p>  Common antibiotics such as doxycycline or amoxicillin are effective at clearing the rash and helping to prevent the development of complications.  They are generally given for up to three weeks.  If complications develop, intravenous antibiotics may need to be used.  Anyone who suspects they may have contracted Lyme Disease should consult their GP who will arrange appropriate testing and treatment. </p>  <p>  The Scientific Advisory Committee of the HPSC has established a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee.  The aim of this Sub-Committee is to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise the harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  These strategies will be published in a Final Report.  In addition to staff from the HPSC, the membership of the Sub-Committee includes specialists in Public Health Medicine, Consultants in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Microbiology, Occupational Health an Entomologist from the Parks and Wildlife Service, a representative from the Local Government Management Agency and an Environmental Health Officer.  A representative from the Patients' Association is also being sought.  The Terms of Reference of the Sub-Committee are:</p>  <p>-  To raise awareness in Ireland of Lyme Borreliosis amongst clinicians and the general public;</p>  <p>-  To identify and highlight best international practice in raising awareness about Lyme Borreliosis for the General Public;</p>  <p>-  To develop policies of primary prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland based on best international evidence;</p>  <p>-  To explore ways in which to improve surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Ireland;</p>  <p>-  To develop strategies to raise awareness among the public particularly in areas of higher tick populations;</p>  <p>-  To produce a Final Report covering all the above areas.</p>  <p>  The Sub-Committee will hold its inaugural meeting today.</p>  <p>  With regard to continuing professional development, the content and composition of professional competence schemes for general practitioners is a matter for the Medical Council and the recognised postgraduate training bodies.  In line with the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Act, as of May 2011, doctors are legally obliged to maintain their professional competence by enrolling in approved professional competence schemes and following requirements set by the Medical Council.  In this context, the Council has established a range of professional competence schemes through formal arrangements with the recognised postgraduate training bodies.  Schemes are operated by the postgraduate training bodies and have been developed to drive good professional practice, which is centred on patient safety and quality of patient care.</p>  <p>  Should a specific service need for continuing professional development for public health nurses be identified, it would be addressed and delivered utilising a collaborative approach involving the registrant, health service provider/employer and educators.  Stakeholders include the HSE-Office of Nursing and Midwifery Services Director, the Centres for Nursing and Midwifery Education and School of Nursing and Midwifery within the higher education sector.</p></reply>

Prior to reimbursing any medicine, the HSE considers of a range of statutory criteria  including clinical need, cost-effectiveness and the resources available to the HSE.</p>  <p>  The decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics. They are not political or Ministerial decisions. </p>  <p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Fampridine in the GMS and community drugs schemes. The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>   In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate sufficient effectiveness and a fair price for Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. </p>  <p>  On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. </p>  <p>  It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE for the inclusion of Fampridine on the community drugs schemes incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of the drug, by offering a reduced price or both. A revised application was received by the HSE on 25 July 2014. The HSE has since been engaging with the company seeking an improved commercial offering and these engagements have been completed. It is not possible to say when a decision on the funding of this medication will be made as the HSE is considering the outcome of those commercial engagements as well as the outcome of discussions which the HSE has had with clinical experts regarding this drug.</p></reply>

The objective of this scheme is to support early learning in a formal setting in advance of starting school. I understand that certain flexibilities are built into the scheme in an effort to accommodate children with special needs, such as an overage exemption, or waiver, for children with special needs who do not meet the age criteria and the option to avail of the free pre-school year over two years.  </p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the free pre-school year.  However, the HSE does work at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability service providers to address individual needs as they arise.  This is done, for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities. In some limited cases at local level, disability services have also facilitated children with disabilities to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing assistant supports where possible and where resources are available. The provision of such pre-school assistant supports should not be confused with the Special Needs Assistants who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post-primary school settings.       </p>  <p>  In general terms, the HSE&rsquo;s role in supporting children with disabilities involves it working in close co-operation with the disability service providers that it funds, with the education sector, with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and with the parents and families of the children in question.  At national level, the Departments of Children and Youth Affairs, Education and Skills and Health are actively looking at the issue of the integration of children with disabilities into mainstream pre-school settings, informed by work undertaken by the Cross Sectoral Team on children's disability issues.  </p>  <p>  The particular issues raised by the Deputy are service matters for the Health Services Executive.  Accordingly I have arranged for the questions to be referred to the HSE for direct reply to the Deputy.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

The Government decided that the preparatory work required for a new travel subsidy scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health. The Department is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns. Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme. Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer. The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for 2015. In the meantime, monthly payments have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time that the scheme closed, in the interests of preventing hardship.</p>  <p>  The Revenue Commissioners operate a scheme - Disabled Drivers and Passengers Tax Relief for Vehicles Purchased for use by People with Disabilities - which provides for a range of tax reliefs in connection with the purchase and use of motor vehicles.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p></reply>

The model of care produced by the ACS Programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  The Programme was also informed by models of care from the US and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24/7 requirements of this service.</p>  <p>  The review looked at the number of centres that should be delivering PPCI in Dublin, where these centres should be located and the feasibility of maintaining 9 to 5 PPCI services on any cardiology intervention site.  Following consultation with the National Ambulance Service and with all relevant hospitals, the ACS Programme recommended that there should be two 24/7 PPCI centres for Dublin, located in the Mater and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, which would accept all ambulance transfers of patients with STEMI.</p>  <p>  The designation of PPCI centres outside Dublin is based on the recommendations of the ACS Programme report of 2012 as follows -  Cork University hospital (24/7), University Hospital Waterford (9-5) and Galway University hospital (24/7).</p>  <p>  Therefore the decision was based on best practice.

Encouraging more people to join the market at younger ages helps spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market, helping to support affordable premiums for all. Since 1 May, &lsquo;late entry loadings&rsquo; will apply for those aged 35 and over who did not purchase health insurance prior to that date. The loadings are set at 2% per year starting at age 35, up to a maximum loading of 70% at age 69 and over. Where an individual is resident in the State, there was a grace period until 30 April 2015 to allow as many people as possible to take out health insurance without incurring loadings.</p>  <p>  The Irish public health system provides for two categories of eligibility for persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical cardholders) and limited eligibility (all others). Persons with full eligibility are entitled to a range of services including all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. Persons with limited eligibility are eligible for in-patient and outpatient public hospital services including consultant services, subject to certain charges. Private health insurance in this country is optional. The eligibility of a resident in the Republic, working elsewhere as a cross-border worker and entitled to treatment by the health service where they work, does not impact upon their capacity to purchase voluntary health insurance in this State. All residents in this State during the current grace period, who choose to wait until after 30 April 2015 to purchase private health insurance, will be subject to the provisions of the LCR regulations.</p></reply>

It concluded that there are both &lsquo;core&rsquo; and &lsquo;discretionary&rsquo; fire service roles. The provision of specific assistance by fire service crews at the request of the National Ambulance Service (NAS) is regarded as a discretionary role, in so far as it is not a statutory function of fire authorities.</p>  <p>  As I recently indicated, I am very supportive of the development of emergency first responder (EFR) capability across all our emergency services, including our fire services. Fire services are well placed geographically and this would be an excellent enhancement of existing emergency medical response capacity and resources in communities across Ireland. In addition, it would very neatly complement the voluntary network of community first response teams which is already in place.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that fire services collaborate closely with other emergency services in the interests of the communities they serve. In a number of areas, there are already local arrangements between the NAS and fire services to provide EFR assistance for 112/999 calls, in particular for cardiac incidents. Given the potential value of such arrangements to get help to people as quickly as possible and the obvious patient benefit, I would very much like to see consideration at national level, between the NAS and fire services, as to how best to approach this issue, particularly in terms of operational interaction and clinical governance. This is being done for community first response and that may be a good model for fire services emergency response.</p></reply>

Firstly, there is the issue of recruitment of nurses educated and trained in Ireland.  The Office of the Nursing and Midwifery Services Director have been supportive in allowing the nursing home sector meet with graduate students in the universities.  The Chief Nursing Office in the Department has been engaged with, the nursing home sector in promoting nursing in the older adult as a career choice.  The Office has facilitated discussions, spoken at conferences and engaged with 3rd level universities on seeking solutions to this issue.  Discussions have involved exploring career pathways within older people services to encourage staff into this area of nursing practice.</p>  <p>  The second area under review, relates to the recruitment of global nurses.  There are 3 adaptation courses available this year.  One has already taken place in April and two more will be held in June and August.  These courses are 6 weeks in duration and facilitate the integration of global nurses to nursing in an Irish context.  Of the 195 places available only 60 places have been taken to date.  The nursing home sector are aware of these vacancies.</p>  <p>  In addition, options are being explored with an Irish university to offer a one-day programme of assessment through an examination format.  The pilot of this programme will be complete and results available in the last quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

Persons with full eligibility (medical card holders) are entitled to a range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultant services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and maternity and infant care services.  People with limited eligibility (non-medical card holders) are entitled, subject to certain charges, to all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultant services and out-patient pubic hospital services including consultant services.</p>  <p>  Separate to the public health system, my Department oversees the maintenance of a competitive and sustainable private health insurance market, under the provisions of the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2014, and monitors developments on an ongoing basis to ensure that the market is regulated appropriately.  The policy objective of introducing Lifetime Community Rating (LCR) to the health insurance market is to encourage people to purchase health insurance at a younger age, as community-rated markets depend on a continuing influx of younger people to help spread the costs of older and less healthy people across the market and helping to support affordable community-rated premiums for everyone who wishes to purchase insurance.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the purchase of private health insurance is optional.  The regulatory framework governing health insurance, such as late entry loadings under LCR and the application of waiting periods for new health insurance customers, applies to all persons choosing to purchase health insurance and is not related to a persons eligibility, or previous eligibility, for public health services.  I am satisfied that this measure is fully justified for the purposes of maintaining a stable insurance market which provides equity of treatment between young and old.</p></reply>

In our statement of Health priorities for 2015, the Minister for Health and I have reiterated our commitment to implementing the Strategy.</p>  <p>  The National Positive Ageing Strategy provides a vision for an age-friendly society and includes four National Goals and underpinning Objectives to provide direction on the issues that need to be addressed to promote positive ageing.  As Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am driving implementation at political level.  The Strategy is a cross-Departmental one and my Department has an overall coordinating and collating role and a more direct role for the health-related objectives.</p>  <p>  A key objective of this Strategy is to change the mindsets of decision makers across Government agencies and to raise the priority that is given to the concerns of older people.  The first step in doing this is to establish a system of regular reporting on actions and initiatives that impact on older people, and these reports are regularly sought and collated by my Department.  The fact that such reports are already and will continue to be required will in itself increase the focus that is given to older persons' issues, and these reports will be submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Sector Reform chaired by An Taoiseach.  Implementation is accordingly an ongoing process.</p>  <p>  It is important to point out the many initiatives already in train which contribute to the Strategy's goals.  For example, in the health sector, in the area of older people&rsquo;s services and supports, the Review of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will be completed shortly.  The Single Assessment Tool, which will allow for a systematic assessment of need and allocation of services to older people, is being developed by the HSE; measures are being taken to ensure integrated care for older patients, and palliative care services are being improved.  The Deputy will also be aware of the recent initiative which saw an additional &euro;25million provided to address the issue of delayed discharges in acute hospitals.  The majority of these patients are older people, and these funds are being applied across both long term and short term residential services and at community level.  As a result the waiting time for funding of approved patients under the Nursing Home Support scheme has fallen to eleven weeks now from fifteen weeks a short time ago.</p>  <p>  A Healthy and Positive Ageing  Initiative (HaPAI) has also been established to implement the research objective of the National Positive Ageing Strategy.  It is a joint initiative between the Department of Health, the HSE&rsquo;s Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Atlantic Philanthropies and will run from October 2014 to December 2017, with a commitment to Department of Health funding for a further two years.  The Initiative will monitor changes in older people&rsquo;s health and wellbeing linked to the Goals and Objectives of the Positive Ageing Strategy.  This will be done primarily through the development of positive ageing indicators to be published every two years.  The HSE will also develop a physical activity communications campaign under the Initiative.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-06a.1068.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600065#WRQ03400"><p>As of 17 April 2015, there are two 24/7 primary percutaneous intervention (PPCI) centres for Dublin, located in the Mater and St James&rsquo;s Hospitals.  These centres accept all ambulance transfers of patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).  The provision of PPCI  from three 24/7 centres in Dublin (St Vincent's, the Mater and St James&rsquo;s Hospitals) had proved unsustainable and the decision to consolidate the service into two centres was made following a comprehensive review and reflects the international trend towards the consolidation of such specialised services on smaller number of sites, to allow for the concentration of volume and expertise.</p>  <p>  In November 2014, the Acute Hospitals Division of the HSE requested the National Clinical Programme for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS Programme) to review the current configuration of PPCI services in Dublin, having regard to the requirement to deliver safe, sustainable services on the designated sites.  The model of care produced by the ACS Programme was informed by advice from the principals involved in centres in the UK and other European countries.  The Programme was also informed by models of care from the US and Australia.  Experience at national and international level highlights the importance of having sustainable rotas of clinical staff to support the 24/7 requirements of this service.</p>  <p>  The review looked at the number of centres that should be delivering PPCI in Dublin, where these centres should be located and the feasibility of maintaining 9 to 5 PPCI services on any cardiology intervention site.  Following consultation with the National Ambulance Service and with all relevant hospitals, the ACS Programme recommended that there should be two 24/7 PPCI centres for Dublin, located in the Mater and St. James&rsquo;s Hospitals, which would accept all ambulance transfers of patients with STEMI.</p>  <p>  The ACS Programme also recommended that there should be a clear definition of the role of the three other cardiology intervention centres in Dublin (Beaumont Hospital, Tallaght Hospital and St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital  in the management of Non ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI).  NSTEMI forms an increasing proportion of interventional work which will continue and develop in those cardiology intervention centres which will not be designated 24/7 PPCI centres, including St Vincent&rsquo;s Hospital.</p></reply>

It is essential that the hospital trust legislation is developed as part of the overall reform process and that the appropriate structures are in place in advance of formal establishment of trusts.

There were 647 applications in 2011 and 436 applications were received by the HSE in 2012 to the end of September that year.  The number of applications for Mobility Allowance for 2010 was 821.  There were 978 applications in 2011 and 780 applications were received in 2012 to the end of September that year.</p>  <p>  The Department is putting together a tabular breakdown of the national figures above by local health area and will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.  This information relates to 2010, 2011 and 2012 up to the end of September 2012.  The figures for 2008 and 2009 are not readily available.</p>  <p>  Work is ongoing on the policy proposals to be brought to Government for the drafting of primary legislation for a new scheme.  Once policy proposals have been finalised and approved by Government, the time frame for the introduction of a new scheme will become clearer.  The Health (Transport Supports) Bill is included in the Government's legislative programme for 2015.

Accordingly, funding was allocated in the HSE Service Plan for 2015 for the appointment of an orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist and support staff at Crumlin.  This will maximise the use of available theatre sessions in the hospital.  The first of these additional staff is now in post, and recruitment for the remaining posts is in process.  In addition, capital funding has been agreed for a new theatre on site at Crumlin, which will expand theatre capacity further.  As a further measure, available capacity is being identified in other hospitals and some children are being transferred for their surgery, where it is considered clinically appropriate for them. </p>  <p>  Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is required to manage and deliver, or arrange to be delivered on its behalf, health and personal social services.

The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The Committee received over fifty written submissions on the General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The hearings commenced on the 10 March and concluded on the 23 April.</p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will make it illegal to sell or advertise for sale alcohol at a price below a set minimum price.  Minimum Unit Pricing (MUP) sets a minimum price per gram of alcohol.  The minimum price of an alcohol product would be based on the number of grams of alcohol in the product.  MUP is a targeted measure, aimed at those who drink in a harmful and hazardous manner, and designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  MUP is able to target cheaper alcohol relative to its strength because the minimum price is determined by and is directly proportional to the amount of pure alcohol in the drink.  The University of Sheffield study reported that the alcohol products most affected by this policy are those that are currently being sold very cheaply, often below cost prices, in the off-trade, i.e. supermarkets and off-licences.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of duty free alcohol products or artisan beers sold at full retail prices.  The General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill does not provide for any exemptions to minimum unit pricing.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  Parliamentary Counsel has been assigned to draft the Bill.  It is expected that the Bill will be published during the Spring/Summer Session 2015.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, 44% of the Irish population has private health insurance and many people opt to be treated privately.  </p>  <p>  The private health insurers operate in a competitive market and are free to impose certain terms and conditions on their policies, providing they comply with the Minimum Benefit Regulations.  For services that are covered by private health insurance, each private health insurance provider in the Irish market has the right to determine which health care provider they will cover for the benefit of their customers.  It is a matter for each insurer to determine how much capacity in any particular area is purchased by it to deliver the services required by its members. </p>  <p>  The private health insurers have no legal obligation to cover all public hospitals, and may opt to offer plans that do not cover certain hospitals, providing they are in compliance with the health insurance legislation.  </p>  <p>  While the introduction of lower-cost, more affordable health insurance plans is welcome, cost should not be the only factor considered by consumers when selecting a health insurance product.  It is also important to select a plan that provides an adequate level of cover and that consumers are fully aware of any reduced level of cover provided at the time of purchase.  All insurers offer a 14 day "cooling-off" period from the commencement of a customer's contract during which time a person may cancel and get a full refund.</p></reply>

The HSE introduced an embargo on recruitment in 2007, and this was followed by the moratorium on recruitment and promotion in the public sector in 2008.  The HSE has had the capacity to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front-line services. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced in Budget 2015 that he intends to delegate greater autonomy to Departments and Agencies to manage their own staffing levels.  The change from the application of a rigid employment control framework, with its particular focus on a moratorium on recruitment and compliance with employment ceilings and targets, to one operating strictly within allocated pay frameworks will allow for recruitment where it is determined that this can achieve more economical service delivery. </p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) has advised that the HSE and Department of Health are required to submit a 2015 Pay and Numbers Strategy, outlining planned pay expenditure and staff numbers.  Following approval of the strategy by DPER, a letter of delegated sanction will be issued.  As this process is still ongoing, the existing moratorium and Employment Control Framework arrangements will continue to apply.  However the number of nurses employed has already increased by nearly 500 in the past 12 months.  This increase partly reflects the initiative being undertaken by the HSE to reduce reliance on agency and to offer contracts of employment where agency can be replaced by full time posts.  The increase also reflects the continuing capacity of the HSE to recruit where it is necessary to deliver front line services.</p></reply>

I am aware of many statements of sympathy by European leaders on this centenary, including some which referred to genocide.  However, the position remains that there is no international consensus and neither the UN nor the EU have adopted a position on this case.</p>  <p>  At this time of centenaries, when we in Ireland hope that our commemorations will increase mutual understanding, I would again urge both Turkey and Armenia to take advantage of any opportunity for reconciliation between their two peoples.

The main focus of the resolution was the setting up of an ad hoc committee to elaborate a binding debt resolution mechanism.  Following detailed consideration of the proposal and discussions with our EU partners and other UN members, Ireland, and our EU partners, were unable to support the Resolution.  </p>  <p>  We engaged actively and in good faith in the process, including through the extensive efforts of our Permanent Representative to the UN. We supported the EU's statement clarifying the important considerations which informed the negotiating approach on the Resolution, as follows:  </p>  <p>  &ldquo;The ad-hoc committee must be limited to the elaboration of a non-binding 'set of principles' which builds upon a market-based voluntary contractual approach to sovereign debt restructuring and aims at furthering its implementation and use.  Neither the EU nor Member States will participate in discussions aiming at the establishment of a binding multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring processes.</p>  <p>  The ad-hoc committee should reflect the recent and ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring undertaken in the IMF, subject to the previous considerations, and should take place in close coordination with and with technical support from the Fund.  Discussions should also make reference to the work in other fora on these issues, such as the Paris Club, which has a history of discussing sovereign debt restructuring issues.&rdquo;</p>  <p>  In the event, the Resolution continued to propose the elaboration of a new legal framework and, in these circumstances, Ireland, in common with EU partners, will not be participating in the work of the committee.</p>  <p>  Ireland is actively engaged in ongoing global processes to address the issue of sovereign debt restructuring.  Work being undertaken at other levels, including in the IMF and at the Third International Conference on Financing for Development to be held in Addis Ababa in July, offer appropriate, established and constructive means for meaningful dialogue on the matter.  We are playing our full role, in partnership with our EU colleagues, in working for the success of the Financing for Development Conference in Addis, which is central to the ongoing negotiations on a new framework for global development to follow on from the Millennium Development Goals.  These major international negotiations at the UN are being co-chaired by Ireland's Permanent Representative to the UN, with Kenya. </p>  <p>  We recognise the importance of continuing to address global debt issues in a development context and will continue to engage in processes, in appropriate fora, that promote constructive dialogue and propose effective and suitable mechanisms to support the countries most seriously affected.</p></reply>

For this year, the Government is providing just over &euro;600 million in Official Development Assistance (ODA).  Of this, &euro;476 million is being managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under Vote 27 &ndash; International Cooperation.  </p>  <p>  Responding to humanitarian emergencies and their aftermath is a central feature of the Irish Aid programme.  We recognise the obligation to provide emergency humanitarian assistance, to save lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity in the most difficult situations.  Recovery assistance provides focused support to countries emerging from conflict or natural disasters, assisting affected populations re-establish their lives.  In responding to emergencies and their aftermath, Irish Aid provides funding to a variety of partners in order to best meet the needs of affected communities.  These include host Governments, Irish and international NGOs, the International Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, and multilateral agencies such as the UN.  Further detail is included in the statistical annexes to the Irish Aid annual report, available on the website at www.irishaid.ie.</p>  <p>  We engage closely with trusted NGO partners, with whom we have a longstanding and proven partnership, so that support can quickly reach those in need of assistance.  National and international NGOs represent a key group within the humanitarian community, particularly in implementing relief operations on the ground.  Through specially designed funding schemes, Irish Aid provides funding to these partner agencies to respond to crises quickly and in the most effective way.</p>  <p>  The Irish people have consistently demonstrated their generosity in responding to humanitarian emergencies and crises around the world.  Donating to a registered charity is the best way to help in a time of crisis.  This support enables registered and experienced relief organisations to purchase exactly what those who have been affected by a humanitarian crisis need most urgently.  A list of registered charities is available from the Development NGO umbrella group, D&oacute;chas (www.dochas.ie).</p></reply>

This has involved a wave of killings, militias acting with impunity, arbitrary arrests, intimidation, closure of media outlets and targeting of human rights defenders.  </p>  <p>  Burundi has experienced recurring violence over the years since its independence in 1962.  The signing of the Arusha Peace Agreement in 2000 was a significant step forward in efforts to build lasting peace and stability in the country.  The adoption of a new Constitution in 2005, establishing a power-sharing arrangement between ethnic groups, was another important milestone.</p>  <p>  Given slow but steady progress over the past fifteen years, the violence is particularly worrying, and it was avoidable.  The street protests arose in response to a decision by Burundi&rsquo;s ruling party, the National Council for the Defense of Democracy, to name the incumbent President, Pierre Nkurunziza, as its candidate for a third presidential term in elections scheduled for June.  Whether or not this breaches the term-limits established by the Arusha Agreement, as has been claimed, is now subject to a review by the Burundian Constitutional Court.  </p>  <p>  It is critically important that Burundi now acts to embrace a process of peaceful democratic transition by ensuring that next month's elections are demonstrably free and credible.     </p>  <p>  I am following the situation through our Ambassador in Dar-es-Salaam, who is also accredited to Burundi.  I share the strong concern that over 20,000 Burundians have fled the country over the past month, mainly to Rwanda.  Our Embassy in Dar-es-Salaam is closely monitoring refugee movements and engaging with the UN High Commission for Refugees, which has undertaken local contingency planning in case of a more significant outflow of refugees.</p>  <p>  In 2014, Ireland provided approximately &euro;1 million to NGO partners, Concern Worldwide and Civicus, for their work in Burundi.  </p>  <p>  In consultation with our partners at EU level, we will continue to closely monitor developments in Burundi.  Two Irish nominees will participate in an EU Election Observation Mission for the June elections.</p></reply>

In relation to the death of Mr. Freddie Grey in Baltimore, and the reaction to his death, President Obama has highlighted the need to investigate how laws and their policing are implemented, while also condemning the violence that some protestors were involved in. </p>  <p>  The US authorities at the Federal, State and municipal level, as well as a range of widely respected US human rights and law reform NGOs, are actively looking at the Baltimore case and others around the US.  The recently appointed Attorney-General Loretta Lynch has confirmed that the Department of Justice will continue its investigation into Mr. Gray's death.  Investigations at city and state level are also continuing and have resulted in some charges being brought earlier this week.      </p>  <p>  The US has a robust democracy and a respected legal system and I would expect that they will continue to deal with such cases of public concern in an open and transparent way.</p>  <p>  I welcome the continued efforts of President Obama and his administration to address the concerns raised by these recent incidents and to build improved relations and trust between US law enforcement and all communities around the United States.</p></reply>

He also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.</p><p>  The Association responded positively to his approaches and agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members.  The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. </p><p>  The publishers have also given assurances that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.</p><p>  In funding terms, despite the very difficult economic situation, this Government has provided approximately &euro;7 million to Primary Schools and &euro;8 million to second level schools by way of book grants in 2015 and the same level of funding was provided in 2012, 2013 and 2014. </p><p>  In addition a further &euro;15 million investment was secured in school book rental schemes in our Primary Schools and this  entails a &euro;5 million per annum investment in 2014, 2015 and 2016.</p><p>  I have no scope to introduce a new additional funding measure to assist secondary schools, as referred to by the Deputy, however ensuring that book rental schemes are available to all parents remains a priority.  </p><p>The previous Minister launched in January 2013  Guidelines for Developing Textbook Rental Schemes in Schools and also a Guide for Parents.  The guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.</p><p>  The position at second level is that for September 2013, 68% of schools reported that they operate book rental schemes.  A more detailed analysis of the returns show that 55% of voluntary schools, 66% of Community and Comprehensive schools and 88% of Education and Training Boards are operating book rental schemes.</p><p>  I want to commend these schools, their efforts mean that the high costs of school books is being significantly reduced for parents. </p><p>  My Department will continue to request information on book rental schemes from first and second level schools annually.

The Strategy sets out the direction of Further Education and Training (FET) over the next five years on both a national and regional basis.  This will lead to major changes to provision in the FET sector with improved quality, a focus on employment focused programmes and basic skills.  There will also be greater emphasis on employer engagement, planning and the promotion of the standing of FET.  The strategy also aims to improve access and to support learners of all abilities across FET programmes.  </p><p>  In 2015, SOLAS will provide funding of &euro;574 million on delivering a range of programmes to nearly 370,000 learners.  My Department will provide additional funding in the region of &euro;150 million for the Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) programme.</p><p>  My Department will work closely with SOLAS on the implementation of the strategy and monitor progress on the detailed FET Implementation Plan they have produced.</p></reply>

The number of redundancies scheduled at this facility is understood to be in the region of 140 persons.  A derogation is provided for under Article 4(2) of the Regulation for cases where exceptional circumstances pertain including where the 500 redundancies requirement is not met.  However, a particularly robust and demonstrable case must be made to the EU budgetary authorities as to the exceptional circumstances pertaining including in terms of the serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy, such as would pass scrutiny with those authorities. </p><p>  The Department has to date successfully made and had approved nine EGF applications since 2009.  The EGF Managing Authority in the Department has successfully used the  Article 4(2) provision in the submission of the two most recent applications, in support of 171 workers made redundant at the Andersen Ireland jewellery manufacturing plant in Rathkeale, Co. Limerick and 424 workers made redundant at the Lufthansa Technik Airmotive Ireland aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul facility in Rathcoole, Co. Dublin.  In these cases, we were able to produce robust and demonstrable data proving serious economic and labour market impacts that was accepted by the EU authorities.</p><p>  However, having analysed the relevant factors and criteria in this case, officials from the EGF Managing Authority in the Department are of the view, based on the current information available in terms of justifying exceptional circumstances and impacts and given the low number of redundancies pertaining in strictly EGF terms, that a sustainable case under Article 4(2) cannot justifiably be made to the EU for a co-funding contribution under the EG.  This is because the indicators used do not suggest that the redundancies in question are an exceptional event in the context of the local or regional economic or labour market environments. </p><p>  As such, the Department has no proposals to make such an application at this time.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p><p>  SENOs engage with schools annually in order to plan for, and to open, new special classes each year, in order to ensure there are sufficient special class placements available at primary and post primary school level to meet demand in a given area.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents are encouraged to liaise with the local SENO to discuss placement options for their child.</p><p>  I can advise the Deputy that the local SENO is actively engaged with the parent of the child in question with a view to securing a school placement. In the interim, 20 hours home tuition per week has been approved for the child pending a placement being secured.</p></reply>

This breakdown also notes the enrolments for each school.</p><p>Details of the list of special schools is provided in Appendix 1 at:</p><p> </p><p>The report also notes that there were 628 special classes in operation in 2012/13, 495 attached to mainstream Primary schools and a further 133 attached to mainstream Post Primary schools, with a total of 3,678 pupils enrolled in the classes. </p><p>For the 2015/16 school year there are currently 858 special classes in place, including 653 special classes in primary schools and 205 classes in post primary schools.  Details of the location of all of these special classes, on a per county basis, is available at .</p><p>The NCSE is also currently considering applications by schools to establish new special classes for the coming 2015/16 school year.  This work is on going and SENOs continue to liaise and work with schools in order to meet the demand for such placements at local level. </p><p>I wish to advise the Deputy that information regarding expenditure in relation to the provision of services for children with special educational needs occurs across a number of separate divisional areas such as, for example, salary costs for additional teaching and SNA supports, school building adaptations, assistive technology, transport arrangements, and enhanced capitation payable. As such, it is not possible to provide details of disaggregated expenditure for each school and class. </p><p>However, I can advise the Deputy that some &euro;1.37 billion will be spent in support of children with Special Educational Needs this year, which represents approximately 15% of my Department's budget, which is the highest level of investment that we have ever had.  This investment will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-06a.1383.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015050600070#WRV01600"><p>I can inform the Deputy that my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) provides educational psychology service to all primary and post primary schools through an assigned NEPS psychologist and in some cases through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA).  Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.</p><p>Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.</p><p>Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention.  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.  This process has been embedded by NEPS psychologists in the Primary sector with the production by the Department of Special Educational Needs &ndash; A Continuum of Support guidance and resource materials which has been distributed to all schools since 2007/8.  In late 2010 similar support documentation was produced in relation to Emotional and Behavioural difficulties in the Primary sector and in relation to a formal Post-Primary Continuum process. </p><p>The continua described above all involve a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools processes which moves from basic classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions and comprise three distinct school based phases characterised as follows:</p><p>Classroom Support &ndash; is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,</p><p>School Support - is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher.  Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.</p><p>School Support Plus &ndash; is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service (predominantly NEPS) in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes.  This level of intervention is for children with complex and/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels.</p><p>The staged model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration and intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need.  The continuum approach ensures that pupils presenting within this range are dealt with quickly and at the appropriate level without the establishment of a waiting list for formal assessment.</p></reply>

The criteria for enrolment in a Special Class for pupils with SSLD is set out in my Department's Circular 0038/2007.</p>  <p>  A full-time teacher is assigned to each class, and classes operate with a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 7:1. In addition, an enhanced capitation grant is provided to schools operating special classes for pupils with SSLD. Eligible pupils may spend up to two years in such classes.</p>  <p>  Pupils who are not enrolled in a special class for SSLD and who meet the criteria for Specific Speech and Language Disorder, as outlined in my Department's Circular, may qualify for additional teaching support where he/she is enrolled in mainstream school. </p>  <p>  Pupils with mild speech and language difficulties may qualify for supplementary teaching support from within the school's general allocation of learning support/teaching support. It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils.</p>  <p>  The provision of health supports, including Speech and Language Therapy services, is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Pupils with SSLD have access to speech therapy services either through the speech and language therapy services provided in the special class setting by the Health Service Executive or through the HSE primary care service. </p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to explain that my Department works with service-providing partners in the health and disability sectors to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs. The interdepartmental Cross-Sectoral Team, comprising of representatives of my Department, Department of Health, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the National Council for Special Education and the Health Service Executive, plans for co-ordinated service delivery across the disability sector.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is a member of the Health and Education Steering Committee which has been established to progress the National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People. This Programme is based on the recommendations of the Report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Services for Children aged 5-18 Years produced by representatives of the professions and management involved in delivering multi-disciplinary services to children. The long term goal of this Programme is to bring consistency in service delivery and a clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need.</p></reply>

This guidance encompasses measures to promote healthy eating, healthy vending, as well as the promotion of Physical Education and Physical Activity. It will issue to post primary schools initially.

These were published in Department Circulars 59/2009 &amp;amp; 60/2009. </p>  <p>  Following the commencement of the Education and Training Boards Act 2013 and the Education (Amendment) Act 2012, the parties met again to align the procedures with the provisions of these Acts.  Circular 0071/2014 issued in October 2014 in that context.</p>  <p>  The procedures provide for a staged process whereby boards of management can bring their dissatisfaction with a teacher's work or behaviour to the attention of the teacher and require him/her to engage in steps to bring about improvement. When professional competence issues are raised in this process, the school must put in place an improvement plan and any necessary supports for the teacher and receive reports from the principal on the extent to which the teacher's work is improving. The Revised Procedures are intended to resolve most cases at the school-based informal or formal stages of the procedures. If, however, the school's board remains dissatisfied with the teacher's work, the Revised Procedures provide that the board should request a review of the teacher's work by the Inspectorate. The report from the Inspectorate may be used by the board in its deliberations concerning the teacher's employment. </p>  <p>  Under the Teaching Council Act 2001, the Teaching Council is the body with statutory authority and responsibility for the registration of teachers in the State.</p>  <p>  The 2001 Act is being amended in the Teaching Council (Amendment) Bill 2015 which is currently progressing through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  It is intended that following enactment of the Bill, Part 5 of the Teaching Council Act which deal with fitness to teach will be commenced. </p>  <p>  Commencement will enable the Council to investigate complaints against teachers.</p></reply>

One aspect of this Agreement relates to supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) and as both Unions that represent SNAs namely, SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to the Haddington Road Agreement, my Department has implemented supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs. </p><p>The first part of the LRC proposals for supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs outlines that the supplementary assignment arrangements only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school/ETB.</p><p>The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for the 2014/2015 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0044/2014 which issued on 12 May 2014 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: </p><p>  With effect from 1 May 2013 once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (Service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.</p><p>With the exception of SNAs who have been re-employed on permanent contracts or have chosen to opt out of the panel in accordance with the terms of Paragraph 6 of the circular, all SNAs who have been made redundant since 1 May 2013 are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including SNAs who are working in temporary or cover positions, or SNAs with less than one year's service, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>When an employer has a vacancy to fill, they must undertake the recruitment process in accordance with the provisions outlined in paragraphs 12-18 of Circular 44/2014.</p><p>As the LRC proposals are part of a wider public-sector pay agreement that represent compromises by both employers and unions, I do not have the ability to alter the terms of that agreement.</p><p>Finally, my Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. The staffing arrangements also include an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeals Board. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. The staffing arrangements for the 2015/2016 school year are set out in Circular 0005/2015 which is available on the Department website.</p>  <p>  At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The primary staffing schedule currently operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils, with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.).  School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p>  <p>  When the moratorium on the filling of posts of responsibility was introduced in 2009, the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools. These posts continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium was therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties posts of responsibility.</p>  <p>  The alleviation arrangements set out in Circular 0004/2014 provide a floor by which schools acutely affected at AP level by the impact of the moratorium can fill their AP vacancies as they arise to the level of the thresholds set out in that circular.</p>  <p>  It continues to be a matter for each individual school authority to re-organise and prioritise the appropriate duties for post of responsibility holders in the context of implementing the moratorium.</p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p>  <p>  The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about further improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p>  <p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

If these schools were allocated five hours' learning support per mainstream teachers as opposed to four hours under the current rules of GAM/EAL, this would result in approximately 9 additional posts.</p>  <p>  There are 3 all girls' DEIS Rural schools with a total enrolment of 278 pupils.  An increase in allocation from four to five hours would results in approximately an additional 0.5 post.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, differing teacher allocation ratios are applied under the General Allocation Model (GAM) in relation to boys, girls and mixed schools in order to account for differentials of prevalence of learning difficulty between boys and girls. The objective of this differentiation is to ensure that resources provided to schools to support children who have additional learning needs are targeted to ensure that those children most in need benefit from these resources.</p>  <p>  The rationale for the differing ratios is based on international literature on the incidence of disability as well as international and national surveys of literacy and numeracy which indicate that there is a greater incidence of disability/learning difficulty in boys than girls.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published a report 'A study of the Prevalence of Special Educational Needs' which is available at www.ncse.ie and which contains details regarding the prevalence of special needs among the pupil population including noting gender differentials.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that schools in Delivering Equality of Opportunity in School Band 1 category also receive an additional base allocation of 0.4 of a post if the school has 200 or more pupils or an additional 0.2 of a post if the school has less than 200 pupils.</p>  <p>  Details of the GAM allocation process for schools for the coming 2015/16 school year are set out in Circular 05/2015, which is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.</p></reply>

The Report contained 34 recommendations focussed on supporting the medium term economic development of rural areas in the period to 2025.  I was appointed Minister for Rural Affairs in July 2014, and in line with the recommendations in the CEDRA Report, I immediately established the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group (IDG).</p><p>The IDG, which is made up of representatives from all relevant Government Departments, is currently working in a coordinated way to ensure that each Department&rsquo;s policy development and implementation fully considers the needs of rural communities. In this context, it is about maximising the financial resources already available for rural development and ensuring that these resources are directed in a way that best supports the sustainable economic development of rural areas.</p><p>In order to maintain strong links with people in rural Ireland who are involved in or have a strong interest in the economic development of rural areas and communities, both Minister Kelly and I have recently established an Expert Advisory Group to monitor progress and provide advice in respect of the implementation of the recommendations in the CEDRA report. This group, which is chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane and met for the first time recently, is looking at the CEDRA recommendations with a view to offering advice regarding priority actions to support the implementation process.</p><p>Regarding the funds available to implement this report in 2015, the intention was not to allocate a specific budget for the purposes of implementing the recommendations of the CEDRA report but rather to ensure that all relevant stakeholders maximise the potential of existing funding streams to support the economic development of rural areas specifically. However, &euro;1 million was allocated in the budget for 2015 to establish a Rural Innovation and Development fund in line with CEDRA recommendations to support innovative, small scale pilot initiatives. Agreement has been reached on the types of projects to be supported under this scheme and a call for proposals for some elements will issue shortly.</p><p>Work is also advancing on the establishment of a Rural Economic Development Zone (REDZ)<b></b>pilot scheme and an amount of &euro;2million is being made available to support the implementation of this pilot. I expect to announce the details of this pilot shortly. A further &euro;5million has also been provided for an expanded REDZ scheme under the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme and I am confident that the learning from the pilot will allow us to progress that in early 2016.</p><p>It should be noted that significant progress has already been made in terms of implementing the recommendations of the CEDRA Report and this will continue through the work of the IDG over the coming period.</p></reply>

Motor tax on cars registered since 2008 is based on CO <sub>2</sub>emissions. I do not consider that either basis of taxation is regressive. In the case of cars taxed on engine capacity, the banding is structured so that the level of tax payable increases as the engine size increases. In the case of cars taxed on the basis of CO<sub>2</sub>, the banding is structured so that higher emitting cars attract a higher rate of tax than lower emitting ones.  The move to CO<sub>2</sub>has been effective in reducing emissions - 95% of all new vehicles purchased are now in the lowest emitting A and B bands, which carry the lowest tax rates.  Overall, the average emissions from new cars purchased in Ireland in 2013 was 121g CO<sub>2</sub>/km, down from 164g CO<sub>2</sub>/km in 2007, before the CO<sub>2</sub>system was introduced, meaning that the country has already reached the EU target of 130g CO<sub>2</sub>/km for 2015.</p><p>In respect of the payment periods for motor tax, the rates applicable for the half-yearly and quarterly options are 55.5% and 28.25% of the annual charge, respectively. These relativities have remained generally consistent since the 1960s. </p><p>The differential takes account of the extra workload for staff in motor tax offices and the Driver and Vehicle Computer Services Division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the resultant administrative costs and printing costs that arise, including the issuing of renewal notices. Each quarterly renewal of motor tax follows the same administrative procedures as the annual renewal process. Consequently, renewing on a quarterly basis generates four times the workload of an annual renewal for the equivalent period.</p><p>I have no plans currently to review the basis for paying motor tax on a half-yearly or quarterly basis. </p></reply>

Government considered the report and, given the complexity of the issues involved, including the fact that the vast majority of households have moved away from local authority collection and have engaged private waste collectors on whom it would be difficult to impose any obligation to provide a waiver system, mandated the working group to continue to examine the issue, with a view to submitting a third report to Government in due course.</p><p>Given that the vast majority of local authorities no longer collect waste and that the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged and services offered vary across the country, it is becoming increasingly apparent that introducing a national waiver scheme in the context of an open market for waste collection would be highly complex. </p></reply>

My Department received submissions from 7,500 organisations and members of the public during this period. </p><p>It is intended that the revisions to the 2006 Wind Energy Development Guidelines will be finalised as soon as possible. In this regard, account has to be taken of the extensive response to the public consultation in framing the final guidelines. Further work is also advancing to develop technical appendices to assist planning authorities with the practical application of the noise measurement aspects of the Wind Guidelines. </p><p>The revisions to the Wind Energy Development Guidelines 2006, when finalised, will be issued under Section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard to guidelines issued under Section 28 in the performance of their functions under the Planning Acts.</p><p>The existing Wind Energy Development Guidelines (2006) provide guidance to planning authorities on aesthetic considerations in relation to the siting and design of wind energy developments in the landscape.  In this regard, my colleague the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has the lead Ministerial responsibility for developing the National Landscape Strategy, with input from my Department, along with other Departments and State Bodies. I understand that the National Landscape Strategy 2015-2025 is expected to be published in the coming weeks.

In the interim, the SEAI makes the new wind atlas data-sets available, on request, to professional Geographical Information Systems users and other organisations.</p><p>SEAI advise that the concept of average wind speed for a county has no practical application in the context of planning an individual wind energy development project.</p></reply>

These organisations include voluntary housing associations.</p><p>The ownership of homes being rented to tenants by AHBs varies, depending on the scheme under which the dwelling was provided.  Since the late 1980s, approximately 27,000 units of accommodation have been provided by AHBs under capital funding schemes underpinned by mortgages.  More recently, a scheme was introduced that provides an up-front capital payment of up to 30% of the property value to facilitate AHBs in raising private finance to acquire or build new social housing units.  The capital advanced is repayable at the end of a payment and availability agreement, usually after 30 years.  Under the terms of these various funding schemes, AHBs are the <i>de facto</i>owners of the properties and are required to make them available for social renting for the duration of the mortgage or, as the case may be, the availability agreement.</p><p>In addition, under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme, AHBs can purchase, construct or lease housing units and make them available for social housing. AHBs can also manage unsold affordable units on behalf of a local authority. These unsold affordable units remain in the ownership of the local authority, while those in leasing arrangements remain either in private ownership or are in the ownership of the NAMA special purpose vehicle (SPV). </p><p>Social housing is key priority for the Government, evidenced by the additional &euro;2.2 billion in funding announced for it in Budget 2015 and the publication of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>in November 2014<i>.  </i>AHBs have a key role to play in the provision of social housing and this is recognised in the Strategy.</p></reply>

The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the circa 90,000 households on the housing waiting lists.</p><p>Of the supply of over 35,000 additional social housing units out to 2020 under the Strategy, almost 12,200 are to be delivered through capital-funded programmes, namely local authority housing construction and acquisitions, the Capital Assistance Scheme and the return of vacant social housing units to use. Social housing targets have been set for each local authority out to 2017 and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>On 5 May 2015, I announced the first major direct build social housing programme under the Social Housing Strategy. This announcement covers over 100 separate housing projects across all 31 local authorities and details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>The new social housing units covered in that announcement &ndash; more than 1,700 in total - will be built by local authorities. Local authorities may also acquire new social housing units where suitable units are available and where their acquisition would provide value for money. My Department does not prescribe the exact number of units that local authorities must build or acquire within their overall targets.</p><p>Social Housing units are also delivered under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP) through:</p><p>-  Local Authority units leased or rented;</p><p>-  Approved Housing Body units constructed, acquired or leased; and </p><p>-  NAMA special purpose vehicle owned units. </p><p>There is no specific breakdown of the individual local authority targets between these delivery mechanisms, however it is expected that 1,000 units from the 3,000 national SHCEP target will be delivered by Approved Housing Bodies in 2015. Each Local Authority is best placed to determine how best to meet their individual SHCEP targets using all the delivery mechanisms available to them and taking account of the housing circumstances in their area.</p><p>The implementation of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>. The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.</p><p>Further to the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 28 July 2014, the first phase of the HAP statutory pilot commenced with effect from 15 September 2014 in Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council and Cork County Council. HAP commenced in Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin and Monaghan County Councils from 1 October. Subsequently, on 18 December, Dublin City Council became part of the statutory HAP pilot, with a specific focus on accommodating homeless households. Dublin City Council is implementing the HAP pilot for homeless households in the Dublin region on behalf of all 4 Dublin local authorities.</p><p>There are now over 1,600 households in receipt of HAP across the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot scheme. </p><p>During the legislation&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas in July 2014, an undertaking was given that a progress report would be prepared for the relevant Oireachtas Committee. I can confirm that data from the pilot sites has been gathered and I submitted a report to the Oireachtas Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht last month. Based on the findings of that review, consideration is currently being given to the sequencing of a further cohort of local authorities to commence HAP on an incremental basis this year.</p><p>The Strategy is based on a multi-annual approach to delivery over two phases:<blockquote>-  Phase 1, building on Budget 2015 announcements &ndash; a target of 32,000 HAP/RAS units by end 2017;<br /><br />-  Phase 2, 2018-2020 &ndash; a target of 43,000 HAP/RAS units by end 2020.</blockquote>Further to this, the delivery target for the HAP scheme in 2015 is 8,400.</p></reply>

The Scheme offered an option to purchase up to half of a property with a standard annuity mortgage, with the balance to be rented from the local authority. The initiative worked well for the majority of borrowers and 16,500 people were facilitated in owning their own home in this way.

Such responsible dog ownership is the key to reducing incidences of dog biting and other problem behaviours. </p>  <p>  The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 to   2010 set out a range of requirements for all dog owners or any other person in charge of a dog. In particular, section 9 of the 1986 Act require s the owner or any other person in charge of a dog to accompany it and keep it under effectual control in any place other than the premises of the owner, the premises of the person in control of the dog, or other premises with the consent of the owner of the premises. Section 21 of the 1986 Act provides that the owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog; it is not necessary for the person seeking damages to show a previous mischievous propensity in the dog, or the owner's knowledge of such previous propensity, or to show that such injury or damage was attributable to neglect on the part of the owner.   </p>  <p>  In addition to the foregoing, the Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 (as amended) set out further requirements that owners of specific breeds of dogs have to follow, namely that such dogs must be muzzled and led, on a sufficiently strong leash or chain not exceeding 2m in length by a competent person over 16 years of age when in a public place.  Several jurisdictions have addressed the matter of restrictions of particular breeds of dogs in a similar way to Ireland.

These measures are set out in the Government's Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness (May 2014) and in the Action Plan to Address Homelessness (December 2014).  These include measures with regard to NAMA property and the allocation of housing units by key housing authorities to homeless and other vulnerable households.  Progress in implementing these plans is reported through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.  The plans and progress reports are available on my Department's website at the following link: South Dublin County Council has recently completed the purchase of a NAMA apartment block, as the preferred option to a hotel property, which will operate as an assessment centre for homeless families providing 65 units of accommodation.  A service level agreement has been put in place with a provider and it is expected that this facility will be fully operational by June.  My Department continues to work closely with NAMA, the Housing Agency, local authorities and approved housing bodies in relation to the delivery of social housing.  NAMA has made significant numbers of housing units available through the Housing Agency to local authorities and approved housing bodies for social housing use including addressing homelessness.  This includes units provided through the NAMA special purpose vehicle, the National Asset Residential Property Services.  Information in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units, including a full breakdown by county of units delivered on a quarterly basis, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at <i>.</i></p><p>I am confident that significant numbers of social housing units will continue to be delivered through this process.</p><p>Successfully tackling the current homelessness issue demands that a higher priority be afforded to homeless households in the allocation of housing.  Accordingly, I issued a Direction to a number of key housing authorities on 27 January 2015 to prioritise homeless and other vulnerable households.  This Direction applies for six months, from 27 January 2015 to 26 July 2015.  Under this Direction each of the Dublin housing authorities must ensure that at least 50% of the dwellings available for allocation under Section 22 of the 2009 Act during the specified period will be allocated to such households that had qualified for social housing support on or before 1 December 2014.  It is expected that this intervention will deliver approximately 500 homes for households in the Dublin Region.  Housing authorities will be reporting on the first 3-months operation of this Direction very shortly.</p><p>As regards funding, I have made an additional &euro;10.5 million of &lsquo;Section 10&rsquo; funding available for homeless accommodation and services across the country in 2015.  This is an increase in funding of over 20%, bringing the Exchequer contribution to &euro;55.5 million.  The 2015 regional allocations are currently being finalised with a view to their confirmation shortly.  Housing authorities also contribute to the funding costs for their areas from their own resources.  In 2014, my Department provided &euro;35.3 million in Exchequer funding to Dublin City Council, as the lead authority for the Dublin Region, under Section 10 arrangements.  To date in 2015, my Department has recouped &euro;4,698,333 in &lsquo;Section 10&rsquo; funding to Dublin City Council &ndash; further payments will be made upon receipt of quarterly reports from the Council.</p></reply>

In this regard, we are also committed to advancing the implementation of the CEDRA Report recommendations and to ensuring that national and local systems and programmes facilitate and support rural development and rural communities.</p>  <p>  To facilitate this agenda, I established the CEDRA Interdepartmental Group (IDG), comprising senior representatives of all relevant Government Departments. As Chair of that Group, I am working to ensure that the work that is being progressed across Government Departments has a rural focus and reflects the challenges and issues facing rural Ireland. This in effect, provides an important system for rural proofing. </p>  <p>  In addition to this, both Minister Kelly and I have indicated recently that we intend to advance the implementation of recommendation 1 of CEDRA Report, which calls for the development of a Rural Policy Statement.  Work on this will begin shortly and I am confident that this will provide a framework to ensure that due consideration is given to the challenges and issues facing rural communities and will support the alignment of policy design and implementation frameworks.</p></reply>

The distance of a town from the gas network is the major factor determining the costs of building a gas pipeline.

No studies have been undertaken by my Department on the potential or otherwise of converting the plant to use biomass. Furthermore, I understand that there are a number of important issues that would demand further consideration before biomass could be used at Moneypoint. These include the following:</p>  <p>   - the conversion of Moneypoint to biomass would require significant levels of capital investment by the operator;</p>  <p>  - support tariffs substantially higher than those available for wind, which has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, would also be required which could lead to increased electricity prices;</p>  <p>  - substantially more biomass than is available domestically would be required with large amounts of the resource having to be imported leading to uncertainty in terms of security of supply. The sustainability of transporting large amounts of imported biomass would also be a cause for concern;</p>  <p>  - the commitment of substantial amounts of biomass to Moneypoint would divert scarce biomass away from the renewable heat sector, where biomass can be used more efficiently and where fewer alternative technologies exist.</p></reply>

The RTP entails the provision of some 230,000 services annually and around 1.7m passenger journeys. The Government has committed to maintaining service levels under the Programme.</p>  <p>  In April 2012 responsibility for managing the RTP was assigned to the National Transport Authority (NTA). This role for the NTA, coupled with its national remit for securing the provision of public transport passenger services, enables the development of better links between local and rural transport services, and scheduled bus and rail services.</p>  <p>  The delivery arrangements for the RTP are undergoing a restructuring process which is being managed by the NTA with a view to reducing administrative costs and maximising spend on the provision of services. The purpose of the restructuring is to protect the provision of rural transport services into the future by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure that maximises integration with other State transport services and by making the Programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the Programme for Government commitment to maintain and extend the RTP with other local transport services and the recommendations of a Value for Money Review of the RTP published in 2012.</p></reply>

The current PSO contract between the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Irish Rail sets out the services and service levels to be provided, including services on the Limerick to Ballybrophy line, in return for the payment of a public subsidy. I am informed by my officials that the total passenger journeys on the line in 2014 was 23,692.</p>  <p>  At the end of 2014 I brought forward a Supplementary Estimate which included additional new funding in the public transport capital investment programme of &euro;101 million to ensure the public transport sector is better placed to address the demands of our economic recovery. A large portion of that amount was targeted at the renewal investment required in the rail network.  Irish Rail has also benefitted from increasing passenger numbers with over 1 million additional journeys in 2014. While this increase is welcome, Irish Rail must continue to improve their services and marketing to attract even more people to use its services.</p>  <p>  The draft Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport recommends the development of a new rail policy, intended to have regard to social and environmental considerations addressed by rail as well as the economic and investment context established in that report.</p>  <p>  Given the significant funding requirements, it is important that rail users and policy makers are consulted on how best to ensure that rail services continue to meet the needs of users and the contribution of rail to an efficient and effective public transport system generally.  A public consultation on the role of rail is under preparation and I expect that this consultation will commence shortly.</p></reply>

Therefore, while my Department has the lead role in relation to the implementation of the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, significant funding is provided through the Rural Development Programme (operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) to assist farmers in meeting the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives. Participation in the Basic Payment Scheme requires farmers to abide by the statutory requirements relating to SPAs and Special Areas of Conservation &ndash; collectively known as Natura 2000 sites. Agri-environment schemes such as the new GLAS scheme have provided, and will provide, a range of supports, including payments in respect of Natura 2000 sites, to tens of thousands of farmers.</p>  <p>  A habitat enhancement scheme (known as the National Parks and Wildlife Service Farm Plan Scheme) was available to farmers in Hen Harrier SPAs to undertake proactive measures for the species. These measures were not a condition of the designation, nor were they mandatory.  For that reason, they are not considered to be compensation for the prevention of an activity or a development on the lands in question. Voluntary commitments were entered into by 377 landowners under the Farm Plan Scheme, covering over 9,000 hectares. I am advised that 42 farm plans are still active.</p>  <p>  The designation of lands does not mean that the lands are subject to blanket restrictions, although they must be managed appropriately. This requirement means that certain State-funded grant schemes must be operated with due care where they may affect such lands and they cannot be considered an automatic entitlement of the landowner.</p></reply>

The intention to designate this site was advertised in November 2007, along with five other Hen Harrier special protection areas. Landowners were advised that they could appeal against the proposed designation of the site as a special protection area. The appeals process has two stages: a Departmental review of an objection to the proposed designation, after which landowners who receive an adverse review may opt to take their cases to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board. This is an independently chaired Board which makes recommendations to me, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, on such cases.</p><p>In total, 25 appeals were lodged, of which 22 were finalised at the first stage and 3 were referred to the Designated Areas Appeals Advisory Board. Of the 22 dealt with internally, 12 were successful, 1 was partly successful and 4 were unsuccessful. 2 objections were withdrawn and 3 objections were not progressed due to the appeal criteria not being met.

It is important also that we do this in a way that is respectful and inclusive to reflect the mature Republic that we have become over the last 100 years.</p><p>One of the core objectives of the programme is to encourage and facilitate participation by, and the inclusion of, the citizens of Ireland to the greatest extent possible in the programme of events to commemorate this significant centenary.  The programme is underpinned by five intersecting and overlapping themes; Remembering, Reconciling, Presenting, Imagining and Celebrating.  The programme comprises seven strands; State Ceremonial, Historical Reflection, An Teanga Bheo, Youth and Imagination, Cultural Expression, Community Participation and Global and Diaspora.  It outlines a range of activities and events already planned under each of the seven strands and full details about the work being undertaken under each strand is outlined on the website .  </p><p>The Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme places a special focus on the Seven Signatories of the Proclamation.  A number of specific projects and activities in the programme relate to the Seven Signatories and individual signatories will also be remembered in a wide variety of ways.  </p><p>At the centre of the Ireland 2016 Centenary Programme are the State Ceremonial Events, which represent the formal and solemn remembrance of the events of 1916 by the citizens of Ireland as the seminal event in our modern history, which led to our independence.  The importance of our national flag and the ideals behind the Proclamation will also play a central role in the programme of events.</p><p>The development of the centenary programme has been informed by the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations, the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations and an extensive consultation, engagement and planning process, which has already been underway for several months and will continue until the end of this year.  The purpose of the process is to inform, to stimulate debate and discussion about the events of 1916 and to foster programme initiatives.  The consultation process involves a range of Government Departments and agencies, relatives, local authorities, local community groups, schools and universities, the Diaspora, historians and historical societies, as well as interested individuals and organisations.  The strength of local community involvement and the unique perspectives and creative ideas of the participating groups and citizens will ensure that the significant events of 1916 will be brought to life and made interesting and relevant for people of all ages on the island of Ireland and abroad.</p></reply>

The Fund was open to 2 applications per local authority, of which 1 application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.

I understand that officials of my Department have met with both the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the Irish Insurance Federation (now Insurance Ireland) to discuss this matter.  My Department is also engaging with local authority Architectural Conservation Officers and other stakeholders in collating specific information regarding historic buildings and insurance with the intention of further examining this issue.</p>  <p>  The principle issue with protected structures centres on the cost of reinstatement to the insurer. There is widespread belief that full reinstatement of protected structures, following loss or disaster, will be required by the regulatory authorities. While reinstatement is often a concern for owners, my Department&rsquo;s guidance is that there is not a requirement for the planning authority to seek full reinstatement unless this is justified. My Department&rsquo;s view is that every local authority should be able to provide information on reinstatement to individual owners and judgements should be made on a case by case basis.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that there are several insurance providers in the market who offer insurance cover for historic properties on a case by case basis, having regard to the risks applicable to older structures in general. Such risks, which arise from age of services, structural stability, etc., relate to all traditionally built buildings - commonly those over 100 years old - and do not singularly target structures protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to pursue matters surrounding insurance for historic properties and keep the issues under review.</p></reply>
