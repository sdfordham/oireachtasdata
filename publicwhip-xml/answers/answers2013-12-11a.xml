The properties located at the Curragh Camp include 25 occupied by serving personnel and their families and 29 occupied by overholders.  Presently, it is understood from the military authorities that there are a further 47 vacant properties at the Camp which were formerly occupied as married quarters.  However none of these are habitable.</p><p>  The general upkeep and maintenance of occupied properties is a matter for the occupant. Routine repairs of an emergency nature are, however, undertaken by the military authorities from time to time as required.  In respect of the properties located at the Curragh Camp, it is understood from the military authorities that the cost of these repairs to date in 2013 amounted to &euro;28,500 and the corresponding amount spent in 2012 was &euro;32,000.  These figures include both military personnel time and materials and the use of external contractors where necessary.  The requirement for more extensive remedial works to properties is overseen by the Department.  It has been found that over time the properties in general would require a significant and disproportionate investment in order to ensure compliance with regulations regarding rental properties.  In light of this it was decided to withdraw the properties from use as Married Quarters due to Health and Safety concerns.</p><p>  The total rent collected in respect of those occupying married quarters at the Curragh Camp was &euro;150,729.36 for 2012, and a total of &euro;144,772.54 has been collected to the end of November 2013.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-11a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121100070#WRA00700"><p>Ireland is not a party to the Hague Convention (V) respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land, and there are no plans for it to become one.  Ireland's policy of military neutrality is characterised by non-participation in military alliances.  This policy has been underpinned by a set of complementary values which include, inter alia, the protection of human rights; support for development, participation in international peacekeeping operations under UN mandates; and the promotion of disarmament and the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>  Partnership for Peace (PfP) is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Euro-Atlantic partner countries and NATO.  It allows partners to build up an individual relationship with NATO, choosing their own priorities for cooperation. Participation in PfP is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentiation, that is, a State selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation in PfP activities.  The PfP programme focuses on defence related cooperation and is designed to help increased stability, diminish threats to peace and build strengthened security relationships.  The principal benefit of our participation is that it has allowed us to enhance the capabilities of Ireland's Defence Forces for peacekeeping, preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates.  It should be noted that a number of like minded, militarily neutral countries also participate in NATO/PfP such as Switzerland, Finland and Austria.    </p><p>  In relation to EU Battlegroups, again these are not military alliances.  They are a fundamental aspect of the EU's capability to react rapidly to developing crises around the globe.  Battlegroups are made available by Member States to the EU Council and there must be unanimity for their deployment.  Within the EU Battlegroup concept, the purpose of the Battlegroup, as a rapid response capability, includes the role of acting as an initial entry force to stabilise a situation pending the deployment of a follow-on force, to support an established peace support operation which is running into difficulties, similar to the deployment of EU forces in the UN operation in the Congo; and to respond to humanitarian crises.  It should be stressed that any deployment of an Irish contingent in a Battlegroup context would be subject to the requirements of the &quot;triple-lock&quot;.</p><p>  In 1999, D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace.  In 2007 D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approved the Memorandum of Understanding to participate in the Nordic Battlegroup 2008 and again, in 2012, approved the Memorandum of Understanding for the Austro-German Battlegroup 2012.</p></reply>

The Nordic Battlegroup will comprise Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway, Estonia and possibly Lithuania and Latvia.  The German led Battlegroup will comprise Germany, acting as Framework Nation, Luxembourg, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.  The proposed Defence Forces contribution to each Battlegroup will be a Reconnaissance Company and related combat support elements.  It is proposed that Ireland will also take command of a multinational Reconnaissance Group Headquarters, providing Ireland with a more significant role within these battlegroups.</p><p>  Ireland has previously participated in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2008 and 2011 and in a German led EU Battlegroup in 2012.  The other members of the Nordic Battlegroup were Sweden, acting as Framework Nation, Finland, Norway and Estonia and Croatia (2011 only).  The members of the German led EU Battlegroup were Germany, acting as Framework Nation, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Macedonia.</p><p>  Discussions have been ongoing with the Framework Nations and participating States to finalise details on the configuration of the Battlegroups along with operational and training details and standby arrangements.  As this work has now been completed I expect to bring the matter to Government shortly.</p></reply>

Significant progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, with an increase of 23% of female participation in the PDF since 2002.  However, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.</p><p>  As of 31 October 2013, there are currently 558 women out of a total strength of 9,222 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces and a 23 % increase of female representation in the PDF since 2002.  A key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males.  A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:<blockquote>- the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants, <br /><br />- special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment, <br /><br />- there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards.<br /><br />- all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,<br /><br />- a Gender Advisor has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.</blockquote>  Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore,  play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas.  The Defence Forces also prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment.  Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks.  The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises.<i></i></p><p>  While Defence Forces policies have been developed to support greater female participation, a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers, how such careers are presented through the education and career guidance systems in our schools and colleges, and how society views the role of women in a fully inclusive and equal workplace where all soldiers and officers, irrespective of gender, are required to be available for duties on a 24/7 basis and are required to serve overseas.  To a large extent, the solution to these societal issues lies outside the Defence Forces.  That said, I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies to increase female participation in the Defence Forces.  To this end, I have requested the Chief of Staff to establish a Working Group to examine levels of participation of women in the organisation at all levels.  The data gathered as part of this review will inform current recruitment policies aimed at increasing participation by women in the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-11a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121100070#WRA01300"><p>I attended the Foreign Affairs Council in Defence Ministers format on the 18th and 19th November in Brussels.  The meeting was chaired by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Baroness Catherine Ashton.  NATO Secretary General Mr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen joined the meeting for some working sessions.  On Monday evening, during the first working session, Defence and Foreign Ministers discussed the High Representative's Report on Common Security and Defence Policy and had an exchange of views.  The focus was on agreeing Council Conclusions, which will feed into conclusions on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) which will be considered by Heads of State and Government at the European Council meeting on 19th and 20th December.</p><p>  There was general support for the HR's Report and the associated Council Conclusions, in particular, the emphasis that was placed on a strong and effective Common Security and Defence Policy for the Union.  Ministers agreed that CSDP needs to be reinvigorated and that it is timely for the European Council to engage on CSDP and provide political direction.  On Tuesday morning, Defence Ministers continued their discussion on the upcoming European Council on Defence, in particular, capability development and the defence industry aspects of the Council Conclusions.  Ministers discussed the growing importance of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and in this regard, stressed the need for a level playing field to avoid market distortions combined with security of supply.  Other issues discussed included research and innovation, specifically dual use technologies.  There was also broad agreement on the need for increased flexibility, including the modular approach, on the use of EU Battlegroups (EUBGs).  The need for cooperation and non-duplication with NATO, in the area of capability development, was underlined by HR Ashton, SG Rasmussen and by several Member States.  </p><p>  In my intervention I welcomed the intention to have security and defence on European Council agenda regularly.  I outlined four issues, which I believe warrant more detailed discussion and endorsement at the European Council meeting.  These include, the use of EU Battlegroups, the reinvigoration of CSDP, the need for the European Council to fully support the ongoing development and maintenance of capabilities, both civil and military, and the need for an efficient and effective defence industry where SMEs can play a full role and which can deliver capabilities, jobs, growth and innovation.   </p><p>  Two military operations currently being conducted by the European Union under the Common Security and Defence Policy were also discussed.  These were Operation Atalanta, which is a naval counter-piracy mission off the Horn of Africa, and EU Training Mission Mali, which is training Malian Defence Forces.  </p><p>  I also attended the European Defence Agency (EDA) Steering Board meeting.  The Chief Executive of the EDA briefed Ministers on the EDA's Work Programme for 2014.  This programme identifies many projects and initiatives in areas such as, Communications and Information Systems; Cyber Defence; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear detection; Counter Improvised Explosive Devices; Maritime Surveillance; Naval Training.  The EDA agreed that they would cooperate closely with the European Commission on research and innovation, particularly in the area of dual use technological developments.  It was also agreed that the EDA would cooperate with the European Commission in areas such as Maritime and Cyber security and energy efficiency.</p></reply>

The 43rd Infantry Group, comprising 115 personnel, consists of a Force Reserve Company and support elements.  Their role includes the provision of a Quick Reaction Force which is on standby to assist with on-going operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  The Irish Infantry Group is also tasked with carrying out patrols and convoy escorts as necessary.  I addressed the question of the incident which occurred on 28 November 2013 involving Defence Forces personnel serving with UNDOF in Syria, in answering a priority PQ earlier. </p><p>  Irish troops are deployed to the Golan Heights at a time of increased instability in that region.  That was the situation pertaining in the region when D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann considered this issue last July, when it decided to deploy the contingent to UNDOF.  It was never the case that this deployment was going to be easy.  Both the political and the security situation in the region is volatile; that is why we are there.  Clearly, when we deploy troops to these types of operations, we must also understand and accept that we are putting them in harm's way and that situations, such as the recent attack, can and will happen.  My responsibility, as Minister for Defence, is to ensure that our personnel have the resources, equipment and training necessary to deal with such incidents.  I am glad to say that the personnel of the Irish Force Mobile Reserve are fully trained and equipped with appropriate force protection assets to undertake their important duties on behalf of the United Nations and that they remain fully committed to this task.  The performance of the equipment and personnel in this most recent incident is testament to the standard and quality of the equipment which the Defence Forces have at their disposal and of the commitment and professionalism of our personnel.  </p><p>  There are no indications at this time to suggest that the Anti Government Armed Elements see Irish troops as a target.  Given the evolving security situation, the UNDOF mission has continued to reconfigure its operations with a view to ensuring the safety of personnel while continuing to implement the mission's mandate.  All necessary Force Protection measures on the ground continue to be implemented by the Irish contingent.  In addition, ongoing threat assessments are carried out in the mission area and the Chief of Staff continually reviews both personal equipment and force assets, to ensure that those Defence Forces personnel deployed to the mission are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles.</p></reply>

It also receives regular updates specifically from the lead Government Departments.  An example is the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, which chairs the National Steering Group under the Framework for Major Emergency Management, and is the lead Government Department in eleven of the forty two emergency scenarios identified in the Lead, Principal and Other Support roles.  The Task Force regularly addresses other emergency planning issues ranging from risk assessment to training and exercises as well as receiving regular briefings on current issues from the various lead Government Departments on their specific roles and responsibilities and their associated work programmes. </p><p>  The Task Force establishes Subgroups from time to time to specifically look at particular areas of emergency planning that may need to be addressed.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, a twelve-month pilot Emergency Aeromedical Support (EAS) service, supported by the Air Corps, commenced operating out of Custume Barracks, Athlone on 4<sup>th</sup> June last year.  This pilot service was established by agreement between my Department and the Department of Health in order to assess the level and type, if any, of dedicated emergency aeromedical support needed to assist the National Ambulance Service, primarily in the west of Ireland.  The assessment focussed on certain types of patient, particularly on the requirements of the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, such as for Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke. </p><p>  A full evaluation of the Service was undertaken by an inter-service Audit and Evaluation Group, and in June 2013, a Report was submitted to the Minister for Health for his consideration.  The Minister for Health has accepted the Report&rsquo;s recommendations including for the establishment of a permanent service.  The Minister has asked that his Department establish a Working Group to examine options for the provision of an EAS service into the future.  While the 12 month pilot period expired on 3<sup>rd</sup> June 2013, I have agreed to extend the Air Corps&rsquo; participation in order for the Evaluation Report to be considered and for the Working Group to complete its work.</p><p>  There have been 490 missions completed by the EAS service up to the end of November 2013.</p></reply>

I understand the violence broke out ahead of the planned arrival of the Malian Prime Minister to Kidal.  However, I have been informed that the circumstances and details of the incident have yet to be established.  I strongly condemn the violence and would urge all parties to exercise restraint, and stand by their commitments contained in the Ouagadougou Agreement.  This Agreement, which was signed on 18 June 2013 between the transitional Government and the armed groups in the northern regions of Mali, is a preliminary agreement to hold the Presidential election and inclusive peace talks in Mali.  The Presidential elections and recent Parliamentary elections were significant milestones in the restoration of constitutional order in Mali, and signs that Mali is making positive political progress and returning to democratic Government.  I hope the final round of Parliamentary elections due to take place next week can proceed in a peaceful environment and give the Malian people the opportunity to decide their political leadership. </p><p>  The recent violence in northern Mali only serves to highlight the need for international support to help Mali overcome the current crisis.  The Defence Forces continue to monitor the security situation in Mali closely.  There are no plans at this time to withdraw the eight (8) Irish personnel currently serving with EU Training Mission in southern Mali.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-11a.58.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/951" speakername="Eamon Gilmore" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121100071#WRB01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29 and 32 to 35, inclusive, together. </p><p>  I remain seriously concerned about the situation in Gaza, both the long term situation and the recent deterioration caused by a reduction in the power supply.  My Department monitors the situation in Gaza closely, including through regular contact with UNRWA and UNOCHA, the main UN agencies active there, as well as relevant Palestinian and Israeli NGOs, some of whom are supported in their work by Irish Aid.  My colleague, Minister of State Joe Costello T.D., witnessed at first hand the very difficult conditions on the ground in Gaza during his recent visit to the occupied Palestinian territory to see the impact of Ireland's aid programme.  He met directly with the UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. James Rawley, and others.</p><p>  While Israeli restrictions have eased marginally in recent years, the overall situation in Gaza has worsened in recent months as Egypt has taken action against smuggling into Gaza, in response to its own security concerns.  The existing fuel shortfall and shortage of supply of building materials, accentuated by the closure of tunnels, is affecting the daily lives of residents, their electricity supply and water and sewage facilities.  In addition, delivery of construction materials through the crossings from Israel, which had been gradually increased, was suspended again in October following the discovery of a reinforced tunnel dug into Israel from Gaza, with the apparent purpose of facilitating an attack into Israel, perhaps on the soldiers manning the border.</p><p>  The power situation is a complex one. Both Israel and Egypt supply electricity to Gaza through the grid system, at commercial rates.  In addition, the Gaza Power Plant supplied about one third of the total available power, using fuel supplied by the Palestinian Authority via Israel, and cheaper fuel smuggled in from Egypt.  Both of these sources have been cut recently, partly because of a dispute in which Hamas has refused to pay for the fuel supplied to Gaza by the Palestinian Authority.  The loss of one third of what was already a marginal power supply has led to increased outages, including to vital water and sewage facilities.</p><p>  The loss of construction materials and of power has led to major lay-offs in the construction sector, one of Gaza's few large employers, and thus increased the level of food dependency, which is the principal cause of concern.  More than 800,000 of the over 1.2 million Palestine refugees in Gaza receive food assistance from UNRWA, which also provides basic education, health, relief and social services.</p><p>  Ireland has responded to the current crisis by providing additional funding of &euro;500,000 to UNRWA to support the food assistance element of their Gaza Emergency Appeal.  This brings Ireland's total contribution to UNRWA's appeals for Gaza to &euro;4.64 million since 2006.  UNRWA's food assistance provides a lifeline for thousands of refugee families in Gaza and helps to prevent a potentially large scale crisis in a context where an estimated 57% of households are classified as food insecure.  This funding support is in addition to Ireland's broader programme of assistance to the Palestinian people and brings our total funding support to date in 2013 to &euro;8.3 million.  This includes support to UNRWA's general fund, the Palestinian Authority, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and civil society organisations working to promote human rights and democratisation.</p><p>  It is clear, however, that humanitarian aid can only seek to ameliorate the difficulties, which will persist until there is a solution at political level. Ireland has therefore continued to draw attention to the urgent need for an end to the overall blockade of Gaza.  We have sought to maintain a focus on this issue, as have organisations such as Amnesty International in their recent report, despite the many other crises in the Middle East at present.  We argue this position consistently in our regular contacts with the Israeli authorities, both in Israel and with the Embassy here in Dublin.  I have raised the matter repeatedly at EU level, to push for the EU to do more to press Israel to end the blockade.  I have made clear before my view that the international community is not doing enough on this issue.  Ireland has also raised Gaza at multilateral level, including in recent weeks interventions at the UN General Assembly in New York and the Human Rights Council in Geneva.</p><p>  In the case of Egypt, the sole crossing point at Rafah is not closed, although it is operating at a more restricted level, as a result of the turmoil in Egypt itself.  The main impact has been from Egypt's effective action against the smuggling tunnels, which we cannot take issue with.  However, the loss of the extra supplies formerly obtained through smuggling has highlighted the shortages caused by the overall Israeli blockade regime.  Their interdiction now only underscores the urgent need for the opening to normal traffic of the main crossings from Israel.  I have urged Egypt to allow the widest possible use of Rafah for normal commercial, human and humanitarian traffic.</p><p>  Israel is entitled to take measures for the security of its people and borders from attacks which have come from Gaza over a number of years.  Nevertheless, it is clear to me that some measures taken, and the overall regime enforced on Gaza, have a negative impact on the entire civilian population and cannot be justified by security needs.  Whether a particular measure amounts to a prohibited act, such as collective punishment, under international humanitarian law is, however, ultimately a matter for legal determination.</p></reply>

In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis which enhances the cost-effectiveness of our external representation.  Our missions abroad work very closely with the state agencies in the promotion of exports, tourism and inward investment.  They perform also a wide range of functions in support of Ireland's foreign policy interests.  These include representing and advancing government policies with other states and in international organisations; economic and cultural promotion; frontline consular and passport services to citizens overseas; engaging with and supporting Irish communities and with programme management, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.</p><p>  The size and deployment of the State's network of missions abroad is kept under ongoing review and any possible reconfiguration would have regard to national priorities and available resources.

Any chargeable gain arising on such a disposal is subject to capital gains tax, calculated in accordance with the Capital Gains Tax Acts.  Where, in addition to compensation for the acquisition of the land, interest is paid to the landowner, that interest is income for tax purposes.  The interest is paid subject to deduction of tax at source at the standard rate of 20% by the authority by virtue of section 246(2) Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.

During the compiling of the Property Register matching difficulties were encountered when consolidating the various Government and non-Government data sources used, and as a consequence some properties were associated with persons on the basis of outdated address information.  As part of its comprehensive LPT communications strategy, Revenue clearly stated that errors in the compilation of the Property Register were inevitable given the scale of the task and requested anybody who received incorrect information on their properties to contact the LPT Helpline immediately to have their records amended.</p><p>  In the case raised by the Deputy, Revenue issued an LPT 1 Return for 2013 to an address previously used to correspond with the person in question in respect of other taxes.  The person subsequently filed his 2013 LPT Return via the online system without using a Property ID and PIN and in doing so created a second property record.  This resulted in the computer system incorrectly categorising the person as a multiple property owner for LPT purposes and assessing him on that basis for both 2013 and 2014.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed that the &quot;duplicate&quot; property has been removed from the Property Register and the address details of the person have been correctly updated.  Revenue has made direct contact with the person to confirm his details and has also provided him with a new Property ID and PIN to facilitate future access to his LPT records.</p></reply>

Figures of the numbers availing of the tax reliefs are also provided, where available.  Tax relief on employee or individual contributions is allowed at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax subject to limits based on annual earnings and age.  Figures have been rounded where appropriate.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that while corresponding updates of the figures are not yet available for the tax year 2011 the necessary work of assembling the basic data to enable this to be done is ongoing.  No data is yet available for 2012 or 2013.</p><p>  Finally, it should be borne in mind that the information imparted by the costing of tax and other reliefs in the pensions area is inherently limited.  It may suggest a significant notional loss in terms of tax foregone as compared with the savings that might be expected if the tax relief was not available.  However, where tax relief arrangements are of such significance, as in this instance, the removal of the reliefs would represent a fundamental adjustment to the current balance of the tax system and would have very significant implications in terms, among other things, of the economic and behavioural impacts which would ensue.  These impacts would be difficult to model in advance.  For these reasons, the real informational content of the costings of tax reliefs is limited and should be treated with some caution.</p><p><b>2006</b><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro; million</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>540</td><td>693,100</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>120</td><td>363,100</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>510</td><td>363,100</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>435</td><td>125,900</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>55</td><td>45,200</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>220</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2007</b><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs</th><th>Numbers<br /><br />availing</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro; million</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>590</td><td>708,500</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>150</td><td>364,700 </td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>540</td><td>364,700</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>408</td><td>121,300</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>61</td><td>46,600</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>240</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2008</b><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs</th><th>Numbers<br /><br />availing</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro; million</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>655</td><td>792,600</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>165</td><td>362,700</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>595</td><td>362,700</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>353</td><td>116,000</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>74</td><td>53,900</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>255</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2009</b><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs</th><th>Numbers<br /><br />availing</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro; million</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>730</td><td>713,600</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>155</td><td>342,200</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>560</td><td>342,200</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>237</td><td>101,300</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>77</td><td>56,200</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>230</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p><p><b>2010</b><table><tr><th>Estimate of the cost of certain tax reliefs for private pension provision </th><th>Estimated costs</th><th>Numbers<br /><br />availing</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro; million</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Employees' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>599</td><td>625,100</td></tr><tr><td>Employers' Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes</td><td>141</td><td>302,900</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of exemption of employers' contributions from employee BIK</td><td>515</td><td>302,900</td></tr><tr><td>Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)</td><td>180</td><td>82,200</td></tr><tr><td>Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)</td><td>73</td><td>52,300</td></tr><tr><td>Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee contributions</td><td>231</td><td>Not available</td></tr></table></p></reply>

ARFs are not pension schemes per se.  They are investment options into which the proceeds of certain pension arrangements can be invested on retirement.  Under the &quot;ARF option&quot;, individuals are entitled to take their retirement lump sum and, with the balance of their pension fund, purchase an annuity, invest in an ARF or take the balance in cash subject to tax.  Where the ARF route is chosen, beneficial ownership of the assets in the ARF vests in the individual.</p><p>  Electing to invest in an ARF or to receive the balance of a pension fund in cash are subject to conditions.  The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (&quot;specified income&quot;) actually in payment for life at the time the option is exercised.  The Finance Act 2013 provided for a specified income limit of &euro;12,700 per annum.  This was a reduction from the limit provided for in Finance Act 2011 of 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory), which had been a limit of &euro;18,000. </p><p>  While any investment income or capital gains arising are exempt from tax while the funds are invested in the ARF, I should point out that sums withdrawn or deemed to be withdrawn from an ARF are subject to tax at the individual ARF-owner's marginal income tax rate.  The 2006 Budget and Finance Act introduced an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets in an ARF on 31 December each year, which notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate.  This measure was introduced because the internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used, as intended, to fund an income stream in retirement but, in certain cases, was being used to build up substantial funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term.  The imputed distribution measure is designed to encourage the use of ARFs, as intended, in the way of actual draw downs being made which are subject to tax.</p><p>  The annual imputed distribution of ARF assets was increased from 3% to 5% in Budget and Finance Act 2011 in respect of asset values as at 31 December 2010 and future years.  It was further increased from 5% to 6% for ARFs with asset values in excess of &euro;2 million at 31 December 2012 and future years.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, based on returns made by Qualifying Fund Managers, the yield from the taxation of the annual imputed distribution of ARF assets for the years 2007 to 2012 is as follows.</p><p><b>Yield from the taxation of the annual imputed distribution of ARF assets 2007 &ndash; 2012</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Yield (&euro; million)</th></tr><tr><td>2007 (earliest available)</td><td>2.75</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>6.5</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>7.9</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>10.3</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>11.6</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>11.5</td></tr></table></p></reply>

For example, Revenue has answered in excess of 900,000 phone calls and replied to approximately 220,000 letters or emails since March 2013.  In particular, Revenue has experienced unprecedented demand for customer support in recent weeks following the issue of payment reminder notifications in respect of 2014 LPT obligations.</p><p>  In the specific case raised by the Deputy, the person concerned acquired four properties between July and September of this year and the details of these transactions were correctly entered to Revenue's e-Stamping system.  However, due to technical difficulties the transactions did not correctly transfer across to the Property Register.  The person made direct contact with Revenue on 30 October requesting that the properties in question be linked to him and Revenue responded on 31 October requesting his PPSN and the relevant Property ID numbers, which he should have received from his solicitor as part of the conveyance process.  The person responded to Revenue on 4 November and provided his PPSN and the addresses of three of the properties but did not provide the Property ID numbers.  Revenue subsequently tried to link the properties to the person from the information supplied but unfortunately this proved to be a difficult matching exercise without the Property IDs.  The linkages were further delayed because the person was involved in a fourth property transaction while the correspondence of 4 November only confirmed three transactions.</p><p>  Revenue has acknowledged that the person made a number of contacts over the following weeks in an effort to clarify the situation, but because of the volume of correspondence during that period he did not receive a timely reply.  However, Revenue has confirmed that the properties in question have now been identified and correctly linked to the person in question.  Revenue has assured me that a member of the LPT team will contact the person in the coming days to confirm all the details and will assist him in completing his LPT obligations as necessary.</p><p>  Revenue has confirmed that the person is considered LPT compliant because his queries were received in advance of the filing deadline and he will not be subject to any penalties providing he meets the outstanding obligations in a timely manner after he receives contact from the LPT team.</p></reply>

The tax treatment of non-residents in Ireland is in line with the position prevailing in many other jurisdictions.  The general treatment under the various taxes can be summarised as follows.</p><p><b>Income Tax and Universal Social Charge</b></p><p>  - Individuals who are resident in the State for a tax year are liable to Irish income tax and the USC on their worldwide income for that tax year, and</p><p>  - Individuals who are not resident here for tax purposes are liable to Irish income tax and the USC on their Irish source income and on income attributable to duties of an employment exercised here.</p><p><b>Capital Gains Tax</b></p><p>  - Persons who are either resident and domiciled or ordinarily resident and domiciled in the State for a tax year are liable to Irish CGT on their worldwide chargeable gains.</p><p>  - Individuals who are resident or ordinarily resident in the State but are not domiciled in the State are liable to Irish income tax and CGT on income or chargeable gains arising outside the State where the income or chargeable gains are received in the State.</p><p>  - Persons who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State for a tax year are liable to Irish CGT on chargeable gains made on the disposal of certain Irish assets, as follows: <blockquote>  - assets of a business carried on by such a person in the State,<br /><br />   -interests in land, buildings or minerals situated in the State,<br /><br />  - exploration or exploitation of rights in the Continental Shelf, and <br /><br />  - unquoted shares which derive their value, or the greater part of their value, from any of these assets. </blockquote><b>Capital Acquisitions Tax</b></p><p>  - Beneficiaries who take a gift or inheritance are within the charge to CAT if the assets, the subject of the gift or inheritance, are situated in the State.  This charge applies equally to both Irish resident beneficiaries of those assets and also to non-Irish resident beneficiaries of those assets.</p><p>  - Beneficiaries who take a gift or inheritance are also within the charge to CAT if the assets, the subject of the gift or inheritance, are situated abroad but the individual who provides a gift or inheritance is resident in Ireland, irrespective of whether that beneficiary is Irish resident or non-Irish resident.</p><p><b>Domicile Levy</b></p><p>  - The Domicile Levy applies to an individual:</p><p>  - who is domiciled in the State in a tax year,</p><p>  - whose world-wide income for the tax year exceeds &euro;1m,</p><p>  - whose liability to Irish income tax for the tax year is less than &euro;200,000, and</p><p>  - the market value of whose Irish property on the valuation date (i.e. 31 December)   is in excess of &euro;5m.</p><p>  - The Domicile Levy applies irrespective of whether or not the individual is resident in the State. </p><p>  In circumstances where double taxation would otherwise arise there are provisions for relief in accordance with the terms of relevant double taxation treaties.</p></reply>

The Financial Conglomerates Directive 2002/87/EC (FICOD) came into effect in 2005 and it applies supplementary prudential supervision to mixed financial groups that carry out both banking/investment firm activities and insurance activities of a significant size.  On 16 November 2011, the European Parliament and Council adopted the amending Directive 2011/89/EU, which revised amongst other things the existing Financial Conglomerates Directive (2002/87/EC).  The Transposition date was 10 June 2013 for this Directive. </p><p>  Work is ongoing on a draft Statutory Instrument with the Office of Parliamentary Council, the Department of Finance and with the Central Bank of Ireland.  This transposition is late due to the resource implications of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the prioritisation of the transposition of the Capital Requirements Directive.  In addition, the subject matter contains a number of references to entities supervised under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRD) 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU and because of this it is envisaged that this will be completed alongside the CRD IV transposition later this month or in early January. </p><p>  It is also worth noting that the deadline of 30 June 2013 for the transposition of Directive 2009/138/EC (Solvency II) has been extended to 31 March 2015 with the implementation date extended to 1 January 2016.</p></reply>

The contractual position in respect of SNAs is outlined in their contract of employment.  Links to the SNA Contracts of Employment are as follows: Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 12/05 (Post-Primary) - ; and  Department of Education and Skills Circular SNA 15/05 (Primary) - .  This contract of employment is augmented by all of the relevant Departmental Circulars governing Special Needs Assistants which detail the standardised terms and conditions of employment for SNAs.  These Circulars are amended and new Circulars are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills from time to time.  </p><p>  The position regarding the working hours of full-time SNAs is as outlined in the standard SNA contract of employment, which was agreed by this Department, the Trade Unions (IMPACT and SIPTU) representing SNAs and the Management Bodies in 2005.  In that context, the standard SNA contract has been designed to be flexible to cater for the different spectrum of working hours across all the various schools including primary, post-primary and special schools.  No set hours were agreed but instead full-time SNAs are expected to work for the normal school hours in the school that they are working in, and in addition to be available for a period of time before and after school in order to help with reception and dispersal of children and preparation and tidying up of classrooms etc.  These times are set locally by the school management and will vary from school to school depending on the requirements of the school. </p><p>  In addition, all SNAs were required to be available for a number of days at the start and finish of each school term not exceeding 12 in total.  Under the Croke Park Agreement it was agreed to introduce greater flexibility to the use of these 12 days.  These 12 days now equate to 72 hours (pro-rata for part-time SNAs) to be used by schools as an additional bank of hours to be utilised and delivered outside of normal school opening hours and/or the normal school year.  SNAs who are employed in a part-time capacity are paid a pro-rata amount dependent upon their level of hours of employment.  Part-time SNAs are paid on the agreed divisor rate for pay purposes for part-time SNAs which is 32 hours.  Furthermore, the issue of appropriate working hours for all public servants was one of the key aspects of the set of proposals for a public service agreement which were put forward by the Labour Relations Commission and which now form the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013-2016 (the Haddington Road Agreement).</p><p>  The specific text of the Haddington Road Agreement relating to working hours for SNAs is as follows:</p><p>&quot;SPECIAL NEEDS ASSISTANTS Hours</p><p>  Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, discussions took place that led to agreement on changed attendance arrangements for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) that give schools the option of an additional two hours working time per week from each Special Needs Assistant.  Under the terms of this Agreement on increased working hours in the Public Service, the available requirements in schools for additional hours for SNAs is quite limited.  Given issues such as the duration of the school day and operation hours, and the specific availability of individual SNAs the details of the utilisation of any additional requirements should be the subject of further discussions.</p><p>  These new attendance arrangements, allied to the provisions outlined in the above paragraph should be the subject of a review by the LRC in advance of the 2013/2014 school year, involving the Department of Education and Skills and IMPACT/SIPTU, in order to assess if the additional hours are being utilised in the most effective and appropriate manner and in order to achieve agreement on any changes deemed necessary in terms of the arrangement agreed for teachers.  This will constitute the liability on Special Needs Assistants in respect of working hours for the purposes of this extension to the Public Service Agreement.&quot;</p></reply>

These Guidelines provide practical advice to primary and post-primary schools on how rental schemes can be established and operated.  The aim of the Guidelines is to help as many schools as possible to start such book rental programmes.  </p><p>The publication of these Guidelines follows a survey of schools by the Department, and which I published in May 2012.  This had a 99% response rate at primary level, and showed that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme.  At second level, the response rate was lower, at 44%.  Of those which did respond, 88% of those in the VEC sector and 73% of those in the Community &amp;amp; Comprehensive sector operated a book rental scheme. </p><p>  I believe these results show that we have a good foundation to build on across the country.  I hope that schools that are not yet operating book rental schemes will be encouraged to use the Guidelines to introduce them.  If they do, it will result in substantial savings for parents.  Schools which already have rental schemes can save parents up to 80% of the cost of buying new books.  A special &quot;Guide for Parents&quot; was also published, to inform them of how the schemes operate and how parents can help schools to establish and run them.  I have been very clear in my support for book rental schemes.  All of us who are parents know how expensive textbooks can be and what a burden it places on already hard pressed families at the start of every school year.  </p><p>I am pleased to see the high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary level and I believe that these Guidelines will encourage this practice across all schools in our education landscape. </p><p>  The Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012 and the same level of funding was provided in 2013.  The per capita funding provided to recognised primary and post-primary schools within the Free Education Scheme is set out in Circular 46/2013.  This grant can be utilised for the purposes of a school's book rental scheme.  The Deputy will also be aware from Budget 2014 that additional funding has been provided which will involve an investment of &euro;15m to support the establishment of book rental schemes in primary schools that do not currently operate them.  The Department will provide &euro;5m in seed capital per annum over a three year period to such schools.  I want to achieve a position where every primary schools has a book rental schemes in operation in the 2014/2015 school year.</p><p>  The Department will be contacting primary schools that do not currently operate a book rental scheme early in the New Year to advise them of the application process.  To qualify for seed capital funding, schools will have to undertake to establish a book rental scheme from September 2014 and in return the Department will commit to the provision of such funding in 2014, 2015 and 2016.  This scheme will be confined to primary schools that do not currently operate such a scheme.</p></reply>

Carlow and Co. Wicklow from 2007 to 2012 are set out in the following tabular statement.</p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.  In order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With improvements in infrastructure and investment in one town in a region it has a positive effect on other towns in the region.</p><p>  The East Region, which includes Wicklow, has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment from FDI companies and employing 67,860 people.  At present, there are 17 IDA supported companies in Co. Wicklow employing 2,267 people.  </p><p>  IDA Ireland's Strategy for County Carlow within the South East Region is to progress the development of a knowledge economy so that the county, and particularly the county town of Carlow, can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  Carlow has traditionally been a centre of manufacturing with a strong engineering tradition in both the indigenous and overseas sectors.  At the end of 2012, there were 7 IDA Ireland supported companies in Co. Carlow employing 576 people. </p><p>  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  Among the companies who announced job creation plans or fresh investment plans in recent years for Co. Carlow were: Merck Sharp &amp;amp; Dohme Biologics (Ireland) Ltd, Unum and Merck &amp;amp; Co Inc.  Similarly, for Co. Wicklow were: Nypro and Oriflame.</p><p>  Work in winning new investments has been continuing steadily in the second half of 2013 and, on the basis of the trends so far, I am confident that the targets set out for IDA Ireland in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013, of winning more than 130 new investments, securing &euro;500m in R&amp;amp;D and creating 13,000 jobs in IDA client companies, will be achieved.</p><p><b>Table showing the amount of grants paid in Co.

Following the merger of that company with Schering Plough, the combined operation has excess manufacturing capacity worldwide.  Accordingly, as part of an overall rationalisation, the company has, unfortunately  decided to close the Swords operation by 2017 and transfer production to other factories in the group, located in countries abroad.  </p><p>  The gradual shutdown of this plant gives a valuable space to seek a new operation for the factory.  It is not anticipated that any staff will have to leave before mid-2014 at the earliest and that 130 jobs would be lost in the second half of 2014.  The remaining positions would be phased out over the following three years up to the end of 2017.  IDA Ireland will work closely with MSD with a view to identifying a buyer for the factory.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort will be made to seek to ensure that this factory can continue as an employer in the area, after the current operation is due to close in 2017. </p><p>  Regarding wider job creation in Dublin, I am pleased that the IDA continues to attract impressive levels of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) both in terms of attracting new projects and, also, expansions to existing operations in the capital.  In addition, significant Research, Development and Innovation investments have been secured across a range of sectors, including Financial Services, ICT and Pharma and major Data Centre investments are being undertaken in different parts of the county.</p><p>  In terms of wider national FDI, it is also important to remember that Ireland overall continues to be competitive in attracting new investment.  Over 1,000 multinational corporations have chosen Ireland as their strategic European base.  Multinationals currently employ 146,000 people directly and many more indirectly.  In the wider context, as a Government, we have put in place strategies for job creation that are now starting to bear fruit.  The Government will continue to deliver on its commitments in the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i>.  Through the <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> in both 2012 and in 2013 we have addressed a wide range of competitiveness issues which has helped turn the economy around and provide the base for private sector job growth.  We are currently developing an <i>Action Plan for Jobs</i> for 2014 which will build on these achievements.  The work of the enterprise agencies will continue to play a huge role in this process.  </p><p>  Recent official data has shown that 58,000 jobs have been created in the country over the last 12 months, which is an impressive achievement, in light of the economic difficulties we have faced.

The Companies Bill 2012 ("the Bill") is a consolidation of all these provisions in one Bill which aims to streamline, simplify and clarify the law.  The Bill is the largest substantive Bill in the history of the State, spread out over 25 Parts, 17 Schedules and comprising some 1,429 sections.</p><p>  Most of the existing references to &quot;servant&quot; are updated to &quot;employee&quot; in the Companies Bill 2012.  For example, Section 285 of the Companies Act 1963 uses the terms &quot;clerk, servant, workman or labourer&quot;; however in the Bill the corresponding Section 622, uses the term &quot;employee&quot; exclusively.  This is in line with the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) recommendation to modernise the language of this section.  (Second CLRG Report at paragraph 4.19.4).    The Department is currently examining a small number of other references to the term servant in the Bill to ensure that they are appropriate in the context of the relevant provision.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 80,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided over &euro;403 million in 2013. </p><p>  Revised rent limits under the rent supplement scheme came into effect from Monday 17 June 2013 and will be in place until 31 December 2014.  The new rent limits have been determined following an extensive review of the private rental market based on the most up-to-date data available.  The rent limits review was completed during the second quarter of this year and used a number of data sources including that of the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) which contained details of actual registered rental tenancies.  As outlined by the Deputy, the Daft.ie Q3 2013 rental report records a year on year increase of 4.4% in rents in County Wicklow.  There is no detailed breakdown of this figure by area within the county or by property type. </p><p>  There are currently over 2,400 rent supplement recipients in County Wicklow.  Analysis shows that there are properties available within the maximum rent limits for rent supplement recipients in County Wicklow.  It must be stressed that the purpose of the rent limit review was to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide rent supplement tenants with access to all housing in all areas.  The Department will continue to monitor rent levels throughout the country but at this point has no plans to revise any of the existing rent limits at this time.</p><p>  Reliance on rent supplement for those persons with long term housing needs is being addressed with the Department's strategic policy direction to return rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short term income support.  In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to housing authorities.  Officials in the Department are working with those in the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, who are leading the project, in developing the necessary legal, policy and operational requirements to give effect to this transfer.</p></reply>

The Department considers that this requirement is necessary to ensure that the host organisation can offer the intern a high-quality, real-workplace experience.  The Department also considers that the support and example of workplace colleagues is a necessary part of the internship experience and that this is critical in enhancing the experience for the intern.

This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of the state pension (transition) thereby standardising state pension age for all at 66 years.  The state pension age will be further increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 years in 2028.  These changes apply to all fully insured employees.  Raising State pension age and the abolition of the State pension (transition) is a necessary step in ensuring the sustainability of pensions into the future.  The recently published OECD report on the Review of the Irish Pension System confirms that reforms are necessary if we are to continue to put pension provision on a sustainable footing given the changes in demographics, the deficit in the Social Insurance Fund, and the difficult fiscal situation.</p><p>  Where individuals exit the workforce prior to pension age they may seek the support of either the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes. Jobseeker's benefit is a weekly payment to people out of work and covered by social insurance and legislation provides that, subject to the person having paid 156 or more qualifying contributions and satisfying the general scheme conditions, a person whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. On this basis, workers who suffer a substantial loss of employment at age 65 will generally be able to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for the full year to age 66 provided they have paid at least 156 qualifying contributions.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit is a substantial support to persons suffering the contingency of involuntary unemployment. Changes to rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context and there are no plans in this regard at present.</p></reply>

This formal learning programme will lead to a FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education.  This is the minimum entry requirement for a Childcare Practitioner.  The duration of this programme will comprise of 2 years in which the Major Award will be completed and one year work practice leading to a maximum 3 year programme overall.  </p><p>  This programme involves defined standards of achievement, a career progression path, and a structure for CE participants in Early Years Services.  These changes are designed to provide a more tailored and valuable support to the provision of community childcare and to achieve greater coherence between participation on CE and the job market. </p><p>  The objectives of this policy are: </p><p>  - to ensure that all Community Employment schemes with childcare places will, in the future, operate under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Framework and use the S&iacute;olta standards (the quality standards in childcare) as a developmental tool; </p><p>  - to provide CE participants on childcare places who work directly with children with quality work experience, training, a clear progression path and qualifications in the childcare sector; and</p><p>  - to re-align the allocation of CE childcare places under dedicated childcare schemes with the standards outlined by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.</p><p>  There will be no reduction in the number of childcare places supported under CE.  The locations where CE participants currently work will not change, but their employer will now be the dedicated childcare scheme.  Where a sponsor loses childcare places to the dedicated childcare scheme, these places can be back-filled with non-childcare related CE places provided that there is an appropriate work programme available. </p><p>  The above improvements have been informed by consultation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, County Childcare Committees and representatives of Scheme Sponsors and Supervisors.</p></reply>

The provisions of EU Directive 2010/41/EU (on the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity) require, amongst other things, the provision of social protection and maternity benefit to spouses and civil partners who are not employees or business partners but who participate in the activities of the self-employed worker, performing the same tasks or ancillary tasks.    Other requirements are a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p><p>  The deadline for transposition of the Directive was 5 August 2012.  However, the Directive allows, in particular circumstances, for an extension of up to 2 years on the period allowed for the implementation of the social insurance provisions.  Ireland secured agreement to allow it to avail of this extended period and so the deadline for implementation of this aspect of the Directive is the 5th   August 2014.

This means that, under the co-operation mechanisms outlined in Directive 2009/28/EC, there is potential for projects of scale both onshore and offshore that are aimed at export markets. It is in this context that the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Mr. Edward Davey MP, and I signed a Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation. That Memorandum sent a strong signal of our shared interest in developing the opportunity to export green electricity from Ireland to Britain and will result in completion of consideration of how Irish renewable energy resources, onshore and offshore, might be developed to the mutual benefit of both countries. The Department of Energy and Climate Change in the UK has published a response to its Call for Evidence on Renewable Energy Trading earlier this year. In that document it concluded that it was not possible to make plans for statistical transfer at this stage and noted that it was therefore exploring physical trading.    The Intergovernmental Agreement is therefore dealing specifically with projects built under the co-operation mechanisms outlined in the Renewable Energy Directive, and in the first instance joint projects. The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom is among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any Inter-Governmental Agreement. An agreed programme of work is already underway so as to prepare for the Inter-Governmental Agreement. This work programme includes economic analysis, addressing policy and regulatory questions and dealing with grid issues. There are very complex engineering and market issues to be teased out but the ambition is to settle on an Inter-Governmental Agreement in early 2014. In advance of this it would be premature to state an export quantity.</p></reply>

Cost effective harnessing of the potential of this sector will be crucial to reducing our dependence on expensive fossil fuel imports, creating a low carbon energy system and delivering jobs in the green economy. </p><p>  My Department is currently finalising an Offshore Renewable Energy Development Plan (OREDP), with a view to publication early in the new year. Informed by the findings of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), the OREDP will identify how best to coordinate action across the environmental, energy and economic development policy areas in order to realise Ireland's abundant offshore renewable energy potential, using both offshore wind, and emerging ocean, renewable technologies. </p><p>  Given the current state of readiness of ocean energy technology, the projections previously outlined for the sector to 2020 will not be achieved. Globally, the industry is at the pre-commercial stage. However, recent years have seen progress, including by indigenous developers, of some promising wave technology devices. While the sustainability and security of supply benefits of ocean energy will ultimately accrue to Ireland, with the right investment and support strategy, ocean energy also offers the potential for significant growth and employment in the medium to longer term. By investing in the early stages of the development of the sector, which will be a key deliverable of the forthcoming OREDP, a significant part of the value chain, with its associated employment benefits, could be captured.  </p></reply>

This work programme includes economic analysis, addressing policy and regulatory questions and dealing with grid issues. There are very complex engineering and market issues to be teased out but the ambition is to settle on an Inter-Governmental Agreement in early 2014. A key objective, from an Irish Government perspective, is to realise the potential for investment, jobs and growth. The amount of energy to be procured by the United Kingdom, the sharing of the renewable energy credit, including the quantity and duration, and the mechanisms for sharing the resultant economic benefits, including an appropriate return to the Exchequer, are among the matters to be addressed ahead of signing any Inter-Governmental Agreement.</p></reply>

Transposition of the Third Energy Package, designed to facilitate completion of the internal market in electricity and gas, is a complex process.  The European Commission has issued two Reasoned Opinions to Ireland in regard to its transposition of certain electricity related aspects of the package.  The Commission stated that it wishes in the additional Reasoned Opinion, which issued in late April 2013, to complement the June 2012 Reasoned Opinion, with, inter alia, clarification of its views with regard to the transposition of the unbundling provisions in the Electricity Directive.  My Department, following careful evaluation of the Commission's opinion, replied in September 2013 and will continue to liaise with the Commission on how full compliance is being implemented in Ireland.  The second case relates to a Reasoned Opinion issued on Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC.  A response to the Reasoned Opinion is currently being prepared and will issue in the coming weeks.  The reply will set out: those articles whose transposition has been notified to the Commission since the Reasoned Opinion; those articles that require legislative amendment; and those articles that my Department considers to have been transposed through a combination of legislation and administrative procedures. Initial draft legislation is being progressed.</p><p>  The third case relates to Directive 2009/31/EC on the geological storage of carbon dioxide and amending Council Directive 85/337/EEC, European Parliament and Council Directives 2000/60/EC, 2001/80/EC, 2004/35/EC, 2006/12/EC, 2008/1/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006.  My Department transposed this in November 2011 exercising a provision under Article 4 of the Directive, not to allow geological storage of CO2 for a period of 5 years as it was considered appropriate to await technological progress and work internationally.  The Commission issued a Reasoned Opinion on 20 November 2013 as they do not consider this approach, which has been adopted by a number of countries, to constitute full transposition and consider that the Directive has only been partially transposed.  My Department is now examining options to finalise transposition of the two articles (12 &amp;amp; 21) that are mentioned in the Reasoned Opinion.  My Department will liaise with the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Commission to ensure that a literal translation of the relevant Directive text into an EC Regulation made under the 1972 Act will satisfactorily transpose the Directive.  My Department is looking at early 2014 to notify the Commission of final implementing measures.  My Department continues to be committed to delivering full compliance on all three Directives.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date has been liable to pay the Household Charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. It has been a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the Charge. The Local Government Management Agency has been administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.</p><p>  I understand from data provided by the Agency that as of 3 December 2013 the total number of registrations for the Household Charge is 1, 304,934. Payments have been registered in respect of 1,280,482 liable properties and waivers have been registered in respect of a further 2 4,452 liable properties. The number of estimated liable properties for the Household Charge is 1,620,814, and therefore the compliance rate stands in excess of 80.5 %.</p><p>  I am advised by the Agency that approximately &euro; 9.3m has been collected by the local government sector in the form of Household Charge late payment penalties in respect of approximately 355,000 properties. Due to owners of multiple properties, some of which may be compliant and some of which may be non-compliant, it is not possible at this time to specify the number of owners who have paid Household Charge late payment penalties.   </p><p>  Under the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 outstanding Household Charge liabilities were, on 1 July 2013, increased to &euro;200 and became a Local Property Tax liability collectable by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.   Queries concerning the collection of Local Property tax liabilities which are former Household Charge arrears should be addressed, in the first instance, to the Revenue Commissioners.</p></reply>

Part 4 of the Act provides for security of tenure on the basis of four-year cycles whereby tenancies are deemed terminated at the end of each four year period and a new tenancy then comes into being, assuming the dwelling continues to be let to the same person. The first cycle of these tenancies is known as &lsquo; Part 4 tenancy&rsquo; and each subsequent one is called a &lsquo;further Part 4 tenancy&rsquo; in the Act.   </p><p>  Where a tenancy lasts in excess of 4 years, it becomes a &lsquo;further Part 4 tenancy&rsquo; and must be re-registered on payment of the &euro;90 registration fee.

Local authorities are continuing to pursue developers and others to comply with their obligations under planning regulations. Predominantly developer/funder/receiver funded site resolution processes will remain the main vehicle to tackle unfinished developments. 553 developments have been brought to a resolution point in this way over the past 12 months alone.  I expect that such processes will continue to make significant inroads into the remaining 992 inhabited unfinished developments.</p><p>  Additionally, my Department has available a Special Resolution Fund of &euro;10 million, provided in Budget 2014, to address the completion of infrastructure on developments which could not be resolved because of absences of, or inadequacies in, planning securities and other unforeseen cost and risk issues.  The fund will be operated by the local authorities and will be carefully targeted mainly to address difficulties in public infrastructure that have arisen on certain developments included in my Department&rsquo;s National Housing Development Survey 2013.  It is also necessary to explore resolution of those developments which appear to be commercially unviable due to location, build quality, commercial demand or other factors and where the most prudent course of action may be to seek the agreement of owners/funders to clear all or part of the site.</p><p>  Accordingly, the National Coordinating Committee established a group to oversee the development of a strategy for these residual developments and to work with stakeholders in identifying and agreeing such sites for full or partial clearance, thereby improving the lives of existing residents and removing dangerous structures from public access.  I understand that forty such developments have been initially identified and fall to be addressed by the relevant owners, receivers and funders.  The names of the individual estates identified by the funders have not been identified to my Department for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  The costs associated with this strategy are equally sensitive and I do not hold this information. Responsibility for the clearance of unviable estates remains the responsibility of the funders and I welcome their participation in this pragmatic approach which will further underscore a return to a properly functioning property market.</p></reply>

Many licensed premises already provide a broad range of non-alcoholic alternative beverages in response to consumer demand and I would strongly encourage all licensed premises to do so. I would, however, be reluctant to impose a statutory obligation concerning the availability of specified products on licensed premises since there may be little local demand for any such product and such a provision would place an additional enforcement burden on the Garda&iacute;. </p></reply>

The Director General assured me that the concerns raised by the Inspector will be dealt with. In particular, concerns raised in terms of the general maintenance of the D&oacute;chas Centre and housekeeping matters have been addressed. In addition, a major refurbishment programme has been undertaken by the Irish Prison Service to upgrade kitchens and the reception area.</p><p>  In April 2012, I published the Irish Prison Service 3 year Strategic Plan.  This strategy sets out the overall high level objectives and key strategic actions the Irish Prison Service intends to take during the period 2012 to 2015.  One of the commitments given in the Strategy is that the Irish Prison Service will work in partnership with the Probation Service and other stakeholders in the statutory, community and voluntary sectors in order to develop a strategy for dealing with women offenders.   It is intended to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons by 2014, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p><p>  In this regard, I can advise the Deputy that the Irish Prison Service and Probation Service published a joint Strategic Plan for 2013-2015.  Both agencies are working together to develop a strategy which ensures a more targeted response to women offenders including:</p><p>  - identifying and diverting women at risk of a custodial sentence through greater use of community sanctions, supports and inter-agency co-operation;</p><p>  - strengthening early intervention measures in the community through adopting a co-ordinated multi-agency approach;</p><p>  - improving outcomes for women currently in custody; </p><p>  - exploring the potentials of women centric alternatives to custody;</p><p>  - development of a suitable step down facility for women offenders, a pathway such as this from the D&oacute;chas Centre to the community would have a positive effect on reducing the numbers in the Dochas Centre;</p><p>  - enhanced co-operation with the community and voluntary sector.</p><p>  In addition in September 2012, I announced the establishment of a Working Group to conduct a Strategic Review of Penal Policy.  In line with a recommendation of the Thornton Hall Review Group which reported in 2012, the Working Group has been asked to carry out an all encompassing strategic review of penal policy incorporating an examination and analysis of all aspects of penal policy including the issue of female prisoners.  This Review is ongoing and the Working Group is expected to report early next year.</p></reply>

This process has already commenced.  The National Disability Authority  facilitated consultations with the Deaf Community in Ireland in 2012 at my request in relation to actions that could make improvements in the lives of deaf people and submissions received from them were considered for inclusion where possible and appropriate in the National Disability Strategy Implementation Plan  which was published in July 2013.</p><p>  As part of the follow-up to that initiative,  I chaired the first special themed meeting of the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group  on the issue of Irish Sign Language on November 28. This meeting brought together representatives of relevant Departments, the National Disability Authority, the Deaf community and other relevant stakeholders with a view to further progressing the implementation of the NDSIP in this regard.</p><p>  The meeting reviewed the current situation across Government Departments and their Agencies with regard to promoting recognition of Irish Sign Language including in service provision  and provided the Deaf Community with the opportunity of presenting their experience of dealing with the Public Sector.  It also provided a useful opportunity to examine mechanisms which could promote the further use and recognition of Irish Sign Language and understand practical implications for service users.  The intention is that outcome of this ongoing process will be reflected in the NDSIP through the incorporation of new actions and related performance indicators and timelines where necessary. Progress on all relevant actions will then be monitored as part of the Implementation Plan monitoring process.</p><p>  The focus therefore remains on the identification of mechanisms for the further promotion and recognition of ISL with a view to promoting and supporting its use, thereby improving service delivery on the ground, rather than on its designation as an official language.  The existing legislation in Ireland gives a level of recognition and practical measures equal to, or above that, in countries which have formally recognised sign language.</p></reply>

The Strategy is being led out under the stewardship of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Alex White.  Under the National Drugs Strategy, the HSE is the lead organisation, under the treatment pillar, with responsibility for expanding the availability of, and access to residential detox facilities and treatment services for under-18s. </p><p>  In the meantime, the Community Programmes Unit of Irish Youth Justice Service, working in partnership with the Young Persons Division of the Probation Service has supported the organisation in question over the past few years.

It will be considered by Young Persons Probation and the Irish Youth Justice Service in the context of youth justice priorities and available resources. The Irish Youth Justice Service expects to be in a position to notify the funding allocations for 2014 to community based organisations early in January.</p></reply>

The survivors and the relatives of those killed and injured have borne the grief of these tragic events and the memory of their loved ones lives on with them.</p><p>  The atrocities perpetrated in Dublin, Monaghan, Dundalk and elsewhere in the 1970s stand out in the memory as particularly bloody episodes in this island&rsquo;s history.  These incidents are among those reflected on in the book to which the Deputy refers.  The Garda authorities are, of course, aware of the claims in the book.  The Deputy will be aware that the author relies to some extent on material arising from the PSNI's historical enquiries team.  The Garda authorities maintain a close working relationship with the PSNI and the historical enquiries team.</p><p>  The late Judge Henry Barron and Mr. Patrick McEntee SC carried out detailed and painstaking inquiries into those awful events in Dublin and Monaghan in May 1974 and, indeed, other tragic atrocities that took place between 1972 and 1976 in which so many innocent people lost their lives.  The Garda authorities co-operated fully with the Barron and McEntee inquiries.    Since this Government took office, the Taoiseach has raised the issue with the British Prime Minister and the T&aacute;naiste has also raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The Deputy will wish to note also that the Taoiseach met with Justice for the Forgotten and a group of victims and relatives in July of this year and assured them of the Government&rsquo;s continued support for their cause.</p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that this House and Seanad &Eacute;ireann have previously and unanimously urged the British Government to allow access to documents relevant to these events.  I know that many Deputies in this House have raised this issue directly with our counterparts at Westminster and that they will continue to do so.</p></reply>

But I can say that there is no evidence available to indicate that the phone of the Taoiseach was subject to the types of activities referred to by the Deputy.</p><p>  The Irish Government&rsquo;s concerns in relation to surveillance issues have been conveyed bilaterally in contacts with the US Embassy in Dublin and it has been made clear to the US Embassy that any such surveillance here would be unacceptable.</p><p>  In a response to a previous Parliamentary Question on this matter my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated that following allegations of US surveillance of European Union institutions earlier this year, the EU has engaged regularly with the US authorities in both Washington and Brussels to seek clarification on the issues raised.  An EU-US High Level Expert Group on data protection has been established, where this and related matters are discussed. The EU is represented on this working group by the European Commission, the Presidency of the Council and the European External Action Service (EEAS), and the work of the group is ongoing.  A number of meetings have already taken place in Brussels and in Washington.  Following this work, the Commission and the Presidency are expected to issue a public, factual report.</p></reply>

It was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on 27 June, 2013.  Following full consideration, the Visa Officer decided to refuse the grant of the visa on 18 October, 2013.  The decision to refuse was appealed on 24 October, 2013 and was upheld by an Appeals Officer on 14 November, 2013 and a letter providing the reasons for this was issued to the applicant.</p><p>  The Visa Appeals Officer did not consider that the person concerned provided sufficient evidence of their relationship history with their spouse in Ireland.  Such evidence is key to establishing to the satisfaction of the Appeals Officer the <i>bona fides</i> of the relationship.  Furthermore, the Visa Appeals Officer deemed the evidence provided to demonstrate adequate levels of available finances to be insufficient.  This increases the likelihood that the granting of a visa in this case could result in a cost to State funds or resources.</p><p>  It is open to the person concerned to make a new application should she so wish.  Where doing so, the applicant should be in a position to address the reasons for the refusal.  Guidelines regarding the visa application procedure are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service <i>- </i><i>.</i></p><p>  Queries in relation to general immigration matters may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

The main acquisitions for 2013 were four tractor units, four 4x4 ambulances, four transit crew cabs, one 52 seater coach, five Ford Ranger 4 x 4 vehicles, twenty transit stores vans and a number of fork-lifts and recovery trailers.  In addition, funding is provided on a continuous basis for the required maintenance of vehicles in the military transport fleet. </p><p>  With regard to the Naval Service, a contract for the provision of two new ships was placed with Babcock Marine, UK in October, 2010. The first ship to be named LE Samuel Beckett is scheduled for delivery in March 2014; the second will be delivered in early 2015.  This vessel replacement strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.  The acquisition of these new vessels with the very latest equipment suites will ensure that the Naval Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the State&rsquo;s sovereign rights over our waters and our fisheries and meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection.</p><p>  The equipment and aircraft available to the Air Corps are of a high standard and are maintained by the Air Corps in accordance with best practice.  There is no provision for the acquisition of new aircraft for the Air Corps in 2013.  However, a significant level of investment in new equipment for the Air Corps took place in recent years.  The investment programme included the delivery of Pilatus training aircraft, the acquisition of two light utility EC 135 and six utility AW 139 helicopters and a mid life upgrade on the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.  Expenditure in the Air Corps for 2013 relates to the maintenance and Power by the Hour contracts set up to keep the fleet operational and to maintenance on the CASA aircraft.</p></reply>

Taking these departures into account, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 October 2013 stood at 9,222.  As the Deputy will be aware the Government has agreed a stabilised strength of 9,500 for the Permanent Defence Force. In the context of current strength numbers being below the agreed stabilised strength.</p><p>  General Service recruitment recommenced in September 2013 from the existing competition panels.  As of 2 December, there has been an intake of 360 recruits from these panels.  In addition, 9 Engine Room Artificers for the Naval Service have recently been recruited while the induction of up to 8 Apprentices for the Air Corps is in the process of being completed. It is my intention that targeted recruitment will continue within the resource envelope allocated to Defence and in this regard it is planned to run a new General Service recruitment competition in the first half of 2014.  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

All staff caring for children in a pre-school service will be subject to a minimum qualification requirement of FETAC Level 5, while pre-school leaders delivering the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme will require a Level 6 qualification.  These requirements will come into effect from September 2014 for new services, and from September 2015 for existing services.</p><p>  In light of these timeframes, my Department has sought to work with the child-care sector to accelerate the process for training and upskilling its staff and improving the quality of care delivered to children.  It is considered that, to achieve the required qualifications in the limited timescale available, staff in the child-care sector, who are on modest pay, should not have to pay the full cost of undergoing accredited training from their own resources.</p><p>  For 2014 a learner fund totalling &euro;1.5 million will be made available through the CCCs so that existing staff can choose a suitable training provider to upskill to Level 5 or 6 as applicable. </p><p>  Early Childhood Ireland (ECI), which is the largest of the voluntary child-care organisations funded by my Department, and the Border Counties Childcare Network (BCCN), which provides quality supports including training in the Border counties area, have been asked as part of their 2013 work plan to offer additional training to the existing child-care workforce in relevant training modules at FETAC Levels 5 and 6.  Additional grant funding will be made available to ECI and the BCCN in 2013 to provide for this.</p><p>  Both ECI and BCCN submitted proposals to my Department outlining their plans to provide the increased level of training support to the child-care sector in line with their roles as voluntary child-care organisations.</p><p>  242 child-care workers are currently participating in two FETAC Level 5 and ten FETAC Level 6 training modules provided by ECI.  A further 278 child-care workers will commence training across fifteen courses (four Level 5 and eleven Level 6), in January 2014, with another 94 commencing training across five courses (one level 5 and four level 6) in February 2014.  Some of the training courses are being delivered online, with the remainder being delivered face-to-face.</p><p>  BCCN has identified approximately 60 child-care practitioners who will avail of their training programme with some of these commencing training as early as next week. The training modules for remaining participants will commence in January 2014.</p></reply>

The Framework will set out the overall principles, vision and outcomes for children and young people and will guide actions across Government over the period 2014 to 2018.  I expect to circulate the Framework to other Ministers in December. Following approval by Government the Framework will be published early in the New Year for discussion at a Government meeting in January.  The Early Years Strategy is one of a number of more detailed strategies under the Children and Young  People's Policy Framework, and it also currently being developed by my Department.</p><p>  Following my announcement that I would lead the preparation of Ireland's first Early Years Strategy,  I appointed an Expert Advisory Group, chaired by Dr. Eilis Hennessy of UCD to advise my Department and myself on recommendations for inclusion in the Strategy.  The work of this group has now concluded and I have received their comprehensive report, entitled <i>'Right from the Start'</i>.  The report sets out a wide range of recommendations for consideration, covering issues that affect Ireland's youngest children and their families, including early childhood health, support for parents and ensuring quality in early years provision.  </p><p>  The recommendations in the report are being considered within my Department.  Last week I  held a consultation event at which key stakeholders from a wide range of relevant areas examined the recommendations and considered whether other issues needed to be considered for inclusion in the Early Years Strategy.  The report and these deliberations will contribute substantially to the final draft of the new Strategy. </p><p>  As soon as the Children and Young People's Policy Framework is approved by Government I intend to finalise the Early Years Strategy and submit it to Government for publication early in 2014.  The final Strategy, which will encompass a wide of range of issues relating to the early years of children's lives, will identify areas of responsibility including those that come under the remit of the new Child and Family Agency.   It is expected also that the Strategy will set time frames within which recommendations are to be implemented.</p></reply>

These Regulations are supported by explanatory notes which offer guidance and assistance in interpretation of the regulations.  </p><p>  Legislative amendments to Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991 were passed by the Oireachtas last week.  These amendments will underpin a number of key reforms which I am introducing as part of the Pre-School Quality Agenda with the objective of improving the quality of childcare services. The amended legislation strengthens the current inspection regime, provides a statutory basis for registration of pre-school services and also provides for the setting of minimum qualification standards for staff working directly with children in pre-school services. </p><p>  To provide for the implementation of the changes to the Act it will be necessary to amend or make additions to the current Regulations in a number of areas, and these will be considered following signing into law of the new amendments.  New National Quality Standards, which will replace the explanatory notes to the regulations and which will set out the outcomes and supporting criteria against which the quality of childcare services will be measured, will replace the existing guidelines in 2014.  However, the first priority is to embed registration, which is a new approach for the sector. Inspection against the new Standards will commence as early as practicable in 2014, following the development of new inspection tools and guidelines for services as well as  a communications exercise with services, which will need to understand the impact of the changes to how they will be inspected. </p></reply>

The purpose of foster care inspections is to review compliance with regulations and standards for all children. Despite progress from earlier inspections, inspectors found that some deficits identified previously had not been rectified.  An Action Plan to address these issues was developed by HIQA.</p><p>  In February 2013, I established a National Monitoring and Oversight Group within the HSE, to include input from a National Expert on Foster Care, to oversee implementation of the Action Plan and I received quarterly updates on the progress.  I received the final report from the group on 1 November 2013.</p><p>  I have been advised by the HSE that they have met with HIQA on several occasions to review progress. The HSE are due to have a further meeting with HIQA at the end of January 2014 and I have requested a further update on progress from the HSE and HIQA.</p></reply>

The level of health services to be delivered within the available funding has been set out in the HSE National Service Plan, which I approved in January.  </p><p>  The reduction in size of the public service has been an essential component of the approach to addressing the State&rsquo;s fiscal difficulties.  This has been combined with a firm focus on improving public service efficiency and effectiveness.   The Haddington Road Agreement provides for some five million additional working hours annually.  </p><p>  These measures will enable the health service to continue to reduce overall numbers, while maintaining services and service levels to the greatest possible extent.  The HSE can make staff appointments once it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.</p><p>  The particular issue raised by the Deputies is a service matter for the Health Service Executive.  My Department has not issued any directive to the Stewards Hospital Management Team in relation to the filling of the post in question.

These guidelines are a National Maternity Early Warning Score Guideline, a National Paediatric Early Warning Score Guideline, a National Sepsis Management Guideline and a National Clinical Handover Guideline.  I expect these guidelines to not only detail best practice but also to make recommendations for staff education and training.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for each local authority.    </p><p>  The Irish Government supported the original decision by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) to approve the allocation of EU funding to the Narrow Water bridge project and committed an up-front funding contribution of &euro;3.9 million in January this year. The funding which was to be provided by my Department for the Narrow Water Bridge Project represented a significant commitment given the current financial circumstances. This funding contribution was due to be matched with a contribution from the Northern Ireland Executive in line with the agreed funding ratios for the Programme.  The Government was disappointed that the tender process resulted in a doubling of the initial estimated cost budgeted for by the project partners for the construction of the bridge. The Government has indicated on many occasions that it would be willing to help to address the shortfall in funding for the Narrow Water Bridge, but this depended entirely on matching contributions from the other parties, including the Northern Ireland Executive. Also, we could not agree to be solely responsible for any further overruns.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, as part of the recovery programme that this Government has had to pursue to put the country back on its feet, unfortunately, there will be a further reduction in regional and local roads spending in 2014 of over &euro;60 million. Ultimately it is from this budget that any additional funding from this State would have had to come and we would not have been in a position to provide a further &euro;10 million towards this project as well as to underwrite any potential further overspend. The estimated figure of a requirement from my Department of &euro;10 million was based on correspondence received from SEUPB and Louth County Council. Given the significant difference between the initial estimates and the returned tender prices, the Deputy will  appreciate the need to take a conservative approach to the funding requests.</p><p>  The progression and importance of this project has been discussed with my government colleagues and on a number of occasions at the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) most recently on the 8th of November. The priority is to avoid the loss of the EU funding involved. As the Deputy will be aware, members of the party that he leads are members of the  Northern Ireland Executive and of the NSMC and agreed this position as articulated in the Plenary Joint Communiqu&eacute; that issued following that meeting in particular: &quot;Ministers remain supportive of the concept of the Narrow Water Bridge and have asked for an urgent analysis of the issues involved.  They remain conscious that the priority is not to lose the EU funding involved.&quot; </p><p>  It is important to note that there are time constraints with regard to the INTERREG funding. It has to be spent by 2015. SEUPB has since withdrawn the letter of offer and has indicated that it proposes to re-allocate the funding to eligible projects capable of being delivered before the end of 2015. I know that officials in my Department and the Department for Regional Development have identified possible replacement projects, that will benefit cross-border communication and economic co-operation in the transport sector and will be working up proposals for consideration by SEUPB.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-11a.632.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/948" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121100102#WRHH00900"><p>There are currently two EU Directives under my Department's remit where the transposition deadline has passed but the Directives are not yet transposed into Irish Law.  The first is Directive 2011/76/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2011, amending Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures.  The Directive has a transposition date of 16 October 2013.  The means of transposing the Directive is being reviewed at present with a view to transposition in 2014.</p><p>  The second is Directive 2011/82/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011, facilitating the cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences.  This Directive has a transposition date of 7 Nov. 2013.  However, Directive 2011/82/EU was adopted pursuant to Article 87(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).   As Article 87 is within Title V of the TFEU (Freedom, Security and Justice), then Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol 21 TFEU apply.  This means that the Directive is not binding upon Ireland or the UK.  The Directive is also subject to a challenge in the European Court of Justice.  Ireland is awaiting the outcome of the Court's judgement on the correct legal basis for Directive 2011/82/EU before considering if we should opt in.  </p></reply>
