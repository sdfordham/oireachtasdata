    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-23a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092300053#WRA01000"><p>I am acutely aware of the pressure being felt by farmers throughout the country as a result of the decline in beef prices over the last 12 months or more.  Not only am I aware of it, but I have made addressing the concerns of these farmers a priority for the Government.      </p><p>  The Deputy is correct in noting that beef prices will always be subject to a degree of volatility.  This is the same for most agricultural commodities such as milk prices or cereals reflecting the globalised world in which Irish agri-food produce is traded.  As a country that exports most of what we produce, we are perhaps even more susceptible to the highs and lows of evolving prices than some of our neighbours.       </p><p>  This volatility has possibly never been more evident as it has been over the last three years.  Prices in 2012 and 2013 rose steadily to an unprecedented peak of over &euro;4.40 per kilo last year but have since declined.  In looking at these changes, we cannot ignore normal supply and demand factors.  This year we have slaughtered nearly 13% more animals than last year and the number of animals slaughtered is 23% higher than at this stage in 2012.  Added to this supply increase, there has been a drop in beef consumption throughout Europe as well as in the returns to farmers notably in the UK also.  The combination of these points will inevitably take its toll on prices here.   </p><p>  Putting structures in place to alleviate the impact of these price changes, and assisting farmers to be better prepared for these fluctuations, have been central to this Government&rsquo;s term in office.  The &euro;1.2 billion per year secured in direct payments each year forms a constant and secure income for farmers, and this is a particularly important buffer as prices decline.  In addition, the need to ensure a viable future for the beef sector has been central to the draft &euro;4 billion Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July.   </p><p>  While this plan is still under discussion with the European Commission, I am proposing in it a number of elements which will be of benefit to beef farmers throughout the country, including the beef data and genomics measure which will be worth around &euro;49 million per year and should bring about long-term improvements to the sector through improving the genetic quality of the beef herd.  Also, the continued support under the new agri-environment scheme GLAS and the &euro;195 million per year support for disadvantaged areas should all benefit farmers in the event of fluctuating prices in the future.  </p><p>  These investment supports, together with the actions falling out of the Beef Roundtable, will help to put the sector on the appropriate strategic footing for the future.  One such outcome arising from the Beef Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses.  Another key outcome has been my announcement of a public consultation regarding possible establishment of producer organisations in the beef sector.  This public consultation has now closed and my Department is currently assessing the responses before deciding on next steps.  Producer organisations can play a key role in conveying contractual negotiation powers on groups of farmers which can help to address imbalances in the supply chain.   </p><p>  While I cannot influence the price paid by factories I can of course help to put in place the structures and schemes which will drive on-farm efficiencies.  I am confident that these structures in place, funded through this year&rsquo;s &euro;40 m investment, as well as the considerable investment through the RDP, will achieve this aim.     </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-23a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092300053#WRA01300"><p>The Report produced by Indecon International Economic Consultants on completion of their <i>'Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon&rsquo;</i>was published in July 2014.  This review was commissioned by my Department in order to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and to identify opportunities to maximise the commercial income of Bord na gCon, with a view to assisting the greyhound racing industry in reaching its potential.  Under the terms of reference for the review Indecon was tasked, <i>inter alia, </i>to assess the appropriateness and effectiveness of the systems operated by Bord na gCon with regard to the regulation of the industry and greyhound welfare and to make recommendations as to any changes required.<br/><br/>The Indecon Report confirms that Bord na gCon has a range of practical measures in place to deal with animal welfare and made recommendations as to how these measures could be enhanced.<br/><br/>The Report verifies that Bord na gCon has produced the <i>&quot;Code of Practice for the care and welfare of greyhounds&rdquo;</i>, as required under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, to guide people involved in the industry as to how greyhounds should be cared for. <br/><br/>The Report also acknowledges that Bord na gCon has a Welfare and Racing Operations Support Manager and a Welfare Committee whose aim is to enhance the care and management of all greyhounds, including racing, coursing and retired greyhounds.  That Committee is charged with the responsibility of identifying problems and proposing appropriate solutions to a variety of greyhound welfare issues over the entire life span of a greyhound.  The Report also noted that Bord na gCon recently appointed a Director of Racing Compliance and Governance.  <br/><br/>The Report also makes reference to the Retired Greyhound Trust which focuses on retired and unwanted greyhounds with a view to providing homes for these greyhounds as pets. <br/><br/>Bord na gCon employs three Area Stipendiary Stewards and 13 Control Stewards, who together with the Welfare and Racing Operations Manager, have all been appointed Welfare Officers under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.<br/><br/>In addition many racetrack employees and officials have an animal welfare element included in their duties.  Bord na gCon also ensures that veterinary surgeons attend race meetings and sales meetings. <br/><br/>The Indecon Report confirms that 2,706 greyhound litters were inspected in 2013 by Control/Stipendiary Stewards who are Authorised Officers under the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.<br/><br/>Indecon recommended that Bord na gCon na gCon should devise and implement a stronger system of appropriate and proportionate sanctions which would work both as a deterrent and a sanction.  The measures suggested by Indecon include <i>exclusion and disqualification orders, significant fines and unannounced inspections of kennels.</i><br/><br/><i>My colleague, Minister Tom Hayes TD, presented the Indecon Report to Bord na gCon on 7</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i>July 2014 for their consideration and has requested that the Bord prepares an action plan to implement the recommendations in the Report, including those that refer to greyhound welfare.  I expect that plan to be submitted in the next few weeks.</i><br/><br/><i>The Deputy also makes reference to the banning of hare coursing. </i>Under the provisions of the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958 the regulation of coursing is chiefly a matter for the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) subject to the general control and direction of Bord na gCon.<br/><br/>Greyhounds involved in coursing are subject to the provisions of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011.  The ICC has confirmed that it has systems in place to underpin the welfare of animals participating in coursing and that it goes to great lengths to ensure the highest standards of hare and greyhound welfare are adhered to.  These procedures include mandatory inspections of hares and coursing venues in advance of the commencement of an event. <i></i><br/><br/>The ICC ensures that a veterinary surgeon and an ICC control steward are present at all coursing meetings.  In addition, veterinary staff from my Department and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife Service (part of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht) attend a number of coursing meetings during the season in a monitoring capacity.<br/><br/>As a further control, a Monitoring Committee on Coursing was established during the 1993/94 coursing season and comprises of officials from my Department and representatives from both the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the ICC to monitor developments in coursing and in that regard the situation is kept under constant review to ensure that coursing is run in a well controlled and responsible manner in the interests of hares and greyhounds alike.<br/><br/>The systems in place to oversee coursing are, in my view, effective, proportionate and working well.  I have no plans to ban hare coursing. </p></reply>

This represents about 2.5% of our total agri-food exports.  However, not all agricultural products are affected by the Presidential ban.  Tea extract, infant formula, casein and beverages are not subject to the trade restrictions.  Moreover, Russia had already imposed a blanket ban on exports of pig-meat from the EU earlier in the year arising from an African Swine fever outbreak in Eastern Europe.  There were also existing temporary restrictions in place on certain Irish plants producing dairy products, beef, beef offal and seafood arising from a Russian audit visit earlier this year so that the effect of the Presidential ban was incremental.  <i>As to the actions taken, imediately upon announcement of the Presidential ban, I asked Bord Bia to establish an advice line to make the most up to date information available to Irish companies exporting to Russia and to assist them in progressing market opportunities elsewhere.  I and my Department are making strenuous efforts to create other market possibilities for Irish agri-food exports.  Last month we were successful in securing the opening of the Philippines to exports of Irish beef, pig-meat and sheep-meat</i><i><font color="#FF0000"> </font></i><i>and the Vietnamese market for Irish pig</i><i>-meat.  Later this year I will be undertaking a trade mission to China.  These are key markets in South East Asia which have been identified by Irish exporters as being of major strategic importance.  China, in particular, is a crucially important growth market for Irish food and drinks with vast import potential across a number of agricultural sectors. </i><br/><br/>In addition, my Department and the Irish Embassy in Moscow have been heavily engaged with the Russian authorities on the pre-existing restrictions and are submitting the required corrective actions to have these temporary restrictions lifted as soon as possible.<br/><br/><i>At the beginning of the month I attended an extraordinary meeting of EU agriculture ministers to discuss the matter.  The Commission has already taken a number of steps to address the immediate effect of the ban.  These include the expansion of the timeframe for application of aids to private storage of butter and skimmed milk powder and the extension of the facility to cheese.  These schemes are being taken up by the industry here and my Department is currently working closely with them.  The Commission has also taken action to support the fruit and vegetables sector which, because of the perishable nature of the products, is particularly vulnerable to unexpected disruption of trade.  The Commission has come forward with an additional allocation of &euro;60 million of EU funding for CAP promotion programmes in 2015 and I have encouraged industry here to apply for part of this funding. </i><br/><br/><i>I have asked the Commission to continue to monitor the situation closely and to take prompt action, where appropriate.  I also made clear at Council that there a number of tools available to us at EU level under the new Common Market regulation which we must be ready to deploy where required and where appropriate.  Finally, I have called on the Commission to increase the advance payment, payable to farmers </i>from 16<sup>th</sup>October next under the Direct Payments Scheme from the current 50%. </p></reply>

I am committed to working with farmers and industry to both deal with the current difficulties, and ensure we have the right measures in place to aid producers achieve better margins on their farms.  The focus of this work must be on the strategic development of the sector and I have already outlined on a number of occasions the very important work being carried out at the Beef Forum.  </p><p>  In addition my Department is working, through the relevant State agencies, to improve efficiency and profitability at farm level.  Through its research and advisory services, and the &lsquo;BETTER&rsquo; Beef Farm Programme, Teagasc is working with industry to communicate these messages at primary producer level. </p><p>  I have already outlined to the House the investment the Government is making in the sector through the &euro;4 billion Rural Development Programme , the &euro;1.2 billion annual Single Farm Payment and other strategic initiatives.  The Government has also prioritised the opening of new markets for Irish beef and the development of markets where Irish beef is already well established. </p><p>  The Bord Bia Origin Green global promotion and marketing initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink, brings together over 200 companies that are working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans.  These plans set out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets and a &ldquo;Green&rdquo; sustainable image is a necessity in order to keep hold of and grow these markets.   </p><p>  I have also led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East.  There have been noteworthy successes in securing market access from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran.  This year to date we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon, Philippines and Namibia.  We are finalising technical arrangements with the US authorities which should see exports of Irish beef to the US commence shortly.  I am also optimistic of making further progress with beef market access to China in the coming months. </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for the beef sector has many strands.  I am sure the Deputy would agree that the concerted effort at market development and market access has a key role to play in that strategy and is one I intend to drive firmly over the coming months.   </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-23a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092300053#WRA02200"><p>As the Deputy is aware, the superlevy fine is set by milk quota Regulations agreed at EU level.  Given that fact, it is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to change that rate without the agreement of both the Commission and all other Member States.  At each Agriculture Council over the last year the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed.  Several Ministers, including myself, called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and remains so presently.  As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an improvement looks unlikely to be achieved.  </p><p>  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian presidency agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.   </p><p>  In preparation for quota abolition, I have announced a number of significant investments by my Department in the Irish dairy sector particularly at farm level.  These include the Dairy Expansion Scheme and the TAMS funding for the dairy sector.  Furthermore, the draft Rural Development Programme 2014 -2020 provides for significant on-farm capital investments through the TAMS II scheme and will include funding for dairy equipment.  Discussions with the Commission prior to approval will facilitate agreement of the overall RDP with the expectation for commencement of this scheme from next year.  These current and prospective investments complement the excellent work being undertaken by Teagasc and ICBF in preparing dairy fairy farmers to take advantage of the significant opportunity which quota abolition will present.   </p><p>  For the information of the House, the estimated total volume of milk supplies up to the end of August 2014, taking into account the relevant butterfat adjustment, leaves Ireland 6.44% over quota at end of that month.  This compares to 0.36% under quota this time last year and is down from 6.79% over quota at end of last month.  In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard for the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call.  I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.

These are ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of viable rural communities, maintaining the countryside and promoting sustainable farming systems, which take account of environmental enhancement measures.   </p><p>  Following a review at EU level the Less Favoured Areas Scheme was replaced as part of the overall agreement on the CAP Reform Package agreed during the Irish Presidency in June 2013. The new Scheme, to be known as Areas of Natural Constraint, is to be delineated by Member States using soil and climatic criteria as defined in the Regulation.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, the three most relevant criteria are SMD (soil saturation), shallow/stony soils and slopes.  As part of the agreement reached between the EU Institutions including the Council and European Parliament, Member States have until 2018 to designate the areas based on the agreed criteria.   </p><p>  It was accepted that pending the outcome of the Review and the implementation of the new designations that the provisions of the existing Scheme should remain in place during the interim period.  The proposals included in the 2014-2012 Rural Development Programme are that the existing level of aid continue to be paid to farmers situated in Less Favoured Areas.  It has also provisionally being decided that the ANC Scheme will have a funding of &euro;195 million per annum, which is the same as the 2013 and 2014 level of funding.  The minimum farming activity remains at 0.15 livestock units per hectare with a lower rate of 0.1 livestock units per hectare applying to marginal land including commonages.  A lower level will be fixed for marginal land where it is environmentally justified.   </p></reply>

Those EU sanctions were, of course in response to the situation in Ukraine, and were fully supported by Ireland.<br/><br/>The effects of the Russian ban will be felt by Irish processors and exporters, by the catching sector and ancillary industries.  The overall effects, taken in conjunction with the other global market circumstances, are potentially severe.  The Russian market has become, in recent years, an extremely valuable one for the Irish fishing industry, especially for pelagic species such as mackerel, horse mackerel and to a lesser extent herring.  The latter will, however, be affected in an indirect way as many of our exports are to countries that in turn are impacted by the ban and so those herring markets will in all likelihood contract.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s direct fishery exports to the Russian market for 2013 were valued at &euro;20.2 million.  The figure for fishery exports to date for 2014 stands at &euro;17 million.  It was anticipated that this sharp growth would continue with the value for 2015 reaching as high as &euro;40 million.<br/><br/>70% of our exports to Russia in 2013 were accounted for by mackerel, which is our single most important fishery.  It is expected that there will be substantial pressure in volume and on prices in EU and international markets for pelagic fish as other countries which are affected by the sanctions compete with us in trying to find alternative markets for produce that should be going to Russia.<br/><br/>At the beginning of this month I wrote to Commissioner Damanaki on this issue to articulate the detrimental impact that this ban would have on Ireland&rsquo;s fishery exports.  At an emergency meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers on the 5<sup>th</sup>of September, I <i>asked the EU Commission to set up a Taskforce to address the situation in Fisheries and to carry out an urgent review of the current rules and amount of funding available for storage aid, with a view to the establishment of an emergency fund.  I have also strongly supported calls for a temporary increase in quota flexibility rules to allow Member States hold over more fishing quota until the following year, allowing time for improvement in the market.</i><br/><br/>The initial response from the Commission has been positive on the possibility of increased quota flexibility, which is seen by our industry as a necessary mitigation tool.  To date, the Commission is continuing to examine the setting up of <b>a taskforce.  However, it has said that the establishment of an emergency fund would present legal difficulties.  I remain hopeful that these difficulties can be overcome. </b><br/><br/>I am fully aware of the potentially very severe effect of this Russian import ban on our Irish fishing industry and will continue to press for the measures that I have set out, which I believe will help to mitigate the effects of this Russian import ban.</p></reply>

An agreement between the world&rsquo;s two major trading blocs has the potential to increase growth and grow jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.       </p><p>  This view is shared among my colleagues in the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers.  Moreover, we also share a common understanding on the need to ensure a stable EU agri-food sector, that provides jobs and growth, contributes to food security, maintains viable rural communities and provides EU consumers with high-quality and safe food produced in an environmentally sustainable manner.  These principles are enshrined in the reformed Common Agricultural Policy agreed last year under the Irish Presidency. </p><p>  The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers has held regular debates on the proposed Free Trade Agreement with the United States and will continue to feed into the negotiating process as discussions continue.  For my part, I will continue to use my influence with my Member State colleagues and with the Commission and Parliament to ensure that the eventual agreement with the United States is good for Ireland and good for Europe.   </p><p>  As to specific Irish interests, in the agri-food sector we have strong offensive interests, both in terms of market access and in eliminating some of the irritants that hinder trade.  We are seeking substantial market access for our dairy products and in the prepared foods area.  We also want to see action to address the question of Grade A equivalence for dairy and the licensing system that applies to dairy imports into the US.   </p><p>  Of course we have sensitivities as well.  One of these is our beef sector.  While we see some opportunities for establishing a niche market in the US for Irish beef, we have concerns regarding the prospect of increased beef imports into the EU.  I have raised these concerns on a number of occasions with the EU Commission.  I have proposed that Ireland&rsquo;s sensitivities are reflected in the size and composition of any quota offered to the US. I have argued that the size of the quota should not exceed European market absorption capacity, which is substantially reduced according to the latest forecasts.  I have also proposed that the quota should be designed &ndash; via end use conditions &ndash; to ensure that imports are not all concentrated on high value cuts and I have argued that an in-quota tariff rate should continue to apply to imports within the quota.   </p></reply>

Tea extract, infant formula, casein and beverages are not subject to the trade restrictions. Moreover, Russia had already imposed a blanket ban on exports of pig-meat from the EU earlier in the year arising from an African Swine fever outbreak in Eastern Europe. There were also existing temporary restrictions in place on certain Irish plants producing dairy products, beef, beef offal and seafood arising from a Russian audit visit earlier this year so that the effect of the Presidential ban was incremental.  As to the actions taken, immediately upon announcement of the Presidential ban, I asked Bord Bia to establish an advice line to make the most up to date information available to Irish companies exporting to Russia and to assist them in progressing market opportunities elsewhere.

The Commission has also taken action to support the fruit and vegetables sector which, because of the perishable nature of the products, is particularly vulnerable to unexpected disruption of trade.

Capturing of badgers takes place under Section 34 of the 1976 Wildlife Act in areas where serious outbreaks of TB have been identified in cattle herds and where Department veterinarians have found following an epidemiological examination that badgers are the likely source of infections.  The mechanism used to capture the badgers is a restraint which is specifically designed with a &lsquo;stop&rsquo; so as not to tighten beyond a predetermined point and so will not cause death by strangulation. All restraints are monitored daily and any badgers are removed within a maximum of 24 hours of capture. A condition of the licence granted is that restraints are checked before noon the next day. Capturing of badgers is not permitted during the months of February and March in new capture areas.</p><p>  Research undertaken at the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) in UCD has shown that damage/injury to captured badgers is none or minimal while in the stopped restraint and lower than with other capture methodologies. My Department also monitors the animal welfare aspects of badger culling on an ongoing basis and is satisfied that the existing culling arrangements and procedures result in minimal injury to badgers.</p><p>  In tandem with the badger removal programme, my Department continues to sponsor research and trials into developing a vaccination programme to control Tuberculosis in badgers, thus improving the overall health status of that species, and break infection link to cattle. The research to date has demonstrated that oral vaccination of badgers in a captive environment with BCG vaccine generates high levels of protective immunity against bovine TB. Current research is aimed at confirming that such a protective effect holds true in the wild population.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s ultimate objective is to incorporate badger vaccination into the TB eradication programme when data is available to ensure that it can be incorporated in an optimally effective and sustainable manner. A number of field trials are ongoing with this objective in mind, but it is anticipated that it will be a number of years before a viable oral delivery method can be put in place and, therefore, targeted badger removals will continue in the medium term in the interests of ensuring that the progress achieved in recent years in combating TB in cattle is maintained.</p></reply>

This date is used because in the 1650s, two surveys were undertaken in Ireland to establish land use, land value and ownership. These surveys are the two most useful historical sources when identifying ancient woodlands.  All native woodlands in Ireland are of conservation importance due to the small national resource estimated to cover only 1 ‐ 2% of the country. Approximately 4,250 hectares of native woodland are designated as nature reserves or national parks, 6,500 hectares as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) (including nature reserves and national parks) and another 23,500 hectares have been identified as potential Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs). These may not necessarily be classified as ancient woodlands however.<br/><br/>Ancient woodlands themselves are of particular importance for a variety of reasons, not least that these represent potential links with prehistoric forests which are by their very nature irreplaceable. These forests also play a role in preserving natural topographical features such as undisturbed relic soils and unaltered watercourses, which are increasingly rare in the modern landscape. They are also of inherent cultural value and may contain a host of archaeological features.<br/><br/>Proposals for a new forestry programme covering the period 2014 &ndash; 2020 have been completed and have been released for public consultation. The programme itself has been designed to address four specific needs as follows:<br/><br/>- Increase the level of forest cover<br/><br/>- Increase supply of forest-based biomass to bridge expected supply gap by 2020 and beyond<br/><br/>- To support private forest holders in actively managing their forests and finally<br/><br/>- Enhance the environmental and social benefits of new and existing forests<br/><br/>The proposals to include forest management plans for ancient woodlands can be considered within the context of this public consultation process and within the scope of addressing the final need dealing with the environmental and social benefits that can be delivered by existing forestry. This consultation process is due to be completed on the 13<sup>th</sup>October 2014 after which the proposals will be submitted to the EU Commission for State aid approval.</p></reply>

The Government is also engaged in the strategic development of the sector including, as the deputy notes, through the Beef Forum.</p><p>  I have chaired two meetings of the Beef Forum already this year and these have involved key stakeholders in the beef sector, including representatives from IFA, ICMSA, ICSA, MII, Teagasc and Bord Bia. The discussions have focused on recent developments in the sector and a series of actions proposed that will aid the viability of beef production.</p><p>  The discussions have been fruitful so far and the following initiatives have emerged from them:</p><p>1. Mr Michael Dowling has made recommendations for the Sector around various headings such as improved transparency, communications and contracts</p><p>2. The Beef Pricewatch data available on my departments Website has been expanded and made more user friendly with the addition of a weekly meat market report.</p><p>3. I have committed to launching a Beef Pricewatch App for Smartphones and other mobile devices. This will make data on factory prices much more accessible to beef producers. My Department is currently in the final stages of developing this App and I intend to launch this very shortly.</p><p>4. My Department is currently engaged in public consultation on the possibility of legislating for POs in the Beef Sector. The Dowling report suggested that POs could bring about a new degree of professionalism in contract negotiations between producer and processor and help ensure a stability of supply.</p><p>5.  Bord Bia has expanded its marketing budget for beef by &euro;0.5m and this is aimed at targeting key markets throughout Europe for Irish Beef promotion.</p><p>  I have committed to reconvening the Beef forum discussions on a quarterly basis. I see them as a good vehicle for constructive dialogue in the Sector and a forum in which real solutions can be found to help overcome the current difficulties and set out a roadmap for a sustainable future for beef farmers.</p></reply>

A total of some 14,936 farmers declare commonage land under the Single Payment Scheme and the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme.  Commonage lands form a significant area of the lands declared annually by farmers in Ireland for the purposes of claiming the Single Farm Payment, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and other Direct Payment Schemes, with approximately 7% of the lands declared are commonage lands. However, there is a growing risk of land abandonment on commonages as under-grazing becomes more of a problem. Farming of commonages is a complex matter, with issues about the legal right to claim, in addition to regular disputes about the grazing of the commonages. </p><p>  In the case of the treatment of commonage lands under the 2014 Direct Payment Schemes, the situation remains unchanged. However, from 2015 onwards, a minimum grazing requirement, equivalent to at least one ewe per 1.5 hectares, will be required of all those applicants declaring marginal lands including commonage under the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme. A lower grazing level will be fixed for marginal lands where it is necessary on environmental grounds. These requirements must be met by each individual claimant by end December 2015 at the latest. The minimum grazing requirement must be met in order to qualify for the Basic Payment Scheme and the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme under the new CAP and does not require a grazing plan with at least 50% of farmers using the same commonage.</p><p>  With a view to having a system to meet the requirements of the Basic Payment Scheme and Areas of Natural Constraint, which will be implemented in 2015, my Department will be writing to all commonage claimants in the coming weeks setting out their individual grazing requirements for marginal lands. The claimants will have the right, if they consider that the figures provided would not meet the requirements of their commonage, to submit an assessment by a professional planner providing alternative figures.</p><p>  Above the minimum stocking level of one ewe per 1.5 hectares, the management of the grazing requirement is a matter for the individual claimants, provided that the commonage is kept in good agricultural and environmental condition and meets all the requirements for both the BPS and ANC schemes. Farmers should bear in mind that they must keep the land adequately grazed in order to ensure that the commonage retains the area eligible for payment.</p></reply>

In recognition of the importance of commonages, hill farmers will get priority access into GLAS but I think it is accepted by all that the most effective management of these hills is achieved when those who are actively farming it work together. That is why the creation of a Commonage Management Plan, that encourages the shareholders themselves to take control of the grazing of their commonage, is the model we have chosen for GLAS. In addition, in order to qualify for an agri-environment payment, the actions undertaken by farmers must be above the baseline for the Basic Payment Scheme, and it is the actions in the Commonage Management Plan which demonstrate this.  The only requirement for commonage farmers joining GLAS is for 50% of active farmers to sign up to a GLAS commonage plan or sufficient farmers to bring in at least 50% of the land. There is no imposition of minimum or maximum stocking densities, and smaller commonages of less than ten hectares in size will not be subject to any minimum participation requirement. On commonages of that size, farmers can enter GLAS in their own right.</p><p>  I do not believe that a minimum participation requirement based on this model is insurmountable and there are ways in which the application process can be structured that might assist. However, where real difficulties are being encountered the farmers concerned can make a case to the Commonage Implementation Committee for entry to the scheme. If it is clear that the farmer or farmers have made every effort to meet the requirement but have failed through no fault of their own, they will not be locked out of GLAS.</p></reply>

I understand that there is an annual open season during which deer can legally be shot under licence. Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners who may apply to the Department of Arts Heritage and the Gaeltacht for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands. Permissions are issued by D/AHG where there is evidence of such damage.  I might also mention that, arising from the contacts between my Department and the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, a non-statutory Irish Deer Management Forum to look specifically at tackling the range of issues around deer will shortly be activated. This Forum will be independently chaired and comprise staff from both Departments and from stakeholder groups. This group will be a national group and is separate from the Wicklow Deer Management Group that both Departments have also supported.</p><p>  Based on existing evidence, my Department&rsquo;s belief is that, insofar as TB is concerned, the underlying problem in areas such as Wicklow is driven primarily by badgers and not by deer. In fact, research has shown that deer as a species are not particularly effective as maintenance hosts for TB except when numbers are high. In this context, an exercise conducted in 2007-2008 focussed on TB strain-typing in cattle, deer and badgers, found a significantly higher prevalence in badgers than in either cattle or deer.</p><p>  In response to current concerns, and following meetings with farmers from Wicklow, my Department is organising a cull of 100 deer in the North Wicklow area for laboratory testing for TB &ndash; the project will also involve Strain typing of the TB for comparison with that found in cattle and badgers in the same area.</p></reply>

It requires careful and detailed advance planning and the 2016 census will cost the exchequer some &euro;50 million over the three years from 2015 to 2017.</p><p>  Given the recent budgetary environment that Ireland has experienced the Central Statistics Office conducted an extensive user consultation on the continuing need for a five-yearly census in Ireland. The response to that consultation showed overwhelming support for a five-yearly census and the enormous value that the data brings, with particular emphasis on the value of small area data that only the census can provide. The Government accordingly decided that a census will be undertaken in 2016. Census day will be 24th April 2016.</p><p>  The CSO works hard to ensure that the information collected and provided from the census remains current, relevant and of maximum use to the public. It has been common practice in advance of each census to conduct a public consultation on possible new questions and changes to existing questions, which are then considered by a specially convened Census Advisory Group in advance of testing in the field in the form of a pilot survey of some 12,000 dwellings. Unfortunately given the very tight budget circumstances in 2013 and 2014, with constraints on resources right across the public sector, it was not possible to pursue this route for census 2016. Accordingly the 2016 census will be run as a &lsquo;no-change&rsquo; census with the questions on the 2016 questionnaire remaining unchanged from those used in the 2011 census, with the exception of the question on marital status.</p><p>  The Government believes that the results from the 2016 census, in the form of some 700 statistical tables, hundreds of user-generated reports, interactive mapping and small-area profile reports, and a detailed micro-data file on travel and work patterns that is unique to Ireland, will be of great benefit to citizens, businesses and public bodies across Ireland.</p></reply>

The target is for 40% representation of each gender on each of the Boards by 2016.<br/><br/>At its meeting on 23 July 2014, the Government approved measures to strengthen the gender balance on State Boards with a view to meeting this target, including the development of implementation plans at Departmental level by end September 2014.<br/><br/><b><i>National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO)</i></b><br/><br/>NESDO is the body corporate for the National Economic and Social Council (NESC). The Board compromises <i>ex &ndash;officio,</i>the Chair and Deputy Chair of the NESC, both of whom are civil servants from my Department and are male.<br/><br/><b><i>National Economic and Social Council (NESC)</i></b><br/><br/>NESC consists of thirty four members.  I have discretion to appoint the eight members and there is currently a 50%/50% female/male representation among this group.  Overall, gender balance is twenty five male to nine female (74%/26%).  Twenty members are appointed on the basis of nominations by other groups and organisations.  Six Council members are civil servants appointed in an <i>ex-officio</i>capacity (five Secretaries General and one Assistant Secretary).<br/><br/>Approaches to future appointments will endeavour to address gender balance on the NESC by encouraging nominating bodies and organisations to give full consideration to the issue of gender balance when meeting any changes to their representation.  I will continue to take full account of gender balance when making any appointments.<br/><br/><b><i>The National Statistics Board</i></b><br/><br/>The NSB consists of eight members.  I have discretion to appoint five members  and there is currently a 60%40% female/male representation among this group.  The gender balance is three female members (including the Chairperson) to five male members (37.5%/62.5%).  Two board members are male civil servants at Assistant Secretary level with relevant functional responsibility in the Departments of the Taoiseach and Finance. The Director General of the Central Statistics Office (CSO) is an ex-officio appointment. The current Director General is male.<br/><br/>The current Board shows a significant improvement in gender balance, with overall female representation on the NSB at 37.5%, up from 12.5% on the previous Board.<br/><br/>The term of the current Board runs until end 2016. If a vacancy was to arise before the end of the Board&rsquo;s term, the appointment process will take full account of gender balance when choosing the most suitable candidate.</p></reply>

This allows the Committee to consult with citizens, experts in the area, civic society groups and other interested groups before any Bill is published, publish a report and outline to the D&aacute;il at Second Stage the Committee&rsquo;s work.<br/><br/>- An annual outline to D&aacute;il of Government Priorities by the Taoiseach &amp;amp; Tanaiste followed by a detailed debate.<br/><br/>- Developing the role of Oireachtas Committees in the Budget Process<br/><br/>- Additional time for legislative debate in the standard D&aacute;il week to help reduce the need to guillotine legislation.<br/><br/>- A 5 minute speaking slot at First Stage in the D&aacute;il Chamber for the proposer of a Private Member&rsquo;s Bill to outline briefly the purpose of the Bill.<br/><br/>- Extending the Friday sittings to every second week to allow more time for the D&aacute;il to debate Private Members Bills published by individual Deputies and to debate Reports from Oireachtas Committees in a structured format for the first time. <br/><br/>- Reforming the Topical Issue Debates to allow a Deputy defer the debate if no Minister from the relevant Department is available.<br/><br/>- Oral questions to Ministers will only be answered if the Deputy tabling the Question is in the Chamber to outline the reason for the question before the Minister&rsquo;s reply. <br/><br/>- A Post Legislative Review system requiring a Minister to report to the relevant Oireachtas Select Committee within 12 months of enactment to review the functioning of the Act. <br/><br/>In parallel with these ongoing reforms the number of D&aacute;il sitting days has been significantly increased since the change of Government by reducing the length of D&aacute;il breaks at Christmas, at Easter, after bank holidays and during the summer and the introduction of regular Friday sitting days. The increase in the number of sitting weeks and the corresponding reduction in the length of the Summer recess has reduced the length of time any Deputy has to wait for replies over the Summer.<br/><br/>The commitment in the Programme for Government to amend Standing Orders so that Written Parliamentary Questions have to be answered within a certain number of days even during the D&aacute;il recess will be considered as part of the next phase of Oireachtas Reform.</p></reply>

The next report will be published in March 2015 and will also include progress on the commitments contained in the recently published Statement of Government Priorities 2014 - 2016.<br/><br/>The table below lists all the commitments that come under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach along with their current status.<br/><br/>ments that come under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach along with their current status.<table><tr><th><b>Commitment Text</b></th><th><b>Status</b></th></tr><tr><td>We will require Departments to publish Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) before Government decisions are taken, thereby offering a further channel to obtain the views of civil society on new rules and regulations.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Abolition of the Seanad (Referendum)</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish a Constitutional Convention to consider comprehensive constitutional reform, with a brief to consider, as a whole or in sub-groups, and report within 12 months on the following: Review of our D&aacute;il electoral system,  Reducing the presidential term to 5 years and aligning it with the local and European elections, Provision for same-sex marriage, Amending the clause on women in the home and encourage greater participation of women in public life, Removing blasphemy from the Constitution, Possible reduction of the voting age, Other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by the Convention.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Reduce the number of committees and give key committees constitutional standing: the D&aacute;il needs fewer but stronger committees, resourced properly.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a role for the Ceann Comhairle in deciding whether a Minister has failed to provide reasonable information in response to a question</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The chief executive of every state funded body will be required to attend the relevant Oireachtas committee on a regular basis to answer oral parliamentary questions that can be submitted by any member, on a similar basis to the attendance of Ministers before the full D&aacute;il.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will amend D&aacute;il standing orders to ensure that replies to written questions are furnished within a specified number of days, even during D&aacute;il recess.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>To make the oral question process more effective, we propose to increase the time allocated to oral question. To provide balance, there will be a reduction in the number of oral questions being submitted to one per member.</td><td>Completed &amp;amp; Ongoing</td></tr><tr><td>A member must be present in the chamber when his or her question is reached, although they may defer to another member the right to ask a supplementary question</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate on the issue of cabinet confidentiality.</td><td>Requires further consideration</td></tr><tr><td>We propose an Investigations, Oversight and Petitions Committee of the Oireachtas. It would be a powerful committee, constructed on the lines of the Public Accounts Committee, bi-partisan in structure and chaired by a senior member of the opposition.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Committee would receive parliamentary petitions from individuals and groups in the community seeking the redress of grievances connected with the public services of the State and with the public administration generally. Its functions would be to act as a &quot;clearing house&quot;, directing complaints to those bodies most competent to act on them: the Ombudsman, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Local Government Auditor, the Oireachtas committee that has oversight of the relevant Department, and so on.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will refer to the Constitutional Convention, the issue of reducing the Voting Age to 17 and giving citizens the right to vote at Irish embassies in the presidential election.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will ask the Constitutional Convention, which is examining electoral reform, to make recommendations as to how the number of women in politics can be increased.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a new code of practice for the use of the government jet, ensuring transparent and cost effective travel.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will give committees the power to introduce legislation, while a new 10 Minute Rule will allow backbench TDs to introduce their own Bills. We will also tackle the huge over-use of guillotines to ram through non-emergency legislation</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will significantly revamp the adjournment debate format. It will be renamed the topical issue debate. There will be a minimum of 5 topical issues. These will be taken in the middle of the day and there will be provision for questions at the end. A Minister or Minister of State from the relevant Department will be present and there will be an end to the practice of one junior Minister reading out scripts on behalf of a number of Departments about a range of issues of which he or she knows nothing.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a package of changes that will bring about a 50 per cent increase in D&aacute;il sitting days. D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will in future meet four days a week. There will be a summer recess of just six weeks and significantly reduced breaks at Christmas and Easter. We will abandon the practice of providing a &ldquo;mid-term break&rdquo; &ndash; a full week off at St Patrick&rsquo;s Day and Hallowe&rsquo;en.  When the D&aacute;il is not in session the Committees shall agree by roster that a particular Committee shall meet in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We propose to break the Government monopoly on legislation and the stranglehold over the business of the D&aacute;il, by providing that the new Friday sittings will be given over exclusively to committee reports and private members business except where urgent government business must be taken.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will enhance the democratic process by involving public representatives at an earlier stage of the legislative process, particularly before Bills are published. We will amend cabinet procedure instructions so as to allow government to publish the general scheme of a Bill so that Oireachtas Committees can debate and hold hearings at an early stage.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>While recognising that there may be exceptional circumstances in which debate may need to be concluded by a given deadline, we will restrict the use of guillotine motions and other procedural devices that prevent Bills from being fully debated, so that guillotining is not a matter of routine as it has become at present, particularly at the end of a session.</td><td>Completed &amp;amp; Ongoing</td></tr><tr><td>We will also deal with the related problem of legislation being shunted through at high speed and will ensure that D&aacute;il standing orders provide a minimum of two weeks between each stage of a Bill, except in exceptional circumstances.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>In order to enhance the role of the legislative committees, we will organise a committee week every fourth sitting week. The D&aacute;il plenary will sit only for questions, including Leaders&rsquo; Questions and the order of business and the remainder of the day will be taken up in committee.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish a petition system to the D&aacute;il, similar to that operating in the European Parliament, to be managed by a specific D&aacute;il committee that will investigate and report on petitions which raise issues warranting attention.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will enhance the parliamentary relationship with the European Parliament in conjunction with Ireland&rsquo;s MEPs. These arrangements will include regular attendance by MEPs at relevant D&aacute;il committees.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The standing orders on urgent issues are used regularly to attempt to raise issues that are not urgent and such requests are almost invariably refused. We will make the D&aacute;il rules for raising urgent issues more meaningful by requiring a minimum number of signatories for such a request. In future, Standing Order 32 requests will not be read out.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Taoiseach will be obliged to brief the Oireachtas prior to attending European Council meetings and to engage with the Oireachtas in debate on EU issues of national significance and concern.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will devote a full week each year to debating major EU issues of concern to Ireland such as the Draft Annual Work Programme, Green and White Papers and proposals for EU budget co-ordination.</td><td>Completed &amp;amp; Ongoing</td></tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will be linked up with the Irish offices of the European Commission and the European Parliament in communicating Europe to the Irish people. Outreach programmes, meetings and competitions particularly in schools will be organised and TDs and Senators invited to participate.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Under the Lisbon Treaty provisions the Oireachtas is entitled to receive all documents produced by the EU Commission at the same time as the EU institutions and the Irish Government receive them. We will ensure all EU documents are forwarded to the Oireachtas through the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach. They will transmit them to the Oireachtas library and the relevant Committees. Every TD and Senator will be informed of the documents as they arrive, so that they can engage in EU matters that concern or interest them.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We propose that Oireachtas Committees will play the major role in scrutinising the EU in the coming years.  Greater emphasis will be placed on deepening the involvement in EU matters of the Oireachtas committees that shadow the work of each Government Department. We will oblige all sectoral committees to deal with EU matters that come within their remit within a defined period of time.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Committees will be supplemented by a system of subcommittees and a system of rapporteurs who have a particular interest in an area of policy or scrutiny and who volunteer to carry out an in-depth study for the relevant committee.</td><td>Completed &amp;amp; Ongoing</td></tr><tr><td>The Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) prepared for Ministers on all EU Directives and significant Regulations will be forwarded automatically to the relevant sectoral Oireachtas Committees. These Committees should advise the Minister and the Joint Committee on European Affairs as to whether the transposition should take place by Statutory Instrument or by primary legislation. Where primary legislation is recommended the full Oireachtas plenary process should be followed.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>All Ministers will be obliged to appear before their respective Committees or before the Committee on European Affairs prior to travelling to Brussels for meetings of the Council where decisions are made.</td><td>Completed &amp;amp; Ongoing</td></tr><tr><td>We will reduce the size of the Department of the Taoiseach, transforming it into the equivalent of a Cabinet Office that oversees the delivery of a new Programme for Government.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Require Departments to carry out and publish Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIAs) before Government decisions are taken.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Prioritise a programme of law reform arising out of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We are fully committed to the EU2020 strategy and its creation of employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will commission an independent audit into the transposition and implementation of EU legislation, placing priority on laws and regulations that caused concern or deemed burdensome to Irish business. We will put in place a mechanism across Government to accelerate implementation of directives, involving relevant Departments and the Attorney&rsquo;s Office.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will rationalise regulators to strengthen consumer regulation and promote the consumer interest.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will continue to support the development of Dublin as an international city region that will have positive economic benefits for the entire country.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>The Government remains committed to ensuring that the European Union prioritises the key themes which were central to Ireland&rsquo;s presidency &ndash; Jobs, Stability and Growth. Both government parties will work through their membership of the largest European political families &ndash; the EPP and PES &ndash; to ensure that growth and job creation are at the heart of EU&rsquo;s agenda.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will continue to pursue additional Seanad reforms through the Seanad Committee on Practices and Procedures (CPP).</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We remain fully committed to the full implementation of all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. We will work closely with the British Government to support the efforts of the political parties in Northern Ireland to reach agreement on the issues of parades, flags and dealing with the issues of the past.<br /><br />(Co-lead with the Department of Foreign Affairs)</td><td>In Progress</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The initiative aims to improve the employability and maintain the work readiness of those who have been unemployed for 24 months or more. Responsibility for delivery of this initiative rests with individual county and city councils. Sufficient resources are available to provide for 3,000 placements in 2014.<br/><br/>The process of identifying work opportunities for Gateway participants and consulting the all the relevant stakeholders, including relevant unions, is a matter for the county and city councils.  A variety of tasks have been identified and are being made available to Gateway participants, including a mixture of new opportunities and opportunities to work in services that have not been provided by county and city councils due to the pressure of scarce resources. The types of projects being considered are varied and include village enhancement schemes, landscaping, tourism ambassadors and working in libraries. <br/><br/>Participants are primarily selected by a random process conducted by the Department of Social Protection from those persons in receipt of a jobseekers allowance payment for 24 months or more.  Jobseekers may also access Gateway by applying to their local Council or by contacting the Department and, in this context, the Deputy should note that up to 20% of the total cohort may be selected in this manner.<br/><br/>The number of persons participating on Gateway as of 19 September 2014 is set out in the following table. Work is on-going with the Department of the Environment, Community &amp;amp; Local Government and the County and City Management Association to ensure that the target of 3,000 placements will be filled by the end of 2014.<br/><br/>Data collected in respect of 9,433 jobseekers selected to date for Gateway indicates that seven jobseekers were subject to sanctions resulting in the temporary disallowance (up to a maximum of 9 weeks) of their jobseekers&rsquo; payments for failure to engage with the initiative. A further 99 jobseekers claims have been closed following engagement between Departmental officials and jobseekers.  In some of these cases, a different DSP payment was deemed more appropriate to the individual&rsquo;s circumstances.  Overall, the Deputy should note that no jobseeker will be compelled to take up a Gateway position that would result in a decrease in the value of their family income or impose other hardships.  Review processes are ongoing in a number of other cases of jobseekers who have not taken up the offer of engagement on Gateway.<br/><br/><b>Table 1: Numbers engaged on Gateway as of 19</b><b><sup>th</sup></b><b>September, 2014</b><table><tr><th>County or City Council</th><th><div>Placements filled at 19.09.14</div></th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co Co</td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cavan Co Co</td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Clare Co Co</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork City Co</td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork Co Co</td><td><div>14</div></td></tr><tr><td>Donegal Co Co</td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Fingal Co Co </td><td><div>81</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire Rathdown Co Co</td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin City Co</td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Co</td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway Co Co</td><td><div>30</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry Co Co</td><td><div>15</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare Co Co</td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny Co Co </td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td>Laois Co Co </td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim Co Co </td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick Co Co</td><td><div>85</div></td></tr><tr><td>Longford Co Co</td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth Co Co</td><td><div>34</div></td></tr><tr><td>Meath Co Co</td><td><div>56</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan Co Co</td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo Co Co </td><td><div>84</div></td></tr><tr><td>Offaly Co Co</td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon Co Co </td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo Co Co</td><td><div>10</div></td></tr><tr><td>South Dublin Co Co</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary Co Co</td><td><div>35</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City Co</td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford Co Co</td><td><div>27</div></td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath Co Co </td><td><div>31</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford Co Co</td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow Co Co</td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>781</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The PSC is designed to replace other cards within the public sector such as the Free Travel Pass and the Social Services Card (SSC) of this Department and to make it easy for providers of public services to verify the identity of customers. </p><p>  Considerable progress has been made in the roll out of the Public Service Card. Approx. 925,000 PSCs have been produced to date. These include c.241,000 Free Travel variants. </p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a registration process which is called a SAFE registration process.  This involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature and the verification of identity data already held by the Department. Both the PSC and SAFE registration are provided for in primary legislation.</p><p>  Face-to-Face registration is taking place countrywide in 81 offices of the Department for individual applicants for a Personal Public Service (PPS) Number and people applying for or in receipt of social protection payments or benefits, including Jobseeker payments, Free Travel entitlement, Child Benefit payments, State Pensions, and One Parent Family payments. </p><p>  Selected low-risk customers have also been invited to avail of a &lsquo;postal&rsquo; registration process which involves utilisation, with consent, of information already provided to other Government agencies, for example, a photograph supplied in connection with an application for a passport. </p><p>  In addition, selected pensioners over 66 who collect their payments at a Post Office are being invited to register by post. This process includes the person providing two passport-standard photographs.</p><p>  The Department is committed to protecting the rights and privacy of individuals in accordance with the Data Protection Acts. The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner was consulted and involved in card design discussions. The card design reflects those discussions. The card has multiple protection mechanisms, all of the highest current international standards, to prevent and detect tampering with the physical card and its contents.  As well as some hidden security features, the card contains visual measures such as its overall graphical design, branding, microprinting, use of optical variable ink and a kinegram.  In addition, a PSC and a card reader will communicate with each other by cryptographic means. Only card readers specifically programmed to accept PSCs can undertake this functionality.</p><p>  The SAFE registration process and the roll-out of the PSC holds a number of benefits for the customers, the Department and for other Public Service bodies.  These include improvement in existing cards (e.g. Social Services Cards and Free Travel) through better security features, considerably reducing the potential for forgery and fraudulent use, a reduction in the rate of fraud and errors caused by incorrectly identified and authenticated people, and improvement in the efficiency of every service delivered by the State through the removal of the duplication caused by multiple agencies each solving the problem of identity and authentication themselves.</p><p>  The introduction of the card, in addition to providing a more efficient service for customers, is also helping to deter and prevent irregularities, including identity theft. The Department has deployed facial image matching software to help detect and deter duplicate SAFE registrations. This has led to the identification of 36 cases (individuals) of facial matches. Some prosecutions are pending as a result and it is estimated that, at a minimum, the level of fraud detected and stopped to date amounts to in excess of &euro;1 million.</p></reply>

If, however, there is a gap of two years in the claimant's insurance record, credits are not valid until at least 26 PRSI contributions have been paid.</p><p>  -  if the claimant was in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance (provided s/he has at least one paid Class A PRSI contribution) Jobseeker's Benefit or Illness Benefit immediately prior to claiming Carer's Allowance.  </p><p>  In addition under the Homemakers Scheme, which was introduced in 1994, a person who gives up work to take care of a child under age 12 or an incapacitated person over age 12 can be classified as a homemaker. Complete years spent out of the workforce looking after a child or an incapacitated person, are disregarded when working out entitlement to a State Pension (Contributory). </p><p>  This scheme was introduced to make qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties - up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age and/or an incapacitated person can be disregarded.  </p><p>  It is planned that a total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory). The proposed date for the introduction of this change is 2020, but this may be subject to change.  </p><p>  The total contributions approach (whereby the pension payment will be based on the number of contributions paid and credited) will remove the current anomaly whereby people can achieve a higher average contribution rate, and thus a higher level of pension, even where they have a lower total number of contributions paid. This move will bring more transparency to the eligibility for pension.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are currently approximately 73,800 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.<br/><br/>Rent supplement is subject to a statutory limit on the amount of rent that an applicant may incur and these limits are generally reviewed every 18 months.  The most recent review was completed in June 2013 with revised rent limits introduced on 17 June 2013.  Despite pressures on the social protection budget, the last review saw rent limits increase in line with market rents in some areas, including Dublin and Galway, with Dublin limits increasing by a weighted average of 9%.  The different rent limits established reflect the differences in the respective rental markets throughout the country.  All major urban population centres were tested to ensure that rent supplement applicants can access accommodation whilst seeking employment opportunities.<br/><br/>A new rent limit review has commenced within the Department and will be finalised to feed into the budgetary process.  This review involves a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices, websites advertising rental properties, relevant Departments and Agencies and non-government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland and the Society of St Vincent de Paul.  The review report will be published on the Department&rsquo;s website when finalised.<br/><br/>The current difficulties in the rental market and the difficulties faced by prospective tenants, including those seeking access to rent supplement, is a shortage of supply of suitable properties in areas of high demand.  I would be concerned that raising rent limits is not the solution to the problem as it is likely to add to further rental inflation and impact, not alone on rent supplement recipients, but also on many lower income workers and students.<br/><br/>Where a customer is unable to negotiate rent with their respective landlord to reduce their rent within the prescribed limits the customer may be advised to secure alternative accommodation.  Where this has been advised there is a long-standing administrative arrangement for a period of thirteen weeks to be provided to the customer as an appropriate timeframe.  As I have previously outlined, there were a number of increases in the maximum limits in the previous review in areas such as Dublin and Galway including the introduction of new increased rent limits for North Kildare, reflecting the higher rental values for these particular areas.<br/><br/>I can assure the Deputies that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  Discretionary powers are available to staff to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant.  A notice reminding staff of their statutory discretionary power to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases, for example, when dealing with applicants who are at risk of losing their tenancy, has recently been circulated.<br/><br/>Statistics are not available on the number of persons who are in emergency accommodation having previously been in receipt of rent supplement.  However, in view of the current supply difficulties, the Department has agreed a protocol with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations so that families on rent supplement who are at risk of losing their accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf.  Since the launch of this initiative in mid June 2014, 118 families have had their rent supplement claims revised by the Department.<br/><br/>Rent Supplement statistics are maintained at county level and are provided in the following tabular statement.  Statistics are not maintained on rent supplement recipients and expenditure by postal district or local authority.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Tabular Statement</b><br/><br/><b>Rent Supplement Recipients by County - December 2013</b>Statistics in relation to August 2013 are not available <b>and August 2014</b><table><tr><th>COUNTY</th><th>END <br /><br />DECEMBER 2013</th><th>END<br /><br />AUGUST 2014</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW </td><td>1,108</td><td>1,073 </td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN </td><td>455</td><td>427 </td></tr><tr><td>CLARE </td><td>1,547</td><td>1,368 </td></tr><tr><td>CORK </td><td>9,020</td><td>8,490 </td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL </td><td>2,047</td><td>1,890 </td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN </td><td>29,541</td><td>27,601 </td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY </td><td>3,983</td><td>3,649 </td></tr><tr><td>KERRY </td><td>1,888</td><td>1,769 </td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE </td><td>4,135</td><td>3,820 </td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY </td><td>1,210</td><td>1,170 </td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS </td><td>1,085</td><td>1,018 </td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM </td><td>354</td><td>331 </td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK </td><td>2,984</td><td>2,704 </td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD </td><td>507</td><td>480 </td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH </td><td>2,422</td><td>2,305 </td></tr><tr><td>MAYO </td><td>1,900</td><td>1,690 </td></tr><tr><td>MEATH </td><td>1,941</td><td>1,777 </td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN </td><td>395</td><td>371 </td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY </td><td>1,124</td><td>1,077 </td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON </td><td>802</td><td>676 </td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO </td><td>542</td><td>468 </td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY </td><td>2,094</td><td>1,994 </td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD </td><td>1,556</td><td>1,435 </td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH </td><td>1,588</td><td>1,533 </td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD </td><td>3,179</td><td>2,763 </td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW </td><td>2,381</td><td>2,201 </td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL </td><td>79,788</td><td>74,080 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The revised estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of &euro;3.3bn in 2014 in respect of the jobseekers schemes.</p><p>  Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009. Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age.</p><p>  This is a targeted measure aimed at protecting young people from welfare dependency. It aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p><p>  To guard against the development of welfare dependency I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.</p><p>  In this context it may be noted that starting in 2014, processes and programmes will be rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low to medium probability of securing employment in the absence of any support) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months of an initial one-to-one interview.</p><p>  As part of the normal budget process, all potential budget measures, including any changes to the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme are assessed in terms of the impact they would have if introduced.  The Department has also published a social impact assessment of the main welfare and tax measures in Budget 2014.  The analysis shows that the combined welfare and tax measures for 2014 result in a loss of 0.8 per cent in average household income.  There was no significant change in the at-risk-of-poverty rate, as social transfers continue to perform strongly, substantially reducing the at-risk-of-poverty rate during the economic recession.</p><p>  With regard to the concerns raised by organisations working with homeless people, the Department is engaging with them to review the approach in relation to rent supplement, particularly with regard to young persons in emergency homeless accommodation.  The Department is also engaging with Simon and Focus Ireland in relation to the development of a specific programme for homeless people on the community employment scheme.</p></reply>

At registration they are then profiled using our profiling system.</p><p>  A Personal Progression Plan (PPP) is then agreed between the young person and the case officer during a 1-2-1 interview process.</p><p>  Approximately 15,000 clients under 25 have completed personal progression plans or action plans so far this year.  This number is relatively low as the engagement process does not currently discriminate on the basis of age.  In order for earlier engagement with under 25s to take place, legislation allowing positive discrimination was passed over the course of the summer which allows the full implementation of the youth guarantee and, in particular, the process of earlier engagement with under 25s is now able to proceed.  This process will be fully operationalised in October and will lead to a significant increase in the number of personal progression plans for under 25s.</p></reply>

The value of the benefit and privilege assessed is based on the level of the parents' assessable income. <br/><br/>There are two exceptions to this rule. No assessment is made where a son or daughter and his or her spouse / civil partner / partner is living with his / her parents.  Where a person returns to the parental home having had an independent life elsewhere in Ireland or abroad for an appreciable length of time e.g. at least three years, the assessment in this case is &euro;7 per week. <br/><br/>Since 2003, the assessment of Benefit &amp;amp; Privilege from parental income was abolished for persons in excess of certain ages as follows:<table><tr><th>Age Group</th><th>Effective Date</th></tr><tr><td>JA customers aged 29 and over</td><td>30 April 2003</td></tr><tr><td>JA customers aged 27 and over</td><td>7 April 2004</td></tr><tr><td>JA customers aged 26 and over</td><td>13 April 2005</td></tr><tr><td>JA customers aged 25 and over</td><td>1 February 2006</td></tr></table>Once the person concerned reaches 25 years of age, the value of any benefit and privilege will no longer be regarded as means. There are currently no plans to alter these arrangements within the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme. The appropriate rates of welfare supports in the year ahead, including the assessment of means, will be considered by Government as part of its deliberations on the next Budget.</p></reply>

These reviews may take place at any time(s) throughout the duration of a claim and recipients of social welfare payments are statutorily obliged to co-operate with these reviews.  The Department uses information available to it from any appropriate source to enable better targeting of eligibility reviews.  However, such information is treated by the Department as unsubstantiated and is used to indicate which claims might benefit from a review.</p><p>  In 2013 following information received from the Revenue Commissioners, the Department commenced a series of reviews of customers, including carer&rsquo;s allowance recipients, who may have significant amounts of capital and investments which could affect their means.</p><p>  The review of the carer&rsquo;s allowance entitlement of the person concerned was initiated based on information later proven to be incorrect.  However, it is very important to emphasise that the payment to the person concerned was not stopped on foot of this unsubstantiated information. The Department made every effort to establish the position regarding the means of the person concerned and adequate time was allowed for the person in question to obtain and provide the information requested by the Department as part of the review.  Suspension of the carer&rsquo;s allowance payment to the person concerned occurred as a direct result of the failure of the person concerned to provide the information requested within a reasonable timeframe.</p><p>  Payment was subsequently reinstated as quickly as possible once the person in question provided the Department with the required information so that the review could be completed.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, the Department has acknowledged that upset had been caused to the person concerned.  In view of this, I am informed that a letter has issued directly to the person concerned apologising unreservedly for any upset caused to her by the Department&rsquo;s review process in this case.</p></reply>

The farm assist scheme is based on jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and recipients retain all the advantages of the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme such as retention of secondary benefits and access to activation programmes.</p><p>  Recent changes to the scheme have brought it into closer alignment with the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme&rsquo;s treatment of self-employed persons.</p><p>  Farm assist is a flexible payment and any farmer experiencing lower levels of income or cash-flow issues can ask his/her local social welfare/Intreo office to review the level of means applying to their claim.</p><p>  The assessment of means for the purpose of qualifying for farm assist is designed to reflect the actual net income from farming.  Income and expenditure figures for the preceding year are generally used as an indicator of the expected position in the following year.  However, account is taken of any exceptional circumstances so as to ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the current situation.</p><p>  Any changes to the scheme would be a matter for Government to consider in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

Based on returns filed to date, about 1.85 milliom properties are liable for LPT.  This reflects the compliance rate of 95% achieved for 2013.<br/><br/>Additional LPT statistics are available on the Commissioners' website at: Local Property Tax StatisticsI am further advised by the Commissioners that they intend to publish updated compliance statistics in due course.<br/><br/>If the Deputy is seeking statistics in respect of uninhabitable properties, I am advised by the Commissioners that these properties are not liable for LPT since they do not meet the criteria of being &quot;used or suitable for use as a dwelling&quot;.  The Commissioners have also confirmed that as LPT is a self-assessed tax, it is a matter for a property owner to determine whether their property comes within the definition of a liable property.  Where a property is regarded as uninhabitable and thereby not liable to LPT, the owner is not required to file an LPT Return in respect of that property.  Consequently, the Commissioners advise that they are not in a position to provide statistics on uninhabitable properties in the State.<br/><br/>I am further advised that a property that was not liable to LPT on 1 May 2013 on the basis that it was uninhabitable will not be liable to LPT for the years 2013 to 2016.  If such a property were to be refurbished to make it suitable for use as a dwelling by 1 November 2016 then it will be liable to LPT for 2017 and subsequent years.</p></reply>

Revenue has made great progress in tackling the problem of diesel laundering over the past three years and now media reports indicate the emergence of another form of fuel fraud, commonly referred to as petrol-stretching.  This involves the illegal addition of kerosene or some other low tax commodity to petrol to defraud the Exchequer and the motorist.</p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under S102(1A) Finance Act 1999 and carries a penalty on summary conviction of &euro;5,000 or, at the discretion of the court to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.  If convicted on indictment the fine is to a maximum of &euro;126,970 and the prison term is to a maximum of five years or both.</p><p>  I am advised by Revenue that they are investigating the recent reports concerning petrol stretching and have been in contact with the motor trade in this regard.  I am also advised that they have taken samples from a number of filling stations that it has claimed may have been the source of adulterated fuel.  These enquiries will seek to establish if there is evidence that kerosene has been added to the petrol being sold by the retailers in question and whether there is evidence to support a prosecution.</p><p>  Revenue and the oil sector have cooperated very successfully to tackle diesel laundering and I am confident that with this cooperation, and with the supply chain information available to Revenue, the problem of petrol stretching can also be tackled successfully.  In this regard it is essential that petrol distributors report on any reduction in the pattern of legitimate supplies of fuel to the retail trade which may indicate that specific retailers are shifting some of their sourcing to laundered or 'stretched' fuel.  </p><p>  Motorists themselves should take care about where they source their petrol from, and report any suspicions concerning the source of adulterated petrol that may have damaged their engines to Revenue.  Revenue will investigate such reports and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.  In that regard, Revenue has recently launched a dedicated section of its website specifically on the shadow economy and this includes an electronic reporting facility for anyone who has information about shadow economy practices such as petrol stretching.</p><p>  A key part of the mineral oil tax regulatory system to protect the Exchequer and consumers is the licensing system that ensures that dealers in mineral oil, including forecourt operators, keep proper records and only source and supply legitimate fuel. At Revenue's request, I have strengthened the legislative framework to refuse and /or revoke mineral oil licences. Revenue has been very pro-active in this sector over the last three years and from mid-2011 to the end of August 2014, 132 filling stations were closed, mainly for breaches of licensing conditions.</p><p>  I will carefully consider any new proposals by Revenue to ensure that the licensing system is robust and acts to protect consumers, the legitimate trade and Exchequer receipts.</p><p>  I would also like to advise the Deputies that the first point of contact for motorists whose vehicles have been affected should be the insurance companies they hold their policies with.  Further to that, those affected should also contact the point of purchase and seek redress through them.  If they remain unsatisfied they may have recourse to civil remedies and as such could seek legal advice.</p></reply>

Ireland considers that the work being undertaken in other fora such as the IMF and the upcoming third International Conference on Financing for Development in 2015 offers more appropriate and established means to progress dialogue on the matter.<br/><br/>Ireland has always had concern for developing countries experiencing debt problems.  In this regard, Ireland continues to support processes aimed at resolving these problems through progressing dialogue, in the most appropriate forum and using the most appropriate and effective mechanisms, to best support these countries.<br/><br/>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the detailed statement made on behalf of the European Union to the General Assembly of the United Nations in this matter, which is available at .  The statement explains the reasons EU member states could not support the resolution and represents the views of member states, both those who abstained on the vote and those such as Ireland who voted against.</p></reply>

Revenue's commitment in this regard is clearly evidenced by the fact that in each of the years specified by the Deputy there were almost 16,000 taxpayers facilitated with phased payment arrangements in preference to deploying debt collection/enforcement options.</p><p>  As I have advised the Deputy in reply to previous questions on this issue, Sheriffs are officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945 and are not accountable to Revenue for their debt collection activities.  Their activities in this regard are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended.  The execution of Revenue certificates (warrants) is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended.  When acting in execution of such tax certificates, Sheriffs are governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debts of all kinds, and not by the provisions of the Tax Acts and are answerable before the courts for any breach of the civil debt collection law.</p><p>  For this reason, data is not collated by Revenue in a manner that would facilitate the provision of a response to the Deputy's questions relating to the seizure, storage and sale of goods, including tools of the trade and computers, by Sheriffs in the years 2011, 2012 and 2013. Revenue could confirm to me however that Sheriffs only undertake seizures in a very small minority of cases and only after the defaulting taxpayer has not engaged with requests for payment. The money secured by the Sheriffs through such activities is paid over to Revenue in settlement or part settlement of the outstanding debt minus the operational fees and expenses incurred. </p><p>  As I have also previously informed the Deputy, I understand that the Sheriffs operate a Code of Practice, available from any Sheriff or on Revenue's website, which sets out how Sheriffs will engage with taxpayers in relation to their tax collection enforcement activities. For example, it includes commitments that when goods are seized, a written inventory is given to the taxpayer as soon as possible, and there is a commitment to furnish the taxpayer with an account of the proceeds of the sale of any goods seized. The Code also sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint and how it will be handled.</p><p>  In regard to Question 35873/14 relating to data protection, this issue is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to answer.  However, I am informed that Sheriffs are subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Acts and I believe that the Minister has already responded to the Deputy on this issue.</p><p>  In regard to Question 35877/14, since January 2009, there have been 125 legal cases in total (not relating to Sheriff action) initiated against Revenue, consisting of 76 general court actions and 49 judicial reviews.  Of these, Revenue reached settlement in ten cases with three cases subject to confidentiality clauses.  Cases are only settled following legal advice from the Revenue Solicitor's Division and Counsel.  Confidentiality clauses are standard practice in the settlement of cases and are subject to negotiation between both parties' legal representatives.</p><p>  Revenue has also received personal injury and property damage claims that are handled by the State Claims Agency as delegated to it under the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2000.  Statistics for these claims since January 2009 is not currently available to Revenue and will be forwarded as soon as received from the State Claims Agency.</p><p>  Because Sheriffs are not directly accountable to Revenue, the Commissioners do not have data in relation to the number of cases of legal action taken against them (the Sheriffs) in the past five years.</p><p>  Revenue does however liaise with the individual Sheriffs through a dedicated unit that ensures the timeliness and accuracy of referrals and payments between both parties and also deals with various issues that arise in individual cases.  Given the number of Questions that the Deputy has raised on this issue to date, it may be that she has a particular case in mind.  That being the situation, Revenue has confirmed to me that it will investigate the circumstances of the case with the relevant Sheriff if the Deputy provides the case details.</p><p>  Finally, I am satisfied that Revenue operates a very balanced approach in the deployment of its enforcement powers including referrals to the Sheriffs.  I specifically want to commend the Commissioners for taking a proactive approach where possible in assisting viable businesses and taxpayers to meet their tax obligations through agreed arrangements in preference to debt collection/enforcement proceedings.</p></reply>

Ballet schools are regarded as providing VAT exempt education of a similar kind.</p><p>  With regard to reducing the VAT rate applicable to Irish dancing, the VAT Directive does not allow for the application of a reduced VAT rate to dance lessons in general.</p><p>  The Deputy refers to cultural activities.  Paragraph 5(2) of Schedule 1 of the VAT Consolidation Act provides for an exemption for cultural services provided by recognised cultural bodies but Irish dance lessons are not provided by a recognised cultural body.  I would point out that Schedule 1 does provide a VAT exemption for the promotion of, and admission to, live theatrical or musical performances where food or drink is not provided during the performances.  It would appear that the admission fees to most feiseanna would benefit from this VAT exemption.</p></reply>

Under the current text Member States will be required to ensure the beneficial ownership information on corporate and other legal entities, and trusts is held in a specified location so that it can be accessed in a timely manner.  In fact there are already provisions in place which allow for enforcement authorities and other shareholders to identify beneficial owners of companies when required.

It was a necessary measure to widen the tax base, remove poverty traps and raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit.  It is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced.  It is applied at a low rate on a wide base, and the revenues collected play a vital part in meeting the many expenditure demands placed on the Exchequer.</p><p>  As a result of a review of the USC conducted by my Department in 2011, the Government decided in Budget 2012 to increase the entry point to the Universal Social Charge from &euro;4,004 to &euro;10,036 per annum.

Earnings above this amount are subject to income tax at 41%.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware however, employees in the PAYE system benefit from a PAYE income tax credit worth &euro;1,650 per annum, to which the self-assessed are not entitled. The PAYE allowance, as it was then, was introduced in 1980 to improve the tax progression of PAYE taxpayers and to take account of the fact that the self-employed generally then had the advantage of paying tax on a preceding year basis.  The argument was also made at the time that the general scheme of allowances for expenses discriminated against employees and in favour of other taxpayers.</p><p>  There have been some changes since 1980.  For example, the self-employed now pay tax on a current year basis.  In addition, the PAYE allowance has become a tax credit.  However, significant timing benefits remain, depending on the accounting period used by the taxpayer.  In addition, the expenses regime for self-assessed taxpayers remains somewhat more liberal than that afforded to employees and therefore the self-employed can actually pay less tax when compared to a PAYE worker on the same income.</p><p>  With Budget 2015 only three weeks away, I am not prepared to be drawn into speculation on budgetary matters at this time.

The Budget 2014 consistent profile forecast interest expenditure to end August 2014 of &euro;5,220 million.  This reduction of &euro;390 million on profile is primarily due to the December 2013 bond-buy back which resulted in lower interest expenditure in the early part of 2014, lower than expected costs from bond issuance so far this year and a favourable rate reset on the floating rate bonds post-Budget last December.     </p><p>  However, as general government debt expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product is the standard metric internationally for assessing debt levels, this is the more appropriate metric to look at.  General government debt is made up of National Debt and debt from all bodies classified within Government.  Interest repayments to service the National Debt are sourced from the Central Fund and are shown on the Exchequer Statement under non-voted current expenditure.  The service of debt from bodies classified within Government may be paid from own-resource income or from funding allocated to those bodies.</p><p>  Budget 2014 forecast general government interest expenditure of &euro;8,755 million in 2015 on an ESA 95 basis. This was revised down to &euro;8,452 million in the April 2014 Stability Programme Update (SPU) primarily due to the changing interest rate environment. Budget 2015 will contain a further update to the estimate for interest expenditure in 2015 which will be on an ESA 2010 basis.</p><p>  With regard to the portion of interest that relates to the deficit, the NTMA borrow not just to fund the expected deficit but also for repayments of other debt and as part of the overall debt management strategy.  </p><p>  Budget 2015 will also contain an updated figure for the projected underlying general government deficit in 2015.

A number of factors could affect the outcome, including the continuation of the strong level of voluntary compliance that was achieved in 2013, the impact of Revenue's national compliance programme to follow up with those liable persons who have failed to meet their LPT obligations for 2013 and 2014, and the compliance programme for the collection of arrears of household charge/LPT. <br/><br/>I am advised that these factors will also, most likely, affect the outcome for 2015.

Following last month's rate reset in respect of the December 2014 interest payment, total cash interest payable in 2014 is presently expected to be just over &euro;750 million.  The increase in interest payable in 2014 compared to 2013 largely reflects the fact that a full year's interest is payable this year.  Interest payable on the floating rate bonds is currently projected to increase in the coming years, consistent with the projected increase in the six-month Euribor interest rate as the interest margins on the floating rate bonds are fixed.  The interest margin averages 2.63% across the eight issues.   </p></reply>

Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.<br/><br/><b>Group B: &euro;30,150- </b>applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.<br/><br/><b>Group C: &euro;15,075-</b>applies in all other cases.<br/><br/>Any prior gifts or inheritances received by a beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same Group threshold are aggregated for the purposes of determining whether any tax is payable on the current benefit.<br/><br/>CAT is charged on the amount of the gift or inheritance that exceeds the beneficiary's tax-free threshold.<br/><br/>For example, as set out above, each child can separately receive gifts or inheritances from their parents up to the value of &euro;225,000 without incurring any liability to CAT.<br/><br/>As each child in a family is entitled to their own separate tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 parents can make substantial gifts or bequests to each of their children tax-free.  <br/><br/>The rate of CAT on the excess over the child's tax-free threshold of &euro;225,000 is 33%.<br/><br/>Apart from the tax-free thresholds, a number of exemptions and reliefs from CAT are provided in CAT legislation.<br/><br/>A complete exemption from CAT is available in relation to gifts and inheritances transferring between spouses.<br/><br/>A gift or inheritance of a dwelling house that is the only or main residence of the beneficiary is exempt from CAT, subject to certain conditions.<br/><br/>Significant relief is also given to gifts and inheritances of agricultural property and business property, again subject to certain conditions. <br/><br/>It is not clear from the details supplied by the Deputy what particular aspect of the Capital Acquisitions Tax legislation he believes constitutes a burden on families.  If the Deputy could supply full details of the particular matter that has been raised with him, I will arrange to have it considered.</p></reply>

In this regard, EU VAT law specifically provides that all digitised publications, including e-books, are treated as the supply of a service liable at the standard rate of VAT, which in Ireland is 23%.  While Ireland applies a zero VAT rate to printed books including atlases, children's picture, drawing and colouring books and books of music, by virtue of a derogation under the VAT Directive for such exceptional treatment, there is no option under EU VAT Law to either exempt e-books from VAT or to apply the zero VAT rate or a reduced VAT rate to such products.</p><p>  The different VAT treatment of printed books and e-books reflects the nature of these products, the latter being a richer product often providing content beyond simple text to include embedded digital music, software, film and internet links. </p><p>  With regard to the recent judgement of the European Court of Justice in Case C-219/13 K Oy, this relates to the VAT treatment of printed vs audio books, that is, books on all physical means of support as defined in point 6 of Annex III to the EU VAT Directive.  The Court judged that it is possible for a Member State to apply different VAT rates to printed books and books on CDs or CD-ROMs.  E-books are not supplied on a physical means of support and as such are not included in Annex III.  EU VAT law makes a distinction between electronic supplies, in this case an audio-book, and electronically supplied services, such as an e-book, and as stated earlier, all electronically supplied services must be applied at the standard VAT rate.   </p></reply>

For instance, the VAT Directive provides that Member States must apply a standard VAT rate   which in Ireland is 23%.  The Directive also allows Member States to apply up to two reduced VAT rates to goods and services as listed in Annex III of the Directive.  The application of the 9% VAT rate to tourism activity is possible because of this provision.  In addition, the VAT Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under set conditions.  Article 110 allows for the continuation of the application of a zero rate or a rate less than 5% to goods or services where that rate applied on and from 1 January 1991.  Ireland takes advantage of this provision in our application of the zero rate to most food, books, medicine and children's clothing, as well as our application of the 4.8% VAT rate on livestock.  Furthermore, Article 118 of the Directive allows Member States to retain the application of a reduced VAT rate of 12% or more on goods and services not contained in Annex III, that had applied at a reduced VAT rate on and from 1 January 1991.  The application of the 13.5% VAT rate in Ireland to domestic fuels, commercial construction and some labour intensive services is based on this provision. </p><p>  Furthermore, making changes to existing VAT rate treatment is also conditional on the terms of the EU VAT Directive, especially considering much of Ireland's VAT rating is historic and subject to specific rules.  It is possible to apply the standard VAT rate to all goods and services.  Taking any particular good or service currently applying at the 23% standard VAT rate, it is only possible to apply a reduced VAT rate of 9% or 13.5% to it if it is listed in Annex III of the VAT Directive; it is not possible to apply a zero rate to it as this only applies to goods and services applying at the zero rate since 1991.  It is not possible to apply a different reduced VAT rate to it as it is only allowable to apply two reduced VAT rates. </p><p>  It is possible to apply a reduced or standard VAT rate to the goods currently applying at the zero rate, however, the conditions of Article 110 provide that it would not be possible to revert those goods back to the zero rate as the zero rating must be continued from 1991.  Similarly, it is possible to apply a standard VAT rate to the goods and services currently applying at the 13.5% rate under Article 118, but it would not be possible thereafter to revert them to a reduced VAT rate.  In addition, as stated earlier, it is not possible to apply a rate of less than 12% to goods and services under Article 118, which means that it would not be possible to apply our 9% VAT rate to the goods currently applying at the 13.5% rate under this Article.</p><p>  Outside of the conditions laid out in the EU VAT Directive, Ireland is free to set the level at which the various VAT rates apply, and free to apply a reduced or standard VAT rate to the goods and services contained in Annex III of the Directive.  In this context, the determination of the level of the standard and reduced VAT rates is based on their economic effect and on the demands of the Exchequer, on a national level and in relation to the specific sector to which a particular good or service relates.  This is undertaken as part of the annual Budget cycle.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-23a.426.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092300063#WRL00600"><p>The graduate entry programme provides undergraduate medical education of four years duration and has been developed to produce medical graduates with the ability to successfully undertake an internship and thereafter to gain full registration with the Medical Council.  The programme is supported by a combination of student fees, State funding and other income.  <br/><br/>While in this case the fees could be considered high, in the majority of cases where third level tuition fees are payable they are at much lower levels.  In addition, those participating in the programme must already have acquired an undergraduate degree, the fees for which would have been covered by the State in the vast majority of cases. <br/><br/>I would point out that tax relief at the standard rate of 20% is available in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual for a third level education course, including a postgraduate course.<br/><br/>Qualifying fees mean tuition fees in respect of an approved course at an approved college and includes what is referred to as the &quot;student contribution&quot;.No other fees e.g. administration fees, examination fees, capitation fees, qualify for tax relief.  Tuition fees that are, or will be, met directly or indirectly by grant, scholarship, employer contribution or other means are deducted in arriving at the net qualifying fees.  A claim for relief may be made in respect of a number of students.<br/><br/>In making a claim for relief for the tax year 2014, the maximum amount of fees that can qualify for the relief is &euro;7,000 per student, but an amount set out in the legislation must be disregarded from each claim (whether in respect of one or more students).  Where a claim for relief includes fees paid on behalf of at least one full-time student, the disregard is &euro;2,750.Where a claim for relief includes fees solely paid on behalf of a part-time student or part-time students, the amount disregarded is &euro;1,375.  Thus, for example, an individual undertaking a graduate entry medical course on a full-time basis, where tuition fees of &euro;15,000 per student apply, would attract relief of &euro;850 made up as follows:<table><tr><th>FEES</th><th>AMOUNT</th></tr><tr><td>Tuition fees  </td><td>&euro;15,000</td></tr><tr><td>Capped at  </td><td>&euro;7,000</td></tr><tr><td>Less</td><td>&euro;2,750</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;4,250 @ 20% = &euro;850</td></tr></table><br/><br/>It is a longstanding practice of the Minister for Finance not to comment, in advance of the Budget, on any tax matters that might be the subject of Budget decisions.  The porposed introduction of tax relief for loans taken out to pursue the graduate entry medical programme will be considered, along with all other proposals, as part of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill and any announcements will be made on Budget Day.</p></reply>

These returns include a Form 11S, a short income tax return.  It is acknowledged by taxpayers and agents that details required on this form are not overly burdensome and a much smaller number of fields have to be completed than for the full Form 11.  <br/><br/>The main criteria used by Revenue to issue the Form 11S to taxpayers are:<br/><br/>- the taxpayer is not a mandatory electronic filer on Revenue's records and is therefore not obliged to file and pay using Revenue's On-Line Service (ROS);<br/><br/>- the previous year's gross turnover returned by the taxpayer is less than &euro;75,000;<br/><br/>- the taxpayer has only declared 1 or 2 trades in the previous year;<br/><br/>- the total of all other income in the previous year is less than &euro;50,000.<br/><br/>Any taxpayer who meets the above criteria is issued with a Form 11S, while those who do not meet the criteria will receive the longer version of the paper return Form 11 or will file electronically, via ROS, Revenue's On-Line Service.<br/><br/>There are significant advantages for a taxpayer in filing their tax return using ROS.  These include:<br/><br/>- relevant information that is available to Revenue is pre-populated on the return;<br/><br/>- the taxpayer has only to input data to the income panels and accounts details relevant to their business and can ignore other non-relevant parts of the return;<br/><br/>- any liabilities in respect of Income Tax, PRSI &amp;amp; USC are automatically calculated within the system;<br/><br/>- an extended return filing date is available.<br/><br/>I am advised by the Commissioners that 87% of all farmers who filed their Form 11 in 2012 did so through the online system, sending a very clear signal that they find the online version very user friendly.  This mirrors the experience of other taxpayers who also use the ROS system extensively to file their returns.  A further 5% of farmers were provided with a simplified return Form 11S for 2012.<br/><br/>I am further advised that the Commissioners have recently been in correspondence with farmers' representatives on the subject of simplified tax returns and they have offered to have further discussions with those representatives, if required.<br/><br/>In addition, I am informed that Revenue will have their usual strong representation at this week's National Ploughing Championship where a team of ROS Liaison Officers will be available to provide information about online filing as well as tax return filing in general.<br/><br/>It appears to me that the Revenue Commissioners have put in place options for those taxpayers, including farmers, whose tax affairs are not overly complex to make it easier for them to file their returns.  In particular, the ROS return has significant advantages for all taxpayers and this is widely acknowledged.  I would strongly encourage all taxpayers to file their tax returns through ROS.</p></reply>

Stamp Duty is charged at half the normal rate.  This relief applies to transfers of non-residential property executed on or before 31 December 2014 and does not apply to leases or transfers of shares. </p><p>  Consanguinity Relief from Stamp Duty is being phased out in context of the reduction in the rate of Stamp Duty on non-residential property (including agricultural property) from 6% to 2%.  Even after the relief is phased out, individuals purchasing property from a relative will be paying Stamp Duty at a lower rate than they would have paid when claiming consanguinity relief prior to the Stamp Duty reduction in Budget 2012 (from 1 January 2015 they will pay 2%; up to December 2011 they would have paid 3%, half of 6%)</p><p>  The amount of duty payable in the absence of this relief would be reduced from previous years given the decline in land values and the reduction of the rate of Stamp Duty applicable to non-residential property in Budget 2012.  The purpose of reducing the Stamp Duty rate was to follow a policy of having low rates and fewer exemptions or reliefs.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on matters that may or may not feature in the Budget.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the EU rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality, and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.  </p><p>  I would point out that in 2011 approximately 10% (valued at &euro;240M) of the contracts awarded above EU thresholds in the State went to non-domestic companies.  This represents less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13billion).  More up to date data on above EU threshold contracts for 2012 and 2013 will be available later this year. </p><p>  Finally, it should also be borne in mind that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad.  The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion.  The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

It facilitates the movement of staff both within and across sectors as a result of the rationalisation, reconfiguration or restructuring of public service bodies or where activities have assumed lesser priority arising from changing business needs and where such reorganisations have given rise to a surplus. A &quot;Redeployment Toolkit&quot; setting out the background and the detailed processes involved has been agreed with the staff unions and is available at . <br/><br/>The agreed arrangements for the redeployment of staff within the Health, Education, and Local Government sectors are managed directly by those sectors. <br/><br/>Redeployment for the Civil Service and Non Commercial Semi-State Bodies operates through a system of Resource Panels, operated by the Public Appointments Service, which also arranges for cross-sectoral assignments to be made, where necessary.  This is  facilitated by the recently enacted , which removes the legislative barriers to mobility and redeployment across the various sectors in the Public Service and addresses other issues that arise on changing employer.  <br/><br/>Individual Departments with regionalised structures have agreed arrangements in place for the transfer of staff. There are no centralised arrangements in place within the Civil Service to facilitate requests for transfers to other locations or Civil Service employments, except in the case of grades represented by the Civil &amp;amp; Public Services Union. Transfers for these grades (mostly Clerical and Staff Officers) are arranged in accordance with formal procedures agreed with the Staff Side at General Council under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Civil Service.<br/><br/>From time to time, transfers between other grades in the Civil Service are arranged on an informal, head-to-head, basis. Such transfers are arranged between the officers seeking to move and the relevant Personnel Units and require the agreement of both Personnel Officers.<br/><br/>The transfer of staff within the Health, Education, and Local Government sectors is a matter for the Minister with responsibility for the sector involved.  <br/><br/>There are no centralised arrangements allowing for the transfer of staff from one public service agency to another other than those arising under redeployment arrangements described above. <br/><br/>In general, the arrangements applying to promotion opportunities in the public service mean that such opportunities are normally confined to those already serving within a particular organisation and are not usually available on a cross-sectoral basis. </p></reply>

In recent years, however, it has been necessary to prioritise public spending and scale back the public capital programme in order to help bring the public finances under control.

As a result, we expect that our Budget 2015 objective of bringing the Deficit below 3% can now be achieved with a lower quantum of fiscal adjustment than the &euro;2bn previously estimated.  Of course, downside risks to the public finances remain, the level of public debt is very high, and the ongoing Exchequer borrowing requirement to fund day-to-day public expenditure is unsustainable over the longer term.</p><p>  As part of the ongoing Comprehensive Review of Expenditure due to be published on Budget day, all Government Departments have been asked to review their spending and to identify measures that will support achieving our fiscal objective.  The CRE is framed in the context of the 2015 expenditure ceilings that were published in Expenditure Report 2014.  Within this context, the recent welcome developments on the fiscal front will allow the Government some space to make decisions to address certain pressures and priorities.  Final decisions in relation to the Budget will reflect updated information on key economic indicators and receipts from taxation.</p></reply>

Of this total amount, the OPW is responsible only for the approval of programmes of works and the disbursement to local authorities of the funding of up to &euro;19.6 million for repair of damage to public coastal protection infrastructure.  The Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine are responsible for the approval of programmes of work and the disbursement of funding for repair of other damaged public infrastructure such as roads, piers, harbours and other community facilities and amenities.<br/><br/>With regard to the funding of &euro;19.6 million that is available from the OPW, the local authorities have indicated that works are in hand at many of the locations involved and that a substantial proportion of the expenditure incurred will be drawn down by them before the end of this year. <br/><br/>In relation to your question on the Government's efforts to fulfil the EU Directive on the assessment and management of flood risk, the implementation of the EU Directive is being undertaken through the national Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme. Good progress is being made on the six regional CFRAM Studies under the national Programme. The Programme is being undertaken by the OPW to meet national flood policy needs in addition to meeting the requirements of the EU Floods Directive. It involves a comprehensive flood risk assessment focused on 300 areas of potentially significant flood risk and the development of long-term, sustainable flood risk management plans.<br/><br/>The purpose of the CFRAM Programme is to:<br/><br/>- assess and map the existing and potential significant flood hazard and risk within the study areas,<br/><br/>- build the strategic information base necessary for making informed decisions in relation to managing flood risk,<br/><br/>- identify viable structural and non-structural measures and options for managing the flood risks for localised high-risk areas and within each river catchment as a whole. <br/><br/>There are three main stages in the Programme; each involving public consultation:<br/><br/>- Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment - complete<br/><br/>- Flood Hazard Mapping (2013 - 2014)<br/><br/>- Catchment Flood Risk Management Plans (2015)<br/><br/>The CFRAM Programme will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis, using Multi-Criteria Analysis.  More information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie.</p></reply>

The report entitled &ldquo;Categorisation of State Expenditure on R&amp;amp;D&rdquo; was published in November 2010 (see at ) and presents an analysis of the proportion of State funding on research and development that is allocated to basic and applied research. <br/><br/>The data presented is based on an approach which considered the classification of funding, according to research type, by the funders of research and development, i.e. Government departments and their associated funding and research performing agencies. In summary, it was found that State funding for basic research lies in the range of 37% - 49% and applied research in the range 51% - 63%. State funding for basic research within the Higher Education Institutions lies in the range 50% - 68% and for applied research in the range 32% - 50%. The majority of State funded research takes place in Ireland within the Higher Education Institutions. The OECD country mean for State funding of basic research in HEIs was found to lie in the range reported here, at 55 %.<br/><br/>Since then a number of developments are occurring within the public research policy system, including the extension of the legal remit of Science Foundation Ireland to fund applied research; the development and implementation of our National Research Prioritisation Exercise; the work by the Advisory Council for Science Technology and Innovation on the overall state funded research centre landscape; and the current work within my Department on the market focussed element of the research centre landscape.  <br/><br/>Science Foundation Ireland has been successfully supporting research teams carrying out oriented basic research in Higher Education Institutions, but this research is typically at an earlier stage than applied research which would involve companies carrying out research necessary to bring products or services to market. The extension of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s legal remit will provide better support to enable ideas generated by Irish research groups to be further developed and commercialised.<br/><br/>The recognition that a country of Ireland&rsquo;s size can only excel in a limited number of fields of research was also recognised and the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group, formally adopted by Government in 2012, aims to accelerate the delivery of economic outcomes from Government investment in public research organisations by aligning future public investment by research funders to 14 opportunity areas.  <br/><br/>The report from the Advisory Council on Science, Technology and Innovation (see ) identified an absence of research centres at the applied end of the research spectrum, and recommended that a Research Technology Organisation (RTO) type model should be introduced in Ireland and outlined the rationale and options for its establishment.  (The European Association of RTOs defines RTOs broadly as organisations &ldquo;which as their predominant activity provide R&amp;amp;D, technology and innovation services to enterprises, Governments and other clients&rdquo;). This approach was endorsed by the OECD in their 2013 Economic Review of Ireland.<br/><br/>Building on this, my Department is currently undertaking a study aimed at strengthening the market-focussed element of the research centre landscape as committed in the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.  <br/><br/>The first phase of this study is establishing the extent to which the expansion of SFI&rsquo;s remit, the new Research Centre and Spokes Programmes with increased industry contribution requirements and the evolving EI/IDA Technology Centre Programme are increasing applied research activity and determining the profile of the research expenditure across the technology readiness level, TRL, scale. Based on this analysis, recommendations will be made on approaches to strengthen the market-focussed research centre landscape to ensure an appropriate research profile between basic research and applied research in Ireland. </p></reply>

The sector accounts for approximately 10% of GDP (approx. &euro;16bn) and, together with the wholesale sector, employs almost 270,000 people throughout the country in every community of Ireland.  </p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s Statement of Priorities to 2016, which was announced by the Taoiseach and the Tanaiste in July, places a particular focus on supporting jobs in the domestic economy, including the retail sector.  This commitment builds on this year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs which includes a number of measures to support retail.  These measures include the establishment of a Retail Consultation Forum to provide a platform for a structured engagement between the Retail sector and relevant Government Departments and agencies.  The purpose of the Forum is to allow key issues of relevance to the retail sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by Government, or by industry itself, to support the sector.  </p><p>  The Retail Consultation Forum was established in June and is chaired by the Minister of State for Business and Employment at my Department, Ged Nash T.D.  As a &ldquo;Super Junior&rdquo; Minister, Minister Nash attends Cabinet meetings and is therefore in a position to provide a direct link between the issues raised at the Retail Forum and Government.   </p><p>  The Forum has held two meetings to date and has discussed items for consideration in the context of Budget 2015 which might assist the recovery of the sector, as well as potential actions for inclusion in the 2015 Action Plan for Jobs.  </p><p>  Aside from the work of the Retail Forum, we will continue to implement other measures in the 2014 Action Plan for Jobs to support the retail sector, including the Trading On-Line voucher scheme and the development of an Integrated Licensing Application System for the Retail sector. </p></reply>

This report must include information on the conduct of any person who was a director of the company during the 12 months preceding its liquidation. Additionally the liquidator must proceed to apply to the High Court for the restriction of each of the directors of the insolvent company, unless relieved of that obligation by the Director of Corporate Enforcement. <br/><br/>A restriction declaration, if made, prohibits an individual from acting, either directly or indirectly, as an officer of a company or from being involved in its formation or promotion for five years, unless the company is adequately capitalised. In the case of a private company, the capital requirement is &euro;63,487 in allotted paid-up share capital.

Therefore, unless a person has been disqualified, pursuant to section 160 of the Companies Act 1990, or restricted, pursuant to section 150 of the Companies Act 1990, that person may become a director of a company, irrespective of whether another company of which he or she is a director is in liquidation. <br/><br/>If the Deputy wishes to make available information that suggests circumstances of possible wrongful behaviour relating to companies or company directors he should contact the ODCE at 16 Parnell Square, Dublin 1 or alternatively at .As the Director of Corporate Enforcement is a statutory independent officer it is not possible for me to intervene in any action or decision taken by the Director in relation to his statutory functions.</p></reply>

The primary compensation measure available under the TB Eradication scheme is the On Farm Market Valuation scheme. In 2013, my Department paid &euro;10.5m to 3,376 herd owners under this Scheme. In addition, herd owners may also qualify for additional payments under the Income Supplement, Hardship or Depopulation Grant schemes subject to compliance with the criteria applying in each scheme. Grants of &euro;1.5m were paid to 934 herd owners under this scheme in 2013. My Department also paid &euro;0.2m Depopulation Grants to 24 herd owners and &euro;0.475m Hardship Grants to 1100 herd owners in 2013.</p><p>  The Bovine Viral Diarrhoea (BVD) Eradication Programme currently embodies re-focused support arrangements for farmers faced with the removal of persistently infected (PI) calves from their herds. These measures provide for a &euro;120 payment in respect of disposals of PI calves in suckler herds and payment of &euro;75 towards the disposal of second and subsequent PI female calves born in dairy herds that are disposed of in a timely manner. Both measures are in respect of 2014 born calves and apply for one year only. </p><p>  In the context of Johne&rsquo;s Disease, my Department also provided significant additional funding towards the Animal Health Ireland&rsquo;s Johne&rsquo;s Disease Pilot Control Programme. One of the most important components of the programme is a veterinary on-farm risk assessment, the objective of which is to provide a framework for the herd owner and his/her nominated veterinary practitioner to identify any farm practices that might constitute a risk of introduction or spread of Johne&rsquo;s Disease within the farm. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the arrangements outlined above provide for appropriate compensation in the case of the various diseases and, given the current challenging budgetary situation, I do not foresee the availability of increased financial resources for the schemes. </p></reply>

It is currently the subject of discussion with the European Commission whose agreement is required to before the scheme and the RDP can come into force.  The proposed Beef Data and Genomics Programme is intended to deliver an accelerated improvement in the quality and environmental sustainability of the beef herd through the application of genomics technology. This will help farmers to maximise productivity in a sustainable way, while supporting improved quality and traceability in the national suckler herd, as set out under the Food Harvest 2020 strategy.</p><p>  The programme will provide support to farmers to take samples for genotyping from selected animals in their herds and to provide vital breeding data to support the development of a national cattle breeding databank. The data will provide farmers with the tools to select higher quality and more efficient breeding replacements through the use of cutting edge genomic technology. The data will allow the farmer to target animals based on ease of calving, high weight gain thereafter, and animals that can be finished earlier. The scheme will have a substantial environmental dividend while improving productivity, reducing input costs and improving margins for farmers.</p><p>  In addition, data gained from the implementation of genomic selection in Irish dairy cattle since 2009 shows that genomic selection could increase genetic gain by up to 50%; this is dependent on good accuracy of selection for which the main requirement is individual animal performance data on a very large number of animals of known parentage.</p><p>  Payments will, subject to the approval of the programme by the EU Commission, be paid to farmers for work carried out, including the development of a herd breeding plan, training and transaction costs. Among the activities being considered for the programme are the:</p><p>- recording of animal events;</p><p>- recording of a range of performance criteria;</p><p>- taking and sending for laboratory testing tissue (DNA) samples from selected animals; and</p><p>- selection of high quality replacement bulls and heifers over the period of their BDGP contract;</p><p>- Completion of an on-farm Carbon Navigator.</p><p>A budget of &euro;295 million has been allocated in the draft proposal sent to the Commission. Officials in my Department are currently in discussions with the EU Commission on the final details of the programme.</p></reply>

However, I am confident that the scheme will be open to applications in 2015 and I am making provision for up to 30,000 applicants in the first year. Payments for 2015 will be in respect of a part-year only, as is normal with the commencement of a new scheme like this, but contracts will then run for their full five year term from 2016.

Measure Number 6: The<b>Native Woodland Conservation Scheme (NWS Conservation) </b>supports the protection and enhancement of existing native woodlands, primarily to protect and enhance native woodland ecosystems. Specific forest types targeted by this scheme include;<br/><br/>- Woodlands designated as a cSAC, NHA, pNHA or SPA;<br/><br/>- Old Woodland Sites, whereby original 6 inch Ordnance Survey maps show continuous woodland/forest cover since the 1830s;<br/><br/>2. Measure 10: The Forest Genetic Reproductive Material Scheme calls for new suitable seed stand to be identified and registered in the National Catalogue of Seed Stands. These seeds stands may then be eligible for support under this scheme where aid will be provided to improve the management and protection of these important sites. Existing registered seed stand from which seed is not currently being collected will also be eligible for this support. The objective of this scheme will be to increase production of quality seed leading to better adapted, more resilient and productive forests.<br/><br/>3. Measure Number 11: Forest Management Plans. Support under this measure is primarily aimed at forests planted under the afforestation scheme. However, as part of the public consultation process consideration could be given to the suitability of this measure to include ancient woodlands.<br/><br/>The programme itself is now undergoing a second round of public consultation at which point careful consideration will be given to submissions made.</p></reply>

Ancient woodlands, with their exceptional biodiversity, including remnant populations of specialist fauna and flora, contribute very significant supporting services;<br/><br/><b>- </b><b><i>Regulating services</i></b><b>: </b>Forests regulate water quality and the volume of water run-off. They also protect against soil erosion and stabilise riverbanks. Carbon sequestration is of increasing value given the need to mitigate emissions in climate change strategies;<br/><br/><b>- </b><b><i>Provisioning services</i></b><b>: </b>The provisioning services of native woodlands provide us with ecosystem goods: not only timber, wood products and wood fuel, but also wild foods such as berries, mushrooms and venison. These are valued and utilised in many other European states and have considerable potential in Ireland too. An additional provisioning service, much utilised in Ireland, is the forage and shelter forests accord to farm animals, realising a significant benefit in reduced agricultural input costs;<br/><br/><b>- </b><b><i>Cultural services</i></b><b>: </b>Woodlands make an important contribution to landscape quality. Their presence is valued for amenity use, providing physical and mental well-being, aesthetic and spiritual pleasure, and opportunities for the appreciation of birds and other wildlife. Ancient woodlands, in particular, also provide historical landscape value as they often contain archaeological features and evidence of past agriculture and settlement.<br/><br/>Possibilities for supporting ancient woodlands also exist in both the Forest Genetic Reproductive Material Scheme and the measure providing support for Forest Management Plans.

The advice received is that to constitute a State Aid, the aid paid out has to disrupt the market. The money received by Coillte in this instance, is not considered to constitute a State Aid, due to the fact that private firms in the same market were at all times entitled to seek and receive forestry premiums. There was no question of other third parties, being prevented from seeking and receiving aid, which would be a distortion of the market. It should also be noted that the ongoing loss of the forestry premium income, formerly received by Coillte, places it in a less advantageous position, compared to any of its competitors as far as State Aid issues go.</p></reply>

No. 77 of 2009 [European Communities (Identification of Bovines Regulations 2009].  The legislation requires that all bovines must be tagged within 20 days of birth with a specific individual tag that identifies the holding, with the birth recorded on the herd register of the keeper and details of date of birth, breed, sex and dam registered on the Department&rsquo;s Animal Identification and Movement (AIM) database within 7 days of tagging. If a bovine animal loses a tag, a replacement tag must be ordered immediately by the keeper.<br/><br/>The identification of bovines is checked at the annual TB herd test and any identification issues are addressed at this time.  Any unidentified animals found at the time of testing must be tagged with a temporary tag as supplier by this Department before testing. It is the keeper&rsquo;s responsibility to correlate the temporary brass tag assigned for testing purposes (via the completion of an ER96 form) with the tag number assigned to the animal on the AIM system. The test details, attributed to the temporary tag, can only be correlated to the permanent tag by the Department, following the completion by the testing practitioner of Section B of the ER96 form, certifying that the correlation between the temporary tag and the tag assigned to the animal on AIM is correct.  It is acceptable for a veterinary practitioner other than the testing veterinary practitioner to certify that the animals bearing both the temporary and permanent tags are correct and therefore that the details on the ER 96 form are in order. <br/><br/>This Department conducts periodic checks to ensure that the ER96 form procedures are being properly implemented. Inspections are also carried out under cross compliance for the Single Farm Payment to ensure that bovines are identified correctly and that all passports are in order.  Where unidentified animal are found temporary tags are inserted. The number of such temporary tags used is not recorded. Penalties may be applied to Single Farm Payments where non-compliance with identification requirements is found.<br/><br/>The number of animals temporarily tagged at test in the years 2011 to 2014 was as follows: <table><tr><th>2011</th><th>3577</th></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>2801</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>2316</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>1536</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As I have stated before, I do no t believe a Beef Regulator is appropriate.  As the Deputy will appreciate, questions of price are ultimately matters to be determined between the purchasers and the sellers of cattle.  It is neither appropriate nor possible for me or any other Minister for Agriculture in the EU, to intervene directly on these issues. Cattle prices are determined by supply / demand dynamics which are in turn influenced by the seasonality of production, the length of the production lifecycle and market conditions such as retail promotions, consumer confidence, competition with other meats and the overall macroeconomic situation.  However, the state, through the Competition Authority already has a well established infrastructure for dealing with allegations of anti competitive practices and I do not consider it appropriate to replicate that structure by establishing a beef regulator.  I should also point out that there is an array of information available on the prices paid in Ireland and elsewhere. My Department collates the prices paid for domestic cattle on a weekly basis and reports this data to the European Commission in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1249/2008 and Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No. 148/2014. To ensure price transparency, results for Members States are published on the DG Agriculture &amp;amp; Rural Development website. The published weekly data includes market prices for carcases and live animals as well as information on production and herd inventories. This publicly accessible information allows stakeholders to monitor the evolution of the market situation in each Member State.   </p><p>There is also a wealth of information available to farmers under the Beef Pricewatch section on my Department&rsquo;s website, including the prices for Steers, Cows, and Heifers across the classification grid, for each DAFM approved factory.  I have also committed to making this existing information even more user-friendly and my Department is currently working on developing a Beef pricewatch app which will be released shortly. </p><p>  As regards the specifications applied at factory level, these are a matter for agreement between producers and processors. What is important, from my perspective, is that these specifications sufficiently remunerate farmers for producing quality animals, provide appropriate production incentives that are reflective of market demands, and are communicated to producers in a clear and timely manner. I will, of course, continue to engage with both farmers and processors to ensure that these specifications are applied in a fair and transparent manner. As the Deputy is aware, I established a Beef Roundtable earlier this year to facilitate such discussions between the parties.  One of the key outcomes arising from this Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses.</p></reply>

Given that fact, it is not possible for me on a unilateral basis to change that rate without the agreement of both the Commission and all other Member States.  At each Agriculture Council over the last year the issue of additional measures to ensure a &lsquo;soft landing&rsquo; to milk quota abolition in 2015 was discussed.  Several Ministers, including myself, called on the Commission to take action to ease the burden of the super levy in the final year of the quota regime but such an agreement was not forthcoming at the time and remains so presently.  As there is no common position at the Council of Agriculture Ministers such an improvement looks unlikely to be achieved.  It must be clearly noted that a number of other countries are opposed to any action on this and have sought to link the issue to possible measures to regulate supply after quotas are gone.  I am obviously resolutely opposed to any talk of supply controls after quota abolition next April on the basis that these quotas have only served to shackle Irish farmers over the last 30 years.  The resultant stalemate means there is insufficient support for any change to the regulations and no agreement has been possible.  The current Italian Presidency of the EU agreed to consider the issue at their first Council meeting in July and I fully expect that the issue will remain high on the agenda for discussion at future Councils where I will continue to seek to have the matter progressed in a way that is fair to both Irish and EU dairy farmers.   </p><p>  The estimated total volume of milk supplies up to the end of August 2014, taking into account the relevant butterfat adjustment, leaves Ireland 6.44% over quota at end of that month.  This compares to 0.36% under quota this time last year and is down from 6.79% over quota at end of last month. In preparing their enterprises for the post quota era, I have at all times urged that farmers have regard for the fact that milk quotas would remain in place until April 2015, along with the associated superlevy regime, and I would take this opportunity today to reiterate this call. I would again urge farmers to use the time period between now and the removal of milk quotas to identify, with their dairy adviser, steps to manage both their milk supply and their dairy herds so that they have an efficient herd as they enter the post quota era.  In this regard, I am organising a major dairy conference on November 19 next to assess our readiness for quota abolition and to take stock of the current challenges and opportunities facing the sector.</p></reply>

Not only am I aware of it, but I have made addressing the concerns of these farmers a priority for the Government.  The deputy is correct in noting that the sector will always be subject to a degree of volatility. This is the same for milk prices, and indeed for cereals.  As a country that exports most of what we produce, we are perhaps even more susceptible to the highs and lows of evolving prices than some of our neighbours.   </p><p>  This volatility has possibly never been more evident as it has been over the last three years. Prices in 2012 and 2013 rose steadily to an unprecedented peak of over &euro;4.40 per kilo, but have since declined. In looking at these changes, we cannot ignore normal supply and demand factors.  This year we have slaughtered nearly 13% more animals than last year and the number of animals slaughtered is 23% higher than at this stage in 2012. Added to this supply increase, there has been a drop in Beef consumption throughout Europe.  The combination of these points is clearly taking its toll. </p><p>  Putting structures in place to alleviate the impact of these price changes, and assisting farmers to be better prepared for these fluctuations, have been central to this Government&rsquo;s term in office. The &euro;1.2 billion per year secured in direct payments each year forms a constant and secure income for farmers, and this is a particularly important buffer as prices decline. In addition, the need to ensure a viable future for the beef sector has been central to the draft &euro;4 billion Rural Development Plan submitted to the EU Commission in July.   </p><p>  The RDP includes a number of elements which will be of benefit to Beef farmers throughout the country, including the beef data and genomics measure which will be worth around &euro;49 million per year and should bring about long term improvements to the sector though improving the genetic quality of the beef herd. Also, the continued support under the new agri-enviroment scheme GLAS and the &euro;195 million per year support for disadvantaged areas should all benefit farmers in the event of fluctuating prices in the future. </p><p>  These investment supports, together with the actions emerging of the Beef Round table, should put the sector on the appropriate strategic footing for the future.</p></reply>

My aim is to build long-term trading relationships into the future in these sectors, particularly in new and emerging markets and since taking office I have led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East. In November I will lead a trade mission to China to progress further the advances we have already made towards gaining access to that lucrative market.   </p><p>  There is a strong demand for meat globally and my focus is to enable Irish exporters to take advantage of the opportunities that arise.  My Department engages on a daily basis with many countries, in collaboration with Bord Bia and Irish embassies&rsquo; personnel on market access issues.  These initiatives have led to a number of notable successes in securing agreement to import from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran which allow the import of Irish beef; with Singapore, South Africa, UAE, Canada and the Russian Federation-Customs Union for the import of Irish sheepmeat and with Australia and Serbia for the import of Irish pork.  To date in 2014, the Lebanon has agreed to re-open its market to Irish beef, sheepmeat and cooked meats.  A certificate has also been agreed with Hong Kong allowing for the export of Irish sheepmeat and agreement has been reached with Namibia on a certificate for the export of beef, sheepmeat and goatmeat.  In recent weeks we have also gained access to Vietnam for pigmeat and to the Philippines for beef, sheepmeat and pork.   </p><p>  In November 2013, the US lifted its ban on the importation of beef from the European Union.  This was one of my priorities the previous year when I visited the US, where I pushed the matter strongly with the US Department of Agriculture Secretary of State, Tom Vilsack and in meetings with Senators.  My Department is working with the meat industry to advance the various technical requirements to ensure commencement of the trade at the earliest possible date.   </p><p>  In December 2013, a delegation from my Department visited China for discussions with authorities there on the lifting of the beef BSE ban which prohibits imports from any EU country. While there are a number of stages to go before Ireland secures access for beef to China, I am hopeful that my visit in November will help to progress further our objective of access for Irish beef.   </p><p>  Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across EU markets.  This wide portfolio of customers has contributed significantly to higher returns for Irish beef in recent years and reflects the success of Bord Bia&rsquo;s differentiation and premiumisation strategy which focuses on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems, full traceability, quality assurance at all stages and superior eating quality.  Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, global promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative, designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink.  Over 200 companies are currently working with Bord Bia to develop, and commit to, sustainability plans setting out clear targets in emissions, energy, waste, water, biodiversity and corporate social responsibility activities.</p></reply>

Bull beef is not a traditional system in Ireland; our grass fed steer and heifer production systems suit our climate and land availability. Producing quality young bull beef that meets specification requirements for meat factories requires intensive periods of meal feeding and finishing within a short timeframe, thus adding input costs to the producer.  Feedback received by Bord Bia from customers in various Continental markets consistently indicates that they highly value prime steer beef coming from grass-based production systems. Young bull beef is seen as more of a commodity and tends to sell for a lower price. There will continue to be niches, in markets like Italy, where there is demand for a certain amount of young bull beef. However, Irish beef producers should be mindful that this is a specialised market for a restricted carcase specification and that it has become more price competitive in recent years.   </p><p>  It is likely that more farmers will revert to traditional steer beef finishing because Irish steers are a unique selling point for our beef industry that enables us to achieve premium prices for that product. In the domestic cattle market, the relationship between processors and producers is a highly interdependent one. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of both sides working together to manage the type and volume of cattle being brought to market so that the supply chain does not undermine the viability of beef production systems for either winter finishers or suckler farmers. I note that Michael Dowling, in his recent report to the Beef Roundtable, suggested a greater role for contracts in the production of young bulls; this requires further exploration on both sides. It is essential that any farmer considering a move to produce bull beef has a clear signal and understanding from his processor that a market exists for this product.   </p><p>  Current market conditions clearly highlight the need for industry operators to improve communication on market trends and signals throughout the supply chain. As the Deputy is aware, I established a Beef Roundtable earlier this year to facilitate such discussions. One such outcome arising from this Roundtable involves better and more timely communication between processors and producers aimed at transmitting early and clearer market signals which bring about more strategically planned sectoral responses. I would encourage the various stakeholders to continue their efforts in that regard. </p></reply>

Most of our exports go to high value EU markets and Irish beef is now listed with more than 75 high-end retail chains across the EU. As with our competitors, Irish beef is susceptible to changes in consumption levels across Europe , and especially in the UK as our biggest export market.  Beef consumption has dropped by over 5% in Europe   since 2010 , with an inevitable impact on the beef supply chain in Ireland. Much of this change is due to increasing price competition from other protein meats particularly poultry.   At the same time however, the Government&rsquo;s response to this shift, together with initiatives by producer and processors, has seen beef exports grow to just under &euro;2.1 billion last year, reflecting a 5% rise in output and a 4% increase in average prices. This growth is a result of concerted action by Government, Industry and producers to develop our product offering   . </p><p>  I have personally led trade missions to China, the US, Algeria and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in the Middle East to expand the range of markets for Irish beef. There have been noteworthy successes in securing market access from authorities in Japan, Singapore, Egypt and Iran. This year to date we have agreed access terms with the Lebanon, Philippines and Namibia. We are finalising technical arrangements with the US authorities which should see exports of Irish beef to the US commence shortly. I am also optimistic of making further progress with beef market access to China in the coming months. </p><p>  Bord Bia is also continuing its investment in market development and promotion, including through an additional &euro;0.5 million which I announced as part of the Beef Roundtable discussions. This &euro;0.5m allocation is in addition to the &euro;9m budget spend per year by Bord Bia on marketing of Irish beef internationally. Bord Bia&rsquo;s strategy for Irish beef is built around differentiation and premiumisation, and focussing on the key attributes of Irish beef: environmentally sustainable, grass-based production systems; full traceability; quality assurance at all stages; and superior eating quality. Among Bord Bia&rsquo;s key initiatives this year is the continued development, promotion and marketing of its Origin Green initiative. This is designed to establish Ireland as a world leader in sustainably produced food and drink   </p><p>  Finally, I should note that the outlook for consumption in the key markets for Irish beef is positive. Furthermore, the decline in beef consumption across the EU is expected to be reversed in the coming years, with medium term forecasts indicating increased consumption in the coming years. My focus is on positioning the industry here to avail of the opportunities which this brings. </p></reply>

Indigenous production of cereals is of course, an important part of primary agriculture production. In addition to generating an income for our tillage farmers, the cereals sector is a key source of grain for the milling and malting industry and feeding stuffs for the livestock sector. Annual cereals production in Ireland has fluctuated around 2 million tonnes in recent years and it is desirable to try and sustain this level of production in order to avoid over dependence on imported cereals.  The 2014 harvest is estimated in the region of 2.5 million tonnes, well above the long-term average production of 2 million tonnes. <b>Since Ireland is a deficit market for cereals, prices here are greatly affected by world prices and supplies</b>. This is very much in evidence at the moment as a buoyant European and World cereals harvest continues to exert a downward pressure on prices of native grain. Volatility in prices is likely to become a constant feature of Irish cereal prices in future and grain producers should factor such fluctuations into their planning and marketing strategies. <br/><br/>My Department operates a range of services aimed at improving the efficiency of, quality and viability of cereal production. These services include seed certification, seed testing and recommended list of varieties, research funding through the &lsquo;Stimulus&rsquo; programme and funding for the quality assurance scheme. In addition, Teagasc provides research, training and advisory services for cereal producers. The value of all these support services is reflected in the fact that Irish cereals producers have consistently achieved some of the highest yields in the world. <br/><br/>Food Harvest 2020 outlined a number of challenges facing the cereal sector in the coming years including price volatility, climatic and disease issues, high input prices, small and fragmented holdings and the cost of rented land. However, the report also pointed to positive projections for cereal prices as markets are relatively well-balanced and world cereal prices are projected to be higher than in the last decade. It is known that global grain production is struggling to meet the increasing demand for food, feed and industrial uses. In addition to a rising global population creating a bigger demand for cereals, an increasing demand for meat is disproportionately increasing grain demand even further. It is predicted that global demand for cereals will reach 3 billion tonnes by 2025 compared with 2.3 billion tonnes currently. <br/><br/>The primary growth in requirement for Irish cereals in the years ahead is likely to be for animal feed, given the targets for increased livestock output proposed in Food Harvest 2020. However, considerable potential also exists in grains for the drink industry such as malting barley and recent significant investments by the large brewing and distilling companies here in Ireland are proof of such potential. Further, it is envisaged that there will be increased demand for Irish oats milled for human food for the home and export markets and in this context, the success of the Agribusiness sector in securing, long-term contracts with US-based Foods companies to supply milled Irish oats to a premium Irish oatmeal brand in the US market, is particularly welcome. </p></reply>

Dairy exports in 2013 were valued at &euro;3 .1 bn and the dairy sector is by a number of measures the country&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry. Due to its reputation and significant global footprint, the dairy sector in Ireland retains significant future growth potential. The removal of quotas will be a key driver in this respect. Ireland strongly supported the decision to abolish milk quotas with effect from 1st April 2015 on the basis that quotas were widely regarded by both the Irish dairy sector and market analysts as a brake on the potential of the sector to respond positively to market opportunities.   The abolition of quotas will facilitate an expansion in the sector and through the Food Harvest 2020 Report the industry has set itself an ambitious target for a 50% increase in milk production by 2020. </p><p>  The projected increase in milk production under Food Harvest 2020 from 4.9bn litres in 2007/2009 to 7.4bn litres in 2020 will come from the two obvious sources, namely increased cow numbers and also increased yield production per cow. Increased milk yield per cow, in turn, will come from two main sources, namely improved breeding (EBI) and greater on-farm efficiency. It should be noted that 0.5bn of the required 2.5bn litre increase has already been achieved.   </p><p>  A comparison with New Zealand highlights the expansion potential. Dairy production in Ireland rose at a rate of 5.6% per annum in the years from 1975 to 1984, to a total of 5.2bn litres. Today, Ireland&rsquo;s dairy production, at approximately 5.4bn litres in 2013, is roughly the same as that in 1984. In that same period, production in New Zealand, with a grass-based system similar to Ireland&rsquo;s, has increased from 7.6bn litres to about 19bn litres. This illustrates the latent potential inherent to the sector and the massive opportunity that now presents itself. Based on i ndustry, farmer and stakeholder responses to date, I fully expect that this potential will be wholeheartedly embraced.   </p><p>  I am also acutely aware of the need to develop as many market outlets as possible for Irish Dairy Products. Notwithstanding this successful trade performance, I am working with industry to raise the profile of the Irish dairy sector, and the Irish agri-food sector generally, in emerging markets in the Far East, North Africa, the Gulf States and elsewhere.   China is an obvious destination for certain dairy products and in particular f or dairy based infant formula, M y Department is working very closely with the industry to build on our presence there . I have been very active in developing relationships in new and expanding markets in order to build the kind of confidence in Irish production and control systems that provide a platform for long-term trading relationships in the future. Most market analysts predict that medium term prospects for global dairy markets are good, with growth in world population and wealth expected to stimulate strong levels of demand for dairy products. My aim is to help position the Irish dairy sector to be able to take advantage of this opportunity.     </p></reply>

Employment levels have been broadly stable in most sub-segments, with the processing sector increasing at a rate of on average 100 per year, supported by in excess of &euro;7 million of grant aid since 2010, co-funded by the Exchequer and European Fisheries Fund. </p><p>Food Harvest 2020 has recognised the potential of the seafood sector to grow sales to &euro;1 billion by 2020 and to increase employment by 3,000 to 14,000. Bord Iascaigh Mhara&rsquo;s Strategy for the period 2013-2017 is targeting achievement of that &euro;1 billion in seafood sales by 2017 and the creation of 1,200 jobs by 2017. Over the two years 2012/2013 seafood sales rose by another &euro;85 million to reach &euro;845 million, a very impressive increase from the Food Harvest baseline of &euro;700 million, indicating that the sector is well on its way to achieving the Government&rsquo;s growth targets.   </p><p>  My Department is presently working on development of a new operational programme for the seafood sector for the period 2014-2020 under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. As part of that work, my Department has completed a SWOT analysis of the seafood sector, in consultation with relevant State agencies and stakeholders. That analysis has identified many opportunities for the seafood sector to grow in the years ahead, together with the challenges that must be overcome.   The new Operational Programme will seek to address those challenges and to build on the opportunities to maximise the contribution of the seafood sector to the economy and to further increase employment in coastal communities. A draft of the Programme will be published for consultation before the end of 2014 and the Programme should begin to be implemented from 2015.   </p></reply>

The outcome has a crucial bearing on the development of the Irish agri-food sector in accordance with the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. It also makes an important contribution to the achievement of the objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy, which aims to deliver smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. The changes are consistent with the smart, green, growth objectives of Food Harvest and provide farmers and the agri-food sector with stability and policy certainty to 2020.    There were three key aspects to the reforms. First a greater emphasis has been placed on sustainability through the &ldquo;greening&rdquo; of direct payments and the requirement to support agri-environment measures in rural development programmes. Second, new and enhanced support is being introduced for young farmers under both pillars on the CAP. Third, the reformed CAP continues the movement towards greater market orientation, through the phasing out of production quotas for key products, the provision of safety-net supports in the case of severe market disturbance and the introduction of flexible measures that can be mobilised promptly and effectively to deal with crises. </p><p>  Already the additional flexibility to manage crises has allowed the EU Commission to introduce additional market support measures to address the effects of the Russian import ban on EU agri-food products. The changes made to the direct payments system, including the provisions on greening, will not come into force until next year but I am convinced that the reforms will help the agri-food sector in Ireland to achieve its full potential. In short, I believe that the reforms agreed last year will underpin sustainable intensification of production in the years ahead, will support environmental stewardship and contribute to the maintenance of a vibrant rural economy. </p></reply>

I strongly believe that the new CFP will achieve that goal both here at home and throughout Europe.  The new CFP will bring real meaningful reform to how EU waters are fished in the future. The agreement is designed to ensure the long term sustainability of fishing in Ireland and throughout EU waters, utilising best scientific advice as a key determinant in setting annual fishing quotas in the future. A key element of the new CFP is the setting of fishing levels on the basis of MSY (Maximum Sustainable Yield). This should lead to healthy fish stocks, higher quotas for both Irish and EU fishermen and lead to more sustainable fishing patterns. The Commission proposals for TACs and quotas for 2015, expected to be published in late October / early November, will take account of delivering MSY for 2015 where possible and on a progressive, incremental basis at the latest by 2020 for all stocks.   </p><p>  The new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) provides the framework for the long term sustainability of fish stocks around our shores, the continued economic viability of our fishing fleet and fish processing while supporting the communities that depend on a vibrant fishing industry.

The new policy puts fishermen at the core of developing conservation measures for fisheries in which they are involved and also makes specific references to taking account of the needs of our fishermen. The new reform provides for a regional approach to decision making. Ireland works with fellow Member States involving UK, France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands on developing appropriate measures for fisheries in the North Western Waters. This group works closely with the North Western Waters Advisory Council and the Pelagic Advisory Council. A discards plan for pelagic stocks in North Western Waters is being finalised as the landing obligation applies to these stocks from 1 January 2015. Work on a plan for whitefish stocks has commenced to provide for the landing obligation which commences on 1 January 2016. This work is being carried out in consultation with the Advisory Council.   </p><p>  It is expected that over time this landing obligation will lead to a healthy fish stock thus resulting in increased fishing opportunities for the fishing industry here at home and throughout Europe.   </p></reply>

Under the Act, it is an offence not to prevent the spread of these noxious weeds. The owner, occupier, user or managers of lands on which these weeds are present are subject to the provisions of the Act, including a fine of up to &euro;1,000 on conviction.   </p><p>  My Department actively seeks to enforce the provisions of the Act by issuing notices to destroy in all instances where it becomes aware of the presence of noxious weeds. A total of 57 such notices were issued in 2012 and 2013. These notices are issued as a result of inspections carried out by Department field officers or on receipt of complaints made by the public. Follow-up action may be undertaken by my officials with the landowner to ensure the notifications are acted upon and that the particular weeds have been dealt with as stipulated in the notice to destroy. Additionally, all recipients of notices to destroy in the last two years were contacted again this year reminding them of their obligations to control noxious weeds present on their lands.   </p><p>  Additionally, under the EU single farm payment scheme, farmers are obliged to keep their lands free from noxious weeds under the cross-compliance measures of the scheme. Failure to do so may result in a reduction of their payment entitlements. </p><p>  My Department continues to engage with all local authorities and the National Roads Authority to ensure a consistent programme of treatment and disposal of noxious weeds on roadsides on an ongoing basis. In that context my officials earlier this year wrote to Managers of each County and Local Authorities together with the National Roads Authority restating their statutory obligations under the Act and reminding them of the importance of implementing measures for the treatment and safe disposal of ragwort. Additionally, I have instructed my officials to contact Iarn&oacute;d Eireann with a view to raising with them the lands identified between Galway and Oranmore.   </p></reply>

I have on-going contact with the Minister for Finance to ensure that tax policy reflects the Government&rsquo;s commitment to agriculture and, in particular, to the objectives of smart, green, growth outlined in the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. A Review of tax measures in the farming sector, a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Finance, was announced in Budget 2014. The purpose of the review is to analyse the benefits of the various tax measures to the agriculture sector and the wider economy versus the costs and to ensure tax policy aligns with the objectives set out in Food Harvest 2020. The Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech that &ldquo;the objective of the review is to identify what works and what doesn&rsquo;t, and redirect the existing level of tax expenditure towards activities of maximum benefit to this sector of the economy&rdquo;. </p><p>  The Review, which is currently ongoing, is being overseen by a working group made up of the Department of Finance, my Department and the Revenue Commissioners. The Review includes an independent cost benefit analysis, an international benchmarking exercise and a public consultation process. </p><p>There was a good response to the written submission phase of the public consultation process; 46 submissions were received. Consultative meetings with 21 key stakeholders were held last May. The submissions and meetings included proposals to amend current measures and some new proposals, all of which will be considered by the working group.   </p><p>  A number of stakeholders have proposed the introduction of a &lsquo;tax deposit&rsquo; scheme and this proposal is being considered by the working group.   </p><p>  As major existing tax measures, Agricultural Relief from Capital Acquisitions Tax and Retirement Relief from Capital Gains Tax are also being considered by the working group.   </p><p>  It is likely that the working group report will be finalised shortly and that any recommendations will be considered in the context of Budget 2015. It is expected that the Review will influence tax policy in the agriculture sector for a number of years to come.   </p></reply>

Local State Solicitors are retained by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for criminal prosecution work on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office is a constituent element of the Office of the Attorney General and is the principal provider of solicitor services to the Attorney General and to all Government Departments and Offices. It also provides solicitor services to certain other State Agencies and acts for the State before Tribunals and Commissions of Inquiry.  The Office does not act for members of the public. While not an office under my remit as Minister, it is my understanding that, under the Customer Charter of the Chief State Solicitor's Office 2011-2014, if someone has a complaint about the standard of service provided by the Office and is unable to resolve the matter with the officer concerned or his/her immediate superior, that person may refer the complaint to the Human Resources Manager, Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office at Osmond House, Little Ship Street, Dublin 8. In the event that the complaint cannot be resolved by the Human Resources Manager, then he/she will arrange for<i></i>a review of the complaint to be carried out by a member of the Office's Management Advisory Committee nominated by the Chief State Solicitor. Under the Charter, all complaints and reviews of them will be dealt with promptly, objectively and in a consistent open and fair manner. Again, while not under my remit as Minister, it is also my understanding that, if the matter giving rise to a complaint about a State Solicitor relates to a criminal prosecution, then such a complaint should be directed to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Infirmary Road, Dublin 7, e-mail address, dpp@dppireland.ie.<br/><br/>More generally, under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2011 and their attendant regulations, the Law Society of Ireland, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator are the independent statutory bodies charged with investigating or resolving complaints against solicitors, including as may be, State Solicitors. Under the statutory complaints framework the Law Society is, therefore, the main route of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors, outside of taking an action through the courts. The Society&rsquo;s Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints in relation to misconduct, inadequate services or excessive fees made directly to it by members of the public. The Society provides guidance on &ldquo;making a complaint&rdquo; on its website, www.lawsociety.ie.<br/><br/>The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of serious misconduct and such complaints are either referred to it by the Law Society or made directly to the Tribunal by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. In more serious cases, where the Tribunal considers that a solicitor should be suspended or struck off it will make such a recommendation to the President of the High Court. Further details are available on the Tribunal&rsquo;s website www.distrib.ie.<br/><br/>Members of the public who are dissatisfied with the way the Law Society has dealt with a complaint may also refer it to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (www.independentadjudicator.ie). The Office of the Independent Adjudicator was established to provide an independent point of contact to which members of the public could have recourse if dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society had dealt with a complaint. It is important to note that the Adjudicator&rsquo;s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the original complaint.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which is due to return to Report Stage in the D&aacute;il in the coming weeks, will establish a new, independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. There will be a new complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct and inadequate professional services independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council backed up by a Legal Practitioners&rsquo; Disciplinary Tribunal. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council as they do at present, but through the new and independent Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p></reply>

The Government's proposed amendments will be made available in advance for consideration. It remains the intention that the Bill be enacted by the end of this year and that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority come into operation early in 2015.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>The Bill will continue to include provision for  multi-disciplinary practices. As the Deputy will already be aware, under the Bill the possible fusion of the two legal professions is one of those matters that is to be the subject of public consultations conducted by the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority.<br/><br/>Having been a key undertaking of the structural reform programme agreed under the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding, the Legal Services Regulation Bill is, in succession to the Troika programme, now the subject of a Country Specific Recommendation under the EU Semester Process. As was the case with the Troika Programme, the relevant contacts and negotiations under the Semester Process are carried out with the European Commission at senior official level, including with  relevant Government Departments such as my own and in conjunction with our Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels.<br/><br/>The relevant Recommendation arising from these negotiations was among those endorsed by Heads of State and Government at the European Council of 26-27 June 2014, including as conveyed to the House by the Taoiseach in his speech of 2 July 2014 on the outcomes of that Council . The Recommendation urges that Ireland take action during the period 2014-2015 to, &quot;Reduce the cost of legal proceedings and services and foster competition, including by the enactment of the Legal Services Regulation Bill by the end of 2014, including its provision allowing the establishment of multi-disciplinary practices, and by seeking to remove the solicitor's lien. Monitor its impact, including on the costs of legal services. Take executive steps to ensure that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority is operational without delay and that it meets its obligations under the legislation, including in terms of publishing regulations or guidelines for multi-disciplinary practices and the resolution of complaints&quot;. The Government's commitment to the structural reforms of the Bill is also a key element of the Programme for Government, the Action Plan for Jobs<i>,</i>the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020<i></i>and the National Reform Plan, respectively.</p></reply>

These proposals are subject to co-decision between the Council and the European Parliament. While the Parliament has already adopted positions in respect of both instruments, the JHA Council has not yet reached agreement on all aspects of the Commission's proposals and expert-level discussions are ongoing under the current Italian Presidency of the Council.</p><p>  Following completion of the co-decision procedure, it will be necessary to review the contents of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 in order to ensure compliance with the revised data protection standards in the new Regulation and Directive. While many of the Regulation's provisions will be directly applicable without the need for domestic legislation, the Directive's provisions may, depending on the final content, need to be transposed into domestic law. It is likely that some amendments to the 1988 and 2003 Acts will be required.</p><p>  As regards improved coordination at EU level, I welcome the Commission's proposals which are intended to ensure greater consistency in the interpretation and application of data protection standards across the EU. The proposals envisage, in particular, increased consultation and cooperation between the Member States' data protection authorities in a strengthened European Data Protection Board. Improved harmonisation in the interpretation and application of data protection standards across the Member States will contribute to reducing administrative burdens and compliance costs for businesses and ensure a more consistent approach to the exercise of individuals' data subject rights in the Member States.</p></reply>

Following an extensive procurement exercise, the Courts Service entered into a contract with the PPPCo in October 2007.  The CCJ was handed over to the Courts Service ahead of schedule in November 2009 and was fully operational at the start of January 2010.</p><p>  Under the terms of the contract, the PPPCo is obliged to provide the facilities and the services in the Criminal Courts of Justice to a required standard and in accordance with a performance regime as set out in the contract.  Failure to meet these standards or failure to have all or part of the Criminal Courts of Justice available for use during the course of the contract period will result in financial penalties being incurred by the PPPCo.  As the Criminal Courts of Justice will be handed over to the Courts Service in an &lsquo;as built&rsquo; condition in 2035 the contract provides that the PPPCo are responsible for the ongoing maintenance, including replacement costs for the fabric, contents and equipment in the Criminal Courts of Justice.</p><p>  A single monthly unitary charge is paid to the PPPCo in respect of the above. I am informed that in 2014 the average monthly unitary charge is &euro;1.8million (including VAT).  Approximately 57% of the cost relates to the initial investment by the PPPCo in capital and construction costs and 43% relates to the provision of ongoing services. Certain additional items of expenditure are paid for on a per use basis. The most significant of these relate to jury minding which cost &euro;470,000 in 2013.</p><p>  It is worth noting that this PPP contract was dealt with in detail by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his 2008 Annual Report and was also examined by a sitting of the Public Accounts Committee of this House in July 2010.</p><p>  I should also mention that, following the construction of the Criminal Courts of Justice, the Courts Service was able to cease leaseholds on various buildings in which courtrooms had been provided, including the Distillery Building, King's Inns, the old Richmond Hospital and Bow Street.

A significant level of activity is taking place in pursuit of this commitment.<br/><br/>The Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration, an Office operating under the ambit of my Department, has a cross-Departmental mandate to develop, lead and co-ordinate migrant integration policy across other Government Departments, agencies and services. The Office is currently engaged in a review of our approach to the integration of migrants with a view to the preparation of a new updated overall integration strategy in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the integration of migrants. A Cross Departmental Group on Integration was reconstituted in March to this end with a mandate to review the activities being undertaken by Government Departments and agencies directed to promoting the integration of migrants, preparing a Draft Integration Strategy taking account of the policies and actions already being implemented, and undertaking consultation with key stakeholders. A public consultation process was subsequently launched on 28 March 2014 as part of the review. Over eighty submissions were received from stakeholders, a large number of whom have now met with the Cross-Departmental Group on Integration. The Cross Departmental Group has also held a number of thematic meetings focussing on key policy areas relevant to the integration of migrants, including education, access to public services and social inclusion, and the promotion of intercultural awareness and combatting racism. Work on the development of the updated integration strategy, which will include further thematic meetings and engagement with stakeholders, is ongoing and will continue into 2015 when the new updated strategy will be published.<br/><br/>More generally It should be noted that the activities of a number of key Departments and agencies in the field of integration are already being taken forward on the basis of specific strategies to ensure that their services respond to Ireland&rsquo;s changed demographic in an interculturally sensitive and inclusive manner. The strategies developed include: an Intercultural Health Strategy; an Intercultural Education Strategy; a Cultural and Arts Policy and Strategy; the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Diversity Strategy; and an Action Strategy for Integrated Workplaces. In addition, many local authorities too have developed action plans, often with the assistance of funding provided by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration.</p></reply>

It is intended to have these completed by October 2014.</p><p>  The Irish Prison Service aims to ensure all releases from Irish prisons and places of detention are planned releases. The policy will standardise pre-release planning across the Irish Prison Service Estate and ensure the informed and effective transition of the offender from prison to the community, in compliance with statutory, legal and sentencing provisions.</p><p>  This policy will apply to all prisons and places of detention in the Irish Prison Service estate and covers such areas as: Housing/Accommodation Needs, Financial Supports, Healthcare, Public Safety and Statutory Requirements, Families &amp;amp; Personal Relationships, Education, Training and Employment.</p><p>  It is recognised that a serious deficiency exists in the infrastructural provision for female prisoners, in the context of a transition from a traditional, secure custodial location to a facility with a lower security level, prior to release into the community. Male prisoners can transfer from a closed prison to the Training Unit, a semi-open institution with a focus on vocational training and an established programme of escalating release to education, work and training or addiction treatment in the community. Suitable male prisoners can transfer to one of two open centres in the jurisdiction, where they can enjoy a significantly lower level of supervision and security, along with more relaxed visiting arrangements. Transfer to such facilities from closed prisons is of enormous value to prisoners, in the context of normalisation, increasing personal responsibility, consolidating family supports and easing the transition from custody to community, all of which contribute towards reducing tendencies towards reoffending. </p><p>  To date, no such facilities have been available to female prisoners; however, I am informed by my officials that plans are well advanced for the construction of a day and residential campus in North Dublin to meet the needs of vulnerable women. This will offer a safe environment with day and residential programmes and services offered to single women who need respite and care. The services provided will be offered in such a way to support the women to become as independent as possible. </p><p>  Many women are sent from the courts to the D&oacute;chas Centre on short sentences of less than a year - usually for non-violent matters, including Theft, Burglary, TAIB (Threatening, Abusive, and Insulting Behaviour) and Intoxication in a Public Place. The fact they are serving short sentences gives the prison-based services little time to identify their issues and address their needs. Often the D&oacute;chas Centre is a place of respite for this category of offender. It is the experience of the Irish Prison Service that many women are imprisoned directly or indirectly because of addiction, mental health, poverty and homelessness. The overall picture is that women offenders are likely to be poor, have limited education and are either unemployed or in low skilled employment. Many experience accommodation problems, often resulting in homelessness, and problems of addiction and/or mental health often feature. Significant numbers of women offenders have experienced abuse, either in childhood or in adulthood. Many women offenders are mothers of young children and may struggle with parenting because of their personal circumstances and unmet needs. </p><p>  This new facility will play a significant role in providing a gradual, supported transition from prison to community for women prisoners. The campus will be subject to a management steering group comprising representatives of the statutory agencies involved, they are: Dublin City Council (Lead), the HSE, The Probation Service, CDTEB and Irish Prison Service. The campus will also be used as a community resource for the people of Finglas so that the campus truly reflects a community based resource. </p></reply>

The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, with penalties of up to life imprisonment for human trafficking, greatly strengthened the law in this area and this legislation was further bolstered in 2013 with new forms of exploitation, for forced begging and forced criminal activities, being provided for in new legislation. The Criminal Law (Human Trafficking)(Amendment) Act 2013 also provided, for the first time, a definition of 'forced labour' in Irish law, based on the International Labour Organisation's definition.<br/><br/>A dedicated Anti-Human Trafficking Unit was established in the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality in 2008 with the purpose of ensuring that the State's response to human trafficking is coordinated and comprehensive. In addition to that dedicated Unit in the Department of Justice &amp;amp; Equality there are 3 other dedicated Units in State Agencies dealing with the issue: <br/><br/>- the Human Trafficking Investigation and Co-ordination Unit in the Garda National Immigration Bureau ; <br/><br/>- the Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the Health Service Executive,  who develop individualised care plans for victims, and<br/><br/>- a specialised Human Trafficking legal team in the Legal Aid Board. <br/><br/>Dedicated personnel are also assigned to deal with the prosecution of cases in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and staff in the New Communities and Asylum Seekers Unit in the Department of Social Protection facilitates victims moving into mainstream social services. There are also a wide range of training and awareness raising activities on-going and extensive consultation structures exist with Non-Governmental Organisations, International Organisations and State Agencies.  <br/><br/>This year, and for the past few years, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in its Annual Policing Plan, has identified trafficking in human beings as one of its priorities with an increased focus given to prevention and detection of human trafficking. Any suspicion of human trafficking that is reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is the subject of a comprehensive investigation  <i>. </i><br/><br/>The State provides a wide range of support services to victims of human trafficking, these include: accommodation, medical care and planning, psychological assistance, material assistance, legal aid and advice, vocational training and education. The Anti-Human Trafficking Team in the HSE develops individual Care Plans for persons who are potentially victims of human trafficking.  These Care Plans include a range of issues including medical health, G.P. referral, counselling, psychological care, sexual health, material assistance, accommodation, training needs, education, etc. <br/><br/>The Government&rsquo;s approach to the issue of Human Trafficking is set out in the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Trafficking of Persons which set out 144 Actions to be undertaken to address this issue. A copy of the National Action Plan and a Review of the Plan are available on the dedicated Anti-Trafficking site blueblindfold.gov.ie. A Second National Action Plan is currently at an advanced stage of drafting and will be the subject of consultation with a broad range of organisations active in this field. This Plan will also be informed by the findings of international evaluations of Ireland&rsquo;s anti-trafficking measures.<br/><br/>Finally, in relation to the issue of the purchase of sex, I am examining the recommendations made by the Joint Committee on Justice Defence and Equality, the advices of the Attorney General and the views of the Minister for Health regarding a new approach to prostitution legislation. As the Deputy will appreciate, prostitution raises a wide spectrum of issues.  When I have had the opportunity to complete consideration of the issues, proposals will be brought to Government in the usual manner.</p></reply>

The 1993 Act provides that only the Minister for Justice and Equality may grant authorisations to intercept and then only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime or in the interests of the security of the State.  Only the Garda Commissioner and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces are entitled to make applications for authorisations to intercept.  The Garda Commissioner may make applications in relation to serious crime or in the interests of the security of the State  The Chief of Staff may make applications in relation to the security of the State only, and such a request must be accompanied by the supporting recommendation of the Minister for Defence.</p><p>  The 2011 Communications (Retention of Data) Act  provides for access to traffic data, location data and subscriber data only. The Act sets out the agencies which are entitled to request access to this data and the circumstances in which such requests can be made.  Those circumstances include the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of a serious offence, the security of the State, the saving of human life and certain revenue offences.  The content of calls, texts etc are not disclosed under this Act.  </p><p>Both statutory schemes are subject to judicial oversight. Both the 1993 and 2011 Acts provide for the appointment of a High Court Judge to carry out reviews of their operation and the relevant reports to An Taoiseach are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. In addition, the Acts provide for a procedure whereby a member of the public who believes their communications have been intercepted or that their personal data has been accessed (whichever the case may be) may make a complaint to a Complaints Referee. The current Complaints Referee is a judge of the Circuit Court.</p></reply>

Despite the challenging budgetary situation, the pre-school year has been maintained as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality pre-school services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.<br/><br/>There is an increasing body of Irish and International evidence quantifying the benefits of early years interventions in terms of improving outcomes for children and in delivering significant economic and societal return to the State. In this context I believe the introduction of a second year would benefit children&rsquo;s educational and developmental outcomes.A second free pre-school year would represent &euro;2,500 to &euro;3,000 worth of free childcare to parents and would be likely to generate 4,000-5,000 new jobs, albeit mostly part-time. <br/><br/>However, the introduction of a second pre-school year would require considerable additional funding, broadly in line with the cost of the current one-year provision, which is &euro;175 million per annum.  This additional funding is not currently available due to the financial constraints under which the Government is operating.  In addition, all of the available evidence indicates that the quality of the pre-school provision is key to good outcomes for children.  The Pre-School Quality Agenda that is being progressed by my Department,  and which involves a range of actions in key areas aimed at improving quality within early years services and enhancing the regulatory regime, is a key building block for any further extension of universal childcare provision.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures,</i>the national policy framework for children and young people 2014-2020, recognises the value of early childhood care and education in supporting children's early cognitive, social and emotional development, and the Government is committed to the introduction of a second free pre-school year within the lifetime of the framework once the required quality standards are achieved and subject to the availability of resources.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-23a.860.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092300071#WRT01700"><p>My Department commissioned the Centre for Effective Services (CES) to undertake a review of the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy, 2001 to establish the extent that the strategy has been successful and to identify any blockages or challenges to its implementation. The report found that there have been significant improvements in the service response to homelessness of children and this has contributed to a decrease in the number of children presenting to services as being homeless.</p><p>  It should of course be noted that policy responsibility for homeless young people, insofar as it extends to my Department, relates to children under 18 and any child welfare and protection concerns that may arise in the context of the Child Care Act 1991. Young people who are homeless, either singly or as part of a family unit and not falling within this category are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.  Young people who were formerly in the care of the State and presently in receipt of aftercare services will, as part of this support, have their accommodation needs identified.</p><p>Children under 16 who present as being homeless to emergency services are taken into care. Children aged 16 and 17 may be taken into care, or provided a service under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991. Such children are typically more challenging to care for as they may be out of school; have experienced neglect and serious family discord; problematic drug use; have mental health or learning difficulties. These children often wish to be only involved with peers and they may be less inclined to engage with social work services. Services need to provide early and flexible options to engage with these children and to support them beyond their 18th birthday.</p><p>  Aftercare is the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of a young person who is leaving statutory care at 18 years of age, to assist him/her in making the transition to independent living. The children most vulnerable to homelessness as care leavers are those leaving residential care or short term foster care placements. Children, who come into care late, in their mid to late teens, may not have developed the relationships with staff or aftercare workers that helps them achieve positive outcomes. It is essential that these young people have an opportunity to develop a relationship with a dedicated aftercare worker who will work with them to identify their needs and ensure that services are in place to help provide them with the stability and support they need.</p><p>  The Child and Family Agency has advised that they are in the process of establishing interagency aftercare committees at local level bringing together Local Authorities, HSE and other statutory and voluntary agencies. These committees will develop interagency wrap around aftercare plans for young people, particularly for those with complex needs, including housing requirements.</p><p>  A protocol, developed by the Child and Family Agency and the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association, in relation to dealing with accommodation issues of young people leaving care, is nearing completion and is expected to issue shortly.  When agreed and implemented, the protocol will see the relevant local authority housing representative attend aftercare planning meetings with social workers of the Agency in relation to those young people for whom social housing has been identified as the most appropriate form of accommodation support.  This, it is hoped, will facilitate a more efficient service for those leaving care in obtaining social housing suitable to their needs.  </p><p>  Furthermore, as the Deputy will be aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. This is in response to concerns that there was insufficient focus in this area and that such planning was not taking place on a properly structured and consistent basis.</p><p>  The prioritisation of services for young people receiving aftercare is considered in the context of the statutory and administrative criteria and rules relating to State provision of services and the requirement of all State bodies to provide services in accordance with resources available to them. The Agency and officials of the DCYA have been and continue to explore these matters further with the relevant Departments and agencies, on a bi-lateral basis, to continue to support the improvement of aftercare for this vulnerable cohort.</p><p>The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, at its sitting on 1st April, considered the draft aftercare provisions. The Committee&rsquo;s report on the Bill was made available to the Department in mid-July and is currently under consideration, prior to refining the text of the provisions in conjunction with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.</p></reply>

It was launched by the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, and then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in April 2014.<br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>is based on a clear vision of what we want for children and young people in Ireland. This vision is for: <br/><br/><i>&ldquo;Ireland to be one of the best small countries in which to grow up and raise a family, andwhere the rights of all children and young people are respected, protected and fulfilled; where their voices are heard and where they are supported to realise their maximum potential now and in the future.&rdquo;</i><br/><br/><i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>puts the everyday lives of children and young people at its centre and requires Government Departments and State agencies to work together in an integrated way along with non-government organisations to achieve better outcomes for children and young people.<br/><br/>It emphasises an integrated and evidence informed approach to working across government, on horizontal and vertical levels, which transfers to all sectors and settings working with children and young people.<br/><br/>The implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>involves the establishment of clear and efficient structures to ensure accountability, drive implementation and provide a forum for stakeholder engagement. These structures have been designed to ensure efficiency and effectiveness. They bring together in a concerted manner the key players across government, the voluntary sector and the voices of children and young people. The new implementation structure streamlines and redesigns existing structures and forums in this area so that their input is represented at a strategic level on the Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Consortium.<br/><br/>The establishment of the Advisory Council is a significant action within <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>to leverage engagement with the whole-of-society, in this case through the NGO sector, with the inclusion of other independent experts and individuals with specific expertise in working with and for children and young people. <br/><br/>The Advisory Council brings together for the first time a diverse range of sectoral stakeholders in the domains of children and young people&rsquo;s policy and provision into one forum. The Advisory Council will provide the platform for the NGO sector involved in the area of children and young people to actively guide and support the implementation of <i>Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures</i>. <br/><br/>As the NGO sector connects with and mobilises communities, families and individuals, they are an essential partner to implementation so as to ensure that better outcomes for children and young people are achieved.<br/><br/>The Advisory Council will comprise 16 members, in four groups of four, under an independent chair. The first three groups represent the sectors of: Early Years, Children and Youth. The representative bodies for the groups in these areas have each been asked to provide three nominees to me for inclusion on the Advisory Council. These groups are:<br/><br/>- Early Years &ndash; The National Voluntary Childcare Collective<br/><br/>- Children &ndash; The Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance<br/><br/>- Youth -  The National Youth Council of Ireland<br/><br/>Presently, work is ongoing in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in finalising the remaining candidates for the positions on the Advisory Council. This will completed shortly and it is expected that the first meeting of the Advisory Council will take place before the end of October. </p></reply>

There is a link between consumption and harm and evidence that affordability is one of the drivers of increased consumption.  The Government has approved an extensive package of measures to deal with alcohol misuse, to be incorporated in a Public Health (Alcohol) Bill , including minimum unit pricing.</p><p>  The Government has decided that minimum unit pricing is the most effective policy measure to deal with the sale of alcohol at cheap prices.  Minimum unit pricing is a mechanism of imposing a statutory floor in price levels per gram of alcohol that must be legally observed by retailers in both the on and off trade sector.  This is a targeted measure, designed to prevent the sale of alcohol at very cheap prices.  It is mainly aimed at those who are higher risk, such as adolescents and people who have a harmful and hazardous alcohol consumption pattern.  It should therefore only have a marginal effect on moderate drinkers.  It is not expected that minimum unit pricing will affect the price of alcohol in the on-trade sector or the majority of alcohol products sold in the off-trade sector including wine</p><p>  Work on developing a framework for the necessary Department of Health legislation is continuing and it is hoped to publish a General Scheme of a Bill in the Autumn.</p></reply>

Under the Scheme, nursing home residents contribute towards the cost of their nursing home care based on their means, and the HSE pays the balance.  The Scheme applies to public, private and voluntary nursing homes.<br/><br/>The person's contribution towards their cost of care is calculated based on 80% of their income and 7.5% per annum of their assets.  If a person is a member of a couple, the assessment is based on half of the couple's combined income and assets.  The Scheme contains several important safeguards which ensure that both the person in the nursing home and their spouse/partner, if applicable, are adequately provided for:<br/><br/>- Nobody will pay more than the actual cost of care;<br/><br/>- The first &euro;36,000 of a person's assets, or &euro;72,000 for a couple, is not taken into account during the financial assessment;<br/><br/>- The principal residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of a person's time in care.  This three year cap can also apply to family farms/businesses in certain circumstances;<br/><br/>- Where an individual's assets include land and property in the State, the contribution based on such assets may be deferred and collected from their estate. This is the optional Nursing Home Loan element of the Scheme;<br/><br/>- Individuals keep a personal allowance of 20% of their income, or 20% of the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater;<br/><br/>- If there is a spouse/partner remaining at home, s/he will retain 50% of the couples income, or the maximum rate of the State Pension (Non-Contributory), whichever is the greater;<br/><br/>- Certain items of expenditure, called allowable deductions, can be taken into account during the financial assessment. These allowable deductions include health expenses.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p><p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p><p>  Eligibility for health services in Ireland is based primarily on residency and means.  The Health Act 1970 (as amended) provides for two categories of eligibility for all persons ordinarily resident in the country, i.e. full eligibility (medical card) and limited eligibility (all others).  Full eligibility is determined mainly by reference to income limits and is granted to persons who, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE) are unable to provide general practitioner, medical and surgical services to persons and themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  There is a provision for discretion to grant a card in cases of &quot;undue hardship&quot; where the income guidelines are exceeded.</p><p>  The Government decided, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure, that the Minister for Health would revert to Government with options for providing eligibility for a range of health services on the basis of specific and defined medical conditions.  The Director-General of the Health Service Executive established an Expert Panel to examine and recommend the range of medical conditions that should be considered as a basis of eligibility.  The Expert Panel is chaired by Professor Frank Keane, past-president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and clinical lead of the National Clinical Programme for Surgery. The panel includes a range of 23 clinical experts from primary care, specialist services and therapies.  The panel also includes a patient representative to ensure that the views of patients are central to the process.  The Expert Panel is to report to the Director General of the HSE, who will then advise the Minister of the outcome of the deliberations of the Expert Panel.</p></reply>

HIQA has advised my Department that it refers to Section 2 (1) of the Act when evaluating whether a residential service is a designated centre. This states that a designated centre is:<br/><br/>&ldquo;an institution <br/><br/>(a)at which residential services are provided by the [Health Service] Executive, a service provider or a person that is not a service provider but who receives assistance under section 39 of the Health Act 2004 or under section 10 of the Child Care Act 1991 &ndash;<br/><br/>I.in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991,<br/><br/>  II.to persons with disabilities, in relation to their disabilities, or<br/><br/>III.to other dependent persons, in relation to their dependencies, or<br/><br/>(b)that is a nursing home as defined in Section 2 of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990&rdquo;<br/><br/>Where residential services for people with disabilities meet the definition as set out above, they are deemed to be designated centres under the Act and HIQA is then responsible for the regulation of these centres. <br/><br/>The regulation of designated centres includes inspections of the centres by HIQA inspectors. These inspections evaluate compliance with the <i>Health Act 2007 (Care and Support of Residents in Designated Centres for Persons (Children and Adults) with Disabilities) Regulations 2013 </i>and with the <i>National Standards for Residential Services for Children and Adults with Disabilities 2013.</i>A report of the findings of each inspection is published on the HIQA website after each inspection, which includes the identification of areas of non compliance and an action plan from the provider to address those areas of non  compliance. <br/><br/>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) began to regulate residential services for people with disabilities on 1 November 2013, pursuant to Statutory Instruments 366 (2013) and Statutory Instrument 367 (2013), which assign responsibility to HIQA for registering and inspecting residential services for children and adults with disabilities, including respite services.<br/><br/>I am informed by HIQA that it has conducted 667 inspections in the period 1 November 2013 &ndash; 19 September 2014.  <br/><br/>I will arrange to forward the Deputy a detailed geographical list of the inspections that have been carried out to date.</p></reply>

The Health (General Practitioner Service) Act 2014, which provides an entitlement for all children aged under 6 to a GP service without fees, was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2014.  </p><p>  The Government will prioritise the over 70&rsquo;s in the next phase of the roll-out of free access to GP care.  The Government has approved the drafting of a Bill to provide a GP service without fees for all persons aged 70 years and over. Drafting of the Bill has commenced and is the subject on ongoing interaction between the Department and the Attorney-General&rsquo;s Office.  The expectation is that the Health (General Practitioner Service) (No. 2) Bill 2014 will be published shortly. The aim is to have the over 70&rsquo;s phase implemented this year or early next year, subject to the conclusion of discussions between the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO.  The estimated cost is &euro;18 million for 2015.</p><p>  Under the existing medical card and GP visit card contracts, it is open to GPs to choose to participate or not in those schemes.  The position in respect of choice of GP for the free GP care for over 70's scheme will be clarified when the requisite legislation and contractual arrangements are in place. Currently, if a GP does not hold the appropriate GMS contract, a patient may obtain a list of contract holders from their local HSE office.  If the patient has had three unsuccessful attempts to secure a GMS doctor who will register them on his/her panel, the patient should contact the HSE, providing details of the doctors they have contacted, and the HSE will assign them to a GMS doctor within the locality.</p></reply>

Following a rigorous procurement process, the Board has now appointed the design team for the project and design development has begun. As part of its brief, the design team has reviewed and validated the programme. The validated programme sets a target for completion of design development in June of next year, at which time a planning application will be submitted. This will include both the main hospital at the St James's campus and the satellite centres, which are considered to be an integral part of the overall project. </p><p>  Allowing an appropriate period of time for a planning decision to be made, it is expected that subject to permission being granted, the project will be on site at all three locations &ndash; the main hospital  on the St James&rsquo;s campus and the satellite centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals - in January 2016. Commissioning for the main hospital is targeted to begin at the end of 2018 and transition of services in Spring 2019, with construction to be fully complete at the end of that year. It is estimated that the satellite centres on the campuses of Tallaght and Connolly Hospital will be complete and in service in mid-2017, well in advance of the main hospital. </p><p>  Minister Howlin has already committed to making &euro;200m available from the sale of the National Lottery for the new children's hospital, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding and underlining the Government's commitment to the project. Current estimates are that the core hospital, including both satellite centres, will be delivered within this envelope.

ASD is classified in the international classification system as a &lsquo;mental and behavioural disorder&rsquo;.  </p><p>  ASDs are viewed as lifelong conditions.  The HSE advises that there are no therapies or drug treatments for ASD that are curative.   </p><p>  This Government is committed to providing specialist supports to enable each individual with a disability, including those with ASD, to achieve his or her full potential and maximise independence, including living as independently as possible.  Services are provided in a variety of community and residential settings in partnership with service users, their families and carers and a range of statutory, non-statutory and community groups. </p><p>  Services provided by ASD service providers include assessment, diagnosis and ongoing treatment and intervention supports.  Ongoing interventions and supports may include home support services, respite services and multi-disciplinary team supports to assess the individual needs of each person with ASD and provide for the appropriate interventions. </p><p>  Products that claim to treat medical conditions such as autism are considered to be medicines and require an authorisation prior to being placed on the market in Ireland. The product referred to as Miracle Mineral Solution is not authorised as a medicine for sale or supply in Ireland. This product is considered to be a medicine and therefore cannot be supplied in Ireland without a marketing authorisation.</p><p>  The supply of unauthorised products in Ireland is a very serious matter. The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has confirmed that it is actively following up on this issue as a matter of urgency. The HPRA continues to advise consumers not to take this product as its safety and efficacy have not been independently verified by a competent authority for medicines, such as the HPRA.</p></reply>

Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable products. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price the Health Service Executive (HSE) will reimburse to pharmacists for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine's prices.<br/><br/>Eligible patients using State drug schemes like the Medical Card or Drugs Payment Scheme will not face any additional costs for products priced at or below the reference price. If a patient would like to receive a particular brand that costs more than the reference price then the patient will have to pay the additional cost of that product. In cases where substitution is prohibited for clinical reasons, patients will not face any additional costs if the prescribed product costs more than the reference price.<br/><br/>The HSE advises the public that if they are being charged prices which exceed the reimbursement price listed on the HSE website (<i></i>), plus a dispensing fee of between &euro;3.50 and &euro;5, then they should discuss the differential with their pharmacist to ensure they get the best possible price for the medicine concerned.<br/><br/>In addition, measures have been taken to increase price transparency among retail pharmacies. In March of this year the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland issued guidelines to pharmacists on procedures and minimum standards of information to be provided to customers, including a requirement to provide an itemised receipt of purchase of medicines.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association  for the assessment of new medicines. In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Fampridine and concluded that, as the manufacturer was unable to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of Fampridine in the Irish healthcare setting, it was unable to recommend the reimbursement of the product. The report is available on the NCPE's website (). <br/><br/>The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of new medicines that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable. Due to the very difficult and challenging economic environment in which the Government targeted additional savings in health expenditure of &euro;619 million in 2014, which must be achieved while protecting front line services to the most vulnerable to the greatest extent possible, the HSE decided it was not in a position to add the drug to the List of Reimbursable Items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. <br/><br/>It is open to the supplier, at any time, to submit a new application to the HSE incorporating new evidence which demonstrates the cost effectiveness of Fampridine. Biogen Idec's Irish management indicated to the HSE in November 2013 that it intended to re-submit an application in April 2014. The HSE has advised it received a revised application from Biogen Idec on Friday 25th July. This application is currently being assessed in line with the agreed procedures and timescales. No further comment is possible at this time as the HSE decision making process is ongoing.</p></reply>

The assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. Standard medical card scheme applications and those for persons aged 70 and older generally require supporting financial and/or medical documentation to be furnished in order for the application to be assessed in line with the HSE&rsquo;s Medical Card and GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines and application forms can be accessed online/by post or at local health offices.</p><p>  However, this process differs in the case of persons seeking emergency medical cards. The HSE has an effective system in place for the provision of emergency medical cards for patients who are terminally ill, or who are seriously ill and in urgent need of medical care that they cannot afford. Medical cards that are applied for in an emergency situation are issued within twenty-four hours of receipt of the required patient details and the letter of confirmation of the condition from a doctor or a medical consultant. Such an application can be initiated through the Local Health office and details of this procedure are available to all GP's and Social Workers.</p><p>  With the exception of terminally ill patients, the HSE issues all emergency cards on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and that the applicant will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the emergency card. As a result, emergency medical cards are issued to a named individual, with a limited eligibility period of six months.</p><p>  For persons with a terminal illness, a means test does not apply.  Once the terminal illness is verified by a GP or Consultant, patients are given an emergency medical card for six months. Given the nature and urgency of the issue, the HSE has appropriate escalation routes to ensure that the person gets the card as quickly as possible. For the purpose of the decision making process for an emergency medical card, in these circumstances, a &quot;terminal illness&quot;, or a person who is &quot;terminally  ill, is a person who is certified by a Doctor or a Consultant as &quot;terminally ill&quot; and is in a palliative care situation. Terminally ill means that the person is suffering from an illness that will end in death, where there is no possibility of recovery and the person is more likely to die of their illness in the next six months than not.</p></reply>

The primary emphasis of Emigrant Support Programme funding is on supporting culturally sensitive frontline welfare services targeting the most vulnerable members of our overseas communities.  These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish communities overseas, reducing homelessness, tacking social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access the local statutory entitlements.  The Programme has evolved in light of recent emigration to respond to the needs of the newer profile of Irish emigrants, including young families, in countries such as Australia and Canada.  Emigrant Support Programme funding is increasingly directed to Irish welfare centres in those countries which play an important role in supporting Irish emigrants, including new arrivals, who experience particular challenges.  Over &euro;2.4million of funding was allocated to organisations in Australia under the Programme between 2003 and 2013.  This network of Irish community support organisations offers a range of responses including information provision, outreach and crisis assistance.  Organisations supported in Australia include the Irish Australian Welfare Bureau and Resource Centre New South Wales, Claddagh Association Perth and the Irish Australian Support Association of Queensland.</p><p>  Our Embassies and Consulates continue to ensure widespread awareness of the Programme and have actively encouraged applications for new projects from regions that support new arrivals.  To date in 2014 expenditure of over &euro;9,370,000 has been approved.  A number of grant applications are currently being processed and I would be happy to provide the Deputy with a complete list of 2014 grants following the end of the financial year.</p></reply>

I have met with the family concerned and have had a number of phone calls and contacts </i>with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Minister Shoukry, in this regard.  In those contacts, I have asked that the charges against this individual be reviewed, and that he be released and permitted to return home to Ireland.  The considered and persistent actions taken to date by the Embassy in Cairo and officials in my Department have also been in pursuit of that objective, and to support this individual&rsquo;s welfare and well-being while he remains in detention.  I raised this case with the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Ms. Catherine Ashton at the recent Gymnich meeting of Foreign Ministers on 29 and 30 August 2014.<br/><br/>Ireland is precluded from directly interfering with the judicial process in Egypt. This is a difficult case in a complex and challenging context.<br/><br/>However, our concern at the continued and lengthy period of detention has been raised with the Egyptian authorities in a clear and sustained manner, as has the critical importance of due process in this case.  I have also emphasised that this individual was only seventeen when the alleged offences took place.  It is the Government&rsquo;s view that this individual should not be tried as part of a group trial involving a large number of defendants and on the basis of group charges, but solely on the basis of specific evidence.<br/><br/>The Embassy of Ireland in Cairo has been in sustained and direct contact with the Egyptian authorities in relation to the case, and contacts have included numerous meetings at Ambassadorial level with senior officials from the Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Justice, and the office of the Prosecutor General.  Consular officials, including the Irish Ambassador to Egypt Isolde Moylan, have visited this person on 24 separate occasions.  The Ambassador and Consul from the Embassy also attended what was to have been an initial hearing in the case on 12 August.  Diplomats from the Embassy have also met with his lawyer to discuss the case.<br/><br/>On 6 August 2014 this individual was moved from the prison where he had previously been held.  During a visit by a representative of the Embassy on 19 August, he raised concerns with the Embassy about his treatment and conditions at the prison.  Following representations by the Embassy, on 20 August he was moved to a separate section of the prison which we are satisfied has more favourable conditions and a better environment for the individual.  Consular officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin have met with family representatives on nine separate occasions and continue to keep the family updated and provide consular assistance.<br/><br/>The EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr. Stavros Lambrinidis raised this case with the then Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, and the Prosecutor General, Hisham Barakat, during his visit to Cairo in February 2014.<br/><br/>My predecessor the then T&aacute;naiste, Eamon Gilmore TD, raised this case with the EU High Representative Catherine Ashton at the Foreign Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 23 June 2014.  This followed a letter from the then T&aacute;naiste to Lady Ashton on 9 May 2014.  Also, the then T&aacute;naiste raised concerns at this person&rsquo;s detention with the then Egyptian Foreign Minister, Nabil Fahmy, on 11 November and 23 December 2013.<br/><br/>The then Minister of State for European Affairs, Paschal Donohue TD, also raised the case in person with High Representative Ashton at the Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 12 May 2014.<br/><br/>In March 2014, the former Minister for Justice, Alan Shatter TD wrote to the then Egyptian Minister for Justice Abdel-Moneim Othman, raising the Government&rsquo;s concerns at the individual&rsquo;s continued detention.<br/><br/>Together with Ambassador Moylan and consular officials in my Department I will continue to seek a review of his case, his release and return to his family and, in the meantime, to provide all possible consular assistance to this individual and his family.</p></reply>

Our policy on International Development, &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo; clearly articulates our vision for a sustainable and just world, and sets out our goals and areas of focus for the coming years.  The policy restates our commitment to achieving the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA), when economic circumstances permit.</p><p>  Since coming to office, this Government has managed to successfully stabilise the budget for development assistance.  This is a significant achievement,  in extremely difficult budgetary and fiscal circumstances.  In 2011 we provided &euro;657 million for ODA, and between 2012 and 2013 our allocation to ODA increased slightly from &euro;629 million to &euro;637 million.  For 2014 we expect to provide in excess of &euro;600 million on ODA.</p><p>  These are substantial allocations of public funds and provide clear evidence of our support and commitment to the aid programme.  They also represent a genuine investment on behalf of the Irish people in assisting those less fortunate than ourselves.  The estimates process for 2015 is now well advanced.  The allocations for ODA, as with allocations to all Government Departments, will be framed in the context of our policy commitments and the overall budgetary circumstances we face.  They will ultimately be a decision for Government.  Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy, that I and the Minster for Foreign Affairs and Trade will make the strongest case possible for the development assistance programme in the Budget to be announced by the Minister for Finance on 14 October.</p></reply>

During the recent conflict, most of these schools were used to provide shelter to large numbers of civilians who were fleeing from other areas.  Some 111 schools were damaged in the conflict, in most cases from the effects of impacts nearby.  However, in seven cases it appears that school premises were directly hit by fire, leading to large numbers of casualties among people sheltering there, including children.  It is likely in most cases, and certain in some, that missiles or artillery shells fired by Israeli forces were responsible.  In at least one case however, Israel stated that its forces had not been involved, and that the blast resulted from a missile, fired from Gaza towards Israel, dropping short in Gaza itself.  This is not an unknown occurrence, and we have no means ourselves at this point of ascertaining exactly what happened.  Nor do we know if incidents of schools being hit by Israeli fire were intentional or not, although in some cases at least it seems likely that the school was the intended target.  It is also necessary to be clear that in a number of cases UNRWA itself discovered rockets and other weapons hidden in school buildings without its knowledge.  In each case UNRWA disposed of the munitions and made public the facts.  Such incidents do not of course justify in any way any subsequent attacks on schools housing refugees, nor does there seem to have been any correlation between the two.  It is however an indication of the complexities involved.<br/><br/>The UN Human Rights Council has established an investigative panel to examine all of these alleged or apparent abuses of human rights or breaches of international law.  We support such an investigation, and will give it every possible assistance.  I hope very much that the panel will be able to determine the truth of what happened in these cases.  I would urge the Israeli authorities to cooperate fully with the panel.<br/><br/>On behalf of the Government, I clearly and consistently condemned the causing of large scale civilian casualties during the conflict, including attacks on schools and shelters.  On 25 July I spoke directly with the Israeli Ambassador, following which I issued a statement including as follows:<blockquote>&ldquo;I expressed my own deep disquiet and the grave concerns of the Irish Government and people at the escalation of violence in Gaza and at yesterday&rsquo;s latest atrocity which saw an UN-run school hit and at least 15 civilians killed and more than 200 wounded, including many children.  Such attacks on civilian institutions such as schools and hospitals are utterly unacceptable, contrary to international law and must stop immediately.&rdquo;</blockquote>At my direction, similar concerns were also expressed by the Irish Ambassador directly to the Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv.</p></reply>

The World Health Organisation is currently estimating the total number of probable and confirmed cases in the region at more than 5,600, with a fatality rate of over 50%.  Ireland is supporting the efforts of the EU, UN and international community to provide a strong and effective response to the crisis, which is focused both on stopping the spread of the virus and treating those affected.  Ireland was one of the co-sponsors of a UN Security Council resolution on Ebola adopted on 18 September, which led to the establishment of a new UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).</p><p>  The two countries most seriously affected by the Ebola crisis, Liberia and Sierra Leone, are partner countries of Ireland for our development aid programme.  We have already provided funding of &euro;350,000 direct to NGO organisations working on the Ebola response there, particularly those that are involved in a very important programme of community sensitisation aimed specifically at halting the spread of the Ebola virus.  Yesterday I announced additional funding of &euro;660,000 for UNICEF, to provide life-saving nutritional supplies to children who have been affected by the crisis.  One in five of those infected are children and, given the disproportionate impact of the virus on women and the high mortality rates, many children are also losing their mothers to the disease.</p><p>  My Department is also working through the UN Humanitarian Response Depot in Accra, Ghana to mobilise pre-positioned Irish humanitarian supplies worth &euro;350,000 with a view to early distribution to those most affected, including survivors and vulnerable children.  A member of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps is also being deployed to Dakar, Senegal, to work with the World Food Programme in setting up an air transit centre for use by the UN Humanitarian Air Service.</p><p>  This funding and support is in addition to our ongoing development programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia.  The 2014 programme budgets for the two countries amount to just under &euro;10 million, a considerable proportion of which will need to be re-directed to fighting the spread of the virus and establishing further treatment facilities.  Irish Aid also annually funds development work in the two countries by our NGO partners - amounting last year to in excess of &euro;6million.</p><p>  We are continuing to monitor the situation closely, in particular through our Embassy in Freetown which is actively engaged and working with the governments of Sierra Leone and Liberia, the UN, EU and our NGO partners, in responding to the outbreak.</p></reply>

Under the student grant scheme, eligible candidates may receive funding provided they are attending an approved course at an approved institution and meet the prescribed conditions of funding, including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means.<br/><br/>Students who qualify for the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), may be considered for support for the student contribution under the student grant scheme provided they satisfy the conditions of the relevant Student Grant Scheme and Student Support Regulations including those relating to residence, nationality, approved course, previous academic attainment and means.<br/><br/>  Since September 2010, all new applicants in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA), and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, are no longer eligible for maintenance support under the student grant scheme.  However, the cost of the student services charge and tuition fees payable to colleges continues to be met for eligible students by the Exchequer.<br/><br/>  The BTEA is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to enable participation in second and third level education by allowing eligible people on certain social welfare payments to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.  Recipients of the One Parent Family Payment are not required by the Department of Social Protection to transfer to the BTEA upon registration on a course of further or higher education.<br/><br/>  Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.  This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances.<br/><br/>  Information on the fund is available through the Access Officer in the third level institution attended.  The fund is administered on a confidential, discretionary basis.  <br/><br/>In addition to the student grant, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education.  Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on www.revenue.ie.</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.  As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<br/><br/>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.<br/><br/>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.  My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.  Application forms for taking a section 29 appeal are available on my Departments website at the following link , or by contacting Section 29 Administration Unit, Friars Mill Road, Mullingar, Co. Westmeath, phone 0761 108588.  An appeal should be made within 42 calendar days from the date the decision of the board of management was notified to the parent.  The  Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency (EWS) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The EWS may be able to offer assistance and advice on securing a school placement within the pupil's area.  The contact details for the EWS is Educational Welfare Service of the Child and Family Agency, Block 3, Floor 1, Grove court, Blanchardstown, Dublin 15, phone number 01-8103260.</p></reply>

The amount due by apprentices is calculated on a pro rata basis of the time which they spend in Institutes of Technology during the academic year.</p><p>  Since 2004, F&Aacute;S/SOLAS has paid a part of the Annual Student Contribution due in respect of apprentices, with apprentices themselves paying the part of the contribution relating to examination fees. As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS have ceased making payments to Institutes of Technology and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.</p><p>  From January 2014 up to the end of the academic year in June, apprentices paid &euro;833 (1/3 of &euro;2,500) per typical attendance block although a small number of apprentices paid more for longer blocks. These arrangements mean that apprentices are treated the same as students in IoTs in terms of the annual student contribution. Apprentices had already been paying &euro;233 (28% of &euro;833) in respect of the exam fee element of the ASC.  However, unlike full-time students, apprentices are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in IoTs. This allowance ranges from &euro;293 to &euro;647 per week depending on the trade and phase of the apprenticeship programme. This is the equivalent to their net take-home pay on the job, and is not subject to tax or PRSI. Such allowances are not available to students in the IoTs.</p><p>  The Budget 2014 decision was taken in the context of the difficult economic circumstances the country is in and the overall savings that my Department had to find in 2014. There is no scope to revisit the measure.  I am deeply committed to supporting apprenticeship training in Ireland, both through the renewal of existing apprenticeships and the extension of the apprenticeship model to new areas. I will be focused on delivering in accordance with the Implementation Plan recently published to take forward the recommendations of the recent independent review of apprenticeship training in Ireland.</p></reply>

Initial teacher education providers have responsibility for quality assuring the content, teaching and assessment of the Gaeltacht element of initial teacher education programmes. Any concerns in this regard should be taken up directly with the provider in the first instance and/or the Council.  My Department supports the changes as contributing to overall quality improvement in initial teacher education. </p><p>  I can appreciate that supporting a student through third level education can be challenging. The decision to abolish the grants was not taken lightly, and it has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing requirement to reduce costs and achieve efficiencies where possible. In making difficult decisions such as this, priority was given to protecting resources for front line education services as far as possible, which is especially challenging with rising numbers of school-going children.  The changes to the Gaeltacht placement grant were publicised in advance of implementation so that students would be aware of the new arrangements before embarking on Initial Teacher Education programmes. </p><p>  To assist with the costs of the Gaeltacht placement, students who are in receipt of a student grant which includes a 100% fee grant, or who would have qualified for a full fee grant but for the Free Fees Schemes, can apply for funding towards travel and accommodation costs under the field trip element of a fee grant, subject to the normal terms and conditions of the scheme.   Apart from the student grant system, in circumstances of particular need students may apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund. Information in relation to this fund is available through the Access Officer in the third-level institution attended</p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking school places in an area. However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice. As schools may not have a place for every applicant, a selection process may be necessary. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.<br/><br/>  Under section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act, 1998, each school is legally obliged to disclose its enrolment policy and to ensure that as regards that policy that principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents' choice are respected.<br/><br/>  Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year. My Department has no authority to compel a school to admit a pupil, except in the case of an appeal under section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 being upheld.

This can necessitate the use of temporary accommodation, as in the case of this school, until my Department is in a position to provide a permanent building. My Department will continue to liaise with the school authorities regarding their long term accommodation needs. <br/><br/>The school opened in 2010 and is currently accommodated in temporary accommodation which is relatively new. It would be expected that with standard maintenance, the accommodation would remain in good condition for a considerable period of time. This accommodation was installed in 2008/2009 at a cost of &euro;1.68 million and was used for a short period by another school. These prefabs are not leased.<br/><br/>  Following an application from the school management, my Department recently approved funding for repairs to the temporary accommodation which was damaged during the storms earlier this year under the Emergency Works Scheme.  It is expected that this funding will address the matters raised by the school. The School Authority was also sanctioned funding for two additional prefabricated units to cater for increased enrolments. The pupils temporarily located in the gaelscoil will move to this accommodation when installed in the coming weeks. As a contract to provide for the improved/additional accommodation has not been awarded, the amount of funding provided is commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed at this point. <br/><br/>It is intended that the new school building in Craddockstown will accommodate the planned new post-primary school for Naas in its start-up years.  This school is due to commence operation in 2015 under the Patronage of the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB).  KWETB will be using the building in the intervening period for other educational services.</p></reply>

Schools have autonomy in relation to the deployment of classroom teachers to individual classes. My Department's guidance to schools is that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). School authorities are also requested, where possible, to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes. The Staffing Schedule includes the provision where schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds. In addition, a staffing appeals process is available to schools, including a new criterion for the 2014/15 school year which is aimed at schools which make a significant contribution to absorbing demographic growth.<br/><br/>The context for any discussion about class sizes is that my Department, like all other Government Departments, is operating within a budgetary programme that is designed to return the Government finances to a sustainable basis. This budgetary programme has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing some economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth that will enable us to move to a point in future budgets where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR and class size. <br/><br/>  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers across primary, post-primary and third level.</p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers. </p><p>  The introduction of water charges is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to create a sustainable funding model for water services. The water metering programme will ensure that the system of charges is fair and equitable. The impact on home improvement costs or rebuilding costs were not considerations in this regard. The CER will be considering Irish Water&rsquo;s charges for connecting to the water services network later in 2014. Pending approval of these charges, there have been no changes to the charges levied for connection to the water services network. </p></reply>

I am conscious of the difficulties caused by rising rents and the problem of sourcing suitable accommodation, especially in Dublin and other urban centres. The most recent published data from the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) Rent Index shows the extent of rising rents, particularly in Dublin where rents for houses increased by 8.5 % annually, while for apartments the figure was 12.1%. </p><p>  The fundamental reason behind the rise in rents is a lack of supply. Increasing both public and private housing supply is a critical issue and earlier this year the Government published Construction 2020 - A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector. It includes a commitment to a social housing strategy which is being finalised and will be considered by Government in the coming weeks.   </p><p>  In addition, the PRTB was asked to conduct a study to explore options to address the difficulties being experienced in segments of the private rented sector due to rising rents and to report back to me with policy recommendations. This report is being finalised and is due to be presented to me in the coming days. It is the first of two studies on the future of the private rented sector and focuses on options to address the recent escalation in rents, mainly in the Dublin region.   </p><p>  While the report is not yet to hand, I understand i t explores a range of issues in regard to rent stability ranging from an examination of rent regulation regimes to the tax treatment of the private rented sector and the role of rent supplement. It is a significant report that will require careful consideration, together with colleagues in Government, before deciding on the best options to address the current difficulties in the market. Our overriding objective is to achieve stability and sustainability in the market for the benefit of tenants, landlords and society as a whole.   </p></reply>

Local authorities have confirmed that 1,604 of the properties identified are considered unsuitable by reference to sustainable planning and housing policy or are located in areas with no demand. A further 1,179 units originally identified as available were subsequently discovered by NAMA to be unavailable as the units had already been sold or leased by their debtor in accordance with their strategy for repaying their debt, or became unavailable when the loans associated with these properties were sold and NAMA no longer hold an interest. The potential of a further 540 units is being evaluated.<br/><br/>Of the current 1,971 available properties for which a social housing demand has been confirmed by the local authorities, <b></b>736 have been delivered for at the end of June 2014. This figure included 531 complete and operational units and 205 units where contracts had been signed and final completion works were under way.  A breakdown by Authority is provided in the table below. A further 603 properties are considered as being active transactions whereby terms are agreed or active negotiation is on-going by all parties concerned or where a detailed appraisal (i.e. determining the most likely delivery mechanism) is being carried out. <br/><br/>The process to source NAMA units requires agreement between several parties and operates is subject to a range of legal and financial constraints. Within this context significant progress has been made . The introduction of the National Asset Residential Property Services Limited (NARPSL) special purpose vehicle (SPV) has aided delivery with some 367 units were delivered in 2013 alone, almost a doubling of what had been delivered in the previous full year of operation. Efforts to source as many suitable properties as possible through this process are on-going, including the reviewing of units previously deemed unsuitable . Information in relation to the delivery of NAMA sourced units, including a full breakdown by county, of units delivered on quarterly basis, is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website: <table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>Identified </th><th>Complete/ Contracted </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow Co.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-09-23a.1300.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1088" speakername="Alan Kelly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014092300079#WRBB04200"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 482, 484 and 492 together.<br/><br/>My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and the purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. <br/><br/>While it is clear that a proportion of funding must be used to provide sufficient bed capacity to accommodate those in need of emergency accommodation it is equally important that resources are channelled to deliver more permanent responses to homelessness in a focused and strategic way. <br/><br/>The level of funding available to housing authorities in 2015 for housing programmes including homelessness is currently being considered in the context of the Estimates process. In light of budgetary demands, I am working with my colleagues in Government to ensure that appropriate funding priority continues to be attached to homelessness.<br/><br/>In February 2013, the Government&rsquo;s <i>Homelessness Policy Statement</i>was published in which the aim to end long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. The statement emphasises a housing-led approach, which is focused on accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.<br/><br/>On 20 May 2014, the Implementation Plan on the State's Response to Homelessness was published in which the Government's approach to delivery on its objective of ending involuntary long-term homelessness by the end of 2016 was outlined. A copy of this plan is available on my Department's website at, <br/><br/><font color="#1F86FF"> </font><br/><br/>This plan sets out a range of measures to secure a ring-fenced supply of accommodation to house homeless households within the next three years and mobilise the necessary supports. Progress in implementing the plan is reported quarterly through the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and a copy of the Quarter 2 Progress Report is also available on my Department's website at the link provided above. <br/><br/>Based on data recorded on the Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS), a recent survey of lead housing authorities confirmed that 2,509 unique individuals utilised Section 10 funded emergency accommodation nationally during the week of 14 to 20 July 2014. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website at the link provided above.<br/><br/>Bringing vacant local authority properties back into productive use as quickly as possible is one of the critical actions in the implementation plan and steps are being taken across the country to bring 1,800 such units into use before year end.<br/><br/>Other suitable vacant residential properties in State ownership are also being considered to be brought into productive use as quickly as possible. Some large sites in Dublin City have been identified by key State stakeholders including OPW, the Department of Defence, and the HSE and these are being considered by Dublin City Council. I understand that proposals on the use of prefabricated units are also being considered by the City Council; in the event that the Council submits formal proposals in this regard, these will require careful consideration by my Department. The use of construction innovations, such as timber-framed housing, could be also considered for meeting immediate need on sites that become available.<br/><br/>The Homelessness Policy Implementation Team charged with overseeing and monitoring the delivery of actions outlined in the Government's implementation plan has been considering this matter further and options are being considered to alleviate the immediate problems in the Dublin region. <br/><br/>The supply of housing more generally will be addressed in the short to medium term by the actions being progressed in the Construction 2020 Strategy and will be strengthened further through the Social Housing Strategy which I expect will be finalised in the coming weeks.<br/><br/>I understand that the night bus previously operated by Dublin City Council and which picked up rough sleepers and transported them to emergency accommodation was discontinued in 2011. This issue is being considered further by the Homelessness Policy Implementation Team.</p></reply>

The Part V Review, carried out by the Housing Agency at my Department&rsquo;s request, has been completed and will be submitted to Government shortly. It is anticipated that any legislative changes required on foot of the review will, subject to Government approval, be incorporated into the General Scheme of a new Planning Bill, which is expected to be published shortly. </p><p>  The allocation of an affordable home is made on the basis that an individual is in need of housing, is a first time buyer, cannot afford to purchase privately on the open market but can service a mortgage obtained by loan through an approved financial institution or a local authority where private finance has been refused. While the terms and conditions of the various affordable housing schemes and the regulations governing local authority loans do not prohibit an affordable home owner from renting a spare room in his/her home, a local authority may attach conditions to the contract with the purchaser pertaining to subletting of the unit and its use by the purchaser as his/her normal place of residence. </p><p>  In order to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes, houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes, at a significant discount from market value, contain a clawback provision. However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result. A breach of contract conditions would be a matter for a local authority to pursue as it considers appropriate given the particular circumstances involved. The administration of the various affordable housing schemes in any particular case is a matter entirely for the relevant local authority.   </p></reply>

The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act defines a customer as the occupier of the premises in receipt of water services. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<br/><br/>In July 2014 my predecessor issued a direction under Section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 which addressed a number of matters relating to domestic water charges including the provision of a free household allowance.  In addition to the above, the Government has agreed to put in place further affordability measures to assist pensioners, persons with disabilities, and carers who receive the Household Benefits Package. The conditions and administrative approach to this additional measure are being developed by the Department of Social Protection.<br/><br/>The proposed approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it has submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER recently held a public consultation on this plan which covered a range of issues, including a number of proposed payment options. The CER is currently reviewing submissions received on the consultation and a determination will be made by the CER later this month. Full details of the CER public consultation are available on </p></reply>

In order to qualify for the commercial rate of motor tax, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for use as a goods vehicle and used solely for the conveyance of goods in the course of trade or business.   </p><p>  The carriage of employees is permitted in a commercial vehicle provided they are employed by the registered owner of the vehicle and the carriage takes place only in the course of their employment. The Roads Act 1920 does not specify the number of employees.</p><p>  There are no new regulations in relation to the taxation of commercial vehicles. Earlier this year, my predecessor issued a direction to motor tax offices that an existing requirement to remove all seats to the rear of the driver&rsquo;s seat and to remove rear seat belts and weld over the seat belt holes and anchor points would no longer apply to goods vehicles. However, the goods carrying area of a vehicle is still required to have a capacity equal to or higher than the person-carrying capacity.   </p><p>  Licensing authorities have an obligation under Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing)(Amendment) Regulations 1992 to be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek additional documentation supporting a claim for the goods rate of motor tax. Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance or evidence of registration for VAT purposes or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate documentation that would indicate that the applicant is in trade or business. It is up to the individual concerned to provide whatever evidence is required by the licensing authority in order for it to be satisfied that the applicant is entitled to the goods rate of motor tax, which is effectively a concessionary rate.   </p><p>  In addition to the primary and secondary legislation governing the motor tax system, it is open to me as minister, to issue such directions to licensing authorities as are considered necessary for securing uniformity of administration and it is the duty of licensing authorities to comply with any directions so given.   </p><p>  All local authority motor tax offices are subject to an annual audit by the Local Government Audit Service.   </p></reply>

The installation programme commenced in August 2013 and will be implemented nationally as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Up to 300,000 households may not be metered in the initial metering programme due to either the high cost or the technical difficulty of doing so. Irish Water has commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. On the basis of this report, it has been agreed to incorporate 48,000 apartments, identified by the report as being easily metered , into the current metering programme. The advancement of any further phase of metering, including the individual metering of properties with a shared service connection, will be a matter for consideration by the Commission for Energy Regulation based on proposals from Irish Water.<br/><br/>The proposed approach to charging has been outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan which it has submitted to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013. The CER is responsible for approving the plan , taking account of a ministerial policy direction issued to the CER in July 2014, in accordance with section 42 of the Water Services (No. 2 ) Act 2013 . Against this background, the CER are proposing to approve a water charges plan which provides that properties not connected to a meter would be billed on the basis of a scheme of assessed charges based on occupancy. The CER recently held a public consultation on the water charges plan and it is currently reviewing submissions received, in advance of making a final determination later this month.  Full details of the CER public consultation are available on its website, .<br/><br/>The policy direction of July 2014 requires the CER to review assessed charges in the light of emerging data on metered consumption to ensure that the assessed charges remain as close a proxy for actual usage as possible.<br/><br/>My Department has asked Irish Water to contact the person referred to in the question directly.</p></reply>

The Personal Public Services (PPS) Numbers will be used by Irish Water to ensure that each household receives the free allowance it is entitled to, as well as any additional allowance for children in receipt of Child Benefit at that address.

Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy including the establishment of a fully functioning integrated public water utility and the roll-out of the national domestic water metering programme (the estimated cost of the metering programme is &euro;539m excluding VAT). Some &euro;250m in loan finance has been advanced to Irish Water to date by the National Pensions Reserve Fund in order to finance this expenditure. <br/><br/>The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has recently reviewed the Irish Water submission in relation to its costs over the regulatory review period, which runs from 1 October 2014 to the end of 2016, to ensure that only efficient costs are recovered from customers. This will result in an allowed revenue for Irish Water of &euro;2,078million over the period. Irish Water has published its proposed Capital Investment Plan 2014-2016 and this is available online at <br/><br/>Irish Water will fund its activities with revenue from a number of sources including domestic and non-domestic water charges, Government subvention, commercial borrowing and equity investment. Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. The approach to charging was outlined by Irish Water in their Water Charges Plan (WCP) submitted to the CER in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013.  <br/><br/>As part of the CER&rsquo;s recent consultation process on the Irish Water WCP it proposed a range of domestic tariffs which would result in an average annual charge of &euro;238 per household. The amount billed to domestic customers for the year 2015 based on this charging structure would be in the order of &euro;300 million and the amount billed to non-domestic customers would be some &euro;230 million. <br/><br/>The CER is currently reviewing submissions received during the consultation and a final determination on water charges will be made by the CER later this month.  Full details of the CER public consultation are available on .<br/><br/>Irish Water has confirmed to my Department that it has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.

Similarly, I have no function in relation to industrial relations issues such as workers&rsquo; rights and conditions or industrial dispute resolution in the waste or any other sector. </p><p>  Waste collection is the statutory responsibility of local authorities, in this case, Dublin City Council. Under section 33 of the Waste Management Act 1996 (as amended) there is a general duty on a local authority to either itself collect the household waste in its functional area or alternatively to arrange for its collection by third parties. Given the strategic importance of waste management to the welfare of the environment and society in general, my Department wrote to Dublin City Council requesting a written report on the contingency/scenario planning that has been undertaken by the City Council to provide/arrange for the provision of an alternative household waste collection service in the event of an inability of Greyhound Recycling and Recovery to maintain collection services to their customers in the City Council area.   </p><p>  The City Council has confirmed that it is satisfied that there is a sufficient number of other permitted operators in a position to provide a household waste collection service to households in the City Council area at a competitive price. The Council also believes that the costs of the City Council directly providing an alternative service would be unreasonably high.   </p><p>  My role as Minister is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which the relevant environmental regulatory bodies, such as local authorities and the EPA, operate. In that context, I intend to introduce legislation early next year , to come into effect in July 2015, to significantly reform the regulation of household waste collection, including introducing measures to require collectors to operate the pay by weight system across all 3 bins as a permit condition and meet certain minimum standards of customer service (for example, specified frequencies of collection).   It will also become a statutory requirement for all collectors to have customer charters in place. I will be setting out in law what the minimum content of these customer charters will be so that standards of service are improved and are consistent.   </p></reply>

The approach involves the participation of rural communities in their own development and formulates this participation through the medium of Local Development Strategies designed and implemented at a local level.  While the LEADER methodology originates in rural development, Ireland also uses community led approaches to deliver development interventions in an urban context.<br/><br/>The proposals outlined in <i>Putting People First</i><i>- Action Programme for Effective Local Government</i>aim to ensure that local government is at the heart of local and community development.  This necessitates some change to the local development landscape that will ensure that the impact of all funding available to support local and community development is maximised.  The establishment of Local and Community Development Committees in each local authority area and the development of a Local Economic and Community planning process will ensure that all local development funding in a given area will be coordinated and directed to the areas of greatest need.<br/><br/>A community led local development approach will provide the framework for these changes.  The Local and Community Development Committee will be made up of the socio-economic interests of each area and the planning process will involve full consultation with communities on the ground.  In this context the LEADER model of Community Led Local Development will be largely maintained and I expect the development companies that have delivered the LEADER elements of the Rural Development and other programmes for both my own and other Government Departments will be key partners in that process.<br/><br/>The new systems for the delivery of local development interventions will be community centred and community led, epitomising the ethos of the LEADER approach.  I am confident that they will be effective and efficient, will facilitate the participation of all members of local communities and will strengthen local government's position as the driver of local and community development for the future.  </p></reply>

It should not be assumed that these leaks are caused by Irish Water's contractors.  The meter installation programme gives Irish Water a strong starting point for mains rehabilitation by enabling the discovery of pre-existing leaks and helping to target more effective investment in leak repair.</p><p>  My Department has been informed by Irish Water that the individual in question contacted Irish Water following the metering installation works in his area and reported a leak on his property.   This complaint was passed to the relevant regional contractor GMC Sierra, who investigated the complaint and has provided a report to Irish Water.  During the meter installation works in the area concerned, the contractor was unable to locate the outside stop valve for the property in question and as a result no meter box or water meter was installed on this property's water supply pipe.  Upon investigating this complaint, the contractor determined that the visible leak on the private property must be due to a separate leak on the property's own water supply connection. </p><p>  Under the Water Services Act 2007, the homeowner is responsible for the water supply pipe on their premises.  The Government has agreed to provide funding to Irish Water for a free first fix scheme.  Under this scheme, Irish Water intends to assist customers in this situation by identifying and repairing leaks on their property (external to the dwelling) and otherwise offering advice on approaches to resolving leaks and saving water in the premises.  The details of this scheme are currently being developed and it is expected it will be available to Irish Water customers from early 2015.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge of &euro;200 per annum, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence. </p><p>  My Department undertook an initial media campaign when the NPPR charge was first introduced in 2009.  This campaign included press advertisements in the Irish Independent, Irish Times, Irish Examiner and The Star in July 2009 along with advertisements on RT&Eacute; Radio in September and October 2009.  Nationwide advertising has also taken place in each year since the introduction of the charge under the auspices of the local authorities to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In addition, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.  As this is a matter for the local authorities themselves, detailed information of such advertising is not available in my Department.   </p><p>  The NPPR Project Board, in conjunction with individual local authorities, undertook a media campaign this year aimed at reminding non-compliant owners that additional late payment penalties applied after 31 August 2014.  The extensive radio and print media campaign reminded non-compliant owners of their obligations to come forward to regularise their affairs and to take advantage of this once-off grace period.  It is my view that reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that property owners have been aware of the Charge and liability dates.

The current Programme officially ended at the end of 2013 having operated for four years with funding of &euro;281m over that period.  It is being implemented on a transitional basis for 2014 with a budget of &euro;47m pending the roll out of the new Social Inclusion and Community Activation Programme (SICAP) in April 2015.  Some 17 Women's Projects under the remit of the NCCWN currently receive funding of &euro;1.3 million under the LCDP.  In addition, my Department also supports a number of Women's projects under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO).  This funding scheme, which supports national organisations in the community and voluntary sector, aims to provide multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.  A new round of funding under this scheme commenced on 1 July 2014.  The<b></b>National Collective of Community Based Women's Networks was allocated some &euro;160,122 under that scheme for the two year period of 1 July 2014 &ndash; 30 June 2016.<br/><br/>The SICAP is one of my key priorities and its budget for next year will be decided in the 2015 Estimates process.  The Programme's target groups are:<br/><br/>- Children and Families from Disadvantaged Areas<br/><br/>- Lone Parents<br/><br/>- New Communities (including Refugees/Asylum Seekers)<br/><br/>- People living in Disadvantaged Communities<br/><br/>- People with Disabilities<br/><br/>- Roma<br/><br/>- The Unemployed (including those not on the Live Register)<br/><br/>- Travellers<br/><br/>- Young Unemployed People from Disadvantaged areas<br/><br/>In accordance with the Public Spending Code, legal advice, good practice internationally and in order to ensure the optimum delivery of the services to clients, the Programme is subject to a public procurement process, which is currently underway.  Stage one (Expression of Interest) has been completed.  Stage two (Invitation to Tender) will get underway in October and will involve the successful applicants from Stage one being invited to apply to one or more Local Community Development Committees, to deliver the programme in local authority areas.  Contracts for SICAP will be determined following the outcome of the procurement process.<br/><br/>The public procurement process is a competitive process that is open to Local Development Companies, other not-for-profit community groups, commercial firms and national organisations that can provide the services to be tendered for to deliver the new Programme.  In Stage one, joint applications were encouraged and organisations of varying sizes (for example smaller organisations working in consortia with larger organisations) were invited to submit joint applications. <br/><br/>When the outcome of Stage one is made known, I will be considering the implications of that for the relevant SICAP target groups.</p></reply>

This will reduce the administrative burden for over 500 local community and voluntary groups registered under the Scheme and it will enable the groups to focus their efforts on supporting vulnerable older people in our communities.</p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Waste Management Act 1996, the preparation and adoption of a waste management plan, including in respect of infrastructure provision, is the statutory responsibility of the local authority or authorities concerned.  Under section 60(3) of the Act, as Minister, I am precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it.<br/><br/>In view of the DWTE project's status as a prospective public private partnership, my Department, together with the National Development Finance Agency, has been represented on the project board chaired by Dublin City Council and attended the most recent meeting of the board in August.  In terms of other engagement in recent weeks, my Department received a number of updates from the City Council, particularly in relation to the process by which the Chief Executives were to seek the views of the elected members of the four authorities.<br/><br/>Regional waste management planning remains a key feature of the Government's waste policy, <i>A Resource Opportunity</i>, published in 2012.  Among the measures which will play an important role in the effective and efficient delivery of waste management services is the rationalisation in the number of waste management planning regions from ten to three.  The three new Waste Management Planning Regions have been designated and tasked with developing new plans for the three Waste Management Planning Regions, for adoption next year.<br/><br/>In relation to the alignment between my objectives as Minister and the requirements of the facility in question, my role is to provide a comprehensive legislative and waste policy framework through which local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency operate.  National waste policy &ndash; including the proposed reforms that I recently announced in relation to the collection of household waste &ndash; is, in line with EU policy and legislation, based on application of the waste hierarchy, rather than on any one individual project.</p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The NPPR Charge is based on self-declaration and therefore the onus is on the property owner themselves to register their property and make the payment.  The 2009 Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  Part 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 deals with the collection of undischarged liabilities relating to the NPPR Charge.  There are no plans to revise this legislation.<br/><br/>A residential property not in use by an owner as his or her sole or main residence is liable for the Charge.  This may not necessarily be a second home; a person may have vacated a property and be living in rented accommodation elsewhere for work or other reasons, for example, and, in such a case, the property that the owner is no longer living in is liable for the Charge, even if it is the only residential property that person owns.  It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable. <br/><br/>Under section 77 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 my Department issued guidance to local authorities concerning matters relating to arrears of the NPPR Charge and late payment fees to ensure that a consistent national approach is adopted.  The guidelines, which are available at , <br/><br/>encourage local authorities to take a proactive approach to ensure that any outstanding NPPR liabilities are discharged in the most equitable, efficient and economically beneficial manner and include guidance on dealing with issues of financial hardship.  It is expected, in the majority of cases, that local authorities will collect the full NPPR Charge liability from owners.  In some cases, this may be by means of arrangement by instalment.  The Act places the Charge under the care and management of the local authorities and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.  All non-compliant owners should log on to or, alternatively, contact their local authority to discuss any matters they wish to clarify and to make their outstanding payments.</p></reply>

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent).  Both schemes are designed to assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are now unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future. <br/><br/>On foot of the recommendations of the Keane Report on mortgage arrears the Government launched the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme on a pilot basis in February 2012 and extended it nationally in June 2012.  The scheme is currently in operation and continues to accept applications from lending institutions. <br/><br/>To be eligible for the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme a household must have had their mortgage position deemed unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process, agree to the voluntary surrender of their home, be in negative equity, and be deemed eligible for social housing in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  There is a cap on the value of the property which applies but the location of the property is not a criterion for inclusion or exclusion to the scheme.  Notwithstanding this, approved housing bodies must treat each case on its merits and issues such as the operational presence of the AHB or the market rent available may impact on its decision. <br/><br/>A total of 2,496 cases have been submitted to date.  31 of these cases are currently being progressed under revised procedures introduced to improve the process.  Of the other 2,465 cases submitted, 1,003 were ineligible or terminated during the process, of which 258 cases were not progressed because the household in question was deemed to be over or under accommodated.  Agreement on the sale could not be agreed on a further 50 cases.  Of the remaining cases submitted, 48 have been completed, 1,221 are currently with the lenders who are seeking the consent of borrowers to share information and for the carrying out of an independent valuation, and the remaining 143 are actively being progressed.  The following table breaks down the 2,465 submissions made by local authority and by status. <table><tr><th>Authority </th><th>Unsuccessful </th><th>Sale Not Agreed </th><th>Borrower consent <br /><br />required </th><th>Active </th><th>Completed </th><th>Grand Total </th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>19 </td><td>1 </td><td>21 </td><td>4 </td><td>2 </td><td>47 </td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>40 </td><td></td><td>18 </td><td>6 </td><td></td><td>64 </td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>20 </td><td>2 </td><td>22 </td><td>4 </td><td>1 </td><td>49 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork City </td><td>10 </td><td>2 </td><td>24 </td><td>2 </td><td>3 </td><td>41 </td></tr><tr><td>Cork County </td><td>69 </td><td>1 </td><td>55 </td><td>3 </td><td>2 </td><td>130 </td></tr><tr><td>DCC </td><td>74 </td><td>5 </td><td>121 </td><td>25 </td><td>7 </td><td>232 </td></tr><tr><td>DLR </td><td>9 </td><td>2 </td><td>7 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>19 </td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>27 </td><td></td><td>16 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td>43 </td></tr><tr><td>Fingal </td><td>57 </td><td>3 </td><td>97 </td><td>17 </td><td>2 </td><td>176 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City </td><td>2 </td><td></td><td>9 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td>11 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County </td><td>41 </td><td>2 </td><td>17 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>62 </td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>19 </td><td>2 </td><td>18 </td><td>3 </td><td></td><td>42 </td></tr><tr><td>Kildare </td><td>36 </td><td>2 </td><td>104 </td><td>5 </td><td>5 </td><td>152 </td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny </td><td>24 </td><td>2 </td><td>26 </td><td>4 </td><td>2 </td><td>58 </td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>28 </td><td>2 </td><td>33 </td><td>3 </td><td></td><td>66 </td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>4 </td><td></td><td>8 </td><td>0 </td><td>1 </td><td>13 </td></tr><tr><td>Limerick </td><td>51 </td><td>1 </td><td>41 </td><td>5 </td><td>3 </td><td>101 </td></tr><tr><td>Longford </td><td>15 </td><td></td><td>8 </td><td>3 </td><td></td><td>26 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>13 </td><td>1 </td><td>22 </td><td>1 </td><td></td><td>37 </td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>29 </td><td>3 </td><td>45 </td><td>15 </td><td>3 </td><td>95 </td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>18 </td><td></td><td>21 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td>39 </td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>81 </td><td>7 </td><td>116 </td><td>5 </td><td>4 </td><td>213 </td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>15 </td><td></td><td>16 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td>31 </td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>25 </td><td></td><td>47 </td><td>5 </td><td></td><td>77 </td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon </td><td>22 </td><td></td><td>6 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td>28 </td></tr><tr><td>SDCC </td><td>58 </td><td>4 </td><td>96 </td><td>9 </td><td>4 </td><td>171 </td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>14 </td><td></td><td>4 </td><td>0 </td><td></td><td>18 </td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>60 </td><td>2 </td><td>48 </td><td>4 </td><td>2 </td><td>116 </td></tr><tr><td>Waterford </td><td>25 </td><td>2 </td><td>43 </td><td>8 </td><td>3 </td><td>81 </td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>27 </td><td>1 </td><td>27 </td><td>5 </td><td>1 </td><td>61 </td></tr><tr><td>Wexford </td><td>46 </td><td>2 </td><td>44 </td><td>2 </td><td></td><td>94 </td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td>25 </td><td>1 </td><td>41 </td><td>4 </td><td>1 </td><td>72 </td></tr><tr><td>Overall </td><td>1,003 </td><td>50 </td><td>1,221 </td><td>143 </td><td>48 </td><td>2,465 </td></tr></table><br/><br/>The following table provides a breakdown by Approved Housing Body.<table><tr><th>Approved Housing Body </th><th>Unsuccessful </th><th>Sale Not Agreed </th><th>Borrower consent Required </th><th>Active </th><th>Completed </th><th>Grand Total </th></tr><tr><td>Carbery HA </td><td>7 </td><td></td><td>13 </td><td>1 </td><td></td><td>21 </td></tr><tr><td>Cl&uacute;id </td><td>153 </td><td>38 </td><td>296 </td><td>78 </td><td>38 </td><td>603 </td></tr><tr><td>North and East Housing Association </td><td>2 </td><td></td><td></td><td>2 </td><td></td><td>4 </td></tr><tr><td>Novas </td><td>12 </td><td></td><td>33 </td><td>1 </td><td></td><td>46 </td></tr><tr><td>Oaklee </td><td>97 </td><td>6 </td><td>199 </td><td>50 </td><td>7 </td><td>359 </td></tr><tr><td>Respond! </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>21 </td><td>3 </td><td></td><td>27 </td></tr><tr><td>Tintean </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td>1 </td><td></td><td></td><td>3 </td></tr><tr><td>Tuath </td><td>19 </td><td>2 </td><td>1 </td><td>8 </td><td>3 </td><td>33 </td></tr><tr><td>AHB Not Assigned Yet </td><td>710 </td><td>2 </td><td>657 </td><td></td><td></td><td>1,369 </td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total </td><td>1,003 </td><td>50 </td><td>1,221 </td><td>143 </td><td>48 </td><td>2,465 </td></tr></table><br/><br/>The LA mortgage&ndash;to&ndash;rent scheme was piloted in two local authority areas in 2013, Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council, and was implemented nationally in February 2014.

Eligibility for the LA -mortgage-to-rent scheme is broadly similar to eligibility under AHB-mortgage-to-rent; however, engagement with the Mortgage Loan and Arrears Support Unit of the local authority is required as an alternative to the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process for private lending institutions.</p></reply>

Under the Directive, Member States are required to report annually to the European Commission the results of a sampling programme for both petrol and diesel, including any breaches of the environmental specifications of the fuel. The Commission collates the data received and publishes annual reports, which can be vie wed on the Commission&rsquo;s website at the following weblink<br/><br/><br/><br/>For Ireland&rsquo;s national sampling programme, a total of 100 petrol samples and 100 diesel samples were collected from service stations in 2013 by Inspection Services Limited on behalf of my Department. The samples were analysed by the State Laboratory. The results found that the samples were broadly compliant with the Directive, with just 16 petrol samples and 3 diesel samples found to exceed environmental specifications.

This includes responsibility for implementing the restructuring of the Programme announced on 9th July 2013. The purpose of the restructuring is to protect the future provision of rural transport services through a more efficient and effective delivery structure that maximises integration with other State funded transport services and by making the Programme a sustainable part of the public transport system. This is in line with the recommendations of a Value for Money and Policy Review of the RTP, published in 2012.</p><p>  The restructuring involves the establishment of 18 Transport Co-ordination Units (TCUs) in place of the existing 35 RTP groups currently delivering the service. The new TCUs will be housed in local authorities where this is practical, with the aim of reducing administrative costs and forging the links in local service provision.</p><p>  The NTA has advised that 3 TCUs have signed Grant Agreements with the Authority under the new arrangements and that the remaining TCUs are expected to be in place this autumn. </p></reply>

In this context, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of the Taoiseach, is engaged in discussions with various stakeholders, including the EU institutions, in order to formulate specific proposals on the optimal approach to the derogation. This matter will be brought forward for consideration by Government in due course.   Furthermore, as part of the Government's strategy to ensure that a sufficient number of qualified personnel are available to meet the needs arising from the recognition of Irish as an official and working language of the EU, my Department continues to provide substantial funding for a range of specialised third-level courses and for the development of Irish language terminology for the EU terminology database, InterActive Terminology for Europe (IATE).</p></reply>

Officials from my Department have also given direct advice in 2014 to persons acting for the owner of the particular thatched structure referred to by the Deputy.<br/><br/>A number of State financial supports provide for the conservation and preservation of heritage structures in general. For example, in 2014 my Department made available a fund of &euro;5 million under the Built Heritage and Jobs Leverage Scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2012.  This scheme, which is operated and administered by the local authorities, is supporting works to approximately 600 protected structures nationally, including works to over 50 thatched structures.I understand that the owner of the thatched structure in question has made an application to Cork County Council in this regard, which the Council is currently assessing.<br/><br/>My Department does not administer a funding scheme specifically for thatched structures.  However, the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government administers a grant scheme for the renewal or repair of thatched roofs of owner occupied houses.  I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Environment Community and Local Government, that under this grant scheme a grant of &euro;6,350 has been provisionally approved in this case and is now awaiting final inspection by that Department&rsquo;s inspector.  <br/><br/>The Heritage Council, which my Department also funds, administers a heritage management community grants scheme.  Whilst I understand that applications have closed for their 2014 scheme, the Council may be able to advise if the structure would be eligible for funding now or in the future.  The Heritage Council&rsquo;s website is .<br/><br/>The level of funding available in 2015 and future years for these schemes will be subject to the normal Budgetary and Estimates processes.  As the Deputy can appreciate, the scope for additional funding for the conservation of the built heritage is constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances and subject to competing priorities within the sector.</p></reply>

As stated in that reply, under the Capital Stimulus Package announced in the Budget, funding of &euro;6m was provided in 2014 in respect of the 1916 Commemorations Programme. A number of flagship capital projects come under the scope of this programme, including Kilmainham Courthouse, the GPO, the Military Pensions Archives and Teach an Phiarsaigh. As part of this programme, an allocation of &euro;0.5m has been provided in my Department's Vote in 2014 to advance the development of a cultural centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh in Ros Muc.    The Deputy will also be aware that in May 2014 the Government announced as part of the Phase 4 Infrastructure Stimulus an allocation of &euro;22m in 2015 for the Commemorations Programme. This funding will help, inter alia, to finance the costs associated with the flagship commemoration projects in 2015, including Teach an Phiarsaigh.</p><p>  The development of a cultural centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh is being progressed by a steering group comprising the various stakeholders, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Galway County Council, the Office of Public Works, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and my own Department. The project has been developed through a collaborative process with all stakeholders with regard to linguistic, social, sustainable and economic considerations. I understand that all the stakeholders have indicated their full support to ensuring that the project is brought to fruition. </p><p>  With regard to the progress made to date, I can confirm that an economic appraisal of the project has been completed. I can also confirm that the procurement of the services of a project management team and design team for the project has been completed and that they have commenced work. </p><p>  In addition to being one of the flagship projects of the Commemorations Programme, I am advised that the project location has been chosen by F&aacute;ilte Ireland to be a key 'discovery point' on the Wild Atlantic Way project. I am also advised that Teach an Phiarsaigh is afforded special recognition in F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Connemara Destination Plan and Connemara Driving Tour and is a key component of its strategy to develop the tourism sector in Connemara. </p></reply>
