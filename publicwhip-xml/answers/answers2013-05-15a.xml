I am fully supportive of the bid to host the Rugby World Cup in Ireland. It is a matter for the IRFU to prepare and submit a bid.  A feasibility study commissioned by the IRFU on the potential for hosting the tournament was recently presented to me by them and the findings of the report are being considered.</p><p>  I am pleased to note that the GAA has given its support for the bid by allowing the inclusion of Croke Park and other GAA grounds in the list of venues that would be used for matches if Ireland was selected as the host country for the tournament.  </p><p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment that event tourism will be prioritised in order to continue to bring major events to Ireland. As well as bringing spectators to our shores, the hosting of sports events can provide a great showcase for Ireland.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland continues to support the holding of sports and other events that can boost tourism and, where appropriate, will provide advice and assistance to the sporting body which is seeking to secure an international event.  I understand that F&aacute;ilte Ireland has engaged with the IRFU in this regard.</p><p>  The bid has also been discussed with the Northern Ireland Minister for Tourism, Arlene Foster MLA, and Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n MLA. They have met with the IRFU and  have also indicated their support for a bid.</p></reply>

In particular, they are subject to external global factors such as fuel costs and currency fluctuations. The steady rise in fuel prices has impacted negatively on the shipping industry. In 2011 alone, oil prices rose sharply with bunker prices spiking by 40% over the course of the year. In 2012 oil prices continued to rise, remaining above $100 per barrel for the second year and exacerbating already challenging conditions for shipping. Currency fluctuations also had a negative impact. In 2012 the euro depreciated against both the US dollar and UK pound by 7.6% and 6.5% respectively. </p><p>  In addition, the shipping industry in EU Member States face the introduction of new lower sulphur limits in marine fuel from January 2015 within designated Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECAs). Although there is no SECA in the seas around Ireland, shipping engaged in voyages to France and other European destinations beyond the Irish sea, will face an increase in the cost of fuel.</p><p>  In relation to the costs imposed on the shipping industry by port companies, as the Deputy will be aware port companies are required to operate in a commercial fashion and in competition with each other. This position is re-enforced in the recently published National Ports Policy. </p><p>  The Competition Authority is currently in the process of carrying out a study of the ports sector in Ireland, as part of which it is reviewing inter and intra-port competition. I expect that the Competition Authority will publish the results of this market study in 2013. I have committed that my Department will deliver a reasoned response to any recommendations made to the Department within six months of publication. </p><p>  All shipping companies servicing routes to and from Ireland are independent commercial companies that are market driven. Many companies have, over recent years, introduced greater efficiencies to reduce their overall operating costs in order to continue to provide services. Despite the difficulties that the industry faces, Ireland offers a diverse range of maritime links to and from the State to facilitate trade and tourism providing vital income streams to the Irish economy. Over 90% of Ireland&rsquo;s trade moves by sea and Ireland is also one of the best served countries in Europe for passenger ferry services with links that are frequent and competitive. </p><p>  There are currently 22 shipping operators providing a mixture of daily to weekly scheduled shipping services from Ireland. This includes 4 companies providing year round scheduled passenger services between Ireland and the UK and France. The Irish Maritime Transport Economist published in April this year by the IMDO is a good source of further information on trade and shipping for those with an interest in this area.</p><p>  Subsidising international shipping services is contrary to EU State Aid and Competition Law, and the principles of free and fair trade.</p></reply>

With regard to the review, an Inter Departmental Working Group was established  last year to carry out a review of the operation of the current Free Travel Scheme.  The purpose of this review is to examine and report on the current operation and future development of the Free Travel scheme. The Group, chaired by the Department of Social Protection as lead Department, also includes representatives from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority (NTA).  The Group has had three meetings and I understand that the work of the Group is expected to conclude by mid-2013.</p><p>  I note that Deputy Dooley's party proposed a reduction of &euro;5million or 7% to this scheme in 2013. This proposal was not taken up, and there was no reduction to this scheme in 2013.</p></reply>

This has the potential to help boost visitor numbers to the island of Ireland and so help support the tourism industry in 2013 and beyond.</p><p>  I am informed that Tourism Ireland is already engaged in a marketing programme to capitalise on the event.  For its part, F&aacute;ilte Ireland is working closely with the local industry in the Border counties to maximise the opportunities presented by the event.</p><p>  It is anticipated that the summit may also bring more immediate benefits for the North West and Border Counties as many of the overseas media and officials accompanying the G8 participants will be accommodated in the border region as well as in Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

Cycling infrastructure and the promotion of cycling are key elements of each of these Programmes. </p><p>  Funding is also being made available for the development of the National Cycle Network with the aim of improving urban, interurban and rural cycling facilities.  Significant investment has already been made in 2012 and 2013 with &euro;7 million allocated to 18 projects across Ireland.  As this phase of the programme will expire at the end of 2013, it is my intention to initiate a new funding call later this year to provide, through a competitive process, a further tranche of funding for the remainder of the years to 2016.</p><p>  My Department also works closely with the National Transport Authority (NTA) which provides funding to local authorities for the development of cycling infrastructure in the regional cities and Greater Dublin Area.  The NTA has published a comprehensive design manual for the provision of cycle routes, particularly in urban areas, and this is available at www.cyclemanual.ie.  Dissemination of best practice and facilitation of appropriate cycle infrastructure design training are also key roles of the Smarter Travel Local Authority Network developed by my Department. </p><p>  In addition to all these initiatives, my Department and the NTA are also committed to expanding the very successful Dublin Bikes scheme and work is well advanced on finalising proposals to introduce similar schemes in regional cites.</p></reply>

The Government's commitment to the A5 project, as outlined at the North South Ministerial Council in November 2011 remains in place. At that NSMC plenary session it was noted that the Irish Government would provide &pound;25 million in 2015 and in 2016 towards the A5 road project.  This is further to the &pound;22 million that the Irish Government has already contributed to the project as part of the planning process.  This brings the Exchequer commitment to &pound;72 million.</p><p>  The Northern Ireland Road Service had planned to start construction on two of the approved sections of the A5 in Autumn last year.  However, following publication of the necessary statutory orders in advance of construction, the Minister for Regional Development's decision to proceed with the A5 was challenged by a group known as the Alternative A5 Alliance.</p><p>  While the Northern High Court rejected the majority of the applicants' grounds of challenge, one was upheld.  The judge found that an appropriate assessment under the Habitats Directive should have been carried out on the scheme.  On that basis at a further hearing on 8 April 2013 the judge confirmed he would quash the Orders relating to the A5 scheme.</p><p>  The project was discussed at the North South Ministerial Council Transport Sectorial on 17 April 2013 and the Minister for Regional Development now plans to undertake the environmental assessment required under the Habitats Directive.  This is a necessary first step to progress the project and it must be allowed to run its course.  Contact between my Department and the Northern Ireland Road Authorities is ongoing under the aegis of the North South Ministerial Council.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority, which is the sanctioning authority for the project, is taking the lead role in providing the detailed information and data required by the EIB.  When I met senior officials from the European Investment Bank recently, I took the opportunity to outline my Department's priorities for investment in Transport Infrastructure in the medium to long term.  We discussed the application for Luas Cross City and a presentation on the project was made to the visitors.  The  EIB officials are very supportive of the Luas link.  I expect the application to have a positive outcome.  Given the constraints in Exchequer funding, I do not have any other major public transport projects I can submit for EIB funding.  The EIB has expressed interest in the DART Underground but due to the cost of this project it can only proceed as a PPP project and with a very significant Exchequer contribution.  I will review this project in advance of the next capital plan.  In relation to roads, the EIB has contributed to the recently agreed PPP for the N11 Arklow - Rathnew and Newlands Cross project.  EIB funding will also be sought for the other three road PPPs announced under the 2012 stimulus package - the N17-N18 Gort to Tuam road, the N25 New Ross bypass and the M11 Gorey to Enniscorthy road.</p></reply>

The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the development of public transport infrastructure in the Greater Dublin Area, including the proposed Luas Cross City line.  This line is a priority project under the Government's five-year capital plan, which is known as the Infrastructure &amp;amp; Capital Investment Programme 2012-2016 under the Medium-Term Exchequer Framework.  In November 2012, following consideration by the Government, I asked the NTA and the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) to proceed with the procurement and contractual arrangements so the enabling works for the project would commence by mid-2013 at the latest.  I understand that work has already commenced on a building condition survey which will establish a baseline record of the condition of properties along the Luas Cross City line.  The procurement process for the advance works, such as Heritage Works, Cellars Investigation and Utility Diversions, is also well advanced.  The award of Heritage and Cellars Investigation contracts is imminent, with work targeted to begin in June 2013.  The tender documents for the Utility Diversions Contracts were also issued recently.  These works are due to start in September or October 2013.</p><p>  A Traffic Forum has been established for the project comprising representatives of the RPA, the NTA, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Dublin City Council and Dublin Bus.  The primary role of the Traffic Forum is to develop traffic management arrangements aimed at minimising the construction impacts of the new Luas line on all road users.  I understand that traffic management plans for the various works elements are progressing well and are being considered at the Traffic Forum meetings.  There will also be ongoing local liaison arrangements as the project proceeds.  I have established a Project Group to address at a strategic level issues which arise during delivery of the project.  The group, which I chair and has met on two occasions, and will enable me to liaise directly with key stakeholders including business representatives and will ensure I am informed of any significant traffic management issues affecting the delivery of the project.  A dedicated Luas Cross City website will be launched shortly.  The estimated cost of the project is &euro;368 million, which includes almost &euro;20 million that has been spent to date.  Funding has been included in my Department's capital allocation to 2016 to cover the cost of commencing the main construction works in 2015 and for pre-construction enabling works in 2013 and 2014.  The project is scheduled for completion in late 2017.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  The Department has allocated a total of &euro;350.462 million for regional and local roads in 2013, a reduction of almost &euro;28 million on the 2012 funding.  Increasingly, regional and local road grant funding to local authorities is being directed towards the maintenance and repair of regional and local roads and low cost safety works.  This will remain the position in the coming years.</p><p>  The Specific Improvement Grants Scheme is being discontinued from 2014 onwards in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work.  In lieu of the Specific Improvement Grant Programme, applications will be sought in mid-2013 for minor bridge repair works (which is a subset of the current Specific Grant Programme) for 2014.  This is in line with focusing moneys on road and bridge maintenance and strengthening.  The grants programme is structured to allow Councils reasonable flexibility in using grants while also ensuring there are clear outputs for the moneys allocated in terms of length of road maintained or rehabilitated.  In addition, I announced that local authorities would be afforded additional flexibility this year by allowing Councils to transfer resources into their discretionary grant.</p><p>  Given the harsh reality of the financial position, the main focus will have to be on the maintenance and repair of roads.  It will be necessary for local authorities to decide how best to manage their road budgets within the funding available.  It is also important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement local authorities in their spending in this area.  The contribution made by local authorities has fallen in recent years both in real and percentage terms.  In 2008, local authorities provided over &euro;405 million in own resources expenditure for works on regional and local roads, representing 40% of the total amount on these roads in 2008 including State grants.  This own resources expenditure has dropped to &euro;137 million in 2012 or 27% of the total expenditure on roads, with the State providing &euro;377 million in 2012 or 73% of the total expenditure last year.  I appreciate that many local authorities are trying to implement savings.  It is important that sufficient priority is given by local authorities to road maintenance in own resources allocation.</p></reply>

As Deputies will be aware, the Ireland West Airport Knock (IWAK) Study Group was established following a meeting of the Airport Board with the Taoiseach, myself, Minister of State Ring and local representatives on 28 January this year to examine how best the future of the airport can be secured and to explore realistic options for growth. The Group was established, under the Chairmanship of Deputy John O'Mahony, whom I would like to thank for agreeing to take on that role.</p><p>  Membership of the Group is comprised of representatives of the Airport Board and management, Mayo County Council, regional Business and Tourism sectors and of the Departments of Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport; Finance, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland.  The Group, while taking account of available funding and State Aid and Competition rules, is examining how the airport can survive and be further developed having regard to the implications for other regional airports.  Two meetings of the Group have taken place on 12 April and 3 May in Knock and Dublin respectively.  Good progress was made at these first two meetings but it is recognised that a substantial body of work needs to be carried out before the Group can complete its report.</p><p>  A Request for Tender for a consultancy study on some elements of the Group's work, which will be funded jointly by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Mayo County Council and the airport, was published on the etenders website  on 8 May.  A specific work programme and timetable for completion of the other aspects of the Group's work has been established and I am expecting a final report in the Autumn.</p><p>  As regards the level of funding provided to IWAK in recent years, under the Regional Airports Programme, &euro;431,907 in operational (Opex) subvention was provided to IWAK in 2011 and &euro;589,644 in 2012.  Applications from regional airports for Opex funding for 2013 will be invited later this year.  Funding for capital works at IWAK under the Capex grant scheme amounted to &euro;233,282 in 2011 and &euro;699,007 in 2012.  Capex funding of &euro;2,039,927, including an additional &euro;650,000 announced last week, has been approved for drawdown at IWAK in 2013, while a further &euro;1,710,993 has been approved for drawdown by IWAK in 2014.</p><p>  In addition, Tourism Ireland is investing in cooperative marketing campaigns to drive inbound tourism on IWAK routes, with expenditure of over &euro;500,000 in 2011 supporting campaigns worth &euro;1m, expenditure of &euro;1,150,000 supporting campaigns worth &euro;1.85m and spend so far this year of &euro;420,000 to support campaigns worth over &euro;800,000.  Opportunities for further campaigns continue to be explored with carriers.</p><p>  Both the Taoiseach and I have also encouraged the exploration of possibilities of cooperation between airports.  In that regard I am aware that the Chairman of Shannon Airport Authority, Rose Hynes has initiated discussions with both IWAK and Kerry Airport on how existing co-operation can be further strengthened.</p></reply>

The State's 25.1% shareholding in Aer Lingus is the only asset within my remit identified for possible sale under the State Assets Disposal Programme.  The Government's decision in February 2012 was to seek to sell the shareholding when market conditions are favourable and on terms and at a price that are acceptable to Government. The Government continues to seek opportunities to dispose of the shareholding. However, the correct circumstances have not arisen to date.</p><p>  In the meantime the Government will continue to manage its shareholding in a responsible manner to protect the State's interests and with the aim of maximising the value of the shareholding. I have no plans to dispose of any other State assets at this time.</p></reply>

Noting this I have referred the Deputy's question to the NTA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p><p>  Under proposals to restructure the RTP which are aimed at strengthening the Programme by ensuring a more efficient delivery structure which will maximise integration with other state transport services and make the Programme a sustainable part of the public transport system, there will be revised contract arrangements.  I am awaiting proposals on a new structure for the delivery of rural transport from the NTA when they have concluded their deliberations and discussions but I am hopeful that I will be in a position to recommend a new structure in the near future which will allow for the maximising of spend on services and the reduction of administration costs.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing on the development of multi-sport all-weather pitches and a pavilion, which will be open to all national governing bodies and also local communities under the management of the sports campus.  The pitches are expected to be completed by September with the pavilion scheduled for completion by the end of the year.  Training facilities for high-performance athletes in equestrian and modern pentathlon sports are expected to be completed by August.</p><p>  Agreements are in place between the National Sports Campus Development Authority (NSCDA) and the FAI, GAA, IRFU and the Irish Hockey Association to develop facilities for each of their sports. It is expected that at least two of these organisations will commence work on their facilities this year.</p><p>  A new Irish Sport HQ has been completed and will be officially opened later this month. The building will accommodate 19 National Governing Bodies of Sport, all of whom will have completed their relocation to the new building by this week.</p><p>  This year is the 10 Anniversary of the opening of the National Aquatic Centre and it is continuing to perform well. Since it opened in 2003 the Centre has recorded over 7 million visits.</p></reply>

Amongst the agenda items for this meeting was Tourism Ireland's Draft Business Plan for 2013.   The Council also discussed major tourism initiatives including The Gathering Ireland 2013 and the Derry - Londonderry UK City of Culture 2013, and noted the major role which Tourism Ireland is playing in the overseas promotion of them. At the meeting, a paper on the Great Britain market was also discussed.</p><p>  The next NSMC meeting in Tourism Sectoral format is scheduled to take place on 26th June in Armagh.  Amongst the anticipated discussion items will be Tourism Ireland's Annual Report for 2012, a review of the 2013 tourism season to date (including major tourism initiatives North and South) and the tourism prospects for the remainder of 2013 and beyond.</p><p>  There is also ongoing cooperation between the tourism agencies and Government Departments north and south in a number of other areas including the selection of suitable tourism projects to benefit from Peace/INTERREG funds and in work to harmonise and share tourism statistics north and south. I look forward to this work continuing and to availing of any other suitable opportunities for north/south cooperation in the tourism sector in the future.</p></reply>

This system will not be fully up and running until September of this year.  In the meantime, the Motor Tax Offices continue to perform front office functions on behalf of the RSA.  During this transition period, applicants can still provide their photos as heretofore.</p><p>  Once the new system is fully operational, there will be a different system for providing photo ID.  The capture of the photograph is included in the fee for the licence, and the SAFE2 ID will be implemented, at which point the only option will be the digital photo taken at the front office network.</p><p>  I understand from the RSA that when they published the Request for Tenders for the front office contract they asked tenderers to put forward a preference for scanning or digital capture of photographs.  All three tenderers opted for digital capture, as it is the most effective, secure and efficient process.  </p><p>  The operation of the tender processes was a matter for the RSA, and I had no involvement in it.  The contractors for the front office, and the back office and card producer, have already been procured.  </p></reply>

As is common across the broader State commercial sector, the State commercial port companies, including D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company, traditionally offered their employees membership of defined benefit pension schemes.  All port companies have now closed their defined benefit schemes to new members and instead new employees are offered membership of defined contribution arrangements.</p><p>  As recognised in the National Pensions Framework, there are &quot;significant problems with the typical current design for funded defined benefit schemes&quot;.  The defined benefit scheme in operation at D&uacute;n Laoghaire Harbour Company shares the problems of these schemes generally.  </p><p>  As reported in the Company's most recently published accounts for 2011 the scheme was underfunded.

It should be noted that the number of core tourism visits grew strongly with holiday trips up by 3.8% and business trips up by 7.7% compared to 2011.  While overall bednights fell in 2012, this was primarily due to a fall of nearly 10% in numbers staying with friends or relatives.  The number of overseas hotel bednights, the most valuable in terms of revenue and jobs, actually grew by 13% in 2012.</p><p>  I am pleased that the positive trend has continued into 2013 suggesting that the Gathering Ireland 2013 is having a real impact.  The most recent figures from the CSO show very strong growth of 7.4% for the first quarter of 2013 compared to 2012, an increase of over 86,000 extra trips.  All of our main overseas markets have shown growth in the first quarter with overseas visits from Mainland Europe up 13%, visits from Great Britain up 1.4%, visits from North America up 16.7%, while visits from the rest of the world grew by 5.4%.</p><p>  The overall target  for the year of The Gathering was to increase the number of overseas visits by 325,000.  The figures for the first quarter suggest that we are well on target to achieve and even exceed this as the increase to date is over 25% of the total increase targeted.  The overall sentiment for travel to Ireland is good  with particularly encouraging signs for visit numbers from Mainland Europe and the USA, supported by significant growth in transatlantic air access for the peak summer period.  Tourism Ireland will continue to roll-out a major consumer marketing campaign to promote Ireland and &quot;The Gathering Ireland 2013&quot; in all our key markets and ensure our targets will be achieved.   </p></reply>

The Road Safety Authority is responsible for the overall implementation of the Strategy and must report to me annually on progress on its implementation.</p><p>  In addition, the Road Traffic Bill 2013, currently being drafted, contains a number of measures aimed at improving driver behaviour on our roads.  The Bill will provide for additional Graduated Driver Licensing measures, the testing of incapacitated drivers following a road traffic collisions where death or injury has been caused, changes to the penalty points regime and intoxication impairment testing for drivers, aimed primarily at drug driving. I hope to publish the Bill in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritization of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.</p><p>  This section of road was recently downgraded from national road status (previously the N4) to regional road status &ndash; R148.</p><p>  In July last year, applications were invited  for consideration for funding under the Specific Improvement Grant Scheme.  Local authorities were asked to ensure that their total cost of applications did not exceed their 2012 grant allocation.  In South Dublin County Council&rsquo;s case this would allow the Council to apply for funding of &euro;800,000 under this grant category.  The R148 project was not among the priority projects submitted by the Council within the expenditure limit allowed.</p><p>  South Dublin County Council may fund this project from its Discretionary Grant.  The Council has been allocated &euro;736,775 under this grant category in 2013.  I also wrote to local authorities earlier this year offering them more flexibility in their regional and local road grants.  Councils have the opportunity to use up to 30% of their Restoration Improvement Grant and reallocate it to their Discretionary Grant.  In South Dublin County Council&rsquo;s case this will amount to &euro;556,641 should they wish to avail of this flexibility which would bring the total Discretionary Grant available to the Council to &euro;1,293,416.  I understand the estimated cost of these works are approximately &euro;300,000.</p><p>  It is open to South Dublin Council to apply to transfer some of its Specific Grant funding for 2013 to this project or alternatively to fund this project from its Discretionary Grant or own resources.</p></reply>

In this regard, I intend to publish a consultation document this summer to seek the views of all interested stakeholders and consumers.</p><p>  Following the review, involving a period of analysis and consultation, I plan to issue a specific, overarching tourism policy statement to provide the necessary direction to support a competitive and sustainable tourism industry and give clear direction to the tourism agencies for carrying out their specific operational programmes.</p><p>  The policy statement will take account of the many factors likely to impact on Irish tourism.  These will include expected developments in international economic and trading conditions and growth prospects for international passenger transportation and global tourism.  The new tourism policy will also take account of current and medium-term prospects for the national economy.  In the context of limited resources, the targeting of financial support only at the highest priorities may require difficult choices.</p><p>  I want to ensure that the tourism policy is robust, well-founded and workable and has the broad support of key stakeholders, including the Tourism industry.  This will ensure that it provides the best framework to support and enhance the competitiveness and strength of the Irish tourist industry into the future.  To this end, in the review of tourism policy I want to secure the views of stakeholders both inside and outside the tourism industry, in Government and elsewhere.  The consultation document that I will publish this summer will facilitate all relevant parties in engaging meaningfully with the review.  I believe that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, which covers tourism, could also have an important role in the consultation process.  I would also welcome any contribution from the Deputy or their party to the consultation process as well.</p><p>  The submissions received in response to our consultation exercise will inform my final statement of tourism policy.  This will then provide a robust foundation for the subsequent development of a broader tourism strategy and action plan.</p></reply>

While the harmonisation of speed limits with Northern Ireland would obviously be desirable there are significant complications to be addressed to arrive at this position, mainly the fact that speed limits in the North are set in imperial measurement units, while we use the metric system of measurement. </p></reply>

This document outlines a roadmap for the sector's future development.  With regard to future investment, there is no Exchequer funding available for port infrastructure development.  Rather, as is stated in the National Ports Policy, the individual port companies must fund development proposals themselves without recourse to the Exchequer.  This is settled Government policy  and no Exchequer funding has been provided to the port companies since the conclusion of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 funding programme.  No budget line exists for such funding and were it decided to provide such funding, it would give rise to significant competition and state aid concerns.

No budget line exists for such funding and were it decided to provide such funding, it would give rise to significant competition and state aid concerns.    </p><p>  The new Policy is clear that the response to future national port capacity requirements should be led by the three Ports of National Significance (Tier 1) - Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes port companies, when, where and as required.  There is also a role for the two Ports of National Significance (Tier 2) - Port of Waterford Company and Rosslare Europort to develop additional capacity to aid competitive conditions, particularly within the unitised sectors.</p><p>  While Exchequer funding is not available there are of course a variety of commercial funding options open to the companies, notwithstanding the current difficulties in the financing markets. National Ports Policy encourages greater private sector involvement and investment in our key Ports of National Significance and there may be possibilities arising through, for example, the use of concession type arrangements or other public-private partnership arrangements.  In addition I raised the possibility of investing in our ports with officials from the European Investment Bank on their recent visit.  Furthermore I was happy to endorse funding applications made by Dublin, Cork and Shannon Foynes port companies under the EU TEN-T programme earlier this year. </p><p>  In relation to the Ports of Regional Significance, they will continue to develop in line with regional requirements.  Those Ports of Regional Significance that are currently under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will transfer to Local Authority control over the coming years.  The future investment in those ports shall be a matter for the Local Authorities concerned.     </p></reply>

Our Departments are working together with Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) to bring forward proposals for an Enhanced Safety Equipment and Training Scheme for Fishermen.  Options on grant-aid of safety equipment, such as Electronic Position Indicating Radio Beacons, Personal Locator Beacons, are being assessed. Stronger enforcement of safety regulations and more comprehensive safety training requirements in this scheme will deliver a significant positive change in relation to safety in the fishing sector.</p><p>  My Department is currently considering the need for a cross - Governmental strategy on maritime safety and how such a strategy could be progressed in an integrated way for the sector.  I expect to complete this consideration shortly and on foot of which will present proposals to Government.  The focus of any strategy will be on the development of a culture of safety amongst seafarers and the crucial role of regulation and enforcement, particularly in relation to vessel inspection and certification and the certification and training of seafarers.</p></reply>

The overall target is to attract at least 325,000 extra overseas visits to Ireland in 2013.  If this target is achieved, it will generate an additional &euro;170 million in revenue this year, based on historic spending patterns.  Recent figures from the CSO show visit numbers for the first quarter of 2013 up over 86,000 compared to the corresponding period of 2012.  This represents an encouraging start to 2013.</p><p>  In terms of resources, the 2013 Estimates allocations to F&aacute;ilte Ireland include a special provision of &euro;7 million which was specifically provided for The Gathering.  This amount is to be used exclusively to fund the promotion, development and legacy of the event and complements support for the initiative from the tourism agencies' mainstream activities and from national and local partners.</p><p>  The general response from the public and tourism stakeholders has been overwhelmingly positive.  There are now over 3,500 individual gatherings confirmed on the Gathering website.  These include clan gatherings, festivals, special sporting events and concerts taking place all across the country throughout the year.  Along with well-established events and festivals, we are also supporting a specially targeted set of events for the Gathering, such as the very successful New Year's Eve Event in Dublin, while over 6,000 overseas visitors took part in the People's Parade in Dublin during the St. Patrick's day festivities.</p><p>  Obviously the ambitious targets for overseas visits and associated revenue can only be achieved if people in our main source tourism markets are aware of the initiative.  Tourism Ireland continues to mount a major consumer campaign to promote The Gathering to the people across the world that feel linked by family, friends or otherwise with Ireland.  The agency is undertaking cooperative activity with the major airlines and ferry operators to highlight the value fares that are on offer.  My colleague, Minister Michael Ring recently launched a brand new app for iPhones and android devices which has been specifically designed for The Gathering Ireland 2013.  The &quot;Gathering Gestures&quot;  app which is free to download has been created by Tourism Ireland and offers a variety of offers to ensure our overseas visitors get even more from their holiday here.</p><p>  While progress to date has been encouraging, as I have previously stated, all tourism stakeholders must continue to work hard to ensure that the full potential of the Gathering is realised.</p></reply>

However, the Act was not commenced and the body was not subsequently put in place.</p><p>  Following detailed consideration of the matter it is now intended that the measures outlined in the Adventure Activities Standards Authority Act, 2001 do not represent the most suitable approach to deal with this issue, and it is proposed that this legislation will be repealed, and this matter be addressed by incorporating provisions in the forthcoming Sports Ireland Bill. The Sports Ireland Bill will merge the Irish Sports Council and the National Sports Campus Development Authority and it is proposed that the new body, Sports Ireland will be  required to maintain a register of all adventure centres. The legislation will make it an offence to operate as an adventure centre if not on the register and allow Sports Ireland to set standards and charges for inclusion on the register.</p><p>  The Heads of the Sports Ireland Bill are currently receiving consideration within my Department.  It is hoped to bring these Heads to Government in the next while, and once the Heads of the Bill have been approved by Government, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications will be invited to consider the matter before the drafting of the Bill itself begins.</p></reply>

However, I believe that the report would have more accurately reflected the Government&rsquo;s extensive assistance to emigrants had the Council sought the views of the Irish Abroad Unit of my Department during their research.  Today, our Diaspora engagement policy has two key strands, namely the Emigrant Support Programme (ESP) and the Global Irish Network.</p><p>  The Emigrant Support Programme provides direct assistance to Irish emigrants, both long-standing and new.  Since 2004, Irish groups ranging from those providing front line services to those most at need including the elderly, isolated, vulnerable and new arrivals to those working in the culture and heritage space have received grants of over &euro;100 million under the Programme. At present, we work with almost 200 Irish community organisations in over 20 countries and despite the economic situation, I ensured the ESP budget for 2013 - &euro;11.6 million - remained at the same level as in 2012. </p><p>  The programme provides extensive funding to organisations that act as first port of call for new emigrants, including the GAA, the London Irish Centre, the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre in Toronto and several similar groups in Australia. We also support a wide range of business and graduate networks around the world.</p><p>  Among the Irish based organisations who receive ESP funding is Crosscare Migrant Project which offers pre-departure services to Irish citizens considering emigration. Crosscare also provide training to mainstream service providers on emigration and returners&rsquo; issues and work in conjunction with Irish welfare organisations abroad (many also funded by ESP) and statutory and voluntary service providers in Ireland including the probation service, Salvation Army and Safe Home.</p><p>  Officials from my Department have been in contact with the National Youth Council of Ireland this week to discuss some of the findings and recommendations from their report with a view to seeing if there are areas the NYCI and the Department might be able to cooperate on in future. </p><p>The second strand of our diaspora engagement programme is our partnership with the Global Irish Network, a group of over 300 of the most influential Irish connected business figures drawn from almost 40 countries, which provide invaluable advice, facilitation and practical assistance to the Government and Irish companies.  The development of the Global Irish Network has transformed the strategic relationship between Ireland and its Diaspora and I look forward to working with them again at the 3rd Global Irish Economic Forum that will take place in Dublin Castle in October.</p></reply>

The three main components of the Department&rsquo;s system of foreign services allowances are as follows.  The three main components of the Department&rsquo;s system of foreign services allowances are as follows.</p><p>Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is designed to defray costs associated with living in cities where the cost of living is higher than in Dublin, based on data provided by an independent external consultancy.  Because COLA is linked to salary and notional net take-home pay it has been reduced in recent years in line with salary reductions in the civil service and with increases in income taxes.</p><p>Local Post Allowance (LPA) provides assistance towards the additional indirect costs arising from the representational role of officers.  This allowance, which varies according to marital status and grade, is payable at all locations abroad.  Officers serving in designated &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; posts may also be entitled to a hardship allowance as part of their LPA.  Where payable, this hardship element takes account of factors such as personal security and political tension, health, environmental factors, climate and isolation.</p><p>Children&rsquo;s Foreign Allowance (CFA) compensates officers for additional costs incurred with regard to their children aged under 18, or under 21 and in full time education.</p><p>The table sets out details of the amounts paid under each heading in 2012.  As each element is calculated for each individual officer based on location, grade and family circumstances, and paid with salary, the question of vouching does not arise.</p><p>The two other allowances listed in the table below (Foreign Allowance and Displacement Allowance) are part of previous systems of Foreign Service Allowances which have now been replaced for almost all officers by the system comprising COLA, LPA and CFA as described above.</p><p><table><tr><th>Name of Allowance</th><th>Amount paid in 2012 </th></tr><tr><td>Cost of Living Allowance</td><td>&euro;2,367,275.10</td></tr><tr><td>Local Post Allowance</td><td>&euro;5,547,143.84</td></tr><tr><td>Children's Foreign Allowance</td><td>&euro;744,756.20</td></tr><tr><td>Displacement Allowance</td><td>&euro;17,576.05</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign Allowance</td><td>&euro;33,197.74</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This parade, which was organised by disparate strands of anti-Agreement republicanism, involved very young children who were pictured parading in paramilitary style clothing including black gloves, beret and black sunglasses.  Regrettably, this is not an isolated example of terrorist supporting organisations and groups attempting to draw young persons back into a tradition of violence and in conflict with the forces of law and order.  To perpetuate a cycle of violence and the use of violence for political ends is to perpetrate an abuse of children.  Ireland has long urged and endorsed the protection of children in conflict and post conflict situations.  We have committed ourselves in the Paris Declaration of 2007 to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups as a cornerstone of our foreign policy.  This deplorable incident reminds us that it is essential, particularly during this decade of centenaries, that historical events in Ireland are commemorated responsibly in a way which secures peace and advances reconciliation despite the legacy of violence which is an inescapable part of our history.</p></reply>

There is a strong, shared resolve to take all necessary actions within the law to bear down on such groups.  Combating their activities has always been and remains a priority for the Government and the Garda authorities.  In this regard, the Garda authorities continue to work closely with their PSNI counterparts in combating the violence and criminal activities of these groups and in seeking to improve community safety for everybody on this island.  Threats of the type to which the Deputy refers, against elected public representatives, are to be deplored not only because they threaten the safety of an individual but also because they are an attack on democracy and free speech, which are the hallmarks of a civilised society.</p></reply>

The Association will provide a forum for regular and formal discussions between Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas on issues of mutual interest and concern, as envisaged in the Agreements. The Association will meet twice yearly on a rotational basis.

Some of the contentious issues around parades, flags and identities have at their heart rights issues and a Bill of Rights is the key to dissolving the obstacles to progress on these issues.  I would also encourage all the political parties on the island of Ireland to give serious consideration to the advice of the Joint Committee of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and the Irish Human Rights Commission on an all-Ireland Charter of Rights.</p><p>  Recent events have recalled and positive role that civil society continues to play in Northern Ireland and points to the valuable role that could be played by the Civic Forum envisaged by the Agreement and I will continue to encourage it&rsquo;s development.</p></reply>

These indicators range from measuring Irish input at the pre-legislative stage of EU policy formation, European Parliament and Oireachtas engagement, to the stage of final decision-making at the Council of the European Union.  This year's report also includes a chapter on the Stability Treaty Referendum.  I note a number of welcome developments over the past year.  There was a significant increase in Ministerial attendance at Council meetings and in 2012 average Irish ministerial attendance at Council stood at 97%.  There has been a large increase also in the number of pre-Council briefings of Oireachtas Committees.  The Joint Oireachtas Committee on European Union Affairs met a total of 36 times during 2012.  Inevitably, a report of this nature places a particular focus on recording quantifiable outputs but I hope these will inform a rigorous and qualitative assessment of Ireland's engagement with the European Union and to identify areas for improvement.  I see the value of this report not just in the statistical information provided but more generally in contributing to better public understanding and oversight of EU matters.</p></reply>

The EU Foreign Affairs Council has repeatedly called on all parties in Mali to abide by international human rights and humanitarian law standards.  This message is reinforced when meeting with members of the Malian Government in international fora, including at the Donor Conference on Mali which is taking place in Brussels today.  The Council has also emphasised the importance of progress on the political track and the implementation of the transition roadmap which has been agreed by the Malian Government and Parliament.  Especially important will be the holding of free and fair elections in the coming months and implementation of a meaningful national dialogue and reconciliation process.  EU Foreign Ministers have also welcomed the announcement by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court of the opening of an investigation into the situation in Mali.  Ireland engages actively in discussions on Mali at the United Nations.  In this context, we have welcomed the report in February by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which outlined evidence of serious human rights violations by both the Malian military and by militant groups in the north of the country.  The report also highlighted issues which must be addressed in the response to the current crisis in Mali if lasting peace and stability is to be achieved, including, notably, the serious underlying and long-neglected ethnic tensions in the country.</p><p>  At the 22nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, in March 2013, the Council adopted by consensus a resolution on assistance to the Republic of Mali in the field of human rights.  The resolution was cosponsored by Ireland.  It established a mandate for an independent expert on the situation of human rights in Mali, with a view to assisting the Government of Mali in its efforts to promote and protect human rights, and to act upon the recommendations set forth in resolutions of the Human Rights Council.  The Council repeated its call for an immediate halt to all human rights violations and acts of violence and for strict respect of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It also called upon all forces and armed groups present within the territory to ensure that international human rights law and international humanitarian law are strictly respected.  On 22 January 2013, Mali was reviewed under the Universal Periodic Review mechanism of the Human Rights Council.  During this review, Ireland recommended that Mali adopt and implement measures to ensure that international human rights standards are observed by the Malian Armed Forces, in particular the absolute ban on torture and ill-treatment and to ensure that all reports of torture and other ill-treatment are investigated effectively with those responsible being brought to justice.  Ireland also recommended that Mali take all feasible measures to protect children from recruitment by state-allied and non-state armed groups, including contributing information, analysis and recommendations to the UN and other stakeholders to support and strengthen their efforts to ensure that international standards are upheld.</p><p>  Recognising the need for human rights training for the Malian army, Ireland is contributing six trainers and two HQ personnel to the EU Training Mission which is working to support strengthening and reform of the Malian army.  Ireland is also committed to supporting international and domestic efforts in the area of electoral preparations and human rights monitoring, working in partnership with other donors and civil society.</p></reply>

This refers to people who require support to enable them to live in the community, such as sheltered accommodation for the elderly or the disabled. The Revenue Commissioners have published guidelines to assist local authorities in identifying special needs accommodation.  Where an LPT liability arises, the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, deems all local authority residential properties to be in the lowest valuation band for the initial valuation period (2013 to 2016) and also allows such bodies to defer their 2013 LPT liability until 2014.  This is to allow such bodies to put in place arrangements for the payment of the tax and for the valuation of their properties.</p></reply>

Community rating, in principle, provides that everybody is charged the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and the current or likely future state of their health.  This measure is in response to the Supreme Court's decision in July 2008 to strike down elements of the previous risk equalisation scheme as <i>ultra vires</i>.  It was intended that the measure would be cost neutral over its duration &ndash; that is, the cost of the age related income tax credit would be met by the yield from the health insurance levy, which is a Stamp Duty.  The scheme was initially intended to run for three years but was extended for a further year before being replaced by the current permanent risk equalisation scheme under the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012.</p><p>I am assuming the Deputy is asking whether the yield from the health insurance levy exceeded the cost of the age related income tax credit in the years in question.  However, it is more appropriate to look at the interim scheme as a whole, rather than individual years.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the annual yield for the years 2009 to date from the health insurance levy, and the cost of age related income tax credits paid out over the same period, are as follows.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Year</b></th><th><b>Age-Related income tax</b><b>credit cost</b></th><th><b>Stamp Duty health insurance levy yield</b></th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>216</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>308</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>333</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>436</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2013 to date</td><td><i>68</i></td><td><i>169</i></td></tr><tr><td><b>Totals</b></td><td><b>1,361</b></td><td><b>1,468</b></td></tr></table></p><p><pfli1></pfli1></p><p>As can be seen from the figures, in 2009 the health insurance levy yield was &euro;19m below the age related income tax credits paid out; in 2010 the levy yield was &euro;10m in excess of the cost of the credits; in 2011 the levy yield was &euro;14 m in excess of the cost of the credits; and in 2012 the levy yield was &euro;1m in excess of the credits.  While the levy yield in 2013 to date is significantly higher than the credits paid out, no further levy will be received in respect of the interim scheme while payments of age related credit will continue until January 2014 in respect of policies paid by instalment.  The interim scheme is still broadly on target to be revenue neutral.</p><p>Under the new permanent risk equalisation scheme, the health insurance levy continues to be collected as a Stamp Duty but it is paid into the new Risk Equalisation Fund rather than the Exchequer.  The age related income tax credits have been replaced by &ldquo;risk equalisation credits&rdquo; which operate outside the tax system.  It is also intended that the permanent scheme will be cost neutral &ndash; that is, the cost of the risk equalisation credit will be met by the yield from the health insurance levy.  The projected turnover (levy yield/credit cost) of the new scheme is c. &euro;500m per annum.</p></reply>

Depending on the circumstances, these can include certain political lobbying and advocacy activities in support of their charitable purpose. </p><p>  Procedures are in place to ensure that bodies that are granted charitable tax exemption are subject to periodic reviews to ensure that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled. All relevant matters, including matters which have been brought to the Revenue Commissioners attention, are taken into account in the context of such reviews.  </p><p>  In regard to the specific issues raised by the Deputies, the Revenue Commissioners have indicated that in order to determine if any such item of expenditure satisfies the terms of a charitable tax exemption it is necessary to examine that expenditure, the context in which it was incurred and the charitable objects of the body incurring the expenditure in detail.</p><p>  If the Deputies wish to provide specific details then the Revenue Commissioners will investigate the issue/s to ensure the terms of the exemption/s in question are being adhered to.</p></reply>

As you will appreciate, I receive numerous requests for the introduction of new tax reliefs and the extension of existing ones, but I must be mindful of the public finances and the many demands on the Exchequer, given the significant budgetary constraints. Tax reliefs, no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system that much more difficult.</p></reply>

The Government's commitment to the Programme does not, and has not stopped us from seeking and agreeing changes to aspects of the programme. A series of burden reducing measures were negotiated by the Government and have been put in place since early 2011.  First we have achieved a reduction in interest on EFSF and EFSM funds and on bilateral loans.The interest rates on EU funding mechanisms (the EFSF and EFSM) were reduced in 2011 and are now provided at rates close to the cost of funding. The maturities of these loans were extended at the same time. The interest rate reductions for the EFSF and the EFSM have also been reflected in the rates charged on Ireland's bilateral loans from the UK, Sweden and Denmark. It is estimated that the interest rate reductions on the EU funding mechanisms and the bilateral loans are worth of the order of &euro;9 billion over the initially envisaged 7 &frac12; year term of these loans.  The positive impact of these changes has been significant as demonstrated by the fact that the average interest rate charged on our programme borrowing at the outset of the programme in 2010 was 5.82 per cent, whereas by end-March 2013, the National Treasury Management Agency has estimated that the all-in fixed euro equivalent cost of loans received under the EU/IMF programme was 3.32 per cent.</p><p>  Second we have achieved an extension of the maturities of the loans. At the Ecofin and Eurogroup meetings in Dublin in April, EU and Euro-area  Finance Ministers agreed in principle, to lengthen the maturities of the EFSF and EFSM loans to Ireland and Portugal by increasing the weighted average maturity of the loans by a further 7 years. The extension will smooth our debt redemption profile and lower our refinancing needs in the post-programme period, improving our long term debt sustainability. </p><p>  Furthermore in February 2013 the Government successfully replaced the IBRC Promissory notes which had a weighted average life of c.7-8 years with Government Bonds with a weighted average life of c. 34-35 years at a lower funding cost for the State, resulting in significant annual interest savings. The Government have also removed Exceptional Liquidity Assistance and the inherent risk associated with short term borrowings which have to be rolled over on a fortnightly basis and have removed IBRC from the financial landscape.   </p><p>  In addition, there are quarterly reviews of the programme implementation and the Government have used these quarterly reviews to renegotiate various aspects of the programme, these include:</p><p>-  a reversal in  the reduction in the minimum wage.</p><p>-  an agreement to reinvest proceeds from state asset sales in projects which are of a commercial nature, enhance employment and preserve long term fiscal sustainability. </p><p>-  the acceptance by the Troika of the measures contained in the Government's <i>Jobs Initiative.</i></p><p>-  the securing of the Troika's agreement to the replacement of the fiscal adjustment measures incorporated in the original agreement for the 2012-14 period by measures that the Government considers to be more growth- and employment-friendly.</p><p>  The success of our overall approach to date is illustrated by the NTMA's highly successful sale of &euro;5 billion in ten year bonds in March.  We are now in the final year of our programme of support, and the Government will continue to seek improvements in our programme conditions as appropriate to support a durable and successful exit. </p></reply>

My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>  It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.</p><p>  Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the Board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to either the relevant Vocational Educational Committee or to the Secretary General of my Department. </p><p>  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  The Board can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, I announced at this year's Teacher Union Conferences that I will shortly bring to Government draft heads of a bill &ndash; the Education (Admission to School) Bill 2013. I will seek to publish the Bill in draft form to allow a full public discussion, including inputs from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection and the education partners. I also intend to publish draft regulations that I plan to make when the Bill is enacted. In bringing forward these proposals, it is not my intention to unnecessarily intrude into how schools do their business. My policy objective is to ensure that every child is treated fairly and that the way in which schools decide on applications is structured, fair and transparent. As the Bill and the Regulations will be published in draft form, they will also be subject to a lot of detailed scrutiny before becoming law. I will be reflecting carefully on the views expressed in the consultation process to ensure they strike the right balance between school autonomy and fairness in our education system.</p></reply>

The policy of my Department is to secure the maximum possible level of inclusion of students with special educational needs in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, or where a special school or special class placement may be required to ensure such placements are provided for.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome attending mainstream schools may receive additional teaching support in primary schools, either under the terms of the General Allocation Model (GAM) of teaching supports, if the pupil's educational psychological assessment places the pupil in the mild general learning disability/high incidence disability category, or through an allocation of individual additional resource teaching hours which are allocated by the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), if the child is assessed as being within the low incidence category of special need, as defined by my Department's Circular Sp Ed 02/05.</p><p>  It should be noted that the introduction of the GAM in 2005 did not change the position in relation to the allocation of supports for children with Down syndrome who had mild general learning difficulty. Prior to the GAM introduction, Circular 08/02 set out that the level of additional support to be provided for children who present with a particular syndrome e.g. Down Syndrome, Syndrome, will be determined following consideration of psychological or other specialist reports which details the nature and degree of the child's special educational needs. The allocations made were differentiated on the basis of the extent of general learning difficulty of the child.</p><p>  Pupils with Down syndrome may be allocated resources under the category of mild general learning disability, or under the categories of moderate general learning difficulty or Assessed Syndrome, in conjunction with another Low Incidence disability. There is not presently a distinct disability category of Down syndrome for resource allocation purposes. As such, it is not possible to advise of the number of children with Down syndrome who are attending mainstream primary education.</p><p>  I have asked the National Council for Special Education to provide me with policy advice on the issue of whether Down syndrome should be reclassified as a low incidence disability in all instances, regardless of assessed cognitive ability. This advice will be included in the NCSE's comprehensive policy advice on how the education system can best support children with special educational needs which is currently in preparation and which is expected shortly.</p></reply>

My Department also provides for a July Programme for pupils with a severe/profound general learning disability.  Where school based provision is not feasible, 10 hours per week home based provision may be grant aided to eligible pupils. Therefore the home based scheme is designed to support children who are not in a position to attend school, and it is generally the case that the Tuition is provided at the child's place of residence. In the vast majority of cases therefore, there will be 1 child in receipt of tuition with 1 tutor providing tuition.  However in a small number of cases where there are qualifying siblings, a combined allocation is made. As Home Tuition is intended to compensate for school based provision it is reasonable to reflect the school grouping principle and allocate to siblings accordingly. For example, in a school setting one teacher is allocated to a class of six pupils with autism. Accordingly it is considered appropriate that a tutor can provide collective tuition to members of one family in the home at the same time.</p><p>  Further clarity on this issue has been included on the information note accompanying the application forms for the home based scheme this year.</p></reply>

As outlined to the Deputy previously the NCSE identified placements in June 2011 for the children to whom she referred in her April parliamentary question on the issue.  Home tuition was approved for these children for a 4 week period from the start of the 2011/2012 school year as the placements previously identified by NCSE had been assigned to other children and were no longer available.</p><p>  The meeting referred to by the Deputy took place in July 2011 at which point parents in attendance were advised of a number of placements available. Some placements identified earlier to parents were at this point no longer available.  Following this meeting a number of additional placements were identified by the NCSE. One of these placements was in a special classes for autism approved by NCSE. While this placement was identified in September 2011, it did not open until December 2011 as the school needed additional time to prepare itself. In the light of this, Home Tuition was further approved for the child to whom the Deputy has referred until the date that the new class physically opened on the basis that he was unable to access placement during this period. This approval was provided notwithstanding that the child had not been enrolled by then and could not have attended on 14th of October because of this fact.  Enrolment of the child in the school was a matter for the parents of the child and the school's Board of Management. The availability of the school's documented policies to the parent is a matter for the school and the parents.</p></reply>

The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget.  However, at a time of severely reduced resources, priorities have to be made. In an effort to ensure fairness in the education system, the PTR in fee charging second level schools will rise by two points to 23:1 in September 2013.</p><p>  However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately. This is an option which is not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools carried out by my Department was recently published and shows that the schools in question have &euro;81m in discretionary income that schools in the free scheme do not have. It is important to note that the report does not contain any policy proposals at this stage. However, even after the Budget changes are implemented, the discretionary income available to these schools will still be quite considerable.</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that this Government recognises the importance of ensuring that students from a Protestant or reformed church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos while at the same time ensuring that funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, an arrangement exists whereby funding is provided by my Department to the Secondary Education Committee (SEC), an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC then disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty with the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a reformed church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to &euro;6.5 million annually. This fund ensures that necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice.</p></reply>

The overarching theme of the Irish Presidency is the contribution of trade to growth, jobs and economic recovery; consequently I attach great importance to promoting the EU's external trade agenda.  Increasing trade is one of the few ways to bolster economic growth without the necessity of drawing on severely constrained public finances. The contribution of external demand to GDP is the EU's most important source of growth for the moment, as domestic demand components - both public and private - remain weak. In fact, the contribution of trade to GDP in 2012 (+0.9 percentage points) cut the depth of the recession in the EU by a factor of four, helping compensate for the downward pull of other economic variables. The contribution of external demand to economic growth is bound to increase in future, as 90% of global economic growth in the next 10-15 years is expected to be generated outside Europe, a third of it in China alone.  Trade policy is therefore an essential component of the EU's growth compact. More trade is also essential to job creation: About 30 million jobs in the EU depend on sales to the rest of the world, an increase of 10 million since 1995. On average, each additional &euro;1 billion of exports supports between 8,000 to 15,000 additional jobs across the EU.</p><p>  Negotiations underway or planned could boost EU GDP by more than 2% or &euro;250bn -equivalent to the size of the Austrian or Danish economy -- and support an increase of more than 2 million jobs related to trade across the EU.</p><p>  The trade negotiations currently underway are set out below.</p><p><b><i>EU-US Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership</i></b></p><p>  President Obama endorsed the launch of free trade talks with the EU in his State of the Union address on 9 February. This followed on from the work of the EU-US High Level Working Group on Jobs and Growth that concluded a comprehensive agreement addressing a broad range of bilateral trade and investment issues, including regulatory issues, and contributing to the development of global rules, would provide the most significant mutual benefit. </p><p>  The EU Council is considering a negotiating mandate to give to the Commission to start the talks. The Irish Presidency has prioritised this process of seeking agreement from EU member states on the final mandate. The negotiating mandate was discussed in depth at the highly successful Informal Trade Ministers meeting that I hosted in Dublin on 17-18 April. </p><p>  The EU-US mandate will be the subject of intensive discussion over the coming weeks and it remains the Presidency's strong intention to seek to agree a mandate at the Foreign Affairs Council (Trade) on 14 June.</p><p><b><i>EU-Canada</i></b></p><p>  Negotiations on a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada (CETA) are almost concluded. Negotiators are currently meeting in order to progress the final stages of an agreement, however no date is set for a final Ministerial meeting to conclude the agreement.</p><p><b><i>EU-Japan</i></b></p><p>  Negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and Japan were launched on 25 March. The first round of negotiations was held in Brussels from 15-19 April and was conducted in a positive atmosphere. The aim is for a comprehensive agreement in goods, services and investment eliminating tariffs, non-tariff barriers and covering other trade-related issues, such as public procurement, regulatory issues, competition, and sustainable development.</p><p><b><i>EU-Singapore</i></b></p><p>  This agreement is the EU's second ambitious agreement with a key Asian trading partner, after the EU-Korea FTA, and the first with a member of the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Once fully implemented, the deal will open up markets on both sides in a number of sectors, including banking, insurance and other financial services industries. Although the substantive negotiations have now concluded, negotiations on Investment Protection provisions are continuing.</p><p><b><i>EU-ASEAN</i></b></p><p>  Talks on trade agreements with other ASEAN countries (in addition to Singapore) are at various stages of maturity. Talks are underway with Vietnam and Malaysia with trade negotiations with Thailand likely to start in a matter of weeks.</p><p><b><i>EU-India</i></b></p><p>  Negotiations with India, a key strategic partner for the EU, are continuing and may hopefully conclude in the coming months.</p><p><b><i>Eastern Neighbourhood</i></b>  Negotiations on Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreements (DCFTA) are progressing well with Armenia, Georgia and Moldova. Negotiations with Ukraine have been concluded and the agreement is awaiting political endorsement on both sides.</p><p><b><i>Southern Neighbourhood</i></b>  Negotiations on a DCFTA started with Morocco in the week beginning 22 April 2013. Preparatory meetings have been arranged with Jordan and Tunisia.</p><p><b><i>Mercosur</i></b></p><p>  Negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement with Mercosur are continuing on a technical level.</p><p><b><i>Gulf Cooperation Council</i></b></p><p>  Negotiations are underway and have been for some considerable time.</p><p><b><i>World Trade Organisation</i></b></p><p>Preparations continue for the 9<sup>th</sup>   Ministerial Conference (MC9) of the WTO in Indonesia in December. Discussions on a package of deliverables are centred on Trade Facilitation and trade development initiatives for Least Developed Countries.</p><p><b><i>Other Agreements</i></b></p><p>  Negotiations on a new International Technology Agreement are also taking place at the WTO. This agreement will extend the range of electronic products that can be traded tariff free among signatories to the agreement. It is expected that talks will be substantially concluded by the end of 2013.</p><p>  In addition, very early negotiations on an International Services Agreement have commenced among some of the world's largest exporters of services. Work on this agreement is at the early stage of development and a final conclusion is not expected until 2014 at the earliest.</p></reply>

The specific recommendations contained in the South East Employment Action Plan, produced by Forfas, are being progressed by a Forum representing the agencies and key stakeholders in the region.  </p><p>  The unemployment rate in the region has remained stubbornly high and has been consistently above the national average for many years.

It is clear that the solution to this problem requires focused action.</p><p>  A number of positive developments have followed on foot of this initiative including a number of significant jobs announcements for the South East e.g. the Eishtec Call Centre in Waterford city created 280 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs; a further 65 Enterprise Ireland-supported jobs new jobs were created by Dawn Meats as a result of a 5 year &euro;300m contract with McDonald's restaurants; the two local Waterford City and County Enterprise Boards have created 59 new jobs; and Danone Baby Nutrition in Wexford announced an investment of &euro;20m in its manufacturing facility which will create around 45 new jobs at its plant.</p><p>  I met with the Forum on 28 March last in Waterford to hear about further progress made by agencies and stakeholders in the region, and to discuss how we can move forward on outstanding actions and other challenges.  </p><p>  Notwithstanding the success of this initiative, I consider that it is neither practicable nor effective to establish jobs task forces or specific jobs plans around the country as a general mechanism to address high unemployment.  I believe that to embark on such a course would involve diverting the various State Agencies from their on-going efforts to create jobs. A considerable administrative commitment is involved in servicing any additional committees and groups which may be set up and, given the constrained staff resources facing all public sector bodies at present, I am strongly of the opinion that establishing such additional groups, except in very exceptional circumstances, would not be in the best interests of using the State's resources effectively.</p><p>  Although the county has seen a number of company closures IDA Ireland continues to compete for high quality investments for Kerry. At the end of<b></b>2012 there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry with total employment of circa 1,600<b></b>  people. IDA will continue to engage with these companies in respect of operational sustainability, job retention and, in certain cases, expansion opportunities.   </p><p>  Enterprise Ireland activity in Co. Kerry is focussed on the creation of new jobs through supporting entrepreneurs to set up new High Potential Start-Up Companies. In 2012, there were 132 Enterprise Ireland-supported companies in Co. Kerry, employing 3,318 people in a full time basis and a further 132 on contract or part time employment. </p><p>  All the State enterprise agencies will continue to actively pursue initiatives to facilitate development and job creation in Co. Kerry.</p></reply>

The pilot YGS will look to develop an activation approach tailored to the needs of young people in a deprived urban area and then test it within a specific geographical location (Ballymun).  </p><p>  It is intended that the pilot YGS will, in respect of the target group of young people,  guarantee access to career guidance/assistance leading to identification of an individual career plan for the young unemployed person with follow-through to training, education, work experience or full-time employment.  Depending on the needs of the young individual the steps in the career plan might include personal assessment, job search assistance, skills training, work experience internships, but the objective in all cases will be to lead the young person to employment placement or further education or training. A particular focus of the pilot YGS will be to involve, and build links with, employers in the locality and the immediate hinterland in order to ensure that the guidance and training elements of the YGS are tailored to the needs of the local labour market and also to generate work placement/experience opportunities for the YGS participants. </p><p>  The European Commission is currently evaluating the high number of proposals received for the Youth Guarantee funding call for proposals. Due to technical constraints, the evaluation process is delayed. Nevertheless, we expect a finalisation of the evaluation process by June at the latest. The total cost of the project is EUR 302,279, we are seeking EUR 250,000 EU contribution. The project should start after signature of the grant agreement, expected within six months of the submission date. The duration of project will be 12 months maximum.</p><p>  It is proposed that the principal target group for participants will be unemployed persons aged 18 to 24 years. It is proposed that the YGS will apply to an intake of c 90 young people per month drawn from two steams.</p><p>(i)	Young people who are coming on to the Live Register during the period of the pilot and who are registering at the Ballymun office.  We expect this cohort to be of the order 60 young people per month. The intervention will commence once the young person has established eligibility to a Jobseekers claim. Not all of the target cohort will require an intervention over and above an initial needs assessment. </p><p>(ii)	It is also intended to target young people who have already been unemployed for some time. Currently, there are approximately 360 young people who are wholly unemployed and on the register in Ballymun for a year or more. This group will be targeted for intervention at a rate of c 30 per month over the life of the pilot. (In months where the intake of cohort (i) is less than 60 the intake of long term unemployed young people will be increased and vice versa).</p><p>  The YGS will be developed through co-operation of all of the relevant stakeholders including the PES (DSP), education and training providers, voluntary and community groups, employers and youth organisations. As part of the bid for this funding the Department of Social Protection consulted with Ballymun Youthreach (CDVEC) Centre of Education Ballymun; Ballymun Job Centre/Local Employment Service Network; Ballymun Adult Read and Write Scheme; Ballymun Regional Youth Resource Limited; Ballymun Community Training Centre; Trinity Comprehensive School; Ballymun Youth Action Project Ltd.; The National Youth Council of Ireland (NYCI) and IBEC with a view to establishing a partnership as required by the terms of reference of the proposal.</p><p>  The Local Implementation Team will comprise representatives of relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Social Protection, FAS, CDVEC, Ballymun Whitehall Area Partnership, Ballymun Job Centre/Local Employment Service Network, North Dublin Chamber of Commerce, Ballymun for Business, EQUAL Youth, and a representative young person (to be identified).</p></reply>

For the most part they are linked to having an underlying entitlement to a social welfare payment while temporarily detached from the labour force or having entitlement to statutory leave e.g. parental or maternity leave.  The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of employees by covering gaps in insurance where they are not in a position to pay PRSI such as during periods of unemployment, illness, etc.   </p><p>  The class at which a contributor paid his or her last PRSI contribution determines entitlement to credited contributions.  Credits are usually awarded at the same rate as your last paid PRSI contribution.  For example, Class A PRSI contributions may entitle a person to all insured DSP benefits, provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.  Credits are not available to a person who has only Class S contributions.</p><p>  People who cease to be covered by compulsory social insurance, may opt to protect their existing long-term social insurance pension entitlements by becoming insured on a voluntary basis and paying voluntary contributions.   Payment of voluntary contributions does not provide social insurance cover for short term benefits such as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  A person who wishes to become a voluntary contributor must satisfy certain contribution conditions and must apply to become a voluntary contributor within 12 months after the end of the contribution year in which he/she was last compulsorily insured.  A person cannot be a voluntary contributor while also an employed contributor or in receipt of credited employment contributions.</p></reply>

The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on 3, with significant financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met.  The NBS contract also provides that where NBS customers do not receive the minimum guaranteed service, as set out in the terms and conditions of their contract, they are entitled to service rebates.  </p><p>  Should any NBS customer experience problems with the NBS service, they are advised to contact 3's customer care centre, 24 hours a day 7 days a week, by phone at 1913 (free of charge), via email to    or by post to 3 Customer Services, Hutchison 3G Ireland Limited, PO Box 333, Dublin 2.  I note that the customer in question has contacted the customer care centre, but is not satisfied with the response received.  </p><p>  My Department has a role where customers have fully utilised the established complaints process and consider that their complaint has not been resolved.  My officials operate a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email at , with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.  My Department will then liaise with 3 personnel at its Head Office in Dublin to remedy any service performance issues.  In this instance, my officials had, directly upon receipt of the correspondence from the person referred to in the Question contacted this NBS customer on Thursday, 9 May.  The details of the complaint were forwarded to 3, which advises that they have contacted the customer and commenced a thorough investigation of the issues raised.

While in general a household must be in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more in order to qualify for RAS, housing authorities do, on occasion, accept households on to RAS where they have been less than 18 months on rent supplement. This occurs under exceptional circumstances and where a long term housing need can be demonstrated. Accepting persons into RAS before the 18 month period has elapsed has been applied in respect of homeless persons and for households with special needs. It has also been applied administratively where a landlord is bringing a number of properties across with tenants on rent supplement for different periods and where it has been relevant in facilitating persons moving back to employment. </p><p>  It is considered, particularly in the current economic climate where unemployment is resulting in an increase in the numbers on rent supplement, that the 18 month threshold remains an appropriate juncture at which to review a household's on-going need for support.</p></reply>

Rather, my intention is that the factors which lead to delays in the processing of cases are dealt with so that asylum seekers spend as little time as is necessary in that accommodation system.</p><p>  The direct provision system is not ideal but it is a system which facilitates the State providing a roof over the head of those seeking asylum or seeking other grounds to be allowed, on humanitarian grounds, to stay in the State. It allows the State to do it in a manner that facilitates resources being used economically in circumstances where the State is in financial difficulty.  There are no cheaper alternatives to the Direct Provision system. A key finding in the 2010 Value for Money Report on the Direct Provision system was that if we were operating a system which facilitated asylum seekers in living independent lives in individual housing with social welfare support and payments, aside from the asylum 'pull factor' it would likely create, the cost to the exchequer would be double what is currently paid under the direct provision system.</p><p>  There are currently 4,698 persons accommodated in direct provision across 34 centres. I do accept that the length of time spent in direct provision and the complexity of the asylum process itself is an issue which needs to be addressed.  The accommodation system is inextricably linked to the surrounding asylum process. The revised Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to re-publish, should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion.  </p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing, I am proposing to introduce new arrangements for the processing of subsidiary protection applications in light of recent judgments in the Superior Courts.  My Department, in consultation with the Attorney General's Office, is developing a new legislative and administrative framework for the processing of current and future subsidiary protection applications. This work is being given high priority and applicants will be advised of the new arrangements as soon as possible.</p></reply>

I would like to thank the Visiting Committee for their Report. The observation that Castlerea prison is a well run prison with professional staff and a high quality of medical care provided to prisoners is very encouraging. The Committee also acknowledged the good work done in the school as well as the work of the prison Chaplain. </p><p>  I should point out that there is no reference to overcrowding in the Castlerea Visiting Committee Report for 2012.  The average number in custody in Castlerea Prison in 2012 was 361, against a bed capacity of 351. This represents an average occupancy level of 102.8% and needs to be viewed in the context of the levels of overcrowding being experienced in prisons such as Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick and the D&oacute;chas Centre. Accordingly, the priority for the Irish Prison Service is to reducing the chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick Prisons and the D&oacute;chas Centre in the coming year.</p><p>  In relation to staff shortages, I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that a new staffing structure and rosters were fully implemented in Castlerea Prison in November 2012 under the implementation of the terms of the Public Service Agreement 2010 -2014 or the Transformation Programme as it is known. The new agreed staffing number for Castlerea is 211. As at 4 May 2013 there were 208 staff assigned to Castlerea which is only 3 below the authorised numbers and the Prison Service is  awaiting a work training competition which should fill the vacant posts.</p></reply>

Section 16 of the Act provides that I can, in cases where the applicant is a parent or guardian acting on behalf of a minor of Irish descent or Irish association waive part or all of the statutory criteria when considering applications for naturalisation.  In general, I only consider it appropriate to waive the statutory conditions for naturalisation where there are exceptional and compelling reasons why these conditions cannot be complied with and where there is no other option available to the applicant under the law.  The usual manner by which children such as those referred to by the Deputy are granted citizenship is for a parent to become an Irish citizen in the first instance.  Thereafter, it is open to the parent, if successful in their own application, to make an application on behalf of their children under the relevant provision.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-15a.573.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051500087#WRZ01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 219 and 220 together.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 provides that sentenced prisoners may be approved temporary release whether it be for a few hours or a more extended period.  The Act sets out the circumstances when temporary release may be provided and what matters must be taken into account.</p><p>The granting of temporary release is done by the officials in the Irish Prison Service Headquarters, on my behalf,  and as such individual prisons do not operate their own schemes of temporary release.  On 15 May 2013 there were 732 prisoners on temporary release or 14.2% of the total number of prisoners in the prison system.  Some 131 of these prisoners are participating in the community return programme and 28 are on temporary release from an open centre. In addition, 229 prisoners had been sentenced for failure to pay a court ordered fine and 95 prisoners were serving sentences of less than 6 months.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan 2012-2015 and the recently published Joint Prison Service/Probation Service Strategic Plan 2013-2015 includes commitments to ensure that all prisoners released early from custody are placed on appropriate structured programme of temporary release.  The Community Return Scheme is a recently introduced initiative whereby carefully selected prisoners can be granted reviewable temporary release coupled with a requirement to do community service work such as painting, gardening or graffiti removal in a supervised group setting.  The type of work involved is intended to assist the community and the scheme is involved with a large number of charitable organisations and local community groups.</p><p>The scheme, which was introduced on a pilot basis in October 2011, is applicable to suitably assessed prisoners who are serving sentences of more than one and less than eight years. Those participating are granted renewable temporary release having served at, or after, the 50% stage of their sentence with a condition of their release to undertake supervised community service.</p><p>In excess of 510 prisoners have taken part in the initiative since it commenced in October 2011 with 319 prisoners now having completed the programme.  Today there are 131 prisoners on community return, which is the highest total at one time since the Programme commenced.  Compliance has been almost 90%; and the 10% who did not comply with the terms and conditions of their release on community return were re-committed to prison immediately to serve the rest of their sentence in custody.  The Community Return Programme has been a really positive development, and as well as allowing prisoners to complete their sentence by way of performing a service to the community, has significantly helped these prisoners to successfully resettle in their communities.</p><p>The Community Return Programme forms part of a wider structured release programme aimed at improving outcomes for prisoners.  In addition to Community Return, the Unlocking Community Alternatives Scheme, UCAS, has been set up in Cork. The primary aim of this Scheme is to reduce the current recidivism rates of short term prisoners by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release. This is a pilot scheme and will be reviewed in 12 months in order to assess whether it has had a positive impact on re-offending rates.</p><p>The Joint Prison Service/Probation service Strategy will also see a focus on working with short term sentenced prisoners - helping with issues such as housing, medical care, substance abuse, training needs, etc. The aim is to increase support to prisoners - prior to their release from prison, upon their release and then for a period after their release in order to help break the cycle of re-offending. Discussions have been ongoing, in this regard, with a number of external agencies and it is hoped that further initiatives will commence in the near future.</p><p>A breakdown of those on temporary release, those on  the Community Return Programme and those who have completed the Community Return Programme is set out in the following table.</p><p></p><p><table><tr><th>Institution</th><th>Temporary release (excluding Community Return)</th><th>Temporary Release to Community Return.</th><th>No completed Community Return </th></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (M)</td><td><div>107</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>40</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mountjoy (F)</td><td><div>71</div></td><td><div>3</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Training Unit</td><td><div>13</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>37</div></td></tr><tr><td>St Patrick's</td><td><div>15</div></td><td><div>6</div></td><td><div>11</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cloverhill</td><td><div>17</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wheatfield</td><td><div>82</div></td><td><div>12</div></td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td><div>41</div></td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>32</div></td></tr><tr><td>Portlaoise</td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>119</div></td><td><div>5</div></td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (M)</td><td><div>47</div></td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>26</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick (F)</td><td><div>24</div></td><td><div>2</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Castlerea</td><td><div>48</div></td><td><div>4</div></td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Arbour Hill</td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td>Loughan House</td><td><div>8</div></td><td><div>28</div></td><td><div>32</div></td></tr><tr><td>Shelton Abbey</td><td><div>7</div></td><td><div>33</div></td><td><div>88</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>601</div></td><td><div>131</div></td><td><div>319</div></td></tr></table></p><p></p></reply>

In some cases the capacities can increase due to the opening of new prisoner accommodation as was the case in Midlands Prison at the end of 2012 when the capacity increased from 636 to 900 following the opening of a new 179 cell accommodation block.</p><p>Similarly, the capacity of a prison can be reduced temporarily due to the closure of a wing or landing as is the current case in Mountjoy Prison where the capacity has been reduced with the closure of the A Wing for refurbishment and Wheatfield where the bed capacity decreased by 20 spaces to facilitate the development of a committal unit.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware and as outlined in the Irish Prison Service Three Year Strategic Plan, it is the intention of the Irish Prison Service to seek to align the capacity of our prisons with the guidelines laid down by the Inspector of Prisons, in so far as this is compatible with public safety and the integrity of the criminal justice system.</p><p>In 2012 and in the first quarter of this year, priority has been given to reducing the chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy, Cork, Limerick Prisons and the D&oacute;chas Centre.  A new prisoner accommodation block in the Midlands Prison, which opened in December last year, has allowed the Prison Service to reduce the capacity and the number in custody in both Cork and Limerick Prison. In addition, the opening of a new 20 space accommodation block, which was formerly used as an administration building,  has helped alleviate the overcrowding being experienced in the Dochas Centre.</p></reply>

These rules are implemented in the context of Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005, which has made a significant contribution to animal welfare during transport. Provisions in the EU regulation relating to the training of drivers, the authorisation of transporters and improved vehicle specifications have all been very beneficial.  The safeguards provided by the existing regulation are well considered and scientifically sound and experience has shown that animals can arrive in perfect health after a long journey if the specification on rests and feeding/watering as set down in Council Regulation (EC) 1/2005 are correctly observed.</p><p>  The current Irish regulation in relation to the approval of ships for livestock transport is set higher than that which applies in other EU Member States. This is justified not only on sound animal welfare reasons but also because it reflects the nature of the shipping routes from this island. Detailed inspections are required before approval is given to ships transporting animals. The requirements for approval of dedicated vessels for the carriage of cattle by sea are contained in the Diseases of Animals (Carriage of Cattle by Sea) Orders, 1996 and 1998. </p><p>  My Department has no jurisdiction in relation to standards of slaughter plants in other countries.  However, it does support ongoing efforts by international organisations, such as the OIE, to improve welfare standards at slaughter plants worldwide. The live export trade provides alternative market outlets for certain categories of livestock, thereby serving a market demand and providing increased competition in the market place for cattle. My Department is conscious of the need to balance this trade with the requirements of the indigenous meat processing industry and seeks to ensure that any such trade is carried out to a high standard. </p></reply>

This is intended to assist those farmers, who had forgotten to submit their application as happens in many instances every year. In some instances, farmers are unaware that they had forgotten to submit their application until they are informed that no application has been received when they make enquires about the non-issue of their payments during the autumn.       </p><p>  In order to be in position to carry out this process, it was necessary to provide that 2013 SPS forms together with entitlement related applications should be submitted directly to the Department's Single Payment Unit, Portlaoise.  </p><p>    Forms may be submitted on-line and an increasing number of farmers are availing of this option by submitting their application themselves or by using an agent approved by the Department. Such agents are either staff of Teagasc or agricultural consultants. In 2012 over 65,000 on-line applications were received and it is likely that over 70,000 will be received this year. I strongly urge farmers to use this option themselves or with the assistance of an approved agent. Such applications are easily traced, are acknowledged electronically and are more readily processed for payment</p><p>  In addition applications may be hand delivered or returned by post to the Single Payment Unit in Portlaoise in the pre-addressed envelope sent out to every 2012 applicant under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme. An Express Post<font color="#FF0000"> </font>  receipt is attached to each return envelope sent out and provides an acceptable proof of postage for retention by the applicant. A registered post receipt is also an acceptable proof of postage if such is required by my Department. The option of posting the application form in the return envelope provided is available at all Post Officers throughout the country. The Single Payment Unit in Portlaoise will remain opened until midnight tonight to accept applications.</p><p>  I am very aware that some farmers seek information from my Department when completing their SPS application forms.  Anyone with a query of this nature should contact the designated lo-call number for their county as printed in the Terms &amp;amp; Conditions of the SPS circulated to all 2012 applicants at the beginning of April. Farmers are well aware of these numbers and thousands of queries are received every year on the Department's lo-call numbers during the period from the issue of the blank application forms until the closing date for the receipt of applications on 15<sup>th</sup> May  <font color="#FF0000">.</font></p><p>  The change in the procedure for the submission of paper applications will mean that many application forms will be received on an earlier date in the Single Payment Unit than in previous years. This in turn will greatly assist the early scanning of forms and the issuing of acknowledgements to farmers and indeed the processing to completion of such applications.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the operation of the National BVD Eradication Programme would have been responsible for some of this increase.  </p><p>  An increased incidence of liver fluke infection in sheep and cattle was anticipated in 2012 because of the increase in rainfall during the year.  The risk was the subject of a liver fluke forecast and alert in a press release issued by my Department in October 2012 which is available on the DAFM website at:- , 67193, en.html. </p><p>  Losses in Sheep due to liver fluke infection, (accounting for 24.3% of cases submitted for post-mortem diagnosis to the Regional Veterinary Laboratories), were elevated this Spring when compared to previous Springs, bearing in mind that the peak incidence of deaths attributed to liver fluke in sheep occurs in the Autumn of each year. There was also an increased incidence of liver fluke infection in cattle, the more common effect of which is production loss such as reduced milk production and / or reduced weight gain rather than deaths.  </p><p>  The Department's Veterinary Laboratory Service continues to be available to help farmers by providing diagnostic services on referral by private veterinary practices.  In addition, in response to difficulties being experienced by farmers in sourcing fodder, I introduced a scheme on the 24<sup>th</sup> April last - the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme - to assist with transport costs in response associated with importation of forage from abroad. The scheme has been extended to 24 May 2013<b>.  </b>Furthermore,<b></b>  emergency assistance continues to be made available under my Department's early warning system to farmers whose animals are currently experiencing serious welfare issues and where the farmer him/herself is unable to cope with the situation. </p></reply>

In response, I have introduced a specific Scheme, the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme, designed to assist towards the transport costs of imported fodder and maintenance of stocking levels. The situation has prompted action by the wider industry and farm bodies, which is very welcome. In keeping the situation under constant review, I decided, given the ongoing shortages in some areas, to extend the Imported Fodder Transport Scheme to 24 May and to double the funding available to &euro;2 million. Simultaneously, my Department&rsquo;s Emergency Welfare System continues to respond to individual emergency situations. </p><p>  Mindful of ongoing difficulties, I also decided that a formal request should again be made to the EU Commission seeking agreement to pay an advance from 16 October of the 2013 Single Farm Payment which, being the first day of the new EU financial year is the earliest potential payment date and almost two months ahead of the standard timeline. It will be recalled that my successful approach to Commissioner Ciolos for agreement to making an advance payment of the 2012 Single Farm Payment was prompted by the very wet weather experienced throughout last summer.</p><p>  With specific regard to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the 2013 Scheme, as already announced, is focussed on the protection of the smaller and most disadvantaged. It must also be borne in mind that the minimum stocking density requirement is equivalent to one ewe per eligible forage hectare and can not in any way be regarded as onerous. It will be recalled that, in response to budgetary realities, it was decided to re-focus the Scheme, with greater consideration been given to those contributing most to achieving the aims of the Scheme, which are: ensuring continued agricultural land use, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a viable rural society; maintaining the countryside; maintaining and promoting sustainable farming systems, which, in particular, take account of environmental protection requirements. </p><p>  Given the restrictions faced by those farming in recognised Disadvantaged Areas and mindful of the aims of the Scheme, as outlined, it will be readily appreciated that appropriate stocking levels are crucial. In this regard, balance must be struck between the need to ensure that at least the minimum is done to ensure the land is adequately utilised and grazed, while at the same time being sufficiently aware of the natural constraints. In this regard, it is clear that the minimum stocking levels currently set under the Scheme achieve this twin objective.  Thus, the terms of the 2013 Scheme remain as previously announced.  Farmers with genuine fodder-related stocking difficulties may avail of the force majeure provisions of the Scheme.</p></reply>

This Scheme was aimed at making a basic broadband service available to un-served premises in rural areas, not already covered by the National Broadband Scheme. An amount of &euro;13,413,000 EAFRD funding was allocated to the scheme which came within the remit of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. </p><p>  During the scheme development process existing commercial internet service providers indicated their ability to provide a broadband service to almost all of the qualifying applicants under the scheme. Consequently there has been no need for any disbursement of public money and no related draw-down of EU funding was necessary. The EAFRD funding originally made available for this scheme may be re-allocated to other qualifying measures under the Rural Development Programme. Adjustments will accordingly be made to the Programme Financial Plan in order to achieve the fullest possible draw down of EU funds having regard to the availability of matching national funding.</p></reply>

These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a <i>pro rata</i> basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.  However, there is no provision under the programme for a second pre-school year for any child.  As the child in question is availing of the full free pre-school complement in the in the current academic year, there is no further entitlement under the ECCE programme.</p></reply>

The application is being considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed last year by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association (IPHA) for the assessment of new medicines.  In accordance with these procedures, the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE) conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of pirfenidone and concluded that, at the submitted price, pirfenidone is not cost-effective for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  The report is available on the NCPE's website (www.ncpe.ie).</p><p>  The NCPE report is an important input to assist decision making and informs further discussions between the HSE and the manufacturer of the drug.  The HSE is currently in negotiations with the manufacturers of pirfenidone and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further while these negotiations are ongoing.  The HSE assessment process is intended to arrive at a decision on the funding of pirfenidone that is clinically appropriate, fair, consistent and sustainable.  The HSE understands that patients and clinicians are very anxious that a decision be made as soon as possible.</p></reply>

All facilities that operate as a 'centre' as defined in the Act, must be registered by the Mental Health Commission. Section 63 of the Mental Health Act 2001 states that 'a person shall not carry on a centre unless the centre is registered and the person is the registered proprietor thereof and a centre which so registered shall be known and is referred to in this Act as an approved centre'. Once a centre is registered by the Commission, it is entered in the register of approved centres and each centre's registration lasts for three years from the date of registration.</p><p>  Full details on the list of registered of approved centres, including access to  reports carried out by the Inspector of Mental Health Services are available on the website of the Mental Health Commission, www.mhcirl.ie.</p></reply>

This has not been altered by this judgment.</p><p>The Court held:</p><p>- In the case of the first and second applicants, Ms A and Ms B, the Court dismissed their applications, finding that there had been no violation of their rights under the Convention;</p><p>- In the case of the third applicant, Ms C, the Court found that Ireland had failed to respect the applicant&rsquo;s private life contrary to Article 8 of the Convention, as <b>there was no accessible and effective procedure to enable her to establish whether she qualified for a lawful termination of pregnancy in accordance with Irish law</b>.</p><p><b>The Court ruled that &quot;no criteria or procedures have been... laid down in Irish law... by which that risk is to be measured or determined</b>, leading to uncertainty...&quot; and held that further <b>legal clarity</b> was required.</p><p><i>Execution of the Judgment</i></p><p>Steps need to be taken to ensure no future similar violations of Article 8 occur. <b>While the State is free, within certain limits, to choose the means of execution it is legally bound to attain the execution result required</b>.  This means that while the State can choose the means of implementation, it needs to <b>achieve legal clarity</b> as to when a woman may qualify for a lawful termination of pregnancy.</p></reply>

Treatment is lifelong.  In 2010, in the absence of sufficient information to make a decision regarding long term funding, the HSE entered into an agreement with the manufacturer and St James&rsquo; Hospital, Dublin, whereby it provided a fund of almost &euro;10m (inclusive of VAT) for the years 2010 to 2012.  This level of funding was seen as sufficient to treat 10 patients, the expected number of patients to be identified for treatment over that time period. The agreement provided that continued funding of Eculizumab would be contingent on the results of a HSE commissioned evaluation of the clinical and economic information associated with the use of this drug. In this context, it was understood that the manufacturer was working with clinical experts internationally to develop the evidence to support continued funding of this very expensive drug.</p><p>  The HSE has honoured the terms of the 2010 agreement. The agreement has now lapsed and a formal re-assessment process has been triggered as was agreed in 2010. Pending consideration of the outcome of the assessment, the HSE is continuing to fund the treatment of the original 10 patients identified by St James&rsquo;s Hospital.  The HSE has released funding of &euro;848,000 (plus 23% VAT) to fund treatment for these patients in the first four months of 2013.</p><p>  The HSE is progressing with the formal re-assessment agreed in 2010 so as to ensure that funding decisions are made in the full knowledge of all the benefits and costs of this drug. The HSE understands that the manufacturer is working on a dossier setting out additional evidence in support of this drug and the HSE awaits its submission. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics has been requested to examine that dossier on behalf of the HSE once it is submitted. Future funding decisions will be made when the assessment report is available.</p></reply>

This shortage is due to manufacturing capacity issues which the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is experiencing at its manufacturing site in the United Kingdom.</p><p>  A number of measures are in place to deal with this shortage and minimise its impact on the delivery of essential health services.  GSK, is closely monitoring supply and ensuring that product stocks are available for those considered most vulnerable and consequently the supply of Augmentin IV to hospitals has been and will continue to be rationed, with paediatric hospitals being prioritised.</p><p>  For other hospitals there are two generic IV amoxicillin / clavulanic acid products currently authorised in Ireland. The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has put in place measures to facilitate the continued supply of these alternative products until such time as normal supplies of Augmentin IV are resumed.</p><p>  Clinical leadership within the HSE made clinical microbiologists, infectious diseases physicians and antimicrobial pharmacists aware of the potential issues in March 2013 and requested that individual hospitals consider preparation of contingency plans to guide clinicians on potential alternatives to Augmentin IV in the event that alternatives were required.</p><p>  My Department works closely with the IMB and the HSE to identify and address medicines shortages so as to minimise their impact on patients.  Shortages are a global issue and can arise for a variety of reasons, including, as in the case in Augmentin IV, production issues at a manufacturing facility.  In the event of a particular shortage, priority is given to restoring supply as quickly as possible and to identifying and securing continued supply of alternative products.  Manufacturers, wholesalers and pharmacies all have responsibility to work together to identify shortages  and implement alternative arrangements to meet the needs of patients.</p></reply>

Building on work already undertaken by the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund has now taken over the reporting of outpatient waiting time data.   For the first time  data is available on www.ntpf.ie.  The collation and analysis of outpatient waiting time data in a standardised format will reveal the distribution of long waiters across all hospitals. In the first instance, this will allow resources to be targeted towards those patients who are waiting longest and ensure that they are seen and assessed.  For 2013, a maximum waiting time target has now been set of 12 months for a first time outpatient appointment.</p><p>  In parallel with reducing the numbers of longest waiters, the SDU will also work with the HSE Clinical Programmes to reform the structure, organisation and delivery of outpatient services to ensure that the right patient is seen and assessed by the right health professional at the right time.</p><p>  Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.</p><p>  In relation to the specific query raised by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Consequently, there is no standard cost of installing fluoridation systems in water treatment plants.  The most recent capital reimbursments made by the HSE to local authorities were &euro;4,426, &euro;14,450 and  &euro;25,286 in respect  of 3 medium sized plants and &euro;621,192 for a larger plant serving a population of over 170,000.  The main types of equipment purchased include bulk tank, bulk tank bund, day tank, day tank bund, weighing scales, dosing pump, dead man's handle and shower unit but this list is not exhaustive.  Local authorities have been requested to ensure, as far as practicable, that provision for fluoridation equipment is included in the tendering process for the procurement of new water treatment infrastructure or the upgrading of existing facilities.  Procurement in this manner should ensure a more cost effective outcome compared to tendering separately for such equipment.</p><p>  The most recent independent national audit of the fluoridation process at water treatment plants was commissioned by the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health and conducted in 2008-2009.  The cost of the project was &euro;232,000.  Figures given in a previous Parliamentary Question for operational costs, capital costs and the supply of  hydrofluorosilicic acid do not include the cost of the audit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-05-15a.732.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013051500087#WRFF01500"><p>The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its first term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government and the Future Health strategy framework.  This policy constitutes a fundamental element in the Government&rsquo;s health reform programme.  There has been no change to the Government&rsquo;s over-arching commitment to this goal.  This Government is the first in the history of this State to have committed itself to implementing a universal GP service for the entire population.</p><p>  Having examined the progress made in the universal GP care plan, it became clear to me that the legal and administrative framework required to provide a robust basis for eligibility for a GP service based on having a particular medical condition is likely to be overly complex and bureaucratic for a short-term arrangement.  Relatively complex primary legislation would be required in order to provide a GP service to a person on the basis of their having a particular illness.  The assessment system for such an approach would have to be robust, objective and auditable in order to have the confidence of this House as well as the general public.  This legislation would have to address how a person could be certified as having such an illness, and who could do this, and how to select the diagnostic basis for medical conditions.  As well as primary legislation, there would be a need for secondary legislation to give full effect to this approach for each condition.  While it would not be impossible to achieve this, it would take several months more to finalise the primary legislation, followed then by the preparation of statutory instruments.  In my view, this would entail putting in place a cumbersome legal and administrative infrastructure to deal with what is only a temporary first phase on the way to universal GP service to the entire population.</p><p>  The Cabinet Committee on Health has discussed the issues relating to the delay in the initial step of the roll-out of the universal GP service.  In doing so, it has considered the importance of weighing the balance between, on the one hand, resolving the legal issues but with a further delay and, on the other hand, the need to bring forward an important Programme for Government commitment with the minimum of further delay.  No decision has been taken by the Cabinet Committee or by Government on changing the first step of the plan to extend GP care without fees to persons with chronic illnesses.  Instead, it has been agreed that we should prepare and set out a number of alternative options with regard to the phased implementation of a universal GP service without fees.  Minister Reilly and I expect to report back to the Cabinet Committee in the near future.  As part of this work, consideration will be given to the approaches, timing and financial implications of the phased implementation this universal health service.</p><p>  The Government has already made clear its commitment to delivering on the implementation of a GP service for the entire population by providing additional financial resources in the two most recent Budgets.  The HSE Vote now contains funding of &euro;30 million for this year for an initial phase of the provision of GP services as part of this Programme for Government commitment.</p></reply>

I have emphasised to the HSE the high priority the Government and I attach to this issue, and also the need to address NCHDs working conditions more generally.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive&rsquo;s Service Plan for 2013 specifically recognises the need to address EWTD compliance as a priority, stating that there will be a particular focus in the acute hospital service on the achievement of compliance with the European Working Time Directive amongst the non-consultant hospital doctor workforce, in line with the Implementation Plan submitted to the Commission in 2012.</p><p>  Key priorities for the HSE in 2013 are a reduction of average weekly hours worked and also a reduction in the duration of shifts undertaken. The Executive is bringing a strong and particular focus to the achievement of compliance with the Directive.  New and demanding targets and timescales have been issued to hospital managers and clinical directors and progress on a site-by-site basis will be assessed against these.  Measures the HSE has identified that will support NCHD retention include the protection of training time, the implementation of formal bleep policies and the transfer of tasks often inappropriately undertaken by NCHDs to more appropriate staff. </p><p>  I am satisfied that the HSE is making every effort to improve the working hours of NCHDs and to implement other measures to improve their working conditions which will in turn facilitate the provision of improved and safer delivery of services to patients.</p></reply>

Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports are managed by the Dublin Airport Authority and the Shannon Airport Authority which operate under clear commercial mandates, are entirely funded from their own internal resources and receive no Government funding supports.  In line with the recommendations of the Value for Money Review on the Regional Airports Programme published in 2011, funding under the Regional Airports Programme 2011- 2014 is being consolidated on the four regional airports of Donegal, Knock, Kerry and Waterford since the start of 2012.  I believe that this policy ensures the provision of the necessary transport access, with the appropriate level of quality of service, to underpin Ireland's economic recovery.</p><p>  A consultation paper on the development of a new civil aviation policy was published on my Department's website on 1 March this year inviting submissions from stakeholders and interested parties by 30 June 2013. Following receipt of submissions, a draft National Aviation Policy Statement will be issued in the second half of this year, with a view to a final policy document being published in 2014.  I would encourage all stakeholders, including the airports, to take this opportunity to give their views so that they can form an important input into this process. </p></reply>
