    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-18a.7.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121800065#WRA00500"><p>On 26 November Government approved the appointment of retired Circuit Court Judge Yvonne Murphy to assist in setting out a possible course of action in relation to women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomies.  Judge Murphy has been asked to meet a number of key interested parties, particularly the support groups for the women, and also the State Claims Agency, and the insurers.   Together with the Judge, I met the three support groups - Survivors of Symphysiotomy, Patient Focus and Survivors of Symhysiotomy Limited - after the Government meeting on 26 November,  to outline this plan to them.    </p><p>  Judge Murphy will complete her work within around 8 working weeks and provide a report to me as early as possible in February. I will then be in a position to revert to Government with detailed proposals, so that a decision can be taken as early as possible on the matter. </p><p>  The Government has also decided not to pursue amending the Statute of Limitations Act in respect of symphysiotomy claims.  This decision is based on strong legal advice that even if the statute bar is lifted, many women will still face long delays and many legal obstacles in pursuing their cases through the courts.  A number of women have not been able to access their files and in some cases the persons involved in their surgery are deceased. Analysis of the small number of cases, which have come through the legal process, shows that the legal costs alone in pursuing a case are extremely high. </p><p>  The actual liability of the State in law in respect of each individual symphysiotomy case is extremely difficult to determine.   However, there is a strong cross-party commitment to facilitate closure for the women who have been adversely affected by symphysiotomy,  many of whom are now elderly.</p><p>  My priority continues to be to ensure that the women who have had this procedure have their health needs comprehensively and professionally met. In this regard, the HSE provides a range of services to women who may be experiencing any adverse effects as a result of undergoing this procedure. These services include the provision of medical cards for the women, the availability of independent clinical advice and the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up. All these services are available on request by the women from the HSE nominated Symphysiotomy Liaison Officers.</p></reply>

Towards this end, funding of &euro;70 million and 890 posts have been provided to develop our community mental health services in 2012 and 2013.</p><p>  In Budget 2014, the Government has again re-committed to the continued development of our mental health services in these extremely challenging times, where the options for additional expenditure generally are very constrained.  &euro;20 million is being ringfenced for the further development of our mental health services in 2014.  This means that, despite serious resource pressures overall, funding of &euro;90m has been made available since 2012 up to end of 2014, which has been specifically ear-marked for mental health and suicide prevention. </p><p>This funding will enable the HSE to continue to develop and modernise our mental health services in line with the recommendations of<i> A Vision for Change </i>  and will allow for the recruitment of between 250 and 280 additional staff to further enhance our:</p><p>  - Adult Community Mental Health Teams;</p><p>  - Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams;</p><p>  - Specialist Mental Health Teams</p><p>  The recruitment process for these new posts will commence in the first Quarter of 2014, with all posts targeted to be in place by Quarter 4 of 2014.</p><p>   I can confirm to the Deputy that I have been assured that the remaining &euro;15 million which was due in 2014 for mental health will be restored in 2015.  I will also be advocating for an allocation of &euro;35 million in 2015 for mental health.</p></reply>

Staff of these organisations are public servants and are subject to Government pay policy.</p><p>  The HSE Internal Audit has indicated that the CEO referred to by the Deputy is in receipt of  two allowances, one for managing another location and one for assisting with fundraising for the organisation.  </p><p>  The HSE has a team of senior managers following up with all of the disability organisations and hospitals, including the agency referred to in the Deputy's question, to ensure that a clear plan to achieve full compliance with health sector pay policy is developed  with each agency.</p><p>  As set out in the pay policy, if  an  organisation wishes to make a business case for the continuation of an  unapproved allowance, it is open to it to do so and any such cases will be  considered  by the HSE (with the involvement of my Department and the Department  of  Public  Expenditure  and Reform, as necessary).  </p><p>  While this process is underway it would not be appropriate for me to comment on an individual case.  As stated previously, these issues are being examined on a case by case basis and it is important that due process is followed.</p></reply>

Serious problems of a long standing nature had been identified in managing scheduled and unscheduled care.  Similar difficulties had arisen in the Midwestern Regional Hospitals (Limerick/Nenagh/Ennis) and an existing senior HSE manager was assigned to this post.  Despite the best efforts of the HSE it had not been possible to attract senior managers with the requisite expertise to run the hospitals.  For that reason individual senior managers were identified from within the system to take on new Group CEO roles for a period.</p><p>  An individual was identified as the most appropriate person to take on the role of Chief Executive of the Galway/Roscommon hospital group, on a secondment basis for three years from his position as Chief Operations Officer of a major Dublin Hospital.  Following a request by my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approved this secondment on a personal-to-holder basis.  The remuneration package reflected the level at which the individual was being remunerated in respect of his duties in the public hospital and additional work undertaken separately for an associated private hospital.</p><p>  This arrangement was approved as an exceptional matter and did not represent a change in overall public service pay policy.</p></reply>

In this context, existing resources in Galway/Roscommon need to be re-shaped, and the priority is to achieve this in line with similar re-configurations undertaken, or planned, elsewhere nationally. </p><p>  In light of the above, a detailed assessment was carried out by HSE West, to reconfigure mental health services in Galway/Roscommon.   An Expert Group applied an open and transparent scoring system to assess the merits of all locations and the most appropriate skill mix for service delivery.  On foot of the conclusions of the Expert Group, I accept the Executive's recommendation to bring about much needed re-configuration of mental health services in this region. </p><p>  Community mental health services in this area will be enhanced on a transitional and phased basis,  bearing in mind that at least some staff from St.Brigid's in Ballinasloe will transfer to new community based provision. Flexibility exists within overall HSE West mental health resources to deliver on this objective.  </p><p>  HSE West has established an Implementation Team, including both patient and staff representation, to engage in appropriate consultation to progress this initiative and to address any outstanding local concerns. The Team has held a number of briefings and meetings to-date, including with the Mental Health Commission, Ballinasloe Town Council, and HSE staff.  In conjunction with relevant officials, I also recently met with a delegation of local public representatives, care professional and union representatives concerning re-configuration of services across Galway/Roscommon.  I am satisfied that the approach being taken by the HSE to improve future mental health services for this area is the best option, taking account of all relevant policy and  resource issues. </p></reply>

Given the budgetary constraints on the health services in recent years, it remains a priority to focus on improving the way services are organised and delivered, and to reduce costs so as to minimise any negative effect on service provision. In the context of 2014 I have identified key priorities based around the principles of fairness, equity and efficiency. The goal, wherever possible, is to cut the cost of services rather than the level or quality of the services delivered and to accelerate the pace of reform. </p><p>  There is ongoing and intensive engagement each month between officials of my Department and the HSE in the context of regular monitoring of expenditure. My Department also provides detailed analysis each month on expenditure trends to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and there is regular engagement between officials from that Department, my Department and the HSE.  </p><p>  The Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Services &ldquo;Future Health&rdquo; identified, as one of the key challenges, the need for an integrated financial management system. My Department is working with the HSE to ensure the development and roll out of a comprehensive financial management system as a matter of priority.</p><p>  As part of the process of further strengthening the financial management of the HSE, independent expertise was engaged to evaluate the financial performance management system and a Finance Reform Board has been established, chaired by the Director General, including senior HSE management and representatives from my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>  Proposals regarding the development and roll out of an integrated financial management system have been endorsed by the Board, with my full support and approval, and the HSE is now finalising a business case for submission to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

I requested that the HSE conduct an Internal Audit of all Section 38 funding recipients. As a result of this audit and as has been reported extensively, a considerable number of  funding recipients have been found to be in breach of Government pay policy with regard to the remuneration of senior staff. </p><p>  I have no plans to establish an independent inquiry into the practice of top-up payments to senior executives in all agencies and services under the Health Service Executive.  </p><p>  I have requested urgent action to ensure that every agency is fully compliant with Government pay policy.  </p><p>  The HSE has a team of senior managers following up with individual agencies and the Director General of the HSE met with the Chairpersons and the CEOs of all the Section 38 organisations last Thursday.  That meeting focused on the requirement of the Board of each Agency to further strengthen governance standards and set out the new requirement to furnish the HSE with a Compliance Statement from the current financial year and for each year thereafter.  This statement will have to be approved by the Board of each Agency on an annual basis, signed by the Chairman and another Director on behalf of the Board and submitted to the HSE together with the organisation&rsquo;s Annual Audited Accounts.  This Annual Compliance Statement will be required in addition to the annual Service Agreement between the Agency and the HSE.</p><p>  Further and separate meetings are being held by senior HSE managers with all of the disability organisations and hospitals concerned this week to ensure that a clear plan to achieve full compliance with health sector pay policy is developed  with each agency.</p><p>  As indicated above the HSE is urgently meeting individual agencies and it is important that due process is followed.</p></reply>

The Study identified a number of priority areas for action to improve the health status of Travellers including mental health and suicide; men&rsquo;s health; addiction/alcohol; diabetes and cardiovascular health. The annual HSE National Service Plan and associated Operational Plans contain a number of specific actions in respect of progressing identified health priorities many of which are delivered in partnership and collaboration with Travellers.</p><p>The over-arching principles of <i>Healthy Ireland </i>provide the required and appropriate platform through which the identified issues as they relate to Traveller health will be met. The need for a robust research and data framework to systematically build data systems around Traveller health will be met through the Outcomes Framework and the Research and Data Plan currently in development and which will provide for the systematic monitoring and evaluation of data and indicators relating to health status and the social and environmental determinants of health within robust governance arrangements. The identification, collection and evaluation of key data and indicators relating to health status and the social and environmental determinants of health will be central to the monitoring of  <i>Healthy Ireland</i>  . </p><p>The goal in <i>Healthy Ireland</i> to reduce health inequalities requires not only interventions to target particular health risks but also a focus on addressing these wider social determinants of health. The Framework provides for new arrangements to ensure effective co-operation between the health sector and other areas of Government and public services that are concerned with these broad determinants of health, including those of importance and relevance to all of those persons who experience health inequalities, including Travellers. The new structures established under <i>Healthy Ireland </i>  to enable and support its implementation will provide a focus on addressing the health needs of all groups experiencing health inequalities, including Travellers, and provides an opportunity to take a new approach to tackling issues such as health inequalities and the social determinants of health more effectively. </p></reply>

A review notification will indicate the card holder should complete a self-assessment or request the card holder to return evidence of household income, assessable outgoings and medical circumstances to enable a full review assessment be conducted by the HSE.  The HSE has increased this time line to four months in respect of those clients who were granted eligibility on the basis of discretion to allow an additional month to ensure that all pertinent medical and other data is provided for inclusion in the assessment process. All customers scheduled for review are notified and a balance of either full reviews or self-assessments is conducted. </p><p>  A reminder letter is issued a month later if the requested review form details have not been returned at that point. If a person does not return the review form within the time specified, continuing eligibility cannot be confirmed and the medical card cannot be reissued. In these circumstances, or where the review process establishes that a person no longer holds eligibility, the eligibility ceases.</p><p>  Persons are requested to return their completed review forms at least one month in advance of the due expiry date of their existing eligibility, in order to give the HSE sufficient time to carry out the review and/or to get back to the individuals, if the application is incomplete or requires any further details to be furnished. </p><p>  Where a review form is returned, but not fully completed by the expiry date, it is HSE policy to extend the eligibility of the client for a reasonable period of time until the review is carried out and a final decision made on the person's continuing eligibility, once there is appropriate communication from the client. Medical card holders who genuinely engage with the review of their medical card eligibility will not have their eligibility withdrawn before that review is complete. </p><p>  GPs are advised three months in advance of the review dates of their patients&rsquo; GP visit cards/medical cards and, subsequently, the following month and the month after that, if the patient has not returned the review form by that time.   </p><p>  GPs have full electronic visibility of the medical card panel of patients available to them and have the facility to electronically allow temporary extension of eligibility for expiring cards where a sensitive renewal is appropriate. The temporary extension may also be allowed where they are aware that a person is still availing of services but there may be something that prevents them from carrying out a standard review, e.g. a blind person with little family support.  GPs can also add new babies to existing cards.  All GPs have appropriate electronic access to the medical card eligibility database and they do not have to confirm medical card details by contacting HSE PCRS.   </p><p>  To ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources the HSE also undertakes reviews of medical card/GP visit card eligibility, whereby selected cardholders are asked to confirm that they are ordinarily resident in Ireland.  Being ordinarily resident in Ireland is a prerequisite for medical card/GP visit card eligibility.  Approximately 10,000 letters are issued each month and the cardholder is asked to sign and return a Declaration of Residency to the HSE.  On receipt of this declaration, eligibility to the GMS Scheme continues.  If a person does not return the Declaration of Residency form eligibility ceases.</p><p>It should be noted that each person who has eligibility to a medical card/GP visit card receives a plastic card on which a &rsquo;valid to&rsquo; date is printed.  This is the latest date that a review may be conducted in respect of that person.  Notwithstanding the &lsquo;valid to&rsquo; date printed on the card, the HSE    may also carry out random reviews of continued eligibility, to ensure that people who hold cards are still eligible, based on national guidelines</p><p>  The HSE's National Service Plan for 2014, which the Cabinet approved yesterday,  includes a &euro;23million savings target under medical card probity in 2014. </p></reply>

The policy establishes a framework for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, which seeks to ensure an integrated and quality assured approach in their management, so as to reduce the burden of these conditions.</p><p>  The implementation of the National Stroke Programme, since 2010 to date has resulted in improved services for all stroke programmes.  One of the programme's targets was to increase the rate of safe thrombolysis from 1% to 7.5% by the end of 2013. The HSE has recently reported a national stroke thrombolysis rate of 10.5% for the third quarter of this year, which exceeds targets and is comparable to rates internationally.  </p><p>  I am pleased to report that the national 24/7 access to safe stroke thrombolysis is progressing, with 24/7 access available now in 23 hospitals.  Ambulance access protocols are in place for other hospitals where acute stroke patients are taken to the nearest hospital providing 24/7 thrombolysis.  As mentioned earlier, significant improvements in thrombolysis rates have been noted as high as 10.5% so far this year.  </p><p>  Further developments in training on this matter are ongoing through the Thrombolysis Training programme.  The Stroke Foundation Education Programme has been developed and rolled out through the Centres for Nurse Education.  The programme empowers all care staff to provide better care and information to stroke patients.  TRASNA (Telemedicine Rapid Access for Stroke and Neurological Assessment) is being implemented.  Both the Mater and Cavan hospitals' TRASNA are operational since May; AMNCH and Naas will switch to new system in the coming months.  The HSE National Ambulance Service has worked in partnership with the Irish Heart Foundation whereby Emergency Ambulance Vehicles double as mobile billboards to improve public awareness of stroke symptoms and boost IHF F.A.S.T.

The implementation of this measure will require primary legislation. The necessary administrative arrangements will be made during the course of 2014 when the specifics of the legislation are known. It is not possible to be definitive about the average increase in workload resulting from the introduction of this measure.  However, the increase in the total number of GP visits arising from the introduction of a GP service without fees is expected to be low as this age group represents a relatively small proportion of the overall population and parents already bring their children to their GP, as necessary, regardless of whether they have to pay. </p></reply>

My priority has always been that my Department, the HSE and other Government Departments work together to provide appropriate supports tailored to the specific needs of each individual.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, legal action has recently been initiated by six families alleging personal injury in which they claim the development of narcolepsy resulted from the administration of the H1N1 pandemic vaccine.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment further on individual cases.</p><p>  Following the receipt of letters from solicitors representing the six individuals who have indicated their intention to initiate legal proceedings, legal advices were obtained by my Department recommending delegation of the management of these cases and, any subsequent similar cases to the State Claims Agency.</p><p>  A Government Decision to give effect to this approach was obtained in October and allowed the Taoiseach to sign the National Management Agency (Delegation of Claims Management Functions) (Amendment) Order 2013 on 15 October.  The management of the cases then transferred to the State Claims Agency.</p><p>  The State Claims Agency informed the HSE that it should cease making ongoing out of pocket payments to individuals who have initiated legal action and that these individuals should, as happens in every comparable litigated case, include these expenses as party of any special damages claim.  The expenses claimed included cost of accommodation, travel and other out of pocket expenses.</p><p>  Ongoing or future out of pocket expenses of litigants, arising from the action on which the litigation is based, forms part of the broader assessment of damages at the conclusion of the action whether at trial or where a settlement has been agreed.  This is the normal practice in legal proceedings. </p><p>  I became aware of the withdrawal of the letter by the HSE on the day it occurred. The HSE's own communications states that it was never the intention to withdraw discretionary medical cards or the provision of other health benefits and supports.  The HSE has apologised for any distress or upset caused and is clarifying the situation with the families involved.</p><p>  In relation to the number of identified cases, the Irish Medicines Board has received 50 reports to date which confirm a diagnosis of narcolepsy with symptom onset following pandemic vaccination.</p></reply>

While the Report does not specify ethnicity, 10 of the 25 deaths reported in the three year period were women not born in Ireland.  There was no evidence of clustering of cases in any one hospital.</p><p>  A significant issue identified in the report was engagement with maternity services and the importance of the availability of interpretive services. A similar report in the UK identified late presentation, poor attendance and poor engagement as risk factors. The HSE is working to ensure that all women, regardless of ethnicity, engage fully with health care services as early as possible in their pregnancy. With regard to women who come from outside of Ireland, one of the initiatives under development is a standardised model for the provision of interpretive services. This will ensure that patients and health care staff have access to an appropriate translation service when required and that the importance of engaging with maternity services is fully understood. </p><p>  Pregnant women who have underlying medical conditions are identified as having a higher level of risk to their health in pregnancy. A particular concern highlighted by the report was the issue of non-Irish national patients receiving alternative medical advice from outside the country.  It is therefore important to ensure that this cohort of women have access to appropriate medical advice and information in Ireland including pre-conceptual counselling and referral to specialist consultants. To this end a range of health information resources are translated into foreign languages and made available as appropriate.</p></reply>

From 16 October 2013, tax relief for medical insurance premiums has been restricted to the first &euro;1,000 per adult and the first &euro;500 per child insured.  Any portion of premium paid in excess of these ceilings will no longer qualify for tax relief.  The measure is projected to save the Exchequer &euro;94 m in 2014 and &euro;127 m in a full year.</p><p>  The new ceilings will ensure some continuing support via the tax system for those who purchase private medical insurance policies, while reducing Exchequer exposure to more expensive policies.  This will affect some consumers, including those over the age of 50, depending on the cost of the policies that they purchase.  While individuals can of course opt for less expensive policies and therefore avoid the impact of this measure, it is important that they fully understand the level of cover their policy provides.</p><p>  Many consumers can make savings on their health insurance premiums by reviewing the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured.  The Health Insurance Authority provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's web-site, www.hia.ie, has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p><p>  With regard to health insurance costs generally, I  have consistently emphasised the vital need to address the rising cost of private health insurance and the necessity for all private health insurers to address their cost base aggressively.  Last year, I established the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance to generate ideas to address health insurance costs.  In June of this year, I appointed an independent Chairperson, Mr. Pat McLoughlin, to work with my Department and the insurers on a review process to give effect to real cost reductions in the private health insurance market.  Mr. McLoughlin recently submitted his report under phase 1 of the review process and the contents are being examined by myself and the health insurers.  The second phase of this review will commence immediately and will report within three months.</p><p>  I will continue to focus on addressing costs in the private health insurance market, to keep insurance as affordable as possible for people who wish to avail of private health insurance.  The Government's clear objective is for the health insurance market to remain as competitive and affordable as possible, as we move towards a new system of Universal Health Insurance. </p></reply>

This Part of the Act was commenced on 1st June 2007 in respect of children aged 5.  </p><p>  There has been a very significant rise in overall activity around the assessment process in recent years in respect of the children now encompassed by the process.  The number of application assessments received in 2012 was 3,505 which is over 400 applications more than in 2010.  In 2013, a further increase in applications has been experienced.  While the HSE faces significant challenges in respect of meeting the statutory time-frames which apply to the assessment of need process, given the number and complexity of cases, it is endeavouring to address the issue within available resources. </p><p>  The assessment process under the Disability Act 2005 can take place in parallel with any intervention which is identified as necessary for the child.  The HSE has issued guidance to its staff to this effect.  In addition, the HSE has instituted measures which include:  prioritising assessments, holding additional clinics, contracting the private sector to conduct assessments and reconfiguring resources to target greatest need. </p><p>  With regard to the roll-out of  network disability teams, following the publication of a report from the National Disability Authority, commissioned by my Department and the HSE, a major emphasis is being placed on reconfiguring disability services for children into geographically-based early intervention and school aged teams.  This is being done as part of the HSE's Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme, which is underway.  Of the twenty five HSE areas, six now have network early intervention and school age teams in operation.  A further five areas have network early intervention teams in place and are developing school age services.  </p></reply>

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board  is the body responsible for the capital project.  Last August, I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January this year.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise to the project.   In August  I also announced appointments to the Children's Hospital Group Board which, as client for the project, will play a key role in ensuring the new hospital is optimally designed and completed as swiftly as possible.  In November, the Programme Director of the Development Board and the CEO of the Children's Hospital Group were appointed.  The CEO of the Children's Hospital Group will play a central role in driving the integration of the three hospitals, and the project as a whole.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission. The new Development Board has reviewed the design team procurement process, which had been initiated in July, and decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and taking into account changing market conditions. While this means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the Development Board is confident there will be no delay to the project overall.    Pre-application planning discussions have commenced, a masterplan for the St. James's Hospital campus is being prepared and St. James's Hospital is working closely with the Development Board and the HSE in relation to the decant phase of the project. Work on the review of urgent care centre configuration is at an advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.</p><p>  In October, the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform announced that up to &euro;200m would be made available for the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding.  The level of funding now in place underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this priority project.  Also, philanthropic / non-Exchequer funding will be sought to the maximum and most appropriate degree.  Work on developing a detailed timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.  However, at this stage, the Development Board is confident that construction can begin in Spring 2015.</p></reply>

The event was hosted and organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.   This was the third in a series of commemorative lectures forming the Iveagh House Lecture series. Each address has recalled a significant event in our history; the first, by Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson last year, on the centenary of the Ulster Covenant, reflected on the life of Edward Carson, Irish unionism and its place in our political life today. Earlier this year, Governor of Maryland, Martin O&rsquo;Malley, recalled the visit to Ireland fifty years ago of President John F Kennedy and reflected on Irish American relations.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, we are committed to the commemoration of historical events in a peaceful and inclusive manner, based on the principles of historical accuracy and in cooperation with key partners, at home and abroad. In line with this approach, the lecture was attended by guests from Ireland and Britain, members of both traditions in Northern Ireland, historians, leaders from civil society and elected representatives past and present.</p><p>  Several of the guests had been involved in the negotiation of the Declaration and in later phases of the Peace Process.  I was pleased in particular to welcome Mrs. Kathleen Reynolds, representing her husband former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds, and members of her family, as well as former T&aacute;naiste Dick Spring.  </p><p>  My opening address reflected on the significance of the Declaration in paving the way for an eventual IRA ceasefire leading, ultimately, to the conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement. I noted the long, intensive and difficult work undertaken by the governments led by John Major and Albert Reynolds. This work was continued and developed by John Bruton as Taoiseach. I also acknowledged the immense contribution by Senator George Mitchell, who was also in attendance and who spoke about his personal experience of the peace process.</p><p>  John Major spoke of his work in building Anglo-Irish relations, the approach which underpinned his approach to negotiating peace and of how setbacks were overcome. He spoke also of the deepening of the relationship between Ireland and Britain in the twenty years following the Declaration.  His comments, which were broadcast by RTE, were important and insightful, and I appreciated in particular his positive and generous spirit and his encouraging remarks on the future of Northern Ireland.</p></reply>

The primary initiative is the Fellowship Training Programme, the objective of which is to strengthen the capacity of partner organisations benefiting from Ireland&rsquo;s support in our key partner countries.  Fellowships are targeted at mid-career professionals who, on completion of the Programme, have committed to putting their acquired skills into practice for the benefit of the partner organisation and the wider community.  Fellowship awards are also aligned to priorities and thematic areas identified in Ireland&rsquo;s country strategy programmes in our key partner countries.</p><p>  The fellowships are awarded annually to successful candidates from key partner countries (Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam, Zambia), as well as Palestine, Timor Leste and Burundi for study in Ireland or within their own country or region. From 2014, applications for Fellowships will also be accepted from candidates in Sierra Leone.  </p><p>Separately, Irish Aid fellowships have been awarded to successful post- graduate applicants from Vietnam under the Irish Development Experience Sharing Programme (IDEAS) and from South Africa under the Kadar Asmal Fellowship Programme.  The IDEAS programme involves sharing experience of Ireland&rsquo;s economic and social development with Vietnam in order to build the capacity of Vietnamese institutions engaged in economic and financial governance.  The provision of fellowships for Vietnamese post-graduate students to study in Ireland is an integral component of the programme.  The aim of the Kader Asmal Fellowship programme is to strengthen the capacity of partner organisations in South Africa to contribute to the reduction of poverty and vulnerability through economic development  .</p><p>  Each of these programmes is managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in cooperation with our Embassies and a management agency, the Irish Council for International Students.  </p><p>Under the budget for the aid programme,  &euro;1.52 million has been provided for the Fellowship Training Programme in 2013.  This allocation is for the costs associated with fellowships awarded to   study in Ireland or in the fellows&rsquo; own country or region.  This figure also includes the management agency fees.  </p><p>Costs of &euro;970,750 will be incurred in 2013 under the Irish Development Experience Sharing Programme for Vietnam, and   &euro;63,897 under the Kader Asmal Programme for South Africa.  All of this funding is counted towards the calculation of Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance.</p><p>  The precise allocations for fellowships for 2014 will be finalised in January and the budget for 2015 will be decided in the context of the annual budgetary process for that year.</p></reply>

Details of the services and supports available to refugees are published on the website of the linked Reception and Integration Agency.  A number of other Government Departments also have responsibilities in this regard, including the Departments of Social Protection, Health and Children, Education and Skills and Foreign Affairs and Trade.   Comprehensive information relating to the number of refugees in Ireland or the cost of providing housing for them is not available in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  However, every year the Department submits to the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) details of Ireland&rsquo;s Official Development Assistance (ODA) expenditure in the previous year.  In line with DAC and internationally-recognised reporting definitions and criteria, donors may include, as eligible ODA, certain expenditure relating to the maintenance of refugees during the first twelve months of their stay in the host country, most notably for the provision of food, shelter and training.  Such costs for 2012, estimated at &euro;101,000 by the Department of Justice and Equality, represented only a very small proportion of Ireland&rsquo;s total ODA spend of &euro;628 million that year.  It should be noted that costs associated with the integration of refugees into the economy of the donor country, or resettlement within the donor country, are specifically excluded by the DAC from ODA eligibility.    </p></reply>

We have played a strong role in the development of an international consensus on the issue of debt cancellation for the least developed countries.    When the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were being elaborated in 2000 and subsequent years, it was recognised internationally that high levels of external debt were placing a heavy burden on some of the poorest countries in the world.  Because they had to use a significant portion of their foreign currency earnings to repay debt, many heavily indebted poor countries could not devote sufficient resources to the achievement of the MDGs, including the Goal to halve the number of people living in extreme poverty.</p><p>  In 2006 the Irish Government demonstrated its commitment and leadership in the area of debt relief by contributing its full financial share of over &euro;116m to the two main multilateral initiatives to address debt relief, the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, while other states opted to pay for this debt cancellation over a much longer period and in smaller instalments. </p><p>  We have consistently also worked with Governments in our partner countries in Africa to help ensure that the additional money from debt relief has been spent on programmes that benefit the poor.  It is important to note that all of Ireland&rsquo;s development assistance is provided in the form of grants, and not loans.</p><p>  On 12 December I attended the EU Foreign Affairs Council (Development) which adopted Council Conclusions on &ldquo;Financing Poverty Eradication and Sustainable Development Beyond 2015&rdquo;.  Under these Conclusions, the EU pledges continued support for existing debt relief initiatives and to promote responsible lending and borrowing practices.</p><p>  As more and more countries graduate from the multilateral debt relief initiatives, the question of how they can maintain their debt at sustainable levels has become more relevant.  It is for this reason that Ireland contributes &euro; 100,000 annually to the UNCTAD Debt Management and Financial Analysis System programme which provides software solutions and technical assistance to developing countries to manage their debt sustainably.</p></reply>

As the number of fatalities rises towards 120,000, including 12,000 children under five, there are now approximately nine million people in need of immediate life-saving support. In addition to more than 6.5 million people who are displaced within Syria, there are currently 2.2 million Syrians who have fled to neighbouring countries.    Ireland has been to the fore in the international efforts to help alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people and is one of the most generous contributors to the humanitarian response on a per capita basis.

In addition, Ireland is an important donor to the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) which this year has allocated US$82 million to Syria and neighbouring countries. </p><p>  We are currently actively examining future support for Syria and we are preparing for the second pledging conference for Syria and region due to take place in Kuwait on 15 January 2014. </p><p>  The Government has matched the very significant humanitarian contribution to Syria with support to international efforts to find a sustainable political solution to the crisis.  We have called clearly for safe and unimpeded humanitarian access. We have urged all parties to the conflict to fully respect international humanitarian law and to refrain from the targeting of civilians. In view of the immense needs in Syria and neighbouring countries hosting Syrian refugees, Ireland will continue to call for increased support to the humanitarian relief effort, both within the EU and internationally.</p></reply>

Current estimates indicate that the Typhoon affected more than 14 million people, with almost 4 million remaining displaced, including approximately 1.5 million children. The full human toll of this disaster remains unclear but over 6,000 lives have been lost to date.   Ireland was amongst the first to respond to this disaster, providing immediate, life-saving assistance. Our contribution to date stands at over &euro;3.6 million making us one of the most generous contributors to this relief effort on a per capita basis. Over &euro;2.6million in funding has been provided through our key NGO partners. This funding is being used for the provision of emergency food and non-food items; water, sanitation and hygiene; emergency health care and, protection of vulnerable women and children.  Ireland&rsquo;s support will benefit up to 50,000 households. Ireland is making a real difference on the ground.</p><p>  To date, Ireland has authorised four airlifts of essential relief items from our emergency pre-positioned stocks, the most recent of which arrived in the Philippines on Monday, 2 December. This brings the total amount of essential relief items provided by Ireland to 166 tonnes, valued at approximately &euro;967,000 in total. According to the latest figures, Ireland is the second largest contributor of emergency stocks through the UN World Food Programme (WFP) Humanitarian Response Depot system (second only to the World Food Programme itself). In addition, Ireland deployed five members of its Rapid Response Corps to the Philippines to assist UN relief teams there.</p><p>  I authorised the deployment of the Government's technical mission which arrived in the Philippines on Thursday 28 November. The purpose of this mission is to obtain a detailed analysis of the longer-term needs of the worst affected regions and to explore ways in which Ireland can most effectively contribute to the recovery process and rebuild for the future. </p><p>  The team has returned to Dublin and is formulating its recommendations on how best Ireland can assist the Philippines recover from this terrible disaster in the medium to long term. Further financial assistance in 2014 will be considered on the basis of this technical team report.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland is adamantly opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances and accordingly seeks its universal abolition.  We are aware of concerns expressed by the President of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) that these actions may lead to uncertainty in the political situation on the Korean peninsula.  Ireland is monitoring the situation closely through our Embassy in Seoul, which is also accredited to the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK).</p><p>  Ireland together with our international partners in the EU and UN have on numerous occasions  condemned the current human rights situation in the DPRK and strongly urge the Government there to immediately put an end to the human rights violations in the country. </p><p>  In February, my Department conveyed directly to the North Korean authorities Ireland&rsquo;s strong condemnation of their nuclear and ballistic missile testing activities, and urged North Korea to re-engage with the international community as expressed in my statement on the matter.</p><p>  During a visit to the DPRK in June 2013, the Deputy Head of Mission to Ireland&rsquo;s Embassy in Seoul raised the issues of human rights and access to the DRPK by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK and other UN treaty monitoring agencies.  </p><p>  In March 2013, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) established a Commission of Inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in the DRPK.  The Commission has heard testimonies from victims who have suffered human rights abuses in the DPRK and will report to the UNHRC in March 2014.  It is disappointing that the DPRK will not cooperate with the Commission of inquiry.  Ireland stands by the resolutions passed by the UN Human Rights Council which calls upon the DPRK to cooperate with the UN and its human rights mechanisms.In November 2013, during the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly, Ireland supported the adoption of a resolution concerning the Situation of Human Rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  This resolution highlighted the systematic, widespread and grave violations of civil, political, economic and social and cultural rights in the DPRK.  It also expressed serious concern at the absence of due process and the rule of law, including fair trial guarantees and an independent judiciary, and the use of extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions. </p><p>  Ireland will continue to monitor the situation closely through our Embassy in Seoul, and will remain in close contact at the EU and UN on these matters.</p></reply>

As the Deputy notes, this is type of track and trace system which seems to be applicable to legitimate production and may be more relevant in countries where cigarettes are manufactured.   The tax status of cigarettes in Ireland, regardless of where they are produced, is identifiable immediately by the presence or absence of the proper tax stamp on the packet. This system works very effectively in relation to legitimate supplies of cigarettes in Ireland. Cigarette smuggling is a global problem estimated to account for some 11% of consumption world-wide and it is not clear how the introduction of further controls in the domestic market alone would assist in tackling the illegal distribution of untaxed cigarettes smuggled from a variety of source countries.    </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Protocol against the illicit trade in tobacco products, agreed in November 2012 and shortly to be signed by Ireland is designed to offer a global approach to tackling the illegal trade, through strict rules and controls on the supply and movement of tobacco products.</p><p>  It stipulates that all those engaged in the tobacco supply chain must conduct due diligence on their customers. The aim is to ensure that sales reflect a real and legitimate demand, and to eliminate the creation of excess supply which could be used in the black market. It is further expected that a global tracking and tracing regime for all tobacco products will be set up within five years of the Protocol's implementation.</p></reply>

At the end of 2012 Revenue had approximately 2,000 staff engaged directly in activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These front-line activities include anti-smuggling and anti-evasion, investigation and prosecution, audit, assurance checks, anti-avoidance, returns compliance and debt collection. The related cost of salaries, overtime and other expenses for the year for these staff was approximately &euro;108m.  The Revenue Commissioners attach a high priority to dealing with this criminal activity."  Revenue's Strategy on Combating the Illicit Tobacco Trade (2011-2013)", which is published on the Revenue website (www.revenue.ie), includes a range of measures designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for illicit tobacco products.</p><p>  This multifaceted strategy includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, use of analytics and detection technologies, and optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and inland to intercept and seize contraband products and to prosecute those involved.</p><p>  Interception of illicit tobacco products at importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.</p><p>  In carrying out this important work Revenue works in close cooperation with other relevant agencies, both nationally and internationally. There is extensive cooperation in this jurisdiction between Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the agencies in the State and in Northern Ireland work closely together, through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to combat the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market. In addition, cooperation takes place with other Revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, in the ongoing efforts to tackle the illicit trade in tobacco products at international level.</p></reply>

I was not prescriptive in how this was to be achieved respecting their differing State ownership and investment and paths to profitability. I have reviewed the letters submitted and in light of the various industrial relations developments since then I now am satisfied that the banks will deliver remuneration cost savings of 6% to 10%.    The Bank of Ireland proposal focused on changes to the defined benefit pension scheme that will affect all staff who are members of this scheme and as the deputy will be aware an agreement has now been reached with the IBOA in this regard. The AIB proposal included the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual along with other changes including an increase in working hours which were agreed with the IBOA in July. The PTSB proposal centred on the wind-up of the defined benefit pension scheme for all staff who were members of this scheme and this has now been completed.</p><p>  For clarity senior management in the banks have made the following contributions; in the case of Bank of Ireland the proposed pension changes affect all staff in the BSPF scheme including the Chief Executive. In the case of AIB reductions in pay and benefits of higher earners ranging from 7.5% to 15% were implemented in the second half of 2012 and it also should be noted that the members of the AIB Leadership Team all joined the bank since 2008 and receive reduced pension contributions from their predecessors. In the case of PTSB all senior management joined the bank since 2008 and are on lower remuneration levels than their predecessors.</p></reply>

I have informed the Deputy recently that under the Relationship Frameworks that govern the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the State supported banks&rsquo;, the bank&rsquo;s Board and Management team retain responsibility and authority for determining the banks&rsquo; strategies and commercial policies and conducting their day-to-day operations. The appointment of rent receivers to properties is a day-to-day operational decision for the Boards and Management teams of the covered institutions.    I have been advised by the Central Bank of Ireland that it has no plans to put a protocol in place for the operation of rent receivers at this time.</p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which falls within the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, provides the main regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector and for the operation of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. The Act provides for security of tenure and specifies minimum obligations for landlords and tenants under a tenancy. In addition, the Act contains provisions relating to the setting of rent and rent reviews and sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy. </p><p>  In circumstances where a receiver is appointed in respect of a rented dwelling, it is important that the rights of tenants under both tenancy agreements and the Residential Tenancies Act are protected. While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on how a receiver is appointed, the statutory or contractual rights of tenants should not be compromised. </p><p>  My colleague, the Minister of State for Housing and Planning, Minister Jan O'Sullivan T.D., has informed me that arising out of her concerns on this issue, she met with the Irish Banking Federation in relation to the provision of guidance in regard to receivers and their responsibilities towards tenants. As a result of that meeting the IBF has published a guide to receivership for residential tenants. </p><p>  I am also informed by Minister O'Sullivan that she is also examining whether amendments to the Residential Tenancies Act, in the context of the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012, could help to bring greater clarity in this area that would be of benefit to tenants and indeed to receivers in how they fulfil their functions.  The Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il and is currently before the Seanad.</p></reply>

Bank of Ireland has informed me that in certain cases it will require a customer to sign a confidentiality agreement prior to entering into discussions in relation to the formulation of an alternative arrangement/restructuring.

Every complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman is dealt with on its own individual merits and consequently the timeframe can vary considerably in accordance with the nature of the particular issues which arise.

In that regard I am assured that Revenue is very conscious of the challenges that exist for some businesses in meeting their tax obligations in a timely manner.  Its debt collection caseworkers will always seek to work proactively with taxpayers and viable businesses that engage positively to agree mutually satisfactory arrangements to overcome temporary cashflow difficulties in preference to deploying enforcement options.  I am informed that the total outstanding tax debt at 31 March 2013, the latest date for which published data is available, amounted to &euro;2,006m. An aged analysis of this debt figure is included in the following table.</p><p>  However the &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; portion of the total debt, which excludes both debt under appeal to the Appeal Commissioners and insolvent debt was &euro;1,180m at 31 March 2013. This figure, which is a more accurate reflection of the debt available to Revenue to manage through its debt management programmes was &euro;137m or 10% less than the same period in 2012.  Of the &euro;1,180 million &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; figure at 31 March 2013, &euro;476m was under active enforcement and a further &euro;124m was the subject of phased payment arrangements.</p><p>  I am assured by Revenue that, notwithstanding the continuing very difficult environment, achieving further reductions in collectible debt is a key strategic objective. I am satisfied that the continuing trend in decreasing levels of &lsquo;debt available for collection&rsquo; over the last couple of years is encouraging and clearly demonstrates the success of Revenue&rsquo;s current approach to debt management.</p><p><b>Age Analysis of Total Debt by Year of Assessment as at

Paragraph 10 of Section 14 provides that relevant employers must submit an annual return to the Revenue Commissioners detailing, inter alia, the number of employees and the amounts of exempt income claimed under the programme.  The first year of the programme was 2012 and employer returns received to date for 2012 have provided the following results:</p><p>Numbers of employees availing of the scheme: 7</p><p>Numbers of employers with employees availing: 7</p><p>Amount of tax forgone: &euro;60,600 (tax free income of 147,817 by 41% for 7 individuals only)</p><p>Numbers of employees for whom education fees were paid: none</p><p>Amount of education fees paid: &euro; nil</p><p>Number of jobs created: 5</p><p>The 7<font color="#0041C2"> </font>individuals qualifying for the relief received an aggregate total tax-free remuneration of &euro;147,817   and the amount of tax forgone is estimated assuming the top rate of income tax rate of 41%.</p><p>  Following a review of SARP claims it was identified that 3 claims did not satisfy the eligibility criteria and the relief was found to be not appropriate  for 2012.  The statistics have, therefore, been updated to exclude these claims, and this accounts for the decrease in some of the figures that were provided with previous information.

I am advised that the Special Liquidators will comply with the timelines, namely that the valuation of IBRC&rsquo;s loan assets be completed by 30 November 2013 and that the sale of IBRC assets be completed by 31 December 2013 or as soon as practicable thereafter.</p><p>  The Special Liquidators have advised me that the valuation of the IBRC loan assets was completed by 30 November 2013. In arriving at the valuation of an IBRC loan asset, the independent advisors were advised to apply a discount rate of 4.5% in determining the value of future cash flows of the asset. Further, a discount of 2.32% will be applied across all loan asset valuations to take into account security and title issues associated with loan assets, to arrive at the Valuation Price.  There is an obligation on the Special Liquidators to ensure that the assets of IBRC are sold at a price that is equal to or in excess of the independent valuations that have been obtained. Should a bid not be received that is in excess of the independent valuation obtained, the loan asset will be acquired by NAMA. No further discount will be applied to the loan asset in its transfer to NAMA.</p><p>  The sales process plan and timeline has been developed following professional advice and in light of requirements of a robust and credible sales process.  The Special Liquidators have also corresponded with all IBRC borrowers providing them with an opportunity to make written representations on the method of disposal of their loans and the criteria for determining who may bid for loan assets.  Consideration was given to Borrower representations and the Special Liquidators are in the process of responding to these Borrower representations.</p><p>  The IBRC loan books have been divided into portfolios and subsequently subdivided into tranches depending on the professional advice obtained for ensuring that the maximum value is obtained for the sale of the Loan Assets.  The sales process is currently underway across all portfolios/tranches and the Special Liquidators confirm that the sale of the IBRC assets will be completed by 31 December 2013 or as soon as practicable thereafter.</p><p>  Last week we witnessed the successful conclusion of the bidding phase for the first portfolio of assets brought to the market by the Special Liquidators. Binding bids for the Evergreen portfolio consisting primarily of Irish corporate loans with a par value of c. &euro;2.5 billion were received on Friday 6th December and the Special Liquidators expect that c.84% of the portfolio (by par value) will be sold to third parties at prices in excess of the independent valuations.  The sales processes for the remaining portfolios in IBRC are on-going and are expected to be concluded in early 2014.</p></reply>

In parallel, beginning in March 2012 Revenue examined in detail PAYE taxpayers who had DSP pensions that had not been returned for prior years.  As is normal practice for any compliance work that they undertake, the Commissioners focussed initially on the highest risk cases, which are those cases where the annual non-DSP income exceeded &euro;50,000.  They moved next to those whose non-DSP income was between &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000 and then to those whose non-DSP income was between &euro;30,000 and &euro;40,000.

It needs to be borne in mind in viewing these data that the level of seizures can vary significantly between years, because of factors such as the occurrence of a very large seizure in a given time period.   The incidence of illicit cigarettes in Ireland is evaluated through annual surveys of smokers undertaken for the Revenue Commissioners and the National Tobacco Control Office of the Health Services Executive. The results for 2012 found that 13% of smokers had an illicit pack of cigarettes, and the comparable figure for 2011 was 15%. This would suggest that the extent of the problem is being contained, as a result of the extensive action being taken against the smuggling and sale of illicit products. A further survey was carried out recently, and it is expected that the results will be available in the first quarter of next year.</p><p>  The work of the Revenue Commissioners against the illicit trade includes a range of measure designed to identify and target those who are engaged in it, with a view to seizing the illicit products and prosecuting those responsible. Key elements of Revenue&rsquo;s strategy include ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, development and sharing of intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, the use of analytics and detection technologies, and ensuring optimum deployment of resources at points of importation and within the country.</p><p>  Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling and intelligence, as well as the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages. Revenue&rsquo;s enforcement officers also target the illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private commercial premises. There is extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating the illicit trade, and the relevant agencies in the State also work closely with their counterparts in Northern Ireland through a cross-border group on tobacco enforcement, to target the organised crime groups that are responsible for a large proportion of the illegal tobacco market.</p><p>  Revenue has approximately 2,000 staff engaged on activities that are dedicated to target and confront non-compliance. These staff are deployed across a number of compliance and enforcement programmes that reflect the strategic and business priorities set out in Revenue&rsquo;s Statement of Strategy and Annual Corporate Plan. These programmes include anti-smuggling controls, audit, assurance checks, debt management, investigations, prosecutions and anti-avoidance interventions. Resources are continuously redeployed across the programmes in response to the Commissioners&rsquo; assessment of risk. It is not possible, therefore, to disaggregate the resources deployed exclusively on tackling the smuggling and sale of illicit cigarettes. </p><p>  The Revenue Commissioners assure me that combating the illegal tobacco will continue to be a high priority for them, that they are committed to maintaining their extensive programme of action against all stages of the supply chain for illicit tobacco products, and that they will continue to make very effort to ensure that those involved in the illicit trade are brought to account before the Courts for their criminal activities.</p></reply>

Section 10B of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) provides that an exemption from the charge to LPT may apply to a residential property purchased, built or adapted to make it suitable for occupation by a permanently and totally incapacitated individual as their sole or main residence, where an award has been made by the Personal Injuries Assessment Board or a court, or where a trust has been established, specifically for the benefit of such individuals.  In the case of adaptations to a property, the exemption will only apply where the cost of the adaptations exceeds 25% of the market value of the property before it is adapted.  The exemption ends if the property is sold and the incapacitated individual no longer occupies it as his or her sole or main residence.</p><p>  I am advised that section 189(A) of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 (as amended), defines 'incapacitated individual' as an individual who is permanently and totally incapacitated, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, from being able to maintain himself or herself.  Entitlement to the exemption provided for in section 10B will depend on whether the extent of a person&rsquo;s disability is such that they are permanently and totally incapacitated from being able to maintain himself or herself.</p><p>  Section 15A of the 2012 Act (as amended) provides for a reduction in the market value of a residential property that has been adapted for occupation by a disabled person where the adaptation has been grant-aided or approved for grant aid, by a local authority, and where the adaptation increases the market value of the property.  As the Deputy states in both Questions that the family has paid for the renovation themselves, it appears that they would not be eligible to apply for this relief. </p><p>  It should also be noted that the impact of such adaptations on a property may decrease its value which may in turn impact on the LPT liability.</p><p>  With regard to Question 54727/13, given the circumstances of the case, Revenue will make direct contact with the person to discuss the specifics and advise on any possible entitlement under either section 10B or section 15A of the 2012 Act (as amended).</p></reply>

A refurbishment programme was carried out in the late 1980s by Wicklow County Council.   I understand that prior to 2007 there were a number of fatal fires in the estate but I am advised that none of the fires was attributable to electrical problems in the properties.  Nonetheless, at the request of elected members of the council it was agreed to engage consultants to survey and report on the properties.  Following a selection process from an independent interview board, consultants were selected to carry out a survey and report on fire safety of local authority houses in the estate.  The survey involved a visual inspection of an agreed number of houses and an "opening up" survey of some houses.  Details of the report were not released as it refers to specific properties.  I am advised the report is the subject of an appeal under the Freedom of Information Acts. </p><p>  The issues raised by the Deputy are primarily a matter for the local authority concerned and housing policy generally is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I can confirm that the estate in question has not been previously raised with me.</p><p>  Issues relating to fire safety are not relevant in determining liability to the LPT. Accordingly, whilst homeowners or properties in this estate may be exempt from LPT for another reason, or may be entitled to avail of a deferral arrangement under the legislation, there is no specific reduction in or exemption from LPT in the circumstances outlined.  However, the condition of a residential property is relevant to its valuation for LPT purposes.</p></reply>

Its role is confined to administering the tax exemption scheme, which includes vetting and processing applications from bodies claiming exemption from tax on the basis that they are charities. The role also includes monitoring such bodies once they have been granted the exemption to ensure that the relevant terms and conditions continue to be fulfilled.</p><p>Revenue has also advised me that because of its obligation to observe confidentiality it is precluded from commenting on the tax affairs of individual bodies.</p><p>However, it has assured me that procedures are in place to ensure that bodies that are granted charitable tax exemption are subject to reviews to ensure that the terms of the exemption continue to be fulfilled. These reviews are carried out on an on-going basis throughout the sector and all matters which come to the attention of Revenue are taken into consideration in the context of such reviews. Where a body is found not to be complying with the terms of its exemption, appropriate remedial action is taken.

The identification process for DEIS was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available. It was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's Regional Offices and the Inspectorate. The choice of variables included in the assessment of disadvantage was guided by the definition of disadvantage in the Education Act, (1998) which refers both to learning outcomes and to social and economic factors.</p><p>  In the primary sector the identification of primary schools, for participation in DEIS, was based on analysis of a survey which identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the School Support Programme.

All Recognised schools, regardless of their philosophy or ethos, are required to comply with the Education Act 1998 and the Rules for National Schools. </p><p>  My Department met with the school concerned in October 2012 at which it was agreed that a number of issues had to be addressed by the school so as to satisfy the requirements for permanent recognition. Both the Department and school concerned have committed to ongoing engagement, and the Department's inspectorate agreed to provide a number of advisory/support visits to the </p><p>school to assist them in making progress to fulfil the requirements. The first set of the advisory visits occurred in the last academic year and further visits are scheduled. </p><p>  It was also agreed that the school would have their period of provisional recognition extended by three years to allow them adequate time to reach the requirements.

Thus, primary schools receive capitation funding in January and June, and the ancillary services grant in March. </p><p>  The amount of grant paid to an individual primary school for capitation and ancillary services is determined by the school's enrolment, subject to a minimum grant for both capitation and ancillary services in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60, and a maximum ancillary services grant in the case of schools with enrolments of 500 or more. </p><p>  The Deputy may wish to note that Circular 40/2009 clarifies issues relating to the allocation of funding for primary schools.

These include: the introduction of a third major transfer point for students between primary level and third level; The question of which school the Transition Year should be placed in; The undermining of Department policy to maintain as common a curriculum as possible for as long as possible to avoid the risk of specialisation too early and school drop out; The potential danger that the senior school will come to be seen as the 'specialist' Leaving Certificate centre into which transfers are sought at senior cycle; The loss of the advantages to be gained when teachers regularly teach students from first year to sixth year; The possibility of students from other schools seeking entry to the senior school with the attendant repercussions for other schools. </p><p>  Apart for these compelling educational reasons, patronage of the new school, was awarded to the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB) specifically on the basis that it would deliver the prescribed curriculum at both Junior and Senior Cycle. Any change to this stated intention could lead to a challenge or to calls for the patronage determination process to be commenced afresh. This could have the effects of both delaying the establishment of the new school and, of course, re-opening the patronage of the new school to other applicant patrons.  I am also satisfied that the erroneous description of the existing post-primary school in Maynooth as being a designated Community College and which was notified the New Schools Establishment Group on 24 August 2012, was corrected as soon as it came to light and that this had no bearing on the outcome of the patronage determination process for the new school.</p><p>  It was never the intention to provide separate junior/senior school buildings in Maynooth.  Therefore, the cost benefit analysis which the Deputy refers to does not arise.  This issue is moot in any event because the configuration within the buildings would not impact building costs.  </p></reply>

The pupil teacher ratio in school settings can result in one teacher being allocated to a class of six pupils with children of mixed age and ability at the appropriate educational level, primary or post primary. Accordingly, it is considered appropriate, as in a school situation, that a tutor can provide tuition at the appropriate educational level to more than one sibling at that level simultaneously in the home.</p><p>  However, in recognition of the differentiated needs of some siblings, and as in the two cases in question, separate allocations have been considered on a case by case basis.

Given technological and ICT developments in the 15 years since FOI was first introduced, the migration of such information to websites and international best practice, these manuals are not considered an effective way of promoting the proactive publication of information into the public domain.  </p><p>  Guidance on the publication schemes will be provided under the Code of Practice on the implementation of the Act which I intend to bring to Government shortly.  It is my intention that the publication schemes will provide for the publication of extensive information on the nature, role, responsibilities and activities of public bodies including the structure, classes of records held, rules relating to any schemes implemented, services provided and so on.  This is intended to facilitate much more proactive publication of information by public bodies thus making official information more accessible outside of FOI on a routine basis.  Greater publication of official data and information is also consistent with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to participate in the multilateral Open Government Partnership.  In that regard, the Deputy will recall my announcement of a major open data initiative at the Open Government Partnership summit in London last month.</p><p>  The Deputy&rsquo;s attention is also drawn to the fact that Section 8 of the new Bill provides that the information contained in the publication scheme will be reviewed at least on an annual basis and that, in the case of a person unable to access a website and who requests details of the nature of records held by a public body, details will be provided in written form.</p><p>  Following a public consultation process on the draft Code, it is planned that the final Code of Practice, once approved by Government, will be introduced in tandem with the commencement of the reformed Freedom of Information legislation.</p></reply>

The opportunity of carrying out certain advance works prior to the placing of a main contract is also being investigated. </p><p>  Maintenance and reinstatement works have been undertaken in recent days by Bray Town Council, including reinstatement of roads and footpaths, sealing small portions of walls and securing the fencing along the site. The removal of additional material at the Slang is not proposed until the 'in-river' season (May to September).</p><p>  The OPW understands that engineering mitigation measures had been incorporated into the works already carried out to make allowance for the installation of the temporary bridge structure at the Slang/Rehill's Land, including the provision of a secondary flow channel and excavation of material at the south riverbank to widen the river channel.</p><p>  I am advised that the works that have been constructed to date (including the construction of the culvert at Bray Bridge) will have a significant beneficial affect in alleviating flood risk.  I would again reiterate that Bray Town Council and the OPW remain fully committed to completing the Bray flood relief scheme to provide the standard 1-in-100 year level of protection and every effort is being made to achieve this objective as soon as possible. </p></reply>

These site visits were from new companies visiting the location for the first time and from senior executives of existing companies.</p><p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world standard physical and digital infrastructure coupled with the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services. In order to achieve economic regional development, IDA prioritises the marketing of Gateway locations within each Region as the locations of critical mass (i.e. sufficient scale of population, skills, infrastructure, companies, business services etc.) and highlights the opportunities provided by Hub locations which are within commuting distances of these Gateways.  With improvements in infrastructure an investment in one town in a region has a positive effect on other towns in the region.</p><p>  Westmeath is part of IDA Ireland&rsquo;s Midlands Region along with Counties Longford, Laois, Offaly and Roscommon.  In this region IDA prioritises the marketing of the linked Gateway of Athlone/Tullamore/Mullingar.</p><p>  The Midlands Region, which includes Mullingar, has been particularly successful in recent years in terms of attracting inward investment from FDI companies.  At present, there are 44 IDA supported companies in the Midlands region employing over 5,000 people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  </p><p>  We must also remember that it is the investor in all cases who decides where to invest and an investment win for Ireland regardless of the location has to be seen as a plus for the country as a whole.</p></reply>

The vast majority of jobseeker customers receive their payments in this manner on a weekly basis.  Exceptions are made in certain circumstances, for instance while a person is undertaking a course of study under the back to education allowance, partaking of an internship under the Work Placement Program or National Internship Program and where there would be difficulty in accessing the post office during normal working hours.  In addition, as announced in Budget 2014, new provisions are being introduced for many older jobseekers who have not yet reached the State pension age of 66.  These provisions include the option to have payments made electronically into a bank or building society account.  I would stress, however, this is optional and an individual may choose to continue to receive the jobseeker payment in a post office if they wish to do so.</p></reply>

Prior to the 2009 Act, only the benefits of active scheme members could be considered in a restructure of scheme benefits. The Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill further extends the options available to trustees of a scheme to include a portion of benefits payable to pensioners. It essentially provides for the sharing of the risk of scheme underfunding across all scheme members. However, the legislation restricts the extent to which pensioner benefits can be restructured as it is considered that this category of beneficiary has less potential to respond to a restructure of scheme benefits. </p><p>  The issue of how these changes might be applied will be a matter for the trustees of the scheme who are required under trust law of act in the best interest of all scheme beneficiaries.</p><p>  Any consideration of a restructure of pension scheme benefits must comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act and with guidance issued by the Pensions Board. The Pensions Board must be satisfied that these provisions have been complied with before the Board will consider issuing a notice to restructure scheme benefits.</p></reply>

The person concerned was notified of the decision to refuse their invalidity pension application on 27 September 2012 and he appealed the decision.</p><p>  As is normal procedure in the case of appeals, the file was reviewed by a DO in order to confirm or revise the decision.  The deciding officer sent the file to a social welfare inspector (SWI) for investigation.  Following receipt of the completed report from the SWI, the deciding officer was satisfied that the person concerned was not in employment.  The next step should have been to establish whether the person in question was medically eligible for IP.  However due to an unfortunate oversight the papers were filed away in error and not referred for a medical assessment.  The Department wishes to apologise to the person in question for this error which led to the claim not being assessed in a timely and correct way.</p><p>  In order to establish medical suitability a diagnostic report has now issued to the customer concerned to be completed by his general practitioner or other treating physician.

Accordingly, policy in relation to tariff setting has been settled since 2002 when the Oireachtas conferred responsibility for tariff setting, under the 2002 Act, on the CER. The CER as the independent energy regulator has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.

Given our high dependence on gas for electricity generation this would also give rise to electricity price increases and would negatively impact on Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness.

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Westmeath, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at . The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Westmeath. This will be achieved by providing:- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and</p><p>- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

I have no direct statutory function in relation to liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, including specific projects like the Shannon LNG project.  The LNG facility would provide additional security of supply to Ireland in that it would bring diversity to Ireland's supply sources and would bring connectivity for the first time to the global LNG market.  The prospect of such a facility is therefore a potentially positive step for the island of Ireland.  Decisions on the regulatory treatment of the gas interconnectors and tariffing are statutorily matters for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.  Therefore, policy in relation to tariff setting has been settled since 2002 when the Oireachtas conferred responsibility for tariff setting on the CER.  The CER as the independent energy regulator has a remit to protect energy consumers, ensure security of supply and support competitiveness.  The CER also has a duty to ensure that new sources of gas for the Irish market do not result in unwarranted increases in the price of gas to business and domestic consumers.</p><p>  On the 29 June 2012 the CER published a decision in regard to the regulatory treatment of the BGE interconnectors.  That decision subsequently became the subject of a Judicial Review by Shannon LNG.  On the 11 December, 2013, the High Court upheld the CER decision of 29 June 2012 on reform of the tariffing regime.  The matter of an appeal of that decision is an issue for consideration by Shannon LNG.</p><p>  I understand that the CER intends to carry out a consultation on tariff settlement in Quarter 1 of 2014 with decisions in Quarter 2.  Tariff reform is being driven by the entry of Corrib gas into the system, with first flows anticipated in 2015.  Therefore, it is in the interests of all stakeholders, including consumers, that clarity in regard to tariffing arrangements is obtained as soon as possible and I would urge all concerned to engage with the CER on its forthcoming consultation on this regulatory issue.</p><p>  The independence of the CER in its decision making is expressly provided for in EU legislation as transposed into Irish law.  Requests have been made to me as Minister to issue a policy direction to the CER in accordance with powers of direction provided under section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. Section 10A of the 1999 Act, as amended, does provide that I may give &ldquo;<i>general policy directions</i>&rdquo; from time to time.  However, I am expressly precluded from giving any policy direction in respect of any individual undertakings or persons.

The Gambling Control Bill will update and replace all existing laws on gambling (other than those relating to the National Lottery). The Government approved the General Scheme in July this year and it has been available on the Department's website since then. The Scheme has also been considered by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and the Committee's Report has been published.   I hope to publish the Bill next autumn.</p><p>  I will be including two particular measures in the Bill that are targeted at the  regulation of on-line operators, especially unlicensed on-line operators. These measures are in addition to a comprehensive set of new measures applicable to all operators. </p><p>  The first of the additional measures provides the basis for enhanced cooperation arrangements at the international level between regulators. These arrangements will facilitate contacts and exchanges of information between our authorities and their counterparts abroad, thereby making it more difficult for those operators trying to avoid detection.</p><p>  I am also proposing that the regulator may apply for Court orders to prevent, disrupt or obstruct receipt of the unlicensed service; these orders will result in what is commonly referred to as &quot;blocking&quot; of the website.  Orders may also restrict publicity, including advertising that refers in any way to the service, as well as prohibiting banks from executing financial transactions   with the unlicensed operator.  I believe these measures will be effective but I am prepared to consider additional measures if they can be shown to add to the controls on these sites.   <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

It remains the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the great majority of migrants comply with this condition.  It does not follow logically that the solution to illegal migration is for the Irish State to reward those who engage in it.</i></p><p><i>If a person is undocumented his/her case can be considered on its merits by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department and part of this consideration involves looking at the extent to which the person's situation is through no fault of his/her own.  Sometimes this consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.  In other cases, the  decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, would be that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.</i></p><p><i>Broad regularisation programmes are problematic.  They could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also significant considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</i></p><p><i>Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom.</i></p><p><i>Finally, I note that a figure of 30,000 is cited on the number of illegal immigrants in the State; by definition it is impossible to state with any accuracy the number of persons without lawful permission to remain in the State and in this respect, Ireland is no different to any other country.</i></p></reply>

Section 35 of the Act, which entered into operation on 1 December 2009, contained specific provisions in respect of easements acquired by prescription, i.e. acquired on the basis of long enjoyment of the easement concerned. It originally provided that such an easement would be acquired at law only on registration in the Land Registry or the Registry of Deeds of a court order under that section.</p><p>  Parts 12 and 13 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 contain amendments to the 2009 Act and the Registration of Title Act 1964 which simplify the procedures for acquiring easements based on prescription. The amendments permit the Property Registration Authority (PRA) to register such an easement without a court order under section 35 of the 2009 Act where it is satisfied that there is an entitlement to it. Where the PRA is not satisfied that there is such an entitlement, such as where there is disagreement between the parties concerned, a court order under section 35 of the 2009 will continue to be required. This is similar to the procedure which applies in respect of applications for registration of title based on adverse possession of the land.</p><p>The updated rules applicable to the new arrangements are set out in the Land Registration Rules 2012 (S.I. No. 483 of 2012) and 2013 (S.I. No. 389 of 2013) which are available on the PRA web site (www.prai.ie).</p><p>  I have no plans at present to make further amendments to the law in relation to easements as set out in Part 8 (Chapter 1) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009 and the Registration of Title Act 1964.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-18a.474.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121800082#WRS01500"><p>As the Deputy may be aware the provision of legal aid falls within two separate categories, i.e criminal legal aid and civil legal aid.  Details in respect of each category are as follows:</p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  The Civil Legal Aid Act (as amended) does not place a limit on the number of times a person may avail of civil legal aid. The granting of civil legal aid is the responsibility of the Legal Aid Board and civil legal aid is only granted in cases where the application meets the merits test as set out in the legislation.  In addition, the applicant must also be financially eligible to qualify for the service. Currently, this means that an applicant cannot have disposable income of more than &euro;18,000 per annum and disposable capital assets of more than &euro;100,000. Disposable income and capital are calculated in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Regulations. More detailed information on financial eligibility and the merits test for civil legal aid is available on the Legal Aid Board's website, .</p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>  The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings. Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary. The Act further provides that the court may require an applicant to complete a statement of means. It is an offence for an applicant to knowingly make a false statement or conceal a material fact for the purpose of obtaining legal aid.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that an accused person who faces serious charges is entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence and if they cannot afford to pay for legal representation there is a right to legal aid.  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend themselves in person or through legal assistance of their own choosing or, if they have insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts. There is no limit to the number of occasions a person can be granted legal aid under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.</p><p>  A new Criminal Legal Aid Bill is planned to update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid, where appropriate.</p></reply>

These allocations are continually monitored to ensure that the best possible service is provided across all communities.</p><p>  In developing his policing plan for 2013, the Commissioner determined that the Garda stations in Ballinahowan, Castletowngeoghegan, Finea and Rathowen in County Westmeath should be closed. These stations were closed on 31st January 2013 and are the only Garda stations in Westmeath that have been closed since 2008.  The closure of these and other Garda Stations around the country has resulted in an additional 61,000 patrolling hours being made available to the communities right across the country.</p><p>  In addition to this, I recently secured a further &euro;9m for investment in the Garda fleet, made up of an additional &euro;5m this year and a further &euro;4m in 2014.  I am informed that as a result of this ongoing investment, a total of 438 new vehicles have either been or will be provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the course of 2013. This brings to &euro;18m the total amount spent on the Garda fleet for the three years 2012 to 2014 and represents a very considerable financial investment in Garda transport, particularly at a time when the level of funding available across the public sector is severely limited.</p><p>  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the official recorded crime statistics, published by the Central Statistics Office and which are available on their web site, which show reductions in 12 out of the 14 categories for which figures are given in the twelve months ending 30 June 2013.

First, it alleges breaches of the criminal law in a foreign jurisdiction. As the Deputy will understand, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the allegation. </p><p>  The second matter, however, is one I am addressing by way of new legislation, namely the regulation of gambling, including remote gambling. </p><p>  The correspondence refers to that new legislation. The Gambling Control Bill will update all existing laws on the regulation of betting and gaming (other than the National Lottery). The Government approved the General Scheme in July this year. The Scheme has also been considered by the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and the Committee's Report has been published. </p><p>  The Bill will confer all responsibility for all regulatory matters on the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Minister's functions will include licensing, inspections, prosecutions and they will be carried out by a body located within my Department. There will be a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licence and with the new legislation generally.</p><p>  The Bill will facilitate cooperation between our authorities and their counterparts abroad, thereby making it very difficult for those operators trying to avoid detection and follow-up actions. </p><p>  I intend to take full advantage of this opportunity to upgrade our out-dated systems and to reflect best practice, including in matters of governance. My aim is to give all consumers a high level of protection but I will be paying close attention, in particular, to measures to protect the vulnerable, including the young. I believe that robust systems will also attract reputable companies and I  would expect to see some of them locate some or all of their back-room operations here.</p><p>  I hope to publish the Bill next autumn. </p></reply>

As I stated in my reply, I am informed by the military authorities that risk assessments are carried out for all mission areas and suitable control measures are put in place to minimise identified risks.  Where a health risk is identified the control measures will include preventative medication where appropriate.  Where malaria has been identified as a risk, the choice of chemoprophylaxis is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues.  The choice of medication is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces on the basis of best international practice having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Irish Medicines Board is the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines for use in Ireland.   The Defence Forces&rsquo; Medical Corps complies with its guidelines on the prescription of medicines, including Lariam.  As I stated in last Wednesday&rsquo;s reply, I am advised that Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  It continues to be licensed by the Irish Medicines Board.  The Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side effects attaching to all anti-malarial medications.  I am advised that protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.  </p><p>  The Defence Forces follow best international practice in prescribing Lariam.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  This is intended to rule out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions, e.g. depression, anxiety, pregnancy, neuro-degenerative disorders etc. which, as has been indicated by the Irish Medicines Board, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.  This medical risk assessment is particular to an individual, forms part of the individual&rsquo;s medical record and is not, therefore, publishable.</p><p>  As I stated in last Wednesday&rsquo;s response, Malaria is a serious disease that kills approximately 1 million people per year in sub-Saharan Africa alone. It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area and Lariam must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risk posed by this highly dangerous disease.</p></reply>

A new development programme for the period 2014-2020 is presently being developed by my Department to implement the proposed EU Regulation for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.</p><p>  The principal measure under the present Programme for the development of the aquaculture sector is the Commercial Aquaculture Development Scheme.  This Scheme is delivered by both Bord Iascaigh Mhara and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta.  The Scheme provides grants of up to 40% of eligible costs to licensed aquaculture operators. The Scheme is aimed at promoting investment in the sustainable development and modernisation of aquaculture SME&rsquo;s.  The Scheme supports investments in the construction, extension, equipment and modernisation of aquaculture sites, in particular with a view to improving working conditions, hygiene, human or animal health and product quality, and reducing negative impact or enhancing positive effects on the environment.  Investments must contribute to one or more of the following objectives:</p><p>a) diversification towards new species and production of species with good market prospects;</p><p>b) implementation of aquaculture methods substantially reducing negative impact or enhancing positive effects on the environment when compared with normal practice in the aquaculture sector;</p><p>c) support for traditional aquaculture activities important for preserving and developing both the economic and social fabric and the environment;</p><p>d) support for the purchase of equipment aiming at protecting the farms from wild predators; and</p><p>e) improvement of the working and safety conditions of aquaculture workers.</p><p>  To be eligible to avail of the Scheme, an aquaculture site must have a valid current aquaculture licence, i.e. not awaiting licence renewal.  Any site located in a Natura 2000 area must also have undergone the necessary environmental assessments required under the Habitats Directive and be licensed in accordance with the outcome of that assessment.  </p><p>Further details of this and other financial supports to the aquaculture sector are available at   .  In addition, BIM also provides professional advice and assistance to the aquaculture sector on husbandry matters.</p></reply>

These arrangements were put in place having regard to the size of the vessels involved in the fishery and the time of year in which the fishing takes place.</p><p>  The position in relation to the management of all fisheries, both pelagic and whitefish, is that the quota is managed on a single year basis and under fishing by any group of vessels is not carried forward to the following year for that group. For all stocks, any carry over from 2013, which can be up to 10 % in the case of Celtic Sea Herring, will be added to the national adjusted quota for 2014.

Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc. This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.</p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions. Under the Common Agricultural Policy, this is done by way of a Clearance of Accounts procedure. This is a formal process and both the Commission and Member States are obliged to adhere to the requirements laid down in the legislation. </p><p>  In the case of Ireland, the Clearance procedure is currently covering five financial years involving the 2008 to 2012 scheme-years. The total amount of EU funds under audit scrutiny in the process is approximately &euro;7.5 billion. I can assure the Deputy that every effort is being made to ensure that Ireland&rsquo;s case and the position of Irish farmers is strenuously argued during the process. </p><p>  I can also reassure the Deputy that every effort is being made to protect the interests of all Irish farmers during the process including the interest of that majority of farmers, who were fully compliant in the declarations they made on an annual basis under the Schemes. This is an extremely serious process. During the years 2002 to 2012, the Commission imposed financial corrections amounting to almost &euro;5 billion on Member States. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this amounted 0.5% of the total amount corrected &ndash; one of the lowest percentages among Member States. </p><p>  Under the EU Regulations, the Commission has to right to impose a flat-rate correction of 2%, 5%, 10%, or greater, depending of its assessment of the risk to the EU Fund involved. A 2% correction on the 2008 &ndash; 2012 scheme years would mean a loss of &euro;150m in funding to Ireland. On the other hand, the level of the correction can be based on the assessed risk if the Member State can establish the risk and the Commission are satisfied with the calculations. In such circumstances,  if the risk is dealt with by the Member State by collecting the debts arising from the over-payments, the amounts collected is taken into account by the Commission in its final assessment. This is the approach Ireland is following.</p></reply>

Current Government incentives for afforestation include grants generally to private farmers to cover the cost of afforestation and premiums to compensate the landowner for the loss of income. Under EU rules, Coillte is not entitled to receive these premiums. In order for Coillte to afforest land it would first have to acquire it in competition with farmers and secondly it would have to incur the cost of planting it without the benefit of these premiums.</p><p>  On the issue of wind energy, the Deputy is aware that Ireland has a national renewable energy target to achieve 40% of electricity generation targets from renewable sources including wind by 2020. Coillte plays its role towards achieving this target; currently some 40% of all installed wind generation capacity is on land owned, leased or previously sold by Coillte to facilitate these projects by other State owned and private companies. When sites are being assessed for wind development every effort is made to limit the area of forest that is harvested to accommodate the wind farm and Department of Agriculture policy requires the planting of compensatory lands to ensure the loss of planted area is minimised.</p><p>  As regards the issue of supply of wooden poles to the ESB, Coillte is working with ESB Networks and Eirgrid to supply as much as possible of their demand from native sources.</p></reply>

The development of a new Rural Development Programme (RDP) under Pillar 2 will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agrifood sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.</p><p>  A general EU co-financing rate of 53% is set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation but this rate may rise to a maximum of 80% for measures such as farm and business development, co-operation activities, and LEADER projects. Environmental type measures may be co-funded up to 75%. The total Exchequer funding that will be required to draw down the available European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) funding will depend on the types of measures included in the new Rural Development Programme and on the co-financing rates applied to these measures.</p><p>  There are a number of conditions attached to Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;313 million per annum.  The draft Regulation provides that at least 5% of EAFRD funding must be reserved for LEADER while the draft Common Provisions Regulation provides that 6% of EAFRD funding must be set aside to a national performance reserve. The funding set aside to the performance reserve will be allocated to each Member State following a performance review in 2019. The draft Rural Development Regulation also sets out that 30% of the total EAFRD amount must be reserved for environmental operations and climate change mitigation and adaptation measures. </p><p>  Work is currently ongoing in my Department to design the new Rural Development Programme (RDP) for the period from 2014 &ndash; 2020. In designing the new RDP, my Department must take account of the range of requirements set out in the draft Rural Development Regulation and the need to support key policy aims for the agrifood sector in the light of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy. In undertaking this work, a number of ex-ante analyses are being undertaken and a public consultation process has also taken place.</p><p>  While final decisions in relation to what measures are to be included in the new RDP have not yet been made, my Department is in ongoing contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the overall financing that will be required, and work on the design of the new RDP is continuing in my Department as a matter of priority.</p></reply>

Certain legal and policy questions are currently being finalised and I expect to shortly submit a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government.  The proposals will have to address the Constitutional and legal position with regard to any retrospective application of legislation, particularly as it relates to the right to privacy and the necessity to obtain consent for the release of personal information.

They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register. In 2007, the Adoption Board published a review of the operation of the Register from 2005 to 2007.  This review contains detailed information about the register and is available on the Information and Tracing section of the Adoption Authority website (www.aai.gov.ie). </p><p>  The Authority has stated that there are currently 7534 adopted persons and 3361 relatives registered.  To date in 2013 there have been 69 matches.  It should be noted that the NACPR is a contact preference register and not a tracing database.  The Authority can only act on making a 'match' when two parties register and agree to contact. </p><p>  The Authority, the Health Service Executive and accredited adoption services routinely inform enquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up.  I am conscious of recent media coverage of the issue of information and tracing and I would hope that this will encourage more birth mothers in particular to access the Contact Preference Register and where possible to consent to the release of information.</p></reply>

In 2011 the HSE established a National Integrated Care Advisory Group (NICAG) to review the existing Integrated Discharge Planning Code of Practice.  Following initial consultation last year with staff in hospitals and the community services the NICAG produced a draft National Integrated Care Guidance document which will replace the existing code of practice.  This document is being finalised and is expected to be published early in 2014. </p><p>  This Guidance Document aims to provide practical advice for service providers regarding effective discharge and transfer from hospital to the community.  It outlines the nine key steps in effective discharge and transfer of care which will facilitate faster, safer discharges for patients.  These steps include identifying whether the person has simple or complex needs, setting an expected date of discharge/transfer within 24/48 hours of admission and reviewing the treatment plan with the person on a daily basis.</p><p>  In relation to discharge summary information, the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) has developed a National Standard for Patient Discharge Summary Information as an important step towards improving the whole care pathway and enabling the delivery of safe, person-centred care.  When a patient is discharged from hospital to primary care it is essential that complete, relevant and valid information regarding the patient's stay in hospital is sent to the primary care healthcare professional in a timely manner, allowing the primary care professional to continue care and management following discharge.  The National Standard for Patient Discharge Summary Information sets out the relevant and important information that should be contained in a patient's summary discharge information.  HIQA has submitted the National Standard to me seeking my approval in accordance with Section 8 (1) (k) of the Health Act 2007.  My Department is examining this submission.</p></reply>

Orthodontic referrals are generally received via the Public Dental Service school screening programme. An individual's access to orthodontic treatment is determined against a set of clinical guidelines called the Modified Index of Treatment Need. At the time of assessment those with urgent clinical need are prioritised for treatment. It should be noted that the nature of orthodontic care means that immediate treatment is not always desirable as it is sometimes necessary to wait for further growth to take place before treatment commences. Patients with the greatest level of need, i.e. Grade 5 or Grade 4 are provided with treatment by the HSE.

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the body responsible for the capital project.  Last August, I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January this year.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise to the project.  In August I also announced appointments to the Children's Hospital Group Board which, as client for the project, will play a key role in ensuring the new hospital is optimally designed and completed as swiftly as possible.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission.  The new NPHDB has reviewed the design team procurement process, which had been initiated in July, and decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and taking into account changing market conditions.  While this means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the Board is confident there will be no delay to the project overall.  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced, a masterplan for the St. James's Hospital campus is being prepared and St. James's Hospital is working closely with the Development Board and the HSE in relation to the decant phase of the project.  Work on the review of urgent care centre configuration is at an advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.</p><p>  Planning for the number of beds for the new children's hospital was undertaken during the previous phase of this project on the Mater campus, based on ongoing analysis of paediatric hospital activity, ongoing review of Diagnostic Related Groups (clinical activity), review of existing and future service plans with each of the specialty groups and application of National CSO Population and Labour Force Projections.  This was carried out in parallel with a review of paediatric acute care trends internationally and the application of LEAN healthcare principles.  Following the Government decision to locate the hospital on the St James's campus, further analysis of existing and planned hospital activity has been carried out and the number of beds required in the new children's hospital at the St James's Hospital campus is being finalised as part of this process.  A significant proportion of the preparatory work that was done for the project on its previous site can be transferred to the new site. </p><p>  Work on developing a detailed timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.  However, at this stage, the Board is confident that construction can begin in Spring 2015 with the transition of services to the new hospital to commence at the end of 2018.</p></reply>

The main relevant market developments over the past five years are as follows:</p><p>- The number of people who currently hold private health insurance is 2.047 million (end-September 2013) or 44.6% of the population.  The number of people insured has been in decline since its peak at almost 2.3 million, or 50.9% of the population, at the end of 2008.  </p><p>- The Health Insurance Authority data indicates that, in the 12 months to end-June 2013, the average premium paid to commercial insurers was &euro;1,095 gross (adults and children combined), which represents an increase of 59% over the corresponding five-year period.</p><p>The following tables show the breakdown of membership by age for each of the commercial health insurers over the last five years.<table><tr><th>End Dec 2012</th><th>Aviva Health</th><th>Glo Health</th><th>Laya Healthcare</th><th>Vhi Healthcare</th></tr><tr><td>0-49</td><td>19%</td><td>1%</td><td>25%</td><td>55%</td></tr><tr><td>50-59</td><td>19%</td><td>0%</td><td>21%</td><td>59%</td></tr><tr><td>60-69</td><td>15%</td><td>0%</td><td>20%</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>70-79</td><td>12%</td><td>0%</td><td>16%</td><td>78%</td></tr><tr><td>80+</td><td>6%</td><td>0%</td><td>6%</td><td>89%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Market Share</td><td>16.9%</td><td>1.0%</td><td>21.5%</td><td>56.4%</td></tr></table><table><tr><th>End Dec 2008</th><th>Aviva Health</th><th>Quinn (Laya) Healthcare</th><th>Vhi Healthcare</th></tr><tr><td>0-49</td><td>9%</td><td>25%</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>50-59</td><td>6%</td><td>20%</td><td>74%</td></tr><tr><td>60-69</td><td>3%</td><td>15%</td><td>82%</td></tr><tr><td>70-79</td><td>1%</td><td>7%</td><td>92%</td></tr><tr><td>80+</td><td>1%</td><td>3%</td><td>96%</td></tr><tr><td>Total Market Share</td><td>5.4%</td><td>21.6%</td><td>66.8%</td></tr></table></p><p>  The tables show a significant disparity in the membership age profile, and thus the associated costs, across the four commercial insurers.  VHI Healthcare continues to have a much greater proportion of members in the age groups 60-69 and above when compared to other insurers.  Insurers with more older customers have higher claims costs.  For example, in 2012:</p><p>- VHI had market share of 56% but had 67% of the total claims paid in the market.</p><p>- Laya had 22% market share but had 14% of total claims paid in the market.</p><p>- Aviva had 17% market share and 13% of total claims paid. </p><p>  Given the disparities in claims costs, mostly related to age and health status, between competitors operating in the health insurance market, risk equalisation has been the mechanism used to create a level playing field in the market.  It does so by providing risk equalisation credits (based on age, gender and level of cover) in respect of insured people aged 60 years and over.  The aim is to distribute fairly some of the differences that arise in insurers' costs due to the differing health status of all their customers.  The Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2013, which is scheduled to pass all stages of the Oireachtas later this week, sets out revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duties that will apply under the RES from 1 March 2014 and will further improve the effectiveness of the Scheme overall.  These revised credits should further level the playing field within the market, by making older clients less costly to insure.</p></reply>

HCAIs represent a major cause of preventable harm and increased healthcare costs.  While not all HCAIs are due to AMR a significant proportion are.  HCAIs are not an inevitable consequence of healthcare - recent evidence suggests that up to 70% of HCAIs can be prevented depending on the type of infection and the baseline rate. </p><p>  The approach to prevention and control of HCAIs is similar irrespective of whether or not it is caused by an antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Therefore,  the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a dual focus:</p><p> 1. Implementing measures to prevent and control HCAIs including those caused by AMR such as MRSA</p><p> 2. Implementing specific measures for AMR including  MRSA;</p><p>    - These are outlined in national guidelines which have been recently updated;</p><p>    - Monitoring infections caused by AMR as outlined later in this response.</p><p>  The HSE has implemented a number of national initiatives in this field for many years, including:</p><p>  - SARI 2001-2010 which specifically outlined the national strategy for prevention of AMR and was launched by the Minister of Health in 2001;</p><p>  - HSE &lsquo;Say No to Infection&rsquo; which focused on both HCAIs and AMR;</p><p>  - The RCPI &amp;amp; HSE national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR which commenced in late 2010.</p><p>Public reporting of HCAIs and AMR in Irish acute hospitals:</p><p>  - HCAIs Prevalence Study 2006 and 2012;</p><p><i>  - S. aureus </i>bloodstream infection (reported quarterly since 2007) &ndash; this includes public reporting of MRSA rates per hospital;</p><p>  - Alcohol hand rub consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007);</p><p>  - Antibiotic consumption (reported bi-annually since 2007);</p><p>  - Hand hygiene compliance (reported bi-annually since 2011)</p><p>  The overall aim of the national clinical programme for the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is that every healthcare worker and all parts of the healthcare system recognise that the prevention and control of HCAIs and AMR is a key element of clinical and non-clinical governance. Our healthcare systems have processes in place to ensure safe healthcare is reliably delivered irrespective of the healthcare setting.  The programme focuses on getting three basic practices right every time we care for our patients; these are hand hygiene, using antimicrobials appropriately (antimicrobial stewardship) &amp;amp; preventing medical device-related infections i.e. IV lines/drips, urinary catheters.  If the above three measures are applied consistently and reliably every time healthcare workers care for their patients/residents/client then a significant proportion of HCAIs, including that caused by AMR will be prevented.</p><p>  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) collates information from hospitals on healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistant organisms such as MRSA.  Information is also published on an ongoing basis for <i>S. aureus </i>and MRSA bloodstream infection &ndash; published quarterly to hospital level since 2007. Notably, there has been an annual decrease in reported <i>S. aureus</i> BSI, from 1,251 (2010) to 1,060 (2012). To the end of Q1 2013, 18.6% were due to resistant <i>S. aureus </i>  (MRSA), a reduction on 2012 (22.8%). I was pleased last week to launch and endorse the second National Clinical Guideline, Prevention and Control Methicillin-Resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(MRSA).  This National Clinical Guideline provides practical guidance on prevention and control measures for MRSA to improve patient care, minimise patient morbidity and mortality and to help contain healthcare costs.  The guideline has been developed for all healthcare staff involved in the care of patients, residents or clients who may be at risk of or may have MRSA in acute hospitals, obstetrics and neonates, nursing homes/long stay residential units and the community.  </p><p>  While I welcome the reducing trend in reported rates of MRSA in Ireland which indicates a halving of MRSA since 2006,  Ireland&rsquo;s MRSA rates are comparably high with other countries.  We must systematically build our actions and processes to continue to reduce the prevalence of MRSA in Ireland. This National Guideline is a significant pro-active step in this direction and I would like to acknowledge the work of the Clinical Advisory Group on healthcare associated infections - MRSA Guideline Committee of the Royal College of Physicians Ireland in developing this guideline.</p></reply>

I established the Special Delivery Unit, which is working to unblock access to acute services by improving patient flow through the system. Significant progress has been made on reducing the numbers of patients on hospital trolleys in Accident and Emergency Departments, against a background of reduced funding for health, reconfiguration of services and a very challenging economic climate.  The Development of Assessment and Admission Facilities by the HSE have further reduced pressure on Emergency Departments. The recent National advancement of Acute Medical Units (AMU), Medical Assessment Units (MAU), Surgical Assessment Units (SAU) and Paediatric Assessment Units (PAU) are designed to ensure rapid alternative assessment and, where necessary, admission of emergency patients.</p><p>  The primary function of such facilities is the immediate and early specialist management of  patients, providing a dedicated location for the rapid assessment, diagnosis and commencement of appropriate treatment. Consultants, supported by a multidisciplinary team, carry out patient assessment and treatment.  If required, patients can be admitted to the short stay medical beds within the unit for a short period for acute treatment and/or observation where the estimated length of stay is less than 48 hours.  In smaller hospitals, admission may be to inpatient beds.  A total of 29 AMUs / MAUs, 4 PAUs and 1 SAU are currently established and functioning.  The total volumes of activity for these units in 2013 is as follows: AMU same day discharge: 37,662 / admission 26,342;  PAS: 5447 attendances and SAU: 2139 attendances.  </p><p>  Year to Date trolley numbers in 2013 are down 13.1% on last year.  This equates to a reduction of 8,446 patients on trolleys year on year.  Compared to 2011, the year to date improvement is 34%, equivalent to a reduction of 28,913 patients on trolleys.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, it is open to the HSE to continue to recruit NCHDs, nurses and consultant staff in circumstances where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement and the recruitment can be accommodated within the budgetary and staff number limits in place.  The number of consultants working in the public health sector has increased significantly in recent years, as this grade was exempt from the moratorium. At present, there are over 2,500 consultants, an increase of over 40% in the last decade, and the HSE continues to approve new posts and to recruit to fill vacant posts.</p><p>  With regard to NCHDs, there is a recognised need to progress compliance, given the extent to which many currently exceed the provisions of the Directive. This is being addressed as a priority by HSE and hospital management. The immediate focus, involving the HSE, hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs, is on eliminating shifts in excess of 24 hours. In certain specialties the NCHD staff required are in short supply internationally.  System reform, in particular the implementation of the Report on Hospital Groups and the Framework for the Development of Smaller Hospitals will assist, through achievement of a more focused and efficient deployment of NCHD staffing.</p><p>  I am committed to improving the working-conditions of NCHDs, to ensuring that they can have a suitable career pathway within the Irish health system and to making all posts as attractive as possible.  In July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.  I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently and which will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system. I have recently received the interim report of the Group, to be published shortly, and the final report is to be submitted to me by June 2014. </p><p>  The number of nurses engaged in the public health service has reduced over the past four years in accordance with Government policy, arising from the requirement that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  Nonetheless, there is a high degree of compliance across the nursing sector with the Directive. Again, the HSE can make essential appointments where it is essential to do so. It is currently undertaking an intensive recruitment campaign to recruit theatre nurses, given current shortages and the importance of filling these posts.</p></reply>

In July 2011, when the Special Delivery Unit was set up a total of 6,277 patients were waiting more than nine months for inpatient or daycase treatment.  By the end of 2012, that number had been reduced by 98% for adults waiting over nine months for inpatient or daycase treatment and 95% for children waiting over 20 weeks for such treatment. </p><p>   The early months of 2013, as anticipated, brought higher levels of Emergency Department admissions which, in turn, had a knock-on effect on scheduled care.  However, the SDU in the HSE, together with the NTPF undertook a range of measures to address this, working closely with hospitals to analyse performance, to agree action plans and extra support as necessary and to ensure hospital capacity is being optimised.  Since August we have reduced the numbers of adults waiting over 8 months by 78% from 6,800 on 22 August to 1,485 on 12 December.  Similarly, we have reduced the numbers of children waiting over 20 weeks by 35% from 883 to 576 in the same period.  GI Endoscopy procedures waiting over 13 weeks have fallen 72% from 1,405 at the end of August to 392 on 12 December. </p><p>  With regard to outpatients, material provided by the HSE indicates that between 28.03.13 and 13.12.13 there has been a 10% reduction in total numbers waiting from 146,268 to 132,199, a 55% reduction in numbers waiting over12 months from 103,433 to 46,761, a 49% reduction in numbers waiting 12-24 months from 64,955 to 32,839, a 54% reduction in numbers waiting 24-36 months from 23,038 to 10,601, a 66% reduction in numbers waiting 36-48 months from 7,745 to 2,649 and 91% reduction in numbers waiting 48+ months from 7,695 to 672.</p><p>  Finally it is also worth noting that in relation to unscheduled care year to date, the INMO have reported 13.1% fewer trolleys than in 2012. This equates to a reduction of 8,446 patients on trolleys year on year. Compared to the base year 2011, the year to date improvement is 34%, equivalent to a reduction of 28,913 fewer patients waiting on trolleys.</p></reply>

The development of primary care centres, through a combination of public and private investment, will facilitate the delivery of multi-disciplinary primary health care.  In 2012 the HSE embarked on a prioritisation exercise for Primary Care Centres. However the prioritisation process is a dynamic exercise, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.</p><p>  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop as many primary care centres as possible using one of the following:</p><p>  - direct build (by HSE);</p><p>  - by way of leasing arrangements with the private sector;</p><p>  - through Public Private Partnership.</p><p>Considerable progress has been made in the delivery of primary care centres and 34 centres have opened since March 2011.  </p><p><i>Direct Build &ndash; </i> In certain locations, the HSE will deliver primary care facilities either through refurbishment/extension of suitable properties or through new build.  Since 2012, primary care infrastructure has been approved and is underway at 15 locations.</p><p><i>Operational lease </i> - Significant progress has been achieved under this mechanism. Construction is underway at 6 locations and planning permission has been granted at an additional 23 locations. </p><p><i>PPPs </i>- Of the 35 primary care centre locations announced under the Infrastructure Stimulus Package in July 2012, 16 locations have been identified as being suitable for the PPP model.  The 16 locations are being developed by the HSE to be brought to a preliminary design and statutory planning process. It is expected that 10-14 sites (indicative number 12 based on affordability) will be delivered as part of a single PPP contract with the remaining centres to be procured by the HSE using other procurement means. While it is not possible, at this time, to give start and completion dates for any of the individual  potential locations, the best estimate is that these primary care centres will be completed by late 2016.</p><p>  In relation to the PCC infrastructure schedule for the future, there will always be more construction projects than can be funded by the Exchequer using the direct-build mechanism.  The Health Service Executive must prioritise healthcare projects including primary care infrastructure within its overall capital envelope taking into account its existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.  Future development of primary care centres will be set out in the HSE's Multi Annual Capital Plan.</p></reply>

Each group of hospitals will work together as single cohesive entities managed as one, to provide acute care for patients in their area, integrating with community and primary care. This will maximise the amount of care delivered locally, whilst ensuring complex care is safely provided in larger hospitals.   Hospital Groups will be required, within one year, to develop a strategic plan which will outline their plans for future services within the group area and the role of hospitals within each group will be considered in detail in the context of this strategic plan.</p><p>  In relation to the specific information sought by the Deputy, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

All HSE dental clinics prioritise emergency care for children up to 16 years of age, treatment for special needs patients and screening of children aged from 11 to 13 years, including referral for orthodontic services where necessary.  Other services, including screening of children 6 to 8 years, are provided but may be deferred in clinics where there is pressure on resources.  The HSE Public Dental Service has recently been re-structured. It is intended that the new arrangements will facilitate standardisation of services available nationally.</p><p>  The Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental treatment for adult medical card holders.  The service is provided by contracted dentists.  The HSE prioritises for treatment patients with special needs, high risk patients and those who have greater clinical needs.  A free oral examination every calendar year and free emergency dental treatment with a focus on relief of pain and sepsis are available to all eligible patients, regardless of their medical condition.  This includes 2 fillings, all extractions, including surgical extractions, and a number of complex treatments.  The HSE will continue to monitor the operation of the DTSS to ensure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of available resources.  Responsibility for the Treatment Benefit Scheme, which provides dental, optical and aural services to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions, lies with the Minister for Social Protection.</p></reply>

However there are a number of vacancies, mainly in smaller hospitals and in certain specialties, including Emergency Medicine and General Medicine at Registrar level.  Filling these posts represents a significant challenge given that there are shortages internationally, there is a competitive market and it can be more difficult to attract doctors to smaller hospitals.  Where sites, such as Waterford, continue to experience challenges in terms of vacancies, hospital management implement contingency plans. If necessary, hospitals make locum arrangements to ensure continued service delivery.  While I would wish to see appointments made to fill these posts, the reality is that in many instances suitable candidates cannot be sourced and locums have to be used in order to ensure service delivery.</p><p>  I am committed to improving the working-conditions of NCHDs, to ensuring that they can have a suitable career pathway within the Irish health system and to making all posts as attractive as possible.  Intensive work is underway in all hospitals to pursue compliance with the European Working Time Directive on NCHDs&rsquo; working-hours.  The immediate focus, involving the HSE, hospital management, the IMO and NCHDs, is on eliminating shifts in excess of 24 hours.  In July this year, I set up a working group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.   I see this as a modernising initiative which is needed urgently and which will, in future years, support the retention of sufficient numbers of doctors trained in Ireland within the system.  I have recently received the interim report of the Group, to be published shortly, and the final report is to be submitted to me by June 2014.  System reform, in particular the implementation of the Report on Hospital Groups and the Framework for the Development of Smaller Hospitals will also assist, through achievement of a more focused and efficient deployment of NCHD staffing.</p></reply>

As indicated to all local authorities in January 2013, the local improvement scheme was reinstated but with no separate allocation for this grant category.  Under the arrangements for 2013 local authorities may use up to 7% of their Discretionary Grant towards local improvement schemes should they wish to do so.  The local contribution for these schemes has been increased to 20% of the total cost of the project.  Apart from this amendment the same eligibility rules apply for these schemes.  Furthermore, it is open to local authorities to supplement the 7% of their Discretionary Grant that they can use for the local improvement schemes with their own resources if they so wish.</p><p>   Details of the 2014 regional and local roads grants will be communicated to local authorities early in the new year.</p></reply>
