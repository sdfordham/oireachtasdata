Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth and the availability of productive employment for young people.  This strategy has been succeeding; by the third quarter of 2016 the number of people in employment was up by 200,000 from the lowest level reached in 2012.  The youth unemployment rate has fallen from 31.1% in July 2012 to 13.5% in January 2017.  The actual number of young unemployed has fallen from 70,000 to 27,500 over this period.  Having being far above typical EU levels, Irish youth unemployment is now significantly below the EU average &ndash; which was 18.6% at the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  Policies to reduce youth unemployment, framed in the context of the EU Recommendation on a Youth Guarantee, concentrate assistance to young people in finding and securing sustainable jobs.  To this end there is monthly engagement by case officers with all young unemployed to facilitate their return to employment.  For those who do not find employment, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in further education or training.  Others are in community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and Tus, or through the JobsPlus employment subsidy for private employment. </p>  <p>  Places on most of these programmes are demand led, and take-up by young people has fallen in line with the substantial fall in youth unemployment.  The number of young people entering the programmes was 23,000 in 2014 and 19,000 in 2015.  Final figures for 2016 are not yet available, but are expected to show a further fall on the 2015 level. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the measures taken under the Youth Guarantee, together with the continuing economic recovery, will support further reductions in youth unemployment.</p></reply>

Work has commenced with a view to having a report ready by the end of March / early April 2017.  This report will be presented to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social Protection for their consideration.  This timeframe for this report is ambitious but I am committed to producing the report as quickly as possible.  It is important in the interests of equity and fairness that the conditions for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit apply to all recipients, including those who could be categorised as seasonal and part-time workers.  </p>  <p>  Where a person exhausts his or her entitlement to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit, he or she must pay 13 additional PRSI contributions to requalify.  If a seasonal or a part time worker meets this requirement they may requalify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p>  <p>  This requirement is in place to ensure the person has a reasonable connection with the labour market before he or she can requalify.  If a person does not re-qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or has used up his or her entitlement to jobseeker's benefit, then he or she can apply for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is a means-based payment paid at the same weekly rate as jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions is approximately &euro;7 billion per annum.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year at an approximate rate of &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that reverting the contributory pension rate bands, to the percentages effective from 2000-2012, would cost &euro;60 million next year, and this annual cost would rise at a rate of approximately &euro;10 million per annum.  If such a change was introduced, it would mainly benefit pensioners with additional income above the State pension, and not those solely dependent upon it.  It would also significantly reduce the funds available for across-the-board pension increases, which were instead introduced in the 2016 and 2017 Budgets, and which benefit all pensioners, including the most vulnerable.  </p>  <p>  Reforms and increases in the pension age have safeguarded the pension system and its core rates, despite huge demographic pressures and the economic crisis.  By achieving this, even in such difficult circumstances, the Government has shown its commitment to supporting older people, as evidenced by CSO figures which show pensioners far less likely to experience consistent poverty than the general population.</p>  <p>  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State pension (non-contributory), which amounts up to 95% of the maximum contributory rate.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-21a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022100057#WRB00800"><p>The rent supplement scheme is supporting 47,000 tenants for which the Government has provided &euro;253 million  in 2017. The scheme is generally available to people whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and do not have alternative accommodation available. Rent supplement is subject to a means test which is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay.  The standard weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.  As part of the means test, a capital assessment is completed which includes savings, investments, property and any monies realised following a settlement as outlined by the Deputy. The combination of the means test and awarding differentiated rates of payment is premised on ensuring that social welfare payments are paid to those most in need and reflects the position that persons with reasonable amounts of capital and property are in a position to use that resource to support themselves. I have no plans to amend these conditions at this time. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme, which will be available nationally from 1st March 2017. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter.</p></reply>

Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, recently announced a new approach that will be taken to reviewing current Departmental expenditure in advance of Budget 2018.  The purpose of this review is to ensure the best value for money for the taxpayer.  It is quite distinct from the &lsquo;savings&rsquo; reviews in Departmental funding levels that took place during the economic crisis. </p>  <p>  It is recognised by Government that activation schemes are positive initiatives that enable people who are long-term unemployed to make a contribution to their communities whilst up-skilling themselves for prospective future employment.  It is also recognised that long-term unemployment and joblessness remain critical issues.  The removal of barriers to employment for those furthest from the labour market continues to be a challenge, even in periods of economic growth. </p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the live register and the growth in job opportunities, it is necessary to ensure that the number and nature of activation schemes, as well as the conditions governing participation on these schemes continues to be appropriate. I will be bringing a Memorandum to Government on the operation of these programmes in the coming weeks.  If there are changes to be made, consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

These supports include employment schemes such as Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s.  These schemes provide part-time temporary work in local communities, as a stepping stone back to employment.  The objective of these schemes is to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person&rsquo;s opportunities in returning to the labour market. </p>  <p>  Deputies on all sides of the House are fully aware of the positive benefits derived from these schemes.  Communities benefit from the skills and talents of participants and, in addition, participants are provided with the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities. </p>  <p>  All participants and community groups are aware of the time limits for participation on these schemes.  The participation limits aim to ensure the benefit of participation on a work scheme is available to the widest possible number of jobseekers. In addition, it is generally recognised that there is a greater likelihood of a &lsquo;lock&ndash;in&rsquo; effect where a scheme is of a longer duration.  </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s Intreo offices and staff co-ordinate the recruitment process for work schemes at a local level and will be happy to assist in relation to any local recruitment issues to ensure the maximum utilisation of places. If any scheme is experiencing particular difficulties filling vacancies, they should contact their local Intreo office as soon as possible.  </p>  <p>  With the ongoing welcome reductions in the Live Register and the increasing number of job opportunities, the Deputies will appreciate that issues such as the appropriate level of expenditure, the number of places and the criteria for participation on employment schemes all need to be considered.  I plan on bringing a Memo to Government in the coming weeks about these matters.  If there are changes to be made, consultations with stakeholders will be facilitated. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputies.</p></reply>

This has been due to volatility in the stock markets, increasing liabilities arising from the demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, low interest rates, and regulatory requirements.  Essentially the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the level of employer and employee contributions to pension schemes and the investment returns earned.  In addition, accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities very apparent on a company's balance sheet, contribute to the pressures under which DB schemes are operating.  During the financial crisis the decline of such schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole sector was at risk.  At that stage a series of legislative amendments was brought forward to alleviate the situation.  Whilst a very significant number of DB schemes have closed in recent years, in most cases they are replaced by Defined Contribution (DC) schemes, generally by agreement between employer and employee representatives.  However, and for those in the workforce more generally who may find themselves without supplementary pension coverage, I have highlighted my support for the introduction of a new auto-enrolment based retirement savings system.  I believe such a system is necessary because the rate of supplementary pension coverage in Ireland, estimated at just 35% of private sector workers, has, for considerable time now, been lower than is needed.  If measures are not taken to address this low rate of coverage, many future retirees will suffer unwanted and potentially significant reductions in their living standards on reaching retirement.   Pensions reform will continue to be a key priority for my Department.  To this end, earlier this year, I confirmed an intention to develop, publish and commence the implementation of an Action Plan for the reform of pensions during 2017.  This Action Plan will include a road map for the reform of the State pension, reforms to improve the current  Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution pension landscape, transposition of the EU &lsquo;IORP&rsquo; Pensions Directive and the development of an auto-enrolment supplementary pension system for working people without coverage.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The schemes also provide a range of supports to encourage and assist people on long-term illness and disability payments to identify and take up available employment, training, educational and other self-development opportunities, where this is appropriate to their circumstances and wishes.  These supports, therefore, make a significant contribution to the Government&rsquo;s broader social inclusion goal. It is not the function of the income support system to address the additional costs associated with a disability and there are no plans to establish a cost of disability payment within the social protection system.  People with disabilities are not a homogeneous group and, as such, have widely differing needs with the result that any additional costs of disability would not therefore arise to the same extent in all cases.  Moreover, some costs associated with disability are addressed across schemes provided by a number of agencies such as the health service and also the Revenue Commissioners through certain tax reliefs and other supports.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Most importantly, there will be no disruption to CIS and MABS services for those who use them.</p>  <p>The Citizens Information Board (CIB), which has statutory responsibility for the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) and the Citizens Information Services (CIS), decided on 15th   February 2017, to restructure the governance arrangements of these services.</p>  <p>The decision comes after a lengthy and extensive analysis of options and a detailed consultation period with all stakeholders on the need for a more streamlined governance model.  The decision was communicated by the Board to all CIS and MABS Boards and to all staff on 15th   February 2017.  </p>  <p>  Under the new governance arrangements, the number of individual local CIS and MABS company boards will reduce from ninety three (93) to sixteen (16).  The new regional board structure will comprise eight (8) CIS boards and eight (8) MABS boards.  </p>  <p>  The restructured governance arrangements are being implemented at local company board level only.  The forthcoming changes in the service delivery partner company governance structure will bring the CIS and MABS organisations more into line with modern public service governance guidelines and requirements where significant State funding is involved.  </p>  <p>  A more streamlined governance structure will result in a more targeted use of valuable staff resources, re-directed to increased front line service delivery, made possible by reduction in the current significant administrative burden associated with maintaining ninety three (93) individual companies nationwide.   </p>  <p>  In 2017, CIB is set to receive State funding of &euro;54 million, of which &euro;15 million is allocated to CIS services, and &euro;24 million is allocated to the network of MABS services. </p>  <p>  Following on from the decision of the Board, a Restructuring Implementation Group is being set up to examine all aspects of implementing the new sixteen (16) board model.  This work will include examination of the establishment costs of the new structure and the potential for future savings derived from the reduction in the administrative burden associated with ninety three (93) individual local companies.  Current costs are an aggregate of the costs incurred by each of the ninety three (93) local companies on items such as audit fees, profession fees (including legal services), payroll administration and board of director expenses.  While cost is not the driver of the restructuring project, some efficiencies are likely to result from moving to a reduced sixteen (16) company model.  The main aim of the project is to improve existing governance arrangements and optimise the benefits from operating a more modern, streamlined and customer focused service delivery model.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS), under the aegis of the Citizens  Information Board, assists people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems, in particular those on low incomes or living on social welfare payments. As part of its free services, MABS provides help and advice to those in mortgage arrears.</p>  <p>   The role of MABS was expanded in 2015 with the establishment of a Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS service (DMA MABS) across the MABS network, to help people specifically with home mortgage arrears.  There are now 32 specialist DMA advisors working across 27 locations countrywide, assisting borrowers to assess the options available to them and, where required, negotiating with lenders on their behalf.  To date, the DMA service has helped almost 3,000 such borrowers.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, MABS provides a national network of court mentors who attend each listed repossession Court hearing countrywide.  The mentors provide support to distressed borrowers who are facing the loss of their home and signpost them to the appropriate services.  To date, over 1,300 borrowers have been referred onward to MABS advisors through the court mentor service.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, an additional initiative was announced by Government.  The scheme, known as Abhaile, further extends the free services already available to borrowers through the DMA MABS service and the court mentor service.   The new voucher based scheme, for which MABS is the gateway, provides access for people, who are insolvent and in home mortgage arrears, to defined levels of independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, free of charge.  Qualification for help under the scheme is based on the borrower being (a) in mortgage arrears on their home; (b) insolvent; (c) at risk of losing their home because of their mortgage arrears; and (d) reasonably accommodated. </p>  <p>  The new services are provided by professionals drawn from one or more panels of solicitors, personal insolvency practitioners or accountants.  Professional panels consisting of qualified and regulated solicitors and personal insolvency practitioners are already in place, and my Department is working in consultation with the professional accountancy bodies to finalise the terms and conditions for a panel of accountants.  </p>  <p>  The scheme which has been in operation since 22 July 2016, was formally launched on 3 October 2016.  To date, 4,399 vouchers for services have been issued, in respect of 2,822 principle private residences.  Of the vouchers issued to date, 3,490 relate to the provision of personal insolvency practitioner services, 788 for legal advice services on issues related to mortgage arrears, and 121 for legal aid services relating to Section 115A Appeals, as defined under the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015.   </p>  <p>  The scheme is being put in place for a period of three years, at an expected total cost of &euro;15 million, to include a communication campaign to highlight the availability of the new services, which is due to commence in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In 2017, the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which is funded by the Citizens Information Board is set to receive State funding of &euro;24 million, including &euro;3.5m for the Abhaile services and &euro;3.26 m for DMA MABS.</p>  <p>  In addition to the services targeted at homeowners in mortgage arrears set out above, my Department administers the Mortgage Interest Supplement (MIS) scheme which is currently supporting   approximately 2,000 recipients who were availing of this support prior to the closure of the scheme to new claimants.  Customers availing of this support prior to 1st January 2014 have been able to retain entitlement to the scheme up to 1st January 2018.  The budget estimate for the scheme in 2017 is &euro;4.1 million. </p>  <p>  MIS recipient numbers were already in decline prior its cessation to new entrants. It is expected that existing MIS customers will continue to exit the scheme through sustainable solutions being put in place with their lenders; securing employment; or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, such as the Mortgage to Rent Scheme. </p>  <p>  I am continuing to monitor the supports and services which the Government has now put in place to assist homeowners in serious mortgage arrears.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  </p>  <p>  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits.  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  When the Green Paper was published in 2007, the expenditure on the State pension (contributory) amounted to &euro;2.75 billion.  The authors were asked to estimate the cost of backdating Homemakers at that point, and in doing so, noted that </p>  <p>  &ldquo;it is extremely difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty what the likely impact of backdating will be. Accordingly, the following estimates are extremely tentative&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  While there are a number of challenges involved, perhaps most notable are (a) estimating the level of take-up by fathers, and (b) the likely movements from one scheme to another, e.g. current non-contributory pensioners who would as a result have a higher contributory pension entitlement instead, and the net cost to the State in such cases.</p>  <p>  The estimate arrived at in 2007 was &euro;160 million (with reduced costs where the backdating was limited), which amounted to 5.8% of State pension contributory expenditure.  The scheme did not apply to the State pension (transition), and has no impact upon the State pension (non-contributory).</p>  <p>  There are now significantly more pensioners than there were in 2007, and the rate of payment has also increased significantly, and so the cost of both the pension, and of awarding higher percentage payments to former homemakers, is more substantial.  The State pension contributory has a provision for &euro;4.844 billion in 2017.  A recent exercise by the Department, based on up-to-date data, estimated that cost of backdating the Homemakers scheme in 2017 would be approximately &euro;290 million, with similar caveats about the degree to which it could be estimated.  This amounts to just under 6% of state pension (contributory) expenditure.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons which would be expected to increase the relative cost of backdating the homemakers scheme, but the main one is that the PRSI records of those retiring is evolving over time.  Women qualifying for a pension today were less than 22 years old when the &lsquo;marriage bar&rsquo; was ended, and were more likely to return to work following a few years out of the workforce than those who started families a decade earlier.  Indeed, many of the earlier cohort would have little or no PRSI contribution record at all, if they started their families when relatively young.  While many, in both cohorts, would qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult (IQA) or a non-contributory pension, an increasing number, particularly those who had significant personal means such as a private or occupational pension, now qualify instead for a reduced rate contributory pension, of say 85% of the maximum rate.  Such women would benefit very significantly from backdating of the scheme, whereas women with no means who continued to receive an IQA or a non-contributory pension would receive no benefit were such backdating to be introduced.  It would be expected that this would continue to increase the annual cost of such a measure, were it to be introduced, over the coming years.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This is the first reduction in the number of children in consistent poverty since 2008. Compared to 2014, in 2015 there was a 13,000 or approximately 9 per cent decrease in the number of children in consistent poverty. The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these figures. Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth. </p>  <p>  The monthly unemployment rate in January 2017 announced by the CSO was 7.1%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012.

Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality services in areas such as childcare, education and health.</p>  <p>  That is why one of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.</p></reply>

Expenditure on pensions, at approximately &euro;7 billion, is the largest block of expenditure in my Department in the Estimate for 2017, representing approximately 35% of overall expenditure.  Due to demographic changes, my Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p><p>As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years. The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  The conditions for the State pension (contributory) are reviewed on an ongoing basis, and there have been a number of changes over the years which impact upon whether someone qualifies or not.  </p><p>One of the conditions of the State pension (contributory) is that a person needs a minimum of 520 weekly contributions (i.e. 10 years) paid since entering insurable employment.  If a person does not have this minimum number of contributions paid, they will not generally have an entitlement to this particular pension, either at a full or reduced rate.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement. </p><p>As provided for in Budget 2012, from September 2012, new rate bands for State pension (contributory) were introduced.  These bands replaced the previous structure, introduced in 2000.  These bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person, and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions, subject to the safety nets in place for those with no other means.  Prior to the change in rate bands a person  reaching retirement age with a yearly average of 47 contributions qualified for the same rate of payment (98% of the maximum rate) as someone with a yearly average of 20 contributions, despite generally their much more significant PRSI record, and regardless of their means.  A person with an average of 48-52 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 more than someone with a yearly average of 20 PRSI contributions. </p><p>Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim. </p><p>Reversing the rates of these bands to the same percentages as were in place during the period 2000-2012 in the next Budget would carry a cost of at least &euro;60 million in 2018, and this would rise at a rate of &euro;10 million per annum.  Rather than use those funds in this manner, which would generally benefit pensioners with other means over and above the state pension itself, and who contributed less into the Social Insurance Fund, it was decided that the increases in pension rates in 2016 and 2017 would be across the board, pro-rata, to the benefit of every pensioner.This positively impacted upon many more people than a reversal of the rate-bands, and unlike that approach, it was to the benefit of those pensioners with no other means.  Any policy change, which saw the rate-bands reverting to 2000-2012 percentages, would result in significantly less money being available to increase the general rate of the pension. </p><p>The home-makers scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties. The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years after that date spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied. This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension. </p><p>Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age. Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them. Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p><p>The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme the position of gender and gaps in contribution records will be considered very carefully in developing these proposals.  The forthcoming independent Actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund will provide data that will allow officials to accurately cost and project various options under the TCA reform.  Following the analysis of that data, it is intended to have a public consultation later this year.  Once that is completed, proposals on the final details of the scheme will be made by the Government to the Oireachtas before the end of the year. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Government has provided some &euro;378 million for the SWA scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  Determinations made in relation to claims made under Sections 196, 197 and 198 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation Act) 2005, namely basic weekly SWA and all supplements, can be appealed to the Social Welfare Appeals Office under Section 311 of that Act.   </p>  <p>  Determinations made in relation to claims made under Sections 200, 201 and 202 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation Act) 2005, namely allowances-in-kind, ENPs and UNPs, can be reviewed by a SWA Reviewing Officer under Section 323 of that Act.  </p>  <p>  Decisions on claims are communicated to customers in writing, as well as the customer&rsquo;s right to appeal or review, as appropriate.</p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Damian Green, M.P. on 2nd February 2017.  Prior to that meeting, I also met informally with Mr Damian Hinds, Minister for Employment, UK Department of Work and Pensions at the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council [EPSCO] on 8 December 2016.</p>  <p>  At both meetings, I emphasised that our long-term objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of civic rights and, specifically in the context of the meeting, social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area [CTA], are safeguarded and maintained.  Both meetings were very positive and constructive.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection [DSP] has undertaken an initial assessment of the implications of Brexit on social welfare schemes and clients cohorts.  This work will now be further informed by the All-Island Sectoral Dialogue that I hosted on Thursday, 16th   February.  The theme of this stakeholder engagement event was &lsquo;Brexit:  implications for social welfare pensions, social insurance and social welfare rights-entitlements&rsquo;.  The event was a citizen-centred and client-focussed forum, attended by some 40 people from civil society and representative groups, business, trade unions and academia.</p>  <p>  Internally, within DSP, the Management Board has been fully engaged with the social protection implications of the vote by the UK to leave the EU and the earlier negotiations on the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU.  A sub-group of the Board was established, following a decision of the Management Board in November 2015, to prepare for the impact of the UK referendum.  An Assistant Secretary has specific responsibility for the Department&rsquo;s Brexit response and is a member of the InterDepartmental Group on EU UK affairs, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Regular updates are given to the Management Board.</p>  <p>  In addition, a cross-Divisional group covering policy, operational policy, systems and key support areas has been established to examine the detail of the implications of Brexit for clients of the Department and DSP&rsquo;s operations.  The Department has also strengthened its own resources by redeploying additional staff specifically to work on Brexit-related issues and internal co-ordination.</p>  <p>  Senior DSP officials service the relevant cross-Departmental Brexit-related committees that have been established.  I am a member of the Cabinet Committee on Brexit as well as being a member of the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</p></reply>

This is due to volatility in the stock markets, increasing liabilities arising from the demographic pressures of increasing life expectancy, low interest rates, and regulatory requirements.  Essentially the cost of providing benefits has increased at a rate that has not been covered by the investment returns earned by pension schemes.  In addition, accountancy standards, which make pensions liabilities very apparent on a company's balance sheet, contribute to the pressures under which DB schemes are operating.</p>  <p>  During the financial crisis the decline of such schemes accelerated to the extent that the whole sector was at risk.  At that stage a series of legislative amendments was brought forward to alleviate the situation.  This followed much consideration of a range of matters such as balancing returns between members, debt on the employer and pension protection funds.</p>  <p>  In spite of the difficulties, many employers have made great efforts to support and deliver on the pension promise made to scheme members.  Many scheme trustees are working hard to ensure the on-going viability of their schemes.  This process is best managed through discussion and negotiation between trustees, employers and members, where efforts are made to reach agreement regarding the steps that must be taken to secure scheme viability.  These steps may include a mix of measures such as increased employer/member contributions, longer working and amended benefits.  I believe that this is the best approach to scheme difficulties.</p>  <p>  I believe further steps can and should be taken in relation to the funding standard.  Following discussions between my officials, the Pensions Authority, the Society of Actuaries and the Irish Association of Pension Funds, the Pensions Authority will shortly bring forward proposals to allow some additional flexibility for DB schemes and to tackle some difficulties with the current operation of the standard.  I intend to consult employer and union representatives on these proposals before making any changes.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The service is delivered by two companies, Seetec and Turas Nua.</p><p>The service was rolled out on a phased basis over the period mid-2015 to July 2016, as a result the first groups of participants have only recently completed their engagement period with the service.  It is important to note, that under the service jobseekers have access to a personal adviser (PA) who works with them over two phases.  The first phase, of 12 months duration, the PA provides practical assistance in searching, preparing for, securing and sustaining employment.  The second phase starts if the jobseeker is successful in finding work. During this phase the PA continues to work with the jobseeker for a further period of at least three months, and up to 12 months.  It will take time therefore to accumulate a sufficient number of clients (who have completed their engagement period) for complete and robust outcomes data to be available.</p><p>However from 2017, the Department will publish a report on the performance of the service on a quarterly basis, with the first such report having just been published recently (17th of January).</p><p>The initial data on the impact of the service is encouraging. </p><p>- Employment outcome data shows that compared to people who did not take part in the service, people who availed of the service were 23% more likely to have started a job  (as of October 2016).  The difference appears to be more marked for very long-term unemployed people, with those out of work for more than three years some 44% more likely to have found a job if they engaged with the service.</p><p>- The results from the first independently conducted customer satisfaction survey indicates that jobseekers feel that they are receiving a good service under JobPath (76 &ndash; 81% satisfaction vs 5 &ndash; 8% dissatisfaction), that the staff of the service make them feel valued (90%+) and they have a good relationship with their personal adviser (90%+). They also feel that the service has improved their chances of getting a job (68% - 77%);</p><p>Given that only a small number of people have completed their full engagement period with the service these results can only be treated as indicative, nevertheless they are encouraging. </p><p>As the number of people who have completed their engagement period with the service increases the department will be in a position to provide greater granularity in the reports to be published each quarter this year.</p><p>The first report (with results together with a copy of the independent customer satisfaction survey findings for both companies) is available on the department&rsquo;s website at &ndash;</p><p><i></i></p><p>In relation to ensuring that the outcomes are suitable to the person, the Department was careful in designing the service to ensure that payments to contractors are conditional on people not just finding a job, but finding sustainable employment.  The companies are, for example, paid for each 13 week period of sustained employment of at least 30 hours per week.  The suitability of employment is therefore a key factor in ensuring that jobs are sustainable.  If people are placed into unsuitable jobs they are less likely to remain in employment and as a consequence the provider&rsquo;s fees will be reduced.  In addition the department has built in a number of controls related to the service, for example should one of the companies fall below the standards expected by the department in terms of performance, customer satisfaction or quality of service delivery the department can retain fees due to the companies.  The department conducts audits and inspections and monitors customer satisfaction and performance of the companies on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

The contributions must have been paid on one of the spouse/civil partners&rsquo; social insurance records and all must have been made before the death of the spouse/civil partner.  Once in payment, the pension remains payable while the person remains widowed or a surviving civil partner.  The legal context governing relationships such as marriage is broader than the social protection system.  Where that context changes, the social welfare code is examined for appropriate changes, e.g., the scheme was introduced for widows on 1st January 1936; it was extended to widowers on 28th October 1994 in light of gender equality issues that had not been considered in the 1930s; and extended to surviving civil partners from 1st January 2011 following the introduction of civil partnership.  Entering into a marriage or civil partnership is a legal act, which confers both rights and obligations on both parties, which do not exist in a legal sense between co-habiting couples. Widows, widowers and surviving civil partners, who become bereaved, therefore, in addition to their personal loss, also lose someone who had legal duties towards them.  In some cases those legal duties were, in part, financial in nature, and the social welfare code recognises that potential loss by providing a pension to them, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  A surviving cohabitant who was not married to their deceased former partner may be entitled to other social welfare payments if he or she has an income need, e.g., One-Parent Family Payment, Jobseekers Benefit or Allowance or Family Income Supplement.  Payment of Child Benefit would continue, where applicable. </p>  <p>  In terms of other income supports, supplementary welfare allowance is a means tested weekly payment, subject to certain terms and conditions, which provides a basic income support to eligible people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.</p>  <p>  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating the rate of pension entitlement.  Entitlement is banded, with the maximum rate payable to those with a yearly average of 48-52 contributions, and the minimum rate payable to those with a yearly average in the range of 10-14 contributions per year.  Even if someone has only 10 years (520 weeks) of paid reckonable contributions between their 16th and 66th birthdays, they would generally qualify for a State pension (contributory), although the rate payable would vary depending on their circumstances, and it will not always be their most advantageous payment to claim, particularly if they qualify for a full-rate State pension (non-contributory).</p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension contributory (SPC) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age, or incapacitated people, to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being calculated for pension purposes.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, making it easier for them to qualify for a maximum rate SPC.  It does not involve the award of credits.  My Department reviews these and other provisions on an ongoing basis and has estimated that the cost of extending the Homemakers scheme to allow people to avail of the full 20 years currently allowed under the scheme, encompassing periods prior to 1994, could cost &euro;290m in 2017.  This figure would increase in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors.  This is due to the redistributive nature of the Fund.</p>  <p>  Where people who were unattached to the labour market during most of their adult lives cannot qualify for a contributory pension in their own right as they have paid few or no contributions, or cannot qualify for a full rate as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such pensioners in old age.  Therefore, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate. </p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contributions Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration later in the year.  This is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This compared to 14.4% the year before.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 25.2% to 34.8% and basic deprivation rose from 51.3% to 53.2% for this group in 2015.  However, these figures (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) have been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the changes over the year are statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals.  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p><p>The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.</p><p>My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme<b>.</b></p></reply>

Abolishing the bereavement grant provided a significant annual saving.  This allowed the Department to protect other social welfare payments such as the State pension. </p>  <p>  There are a range of supports available for people following bereavement which provide more significant support than the grant.  These include a weekly-paid widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner&rsquo;s (contributory and non-contributory) pensions, which are based on contributions or a means test, and a once-off widowed or surviving civil partner grant of &euro;6,000 where there is a dependent child.  A number of social welfare payments, including State pension, continue in payment for six weeks following a death.  In Budget 2016, the Government increased the payment after death period to 12 weeks for carer&rsquo;s allowance.  Guardian payments are available where someone cares for an orphaned child.  A special funeral grant of &euro;850 is paid where a person dies because of an accident at work or occupational disease.</p>  <p>  The supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme provides assistance to eligible people in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.  Under the SWA scheme, the Department of Social Protection may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet from their weekly income, which may include help with funeral and burial expenses.  The Government has provided &euro;31.5 million for exceptional and urgent needs payments in 2017. </p>  <p>  Although ENP expenditure has reduced in recent years, the scheme is demand led and continues to provide assistance to those with exceptional needs taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  Provisional expenditure for 2016 is &euro;32 million, showing that expenditure under the scheme is stabilising in recent years in line with the improvement in the economy.</p>  <p>  Any decision to restore the bereavement grant would have to be considered in the context of overall budgetary negotiations. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The numbers in receipt of rent supplement are declining for a number of reasons including the continuing improvement in the economy and transfer to social housing options.  The most significant policy change is the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), under which responsibility for persons with long term housing needs transfers from my Department to the local authorities.  While statistics are not maintained on those leaving rent supplement and entering homeless services, I can assure the deputy every effort is made by my Department so that rent supplement tenants can remain in their homes.  In view of the on-going rental market difficulties, my Department implements a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits.  In addition, the Protocol arrangement in place with Threshold is operational in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Dublin, Cork, Meath, Kildare and Wicklow and Galway City.  Since the introduction of this flexible approach, in excess of 11,000 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments.  These measures in tandem with the increased rent limits introduced in July 2016 are supporting rent supplement tenants to minimise the threat of losing their tenancies. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-21a.114.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022100058#WRC02300"><p>The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided that State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years, which is the current State pension age.  This will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  Where this is not possible, and where they are available for work, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  Reversing this measure would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million. Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;80 million, and this is expected to increase over time. </p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision which are currently increasing by close to &euro;1 billion every 5 years.  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital, if the current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no statutory retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so. </p>  <p>  In January 2016, an Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established specifically to examine the implications arising from prevailing retirement ages.  The final report of the Group made a number of recommendations to support working and retirement practices.  This included a request to the Workplace Relations Commission to prepare a Code of Practice under Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to help manage the engagement between employers and employees regarding retirement issues and longer working.  The final report, the recommendations of which were accepted by Government in August 2016, is available on the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The contract for the safety camera service, which was awarded following a public procurement competition, is with Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe.  The new safety camera contract is an agreement between the Minister for Justice and Equality, the Commissioner of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Road Safety Operations Ireland, trading as GoSafe.  </p><p>The Minister for Justice and Equality authorised the awarding of the services agreement for the provision and operation of safety cameras on a managed service basis for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with Section 81(7) of the Road Traffic Act, 2010.  Section 81(7) of the Road Traffic Act 2010 provides for persons, other than members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to make recordings, which can be used as evidence of an offence under the Road Traffic Acts, when authorised to do so by means of an agreement with the Minister for Justice and Equality. </p><p>The duration of the new contract is 6 years, with the option to extend the contract for an additional 12 months. Under the new contract, GoSafe will provide an annual minimum of 90,000 hours of monitoring and surveying vehicle speed across 1,031 designated safety camera zones.  This equates to a minimum of 7,400 monitoring hours and 100 survey hours a month.  This represents an annual increase of 300 hours on the existing contract.  The new contract also contains provisions for up to 1,500 additional monitoring hours within any calendar month and the option to avail of fixed, temporary fixed and average speed safety camera systems.  </p><p>The role of the Garda Safety Camera Contract is to improve road safety by changing driver behaviour in order to reduce road traffic fatalities and serious injuries by reducing the incidence of drivers exceeding stipulated speed limits, in circumstances where speeding is known to be a significant factor behind serious collisions. </p><p>The Government's current Road Safety Strategy (2013 &ndash; 2020) sets the task of making Ireland's roads as safe as the best performing countries in the European Union and beyond.  The strategy aims to reduce road collisions to 25 road deaths per million of population by 2020.  The recent increase in road deaths (188 road traffic fatalities in 2016) highlights the need to continue to deploy all effective measures to reduce speeding, and therefore road traffic collisions.  Speed enforcement is a key component in Garda road safety enforcement strategy and the introduction of a safety camera network has been central to this strategy for several years.  The network also releases Garda resources for other road safety enforcement and the speed surveying function it provides informs road policing operations generally. </p><p>The overall impact of the cameras can be seen in the number of fatal collisions in the designated safety camera zones, referred to as speed enforcement zones.  The designation of specific sections of road as speed enforcement zones is based on an analysis of collision data by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The locations of these speed enforcement zones are available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.  In the years 2004 to 2009 (the 6 years before the introduction of the safety camera network began), approximately 3 out of 10 (30%) fatal collisions occurred in these zones.  Following the introduction of monitoring, this collision rate dropped to less than 2 in 10 (17%) in 2013 and to approximately 9% to April 2015. </p><p>After reaching a low of 165 in 2015, the 2016 increase in road fatalities strengthens the argument for all agencies to maximise their road safety efforts so as to reverse this development.  The Road Safety Authority plays a vital role in the context of road safety in Ireland by:</p><p>- Developing and implementing to increase awareness of road safety and promote safer driving;</p><p>- Improving </p><p>- Establishing and monitoring a </p><p>- Overseeing the and </p><p>- Working with stakeholders to ensure a co-ordinated response and ensure our collective resources are used wisely and efficiently;</p><p>- Undertaking in order to develop measures and recommendations to improve road safety;</p><p>- Advising the Minister for Transport on road safety policy;</p><p>- Producing road safety strategy documents and monitoring their implementation.</p></reply>

The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling, including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery.  It will provide for the licensing of all forms of on-line gambling.</p><p>  It is the intention to proceed with this legislation at the earliest opportunity. In support of these efforts the Government has delegated powers of the Minister for Justice and Equality under the gaming and lotteries legislation to me as Minister of State. </p><p>As the Deputy will recall, the General Scheme was referred to what was at the time the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for consideration and observations.  The Joint Committee received 29 submissions and held public hearings following which it issued a report on 6 November 2013 which contained 8 conclusions and was laid before the Houses.</p><p>The 2013 General Scheme provides for the conferring of responsibility for all regulatory matters in this area on the Minister for Justice and Equality, including licensing, inspections and prosecutions, and it envisages that these functions would be carried out by a body located within the Department of Justice and Equality.  The General Scheme also provides for a dedicated inspectorate to ensure compliance by licence holders with the terms of their licences and with the new legislation generally.</p><p>  The Gambling Control Bill will have consumer protection generally as one of its core principles, and it is envisaged that it will include several measures aimed at the protection of vulnerable persons, including children, from risks to their well-being arising from gambling.  The 2013 Scheme includes measures that will require licence holders to act in a socially responsible way.  These measures include controls on advertising, promotions and sponsorship.</p><p>Pending the bringing forward of the main Bill, which is a major undertaking, I have also asked my Department to examine whether there are any individual pressing areas of concern, intended to be dealt with in the Bill, which could be dealt with early this year by separate legislative measures.  A number of such measures are, therefore, under active consideration and will be included in the Scheme of the forthcoming Courts and Civil Law Miscellaneous Provisions Bill which is, under the Government Legislation Programme, to be submitted for legislative scrutiny early this year.  This initial approach will, as I have indicated, be augmented by the completion of the more complex work on the main Bill for Government approval and publication in due course.</p><p>  I and officials of my Department are continuing to consult with relevant stake-holders, including those with experience in dealing with persons for whom gambling has become a problem and, as I have outlined, I intend to move forward as quickly as possible with the appropriate legislation.</p></reply>

The recommendation made by the IRM in this particular case was that I should take no further action.</p>  <p>  Certain matters arising from the tragic death in this case were already being investigated by Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC).  This arises in part from the fact that my predecessor had referred aspects of this particular case to GSOC.  I understand that, that investigation has not concluded.  I should also mention that a civil action has been initiated against the State in respect of issues raised in the complaint.</p>  <p>  When the Taoiseach and I recently met with the family, the Taoiseach assured them that when the GSOC investigation is completed the question of whether, and if so, what further action can be taken, will be considered.

Under this programme, the Government has pledged to accept a total of 4,000 persons into the State, 2,622 through the EU relocation mechanism established by two EU Council Decisions in 2015 to assist Italy and Greece, and 1,040 (519 by the end of 2016 and the remainder in 2017) under the UNHCR-led refugee resettlement programme currently focussed on resettling refugees from Lebanon. </p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais.  These initiatives therefore leave just a small residual balance to be allocated from the Government decision to take 4,000 persons.</p><p>Resettlement strand of the programme</p><p>Taking account of the situation in the Middle East, and the plight of the refugees, the T&aacute;naiste announced that Ireland would accept 520 persons for resettlement over an 18-month period to the end of 2017.  This was almost double the figure proposed for Ireland by the European Commission and was delivered a year ahead of the Commission deadline.  </p><p>In addition, the Government recently announced that it is extending the resettlement programme to take in a further 520 refugees from Lebanon in  2017, most of whom are of Syrian origin.  260 refugees have already been selected during a selection mission to Lebanon in October 2016 and are expected to arrive in Spring 2017.  Most of these refugees are also Syrian.  A further selection mission to Lebanon will be arranged in the coming months to select the remaining refugees due to come to Ireland in 2017 under the resettlement programme. </p><p>Relocation strand of the programme</p><p>Despite initial delays outside of Ireland's control in respect of the operation of the 'hotspots' on the ground in Greece, Ireland has to date taken in a total of 320 people from Greece under relocation, another 78 people have been formally accepted and are awaiting transport arrangements, and a further 155 have been assessed and are awaiting clearance.  A monthly schedule has been agreed with the Greek authorities which will sustain the pace of intakes throughout 2017 at the levels required to allow Ireland to meets its commitments to Greece within the time frame envisaged by the  Programme. </p><p>As regards Italy, the relocation mechanism from Italy has yet to commence for many countries, including Ireland, due to issues with the Italian authorities surrounding the security assessment of migrants assigned to other Member States.  Intensive efforts are ongoing to resolve this, both bilaterally with Italian counterparts at official, diplomatic and Ministerial level, and at EU level, including through the European Commission.</p><p>The total target for relocation to Ireland in the Council Decisions also includes a further 910 persons but the country of origin for this cohort has not yet been assigned at EU level.  </p><p>The following table sets out the position regarding the assignment of the 4,000. </p><p>Table of Total Numbers under Government Decision<table><tr><th>Relocation Strand</th><th>Numbers</th></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1523</td><td>600</td></tr><tr><td>Council Decision 2015/1601</td><td>2,022</td></tr><tr><td>Total Relocation</td><td>2,622</td></tr><tr><td>Resettlement Strand</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 09/06/15</td><td>520</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 06/07/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Government Decision 29/11/16</td><td>260</td></tr><tr><td>Total Resettlement</td><td>1,040</td></tr><tr><td>Total Unaccompanied Minors Calais (Government Decision 10/11/16)</td><td>200 (up to)</td></tr><tr><td>Mechanism as yet undecided</td><td>138</td></tr><tr><td>Grand Total</td><td>4000</td></tr></table></p><p>Unaccompanied minors</p><p>In announcing the IRPP, the Government recognised the importance of prioritising family groups and addressing the position of unaccompanied children.  A significant number of those who have arrived to date are young children with one or two parents.  Ireland has taken in four unaccompanied minors with another to follow very shortly; we have indicated our willingness to take further unaccompanied minors from Greece under relocation and work continues in this regard.  Such minors are placed in the care of Tusla.  Unaccompanied minors that Ireland takes from Greece are additional to the commitments made by Ireland in respect those previously resident in the migrant camp in Calais.</p><p>In summary, under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme 519 refugees have arrived in Ireland under resettlement and 320 persons have arrived in Ireland under relocation.  I wish to confirm to the Deputy the deep commitment of the Government to delivering on its decision to accept 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers, notwithstanding the difficulties that have been encountered so far which have been outside of Ireland's control.</p></reply>

Refugees admitted under the resettlement programme have been resettled in 39 different communities throughout Ireland and in all four Dublin local authority areas to date.  In the coming months, persons admitted under the relocation programme and who have been granted refugee status, subsidiary protection or permission to remain will begin the process of resettlement into local communities.  Preparatory work is ongoing in this regard.  </p><p>Resettlement has been ongoing in Ireland since 2000 when the first refugees were admitted under the resettlement quota programme.  Over the years, programmes have been developed to support refugees, known as &quot;programme refugees&quot;, post arrival to assist refugees to adjust and to prepare for independent living.  A separate programme, building on the work started during the Reception phase, begins in local receiving communities approximately nine months before the refugees move into the local community.</p><p>The Resettlement Programme is coordinated at the national level by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration (OPMI), Department of Justice and Equality, and is overseen by an Inter-Departmental Working Group which has representation from mainstream Government Departments, the HSE, and SOLAS.  This Inter-Departmental Working Group at a national level is a key driver of the resettlement programme.</p><p>Key elements of the post arrival programme are:</p><p>- Staff from the OPMI Resettlement Team, accompanied by interpreters, meet the refugees airside on arrival and accompany them to an Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre where they are accommodated for approximately 8 to 12 weeks.</p><p>- During the days post arrival the refugees are registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) where they are issued with a Registration Certificate.</p><p>- Refugees are registered with the Department of Social Protection for a public services card and to be assessed for a social protection income.</p><p>- Refugees are assisted to apply for a medical card.</p><p>- An 8 to 10 week Language Training and Cultural Orientation programme is provided by the Education and Training Board.  During this programme, refugees hear about their rights and responsibilities.  They have time to ask questions, build confidence and rest.  Speakers are invited from various organisations to provide information about their services.  Interpretation is provided to ensure a full understanding of the content on the part of the refugees.</p><p>- Local Service Providers, volunteers and NGOs visit the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres to provide services, to provide information and to support and befriend the refugees.</p><p>- The period of 8 -10 weeks allows newly arrived refugees to rest and acclimatise to their new environment and culture before being moved to independent living in the community.</p><p>- A GP is assigned and refugees have the opportunity to deal with their emergency medical needs.  Adults and children who may not have had access to medical services for some time are referred for Dental and Optical assessments.</p><p>- Interpreter/Translator/Cross Cultural workers are currently being interviewed to work in the EROCs to facilitate better understanding between service providers and the refugee clients  to promote better outcomes for the refugees.</p><p>- Childcare is  provided free of charge to allow the adults to attend the Language and Orientation programme.</p><p>- Education provision is made for school age children by the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>- Refugees are individually assisted to apply for a medical card.</p><p>- Emergency medical matters are followed up while resident in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centres.</p><p>- Once the refugees have completed their post arrival Orientation and Language Training programme, and when housing is available, the refugees are transferred to the Local Community with the support of the resettlement team from the OPMI and supported at a local level by service providers and volunteers in the local community. </p><p>The Language and Orientation Training that began while resident in the Emergency Reception and Orientation Centre continues post resettlement in the community.</p><p>Key elements of the resettlement programme in the Community are:</p><p>- The programme is coordinated at local level by a Resettlement Inter-agency Working Group comprising of representatives of all local mainstream Service Providers which is established in each receiving community.  The local Inter-agency Working Group is chaired by the Local Authority and supported by the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration.</p><p>- Work in preparation for the arrival of refugees begins nine months in advance of resettlement.</p><p>- Services to refugees are provided on the basis of mainstream model of service provision, while recognising that targeted initiatives may be required during the first year post resettlement as the newly arrived refugees adapt to independent living, a new language and culture.</p><p>- Each Service Provider representative on the Inter-Agency Working Group plays a role in the preparation for receiving the refugees. </p><p>- GPs, school placement, housing, social protection income and English language training, links with the local NGOs and the Community and Voluntary sector are organised, in so far as possible, in advance of the refugees' arrival in the community.  </p><p>- Programme refugees admitted for resettlement purposes have, in general, the same rights and entitlements as an Irish citizen in relation e.g. to employment, education and training, medical care, social welfare, access to the courts etc. </p><p>- OPMI provides interpretation where required and assists in the resolution of issues arising during the first two weeks post arrival. </p><p>- OPMI provides funding to employ a Resettlement Support Worker who works closely with the refugee community to help them to resolve issues arising thus building capacity towards independent living.  The Resettlement Support Worker provides day to day support, identifies gaps in services and issues arising relating to accessing services, and brings these to the attention of the Service Provider.</p><p>- Language training is provided in the receiving community by the Education and Training Board for a period of 12 months post arrival.  Where a person has adequate levels of English, that person is placed in mainstream courses by the Education and Training Board.  The person may also be referred to the Department of Social Protection for inclusion in their activation programmes.</p><p>- Childcare is provided under mainstream Childcare schemes funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  This facilitates participation by adults in language and other training programmes.</p><p>- Children are placed in local schools.  Funding is provided through OPMI grants to organise after-schools clubs and to encourage children to participate in school outings, sporting and other activities at a local level.</p><p>- Funding is provided by the OPMI to support engagement by adults in local events and activities such as promoting participation in men's shed, women's groups, involvement in the arts and sporting activities, organising intercultural events promoting participation in volunteering at a local level. </p><p>- Local NGOs and the Community and Voluntary Sector work in cooperation with the local Resettlement Support Worker to include newly arrived refugees in local activities.</p><p>- Local volunteers are encouraged and facilitated to engage with newly arrived refugees at a local level.  Funding is provided to encourage outings and visits to local attractions and other activities organised by volunteers, subject to appropriate Garda vetting.</p><p>- Adults and children are encouraged to participate in local sporting activities and funding is provided to support this where appropriate. </p><p>- All resettled refugees have the contact details of their key OPMI Resettlement Officer should any issues arise that cannot be resolved locally.</p><p>It is intended that similar programmes will be put in place for persons relocated from Greece and/or Italy under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme and work is ongoing in this regard.</p></reply>

Political agreement was reached on the draft Directive in December 2016.  The text was endorsed by the European Parliament&rsquo;s Internal Market Committee on 26 January 2017 and is due to be voted by the full Parliament in March, and if passed, will then formally be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council.</p>  <p>  The Firearms Directive allows the Commission to adopt standards and rules on the deactivation of firearms.  The Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/2403 of 15 December 2015 (Deactivation Regulation) establishes common guidelines on deactivation within the EU with the objective of addressing problems due to the illegal re-activation of firearms by using pieces of other deactivated arms, home-made pieces or pieces acquired via the internet. </p>  <p>  This Regulation sets out common and strict minimum criteria for the way EU countries must deactivate weapons so that they are rendered irreversibly inoperable. This Regulation came into effect on 8 April 2016 and has direct application within this jurisdiction.  It is important to note that the Regulation permits both firearms owners and registered firearms dealers to carry out the work required to render the firearm irreversibly deactivated in accordance with the regulation.  The firearm must then be submitted to any one of the current [46] national competent authorities within the EU for verification and certification.</p>  <p>  Ireland has not appointed a Competent Authority to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with this Regulation because there is no significant firearms manufacturing industry in this country and no formal training for a gunsmith is recognised by the State.  However, the Department of Justice and Equality has received statements of interest from twelve interested parties who wish to be assessed to be appointed as a Competent Authority for the verification of the deactivation of firearms under the regulation.  As the Regulation is currently being revised by the European Commission, these interested parties have been advised that the Department does not propose to progress their applications until the amended text has been agreed and approved by the  Commission.  In the meantime, the Birmingham Proof House has been approved by UK authorities to verify the deactivation of firearms in accordance with the Regulation and they have indicated their willingness to undertake such verification work for Irish customers. </p>  <p>  The possession of any firearm, even after deactivation, will continue to require authorisation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

There are also 18 Garda Reserves and 16 civilians attached to the Coolock District.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2016, the purpose of which is to address issues relating to bail and sentencing for prolific burglars of dwellings, provides that persons awaiting trial for burglary of a dwelling who have recent convictions or pending charges for domestic burglaries can be denied bail in appropriate cases. </p>  <p>  The Act also provides for consecutive sentences for prolific burglars.  Section 2 of the Act inserts a new section 54A into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001.  This provision requires a court which decides to impose custodial sentences for multiple domestic burglary offences committed within a 12 month window to impose such sentences consecutively.  The provisions apply to adults previously convicted of a domestic burglary committed in the five years before the burglary offence for which they are being sentenced.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides that  a person guilty of burglary is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years or both and section 13 of the Act provides that a person convicted of aggravated burglary is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for life.  </p>  <p>  In addition, section 26 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 provides that a court may make a monitoring order for persons convicted of aggravated burglary.  The court may also make a Protection of Persons Order which prohibits the offender from engaging in any behaviour that would be likely to cause the victim of the offence fear, distress or alarm.  That Act also provides that where a person has been convicted on indictment of a specified offence (which includes aggravated burglary) and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years and commits another specified offence within 7 years of the first conviction, the court must impose a minimum term of imprisonment which is at least three quarters of the maximum sentence provided by law for that offence, or at least 10 years imprisonment if the maximum sentence is life imprisonment, unless to do so would be disproportionate in all the circumstances of the case.</p>  <p>  The case for any further strengthening of the law will be kept under review, and the Justice and Equality Joint Committee could play an important role in this regard. However, it must also be borne in mind that the Strategic Review of Penal Policy report published in 2014 made a number of recommendations in relation to sentencing.  Adopting an approach similar to the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Mandatory Sentences published in June 2013, the Review Group recommended that no further mandatory sentences or presumptive minimum sentences be introduced and that existing provisions should be reviewed.  An Implementation and Oversight Group was established in 2015 to oversee implementation of these recommendations.  </p>  <p>  Finally, it is important to also mention the activities of Operation Thor which was established to tackle burglary and related crimes, in both rural and urban areas.  Since the launch of the operation in November 2015, the burglary figures have shown a significant downward trend and the most recent crime statistics for Q3 of 2016 show a decrease of 31% in burglary for the twelve months ending 30 September 2016 compared to the previous twelve month period.</p></reply>

A court may also make an order under section 11 when granting a judicial separation or divorce.  Section 3 of the 1964 Act provides that the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration for the court in any proceedings where access to a child is in question.  </p>  <p>  The law places an emphasis on recognising the rights of the child to the society of both his or her parents.  Section 11D of the 1964 Act obliges the court in proceedings under section 11 to consider whether the child's best interests would be served by maintaining personal relations and direct contact with each of his or her parents on a regular basis.  Section 25 of the 1964 Act requires the court, as it thinks appropriate and practicable, to take into account the child's wishes in access matters, having regard to the age and understanding of the child.  </p>  <p>  Section 56 of the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 inserted a new section 18A into the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  Section 18A provides that where a parent or guardian of a child has been granted access to the child under the 1964 Act, but he or she has been unreasonably denied such access by another guardian or parent, that person may apply to court for an enforcement order.</p>  <p>  The court shall make an enforcement order only where the court considers that access was unreasonably denied, an enforcement order would be in the best interests of the child, and it is appropriate in the circumstances of the case to make an enforcement order.  An enforcement order may provide for:</p>  <p>   - granting the applicant additional time with the child to help rebuild or strengthen their relationship if it has been disrupted by the denial of access;</p>  <p>   - requiring the parent or guardian who denied access to repay the applicant the necessary expenses he or she incurred in trying to exercise access;</p>  <p>   - requiring either or both the applicant and the parent or guardian who denied custody or access to undertake a parenting programme or family counselling, or receive information about the possibility of availing of mediation.</p>  <p>  The court may not make an order granting additional time with the child unless the child has had the opportunity to make his or her views known and the court has taken them into account.  </p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I have no role in the enforcement of court orders.  This is the function of the courts, which are, subject to the Constitution and the law, independent in the performance of their functions.  However, the operation of the law in this area is kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

The Act provides for the introduction of a single procedure which enables all grounds for seeking international protection and permission to remain in the State for other reasons to be examined and determined in one process.  The new procedure brings the State into line with protection processing arrangements in all other EU States and gives effect to one of the main recommendations of the McMahon report.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) has been abolished and responsibility for the investigation and determination of applications for international protection and related permission to remain matters has transferred to a new International Protection Office (IPO) in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.  The IPO is statutorily independent in the performance of its international protection functions. </p>  <p>  A comprehensive information process has been put in place by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service and the new International Protection Office to ensure that applicants and their legal representatives are aware of the provisions of the new legislation and particularly how it will impact on applicants who are affected by the transitional arrangements.  The transitional arrangements apply to certain applications for refugee status and subsidiary protection which were made before the commencement date and were not finalised for processing by the ORAC and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that, as is required by the 2015 Act, in late January/February 2017 the IPO, in addition to placing advertisements in the national media, wrote to approximately 3,000 applicants whose cases were not finalised by the ORAC or the RAT to inform them of the relevant provisions of the 2015 Act and how the transitional provisions would affect their applications.  This information was made available in some 17 languages.  All applicants received the following documents with the mailshot</p>  <p>   - Information Note - Transitional Arrangements (IPO 12),</p>  <p>   - Information Booklet for Applicants for International Protection (IPO 1) and,</p>  <p>   - Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2).</p>  <p>  On 30 January 2017, the IPO wrote to all legal representatives on record providing information on the new legislation.  The legal representatives received copies of the main template letters sent to the applicants along with the Information Note on transitional arrangements (IPO 12).  In addition, notices were circulated to Direct Provision centres in relation to the mailshot.  </p>  <p>  I am also informed by the Chief International Protection Officer that he has held a number of meetings with Non-Governmental Organisations and the UNHCR, through the IPO Customer Liaison Panel, to brief them on the arrangements for the commencement of the Act and for the notification of applicants in relation to the transitional provisions and how these will be operated in practice.</p>  <p>  I understand also that additional resources have been provided to the Legal Aid Board to provide advice and assistance to applicants with their applications.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that the letters sent to applicants in January/February 2017 made clear that the Application for International Protection Questionnaire (IPO 2) should be returned "if possible, no later than 20 working days from the date of the covering letter".  However, this is purely an administrative deadline and flexibility is being provided by the International Protection Office if extra time is required for its completion and the receipt of legal advice, where required.  I understand the IPO has again written to the members of the Customer Liaison Panel to remove any doubt on that score.  The IPO, however, remains anxious to re-commence the processing of international protection applications under the 2015 Act on a comprehensive basis and the return of completed Questionnaires and accompanying documents as soon as possible by applicants will assist this process.  There is also provision for supplementary information to be provided subsequent to the completion of the questionnaire.  Any such additional information should be provided not later than two weeks before the applicant's scheduled interview, if possible.</p>  <p>  In relation to the availability of the questionnaire, under the 2015 Act applicants are required to apply in person for international protection either at the frontier or within the State. At that time and in line with the requirements of the 2015 Act, applicants in the IPO are fingerprinted, photographed, issued a reference number and a Temporary Residence Certificate. Normally at that time, the IPO provides the International Protection Questionnaire and an accompanying information pack.  In order to maintain the integrity of the Questionnaire and the application process generally, it has never been the practice to make the questionnaire available publicly or online.  Such publication would leave the process open to abuse by non-applicants and those who are not at the frontier or within the State as required by law.  Additional copies of the questionnaire are, however, provided to applicants and their legal representatives, on request, once their application reference numbers have been assigned.</p>  <p>  You will appreciate that the commencement of the International Protection Act 2015 represents the most fundamental reform of the International protection process in the State for nearly two decades.  The single procedure process, which should be compared with the previous multi-layered process involving multiple bodies and procedures, will result in the determination of status for applicants at a much earlier stage than has been the case to date, and consequently, shorter stays in the Direct Provision system. </p>  <p>  While it is recognised that, for a transitional period, applicants will be required to become familiar with the new arrangements, I can assure the Deputy that support will be provided by the International Protection Office and other relevant State authorities to ensure that clarity is available to applicants on the new arrangements and how they will impact on individual cases.</p></reply>

Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65.1 million to the Exchequer in 2016. These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Minister for Health that due to concerns following on from reports of the Ombudsman in 2011 and 2012 regarding the legal status of both the Mobility Allowance and Motorised Transport Grant Scheme in the context of the Equal Status Acts, the Government decided to close both schemes in February 2013.  The Government is aware of the continuing needs of people with a disability who rely on individual payments which support choice and independence.  In that regard, monthly payments of &euro;208.50 have continued to be made by the Health Service Executive to 4,700 people who were in receipt of the Mobility Allowance at the time the scheme closed.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  The Minister for Health has informed me that work on the policy proposals in this regard is at an advanced stage and he anticipates that this will be brought to Government shortly.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the 'Help to Buy' initiative was initially announced on 19 July 2016 as part of 'Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness'. This plan contains a significant volume of responses to the current crisis, of which the Help to Buy initiative is one.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the scheme is not a broad based relief available for the purchase of any home by any buyer. It is instead a targeted response that is aimed at first-time buyers, buying (or building) new residences. This targeting is designed to help encourage the building of new homes, thereby increasing supply, by turning notional demand into real demand. By restricting this initiative solely to new dwellings and new self builds, it is anticipated that the resulting increase in demand for affordable new build homes should encourage the construction industry to provide for an additional supply of such properties.</p>  <p>  If the initiative was also available for second hand properties, it would have little or no effect on the provision of additional supply, and thus the scheme would consist primarily of deadweight in terms of incentive effect. As the Deputy will be aware, an increase in the supply of new housing is fundamental to resolving the current crisis.</p></reply>

This refund is generally payable to the contractor at the deposit stage in the case of a home purchase, or in the case of a self-build, is paid to the applicant when they have drawn down the first tranche of their mortgage.</p><p>I am advised by Revenue that the number of Help to Buy (HTB) applications received up to Friday 17 February 2017 was:<table><tr><th>No. of Applications</th><th>Successful applications</th><th>*Pending</th></tr><tr><td>2,951</td><td>872</td><td>2,079</td></tr></table>*Pending means that the applicants either have to file an outstanding return or address a compliance issue, the application is to be reviewed by a Revenue caseworker, or the applicant needs to finalise his or her application.  The Revenue Commissioners are encouraging prospective applicants to file any necessary returns and resolve any outstanding issues before they make their HTB application. Applicants can, of course, also use Revenue's website to carry out other requests, for example to file a Form 12 or apply for tax clearance. PAYE taxpayers can use myAccount and the bulk of the applications so far have been submitted via myAccount. Business taxpayers can use ROS Revenue's Online Service.</p><p>Information about the loan-to-value ratios is not available when individuals submit their applications, as such figures are not usually finalised at that stage of the process.  However, this information is necessary for successful applicants to finalise their claims.  I am advised that the categorisation of successful claims by the requested loan-to-value ratios as of 17 February 2017 was:<table><tr><th>Loan-to-value (LTV)</th><th>90% </th><th>85% to 90%</th><th>80% to 85%</th><th>Below 80% (and above 70% minimum LTV)</th></tr><tr><td>Total (307)</td><td>84</td><td>119</td><td>57</td><td>47</td></tr></table>The number of applications and claims for the incentive are too small to materially affect the previously estimated cost of the scheme. In this regard, the Deputy may wish to note that at Budget time, it was estimated that the Help to Buy incentive would cost &euro;40 m per annum, but &euro;50 m in 2017 due to the backdating of the relief in respect of properties which became eligible for the scheme since 19 July 2016.</p></reply>

NAMA will focus on completing its ongoing deleveraging, its Dublin Docklands SDZ and residential funding programmes in the interim period to 2020. NAMA's most recent annual statement which provides further insight into the Agency's expectations regarding these activities was laid before the Dail on 2 November 2016 and is also available on NAMA's website.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is through the successful completion of these objectives that NAMA currently projects a surplus in the region of &euro;2.3 bn to be returned to the State once it completes it work.</p>  <p>  As per section 60(2) of the NAMA Act 2009, NAMA may use surplus funds to redeem and cancel its debt.  Surplus funds may only be returned to the Central Fund once NAMA's debt has been redeemed in full.</p>  <p>  Any NAMA surplus paid into the Exchequer will be recorded in line with Eurostat rules and would likely be deemed a once-off capital receipt under non-tax revenue in the Financial Statements of the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  It will be a decision for the Government as to how any surplus returned by NAMA will be utilised.</p>  <p>  It has always been the Government's intention to use such receipts from the resolution of the financial sector crisis to pay down our debt and help reduce our debt servicing costs. Given the uncertainty around the specific timing of or the amount that will be realised, such receipts have not been included our debt forecasts.  Debt reduction underpinned by our lower national debt target of 45 per cent of GDP, will increase the resilience of the public finances to deal with any potential shocks which may emerge.</p></reply>

This is due to the fact that they are classified as a 'financial transaction' or essentially the exchange of one form of asset (shares, equities, loans) for another (cash). Consequently, the sale of any shareholding in any of the banks would not count as general government revenue. Therefore, there is not generally any increased capacity to spend as a result of the sale of shares without affecting the general government balance.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, the re-capitalisation of our banking sector has added to the stock of general government debt and in turn increased our annual debt servicing costs. It has always been the Government's intention to use receipts from the disposal of the State's banking investments to pay down this debt and help reduce the debt servicing costs.

The option was available for a three year period from 27 March 2013, the date that Finance Act 2013 was passed into law, and came to an end on 26 March 2016.</p>  <p>  There are a number of reasons why pre-retirement access to pension savings is not permitted on a general basis, the principal one being that these arrangements (and the associated tax reliefs on contributions and pension fund growth) are designed to be long term savings vehicles based on the principle that the benefits will be "locked away" to help fund an adequate income in retirement.</p>  <p>  The pre-retirement access to a portion of AVCs which I introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2013 was allowed on a tax-neutral basis.  The contributions were tax-relieved at the individual's marginal rate on the way in and were taxed at the individual's marginal rate on withdrawal. This was a measure designed to enable rather than incentivise individuals to access part of their pension savings beyond their regular or compulsory pension contributions.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the most up to date figures for the AVC access scheme are that 18,682 individuals availed of the early access facility over the 3 year period to the amount of just over &euro;202 million gross in drawdowns, on which tax of some &euro;79 million was paid (the exact figure is &euro;79,029,232 million).</p>  <p>  It is important that individuals continue to provide for their retirement and, it would appear, most individuals with AVCs decided to preserve their AVC pension savings.

According to the Savills report referenced by the Deputy, the take-up of office space exceeded 200,000 sq.m for the third successive year in 2016. Given the sustained level of demand and the increase in prime office rents, the construction of commercial office space has significantly picked up following a near cessation in activity over 2011 to 2015. Approximately 388,000 sq.m of office space is currently under construction, equivalent to 9 per cent of the stock of office space in Dublin. According to CBRE, approximately 77,000 sq.m of office space was constructed in 2016 alone. Together with a strong granted planning pipeline, this should help to address the current scarcity of office space, particularly in the Dublin region.</p>  <p>  The proportion of pre-let office space as a share of overall lettings accelerated significantly in the second half of 2016, a trend which is consistent with two characteristics of our office market: (1) the pent-up demand resulting from a lack of development during crisis years; and (2) the increased discipline in financing construction and development reflecting lessons learned through the financial crisis.</p>  <p>  Regarding pent-up demand from a lack of development during crisis years, it is well understood that there was no new development nor demand for such development - during Ireland's financial crisis years, which were marked by low property prices and high vacancy levels.  The success of our economic recovery has brought with it an increased demand for office space.  It is the nature of property markets that construction typically lags demand due to the time needed to plan and develop a building once the demand for that building has been identified.  In the meantime, price and vacancy levels absorb the impact of such increases in demand.  These dynamics are evident in the report which notes the current low vacancy rate in prime office space as reflecting the extent of pent-up demand for space and the construction lag.  As an open economy, it is in our interest to minimise the construction lag for buildings for which there is proven demand so that we can prevent excessive pressures from building up within the market's price and vacancy response.  To this end, the Government has identified a number of initiatives in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan which seek to improve the market's ability to respond to demand more quickly both in the commercial and the residential markets.</p>  <p>  Turning to the increased discipline in our financing markets, I understand that pre-letting agreements are increasingly becoming a characteristic of office development activity.  Securing a pre-let for a development significantly reduces the risk associated with that development, which increases the availability of senior debt finance, significantly reducing the financing costs of the development.  One of the factors that contributed to the collapse of the property market and the wider economic crisis was the inappropriate use of debt financing for speculative development.  We have learned that only development with proven demand should attract significant levels of debt finance.  It is appropriate that these risks of speculative development are not financed by a predominance of senior bank debt, but rather by equity investment, more appropriate for such speculation.  As the market adjusts to equilibrium, the use of pre-lets to demonstrate proven demand is likely to be a permanent feature of our market which will help to unlock continued sources of funding.</p>  <p>  It is this dynamic, driven by the proper risk-based financing of development, that brings discipline to our development market.  Requiring that a high proportion of a building be pre-let helps to curb the risks of speculative development, encourages sustainable lending practices in the commercial real estate market and allows funding providers to manage risk appropriately.</p>  <p>  I am encouraged that these market metrics are being captured, analysed and discussed. I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor these and other developments in the commercial real estate market.</p></reply>

The European framework on remuneration applies to all financial institutions subject to CRD IV, which I as Minister for Finance am responsible for implementing.  The disclosure of the bonuses paid in Ireland to relevant individuals in 2015 is part of this new framework, as there is a requirement for the European Banking Authority to publish aggregated data on high earners earning &euro;1 m or more per financial year.</p>  <p>  Along with increased transparency requirements, CRD IV introduced a number of other changes to the remuneration framework for financial institutions, such as short-term targets being the focus of institutions, as a response to the remuneration policies implemented for staff resulting in significant risk taking.</p>  <p>  The framework includes a number of criteria to prevent a return to the excesses of the past. These include requirements on individuals within a relevant entity whose professional activities have a material impact on their risk profile, known as 'material risk takers'. These material risk takers include senior management, risk takers, staff engaged in control functions and any employee receiving total remuneration that takes them into the same remuneration bracket as senior management and risk takers.</p>  <p>  The remuneration paid to these material risk takers must consist of the following structure (which will also apply to the 26 individuals reference by the deputy):</p>  <p>- a substantial portion, and in any event at least 50%, of any variable remuneration should consist of equity-linked or other non-cash instruments;</p>  <p>- a substantial portion of the variable remuneration component, and in any event at least 40% to 60% (the latter in the case of a variable remuneration component of "a particularly high amount") should be deferred over a period of not less than three to five years;</p>  <p>- the variable component of the total remuneration shall not exceed 100% of the fixed component of the total remuneration of material risk takers;</p>  <p>- shareholders, owners or members of the institution, acting by a qualified majority can approve a higher maximum level of the variable component provided that this level does not exceed 200% of the fixed component of the total remuneration; and</p>  <p>- the relevant competent authority in Ireland, the Central Bank of Ireland are to be informed of recommendations to shareholders and of the result of any shareholder vote, which shall not conflict with institutions' obligations to maintain a sound capital base.</p>  <p>  The Green Paper on Corporate Governance Reform issued by the UK Government in November last year is considering a number of options for updating the UK's corporate governance framework which includes examining executive pay, measures to increase connection between company boards and connected stakeholders and the extension of governance requirements that currently only apply to listed companies to privately held entities. I note that this Green Paper applies to the governance framework of the listed and unlisted companies in the UK.  In the case of Ireland the relevant Department in this area is the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept.  This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide cover to particular categories of individuals such as people employed in the Arts or certain Sportspeople.</p><p>As the question is not clear as to which forms of insurance are being refused, my officials sought to clarify the matter, but were unable to get a response from your Office.  Consequently the assumption has been made that you are referring to motor insurance due to fact that it is a very topical issue and has been the subject of a recent review by my Department.</p><p>Consequently, you should be aware that in  making their individual decisions on whether to offer motor cover and what terms to apply, insurers use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions. Theses factors can include the age of the driver, the type and age of car, the claims record, driving experience and penalty points of the driver, the number of drivers, how the car is used, etc.  My understanding is that insurers do not all use the same combination of rating factors, and as a result prices and availability of cover varies across the market. In addition, insurance companies will price in accordance with their own past claims experience. It should be noted that difficulties in obtaining motor insurance with regard to the above mentioned professions has not been brought to the attention of officials in my Department to date.</p><p>Finally, Insurance Ireland operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to obtaining insurance. In the event that a person is unable to obtain a quotation for motor insurance or feels that the premium proposed or the terms are so excessive that it amounts to a refusal to give them motor insurance, they should contact Insurance Ireland, 5 Harbourmaster Place, IFSC, Dublin 1,  Telephone +353 1 6761820, quoting the Declined Cases Agreement.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions: </p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p><p>- be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p><p>- be without both hands or without both arms; </p><p>- be without one or both legs;</p><p>- be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p><p>- have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p><p>The Scheme and qualifying criteria were designed specifically for those with severe physical disabilities and are, therefore, necessarily precise.  </p><p>The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the fuel grant, the scheme is estimated to have cost of the order of &euro;65m in 2016. This figure does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p><p>The disability criteria for the tax concessions available under the scheme have changed over time. When the scheme was first introduced in 1968, the legislation only allowed for one medical ground. In 1989, four new medical grounds were added and in 1994, one new medical ground was added. </p><p>I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities. I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria. While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

I am also conscious that where a bank comes into possession of a property the institution has a fiduciary responsibility to dispose of the property in a manner that satisfies its independent, commercial mandate.  However I welcome the fact that this is now also happening through interaction with the Housing Agency, local authorities or other means.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government last summer launched Rebuilding Ireland, the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The Action Plan represents a whole of government response to the issues in the housing market with actionable measures across a wide range of areas, designed to stimulate housing supply and remove many of the barriers to a normally functioning market.</p><p>While the Department does not have the information requested by the Deputy, I recently received the following responses to this question from the three banks in which the State has a shareholding: </p><p>AIB</p><p>All disclosures in relation to AIB's residential mortgagesproperties in possession can be found on page 53 of AIB's Half-Yearly Financial Report 2016. It is the bank's policy to sell all assets on a vacant possession basis. AIB has engaged directly with the Housing Agency to provide a list of more than 500 properties for consideration. As at end of December the Housing Agency has expressed an interest in over 200 of these properties with 175 of these sale agreed. AIB continues to work directly with the Housing Agency to ensure all suitable properties are made available for consideration.</p><p>PTSB</p><p>Permanent TSB have informed me that all disclosures in relation to PTSB's residential mortgages and related properties in possession can be found on page 88 of PTSB's Half-Yearly Financial Report 2016.  It is PTSB's policy to sell all assets on a vacant possession basis.  The bank has also informed me that the actual number of vacant properties in Permanent TSB possession at 31 December 2016 was 437 and within the last five months, the bank has completed one repossession sale to a local authority and one mortgage to rent sale to a housing body.  Separately PTSB has been engaging directly with the Housing Agency since 2015.</p><p>Bank of Ireland </p><p>According to Bank of Ireland, all regulatory required disclosures for Bank of Ireland, including those related to property, can be found in their annual report.</p></reply>

This followed a recommendation in the 2009 report by the Commission on Taxation that rent relief should be discontinued. The view of this independent commission was that, in the same manner in which mortgage interest relief increases the cost of housing, rent relief increases the cost of private rented accommodation. Accordingly, the result of reintroducing this relief would be a transfer of Exchequer funding directly to landlords, which would not have the intended effect of reducing the pressure on tenants.</p>  <p>  In addition, a tax credit of this nature would be of little benefit to lower-income workers, the unemployed and students, who may not receive the benefit of the relief as they may not be paying sufficient levels of income tax. The actions that the Government propose to take in order to address concerns about the cost of rental accommodation are set out in the "Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness". Finally, at the time of its abolition, the rental tax relief cost the Exchequer up to &euro;97m per annum, and it is likely that this figure would be an even higher cost were a similar scheme to be introduced. Taking these factors, among others, into consideration, I currently have no plans to introduce a tax credit in the manner in which the Deputy describes.</p></reply>

The purpose of the tapered extension is to avoid a sudden significant increase in mortgage repayments for those losing the relief, but instead to withdraw the relief gradually, allowing the mortgage holder time to adjust to the change in mortgage repayments.</p>  <p>  At present, Section 244 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief in respect of interest paid on qualifying home loans taken out on or after 1 January 2004 and on or before 31 December 2012, with relief being available until 31 December 2017.  Mortgage interest relief has been abolished for homes purchased since 1 January 2013.</p>  <p>The Deputy will also be aware that, on foot of a change I introduced in Budget 2012, first time buyers who bought at the height of the property boom between 2004 and 2008 receive a rate of mortgage interest relief of 30%. This compares favourably to the rates available to other remaining recipients of MIR which reduce on a gradual basis from 25% in years 1 and 2 of the mortgage to 15% in the 8th   and subsequent years.</p>  <p>  Single individuals and married couples / civil partners that are first-time buyers qualify for mortgage interest relief for the first seven years of their mortgage up to a maximum ceiling of &euro;10,000 and &euro;20,000 respectively. Thereafter relief is restricted to ceilings of &euro;3,000 and &euro;6,000 respectively. </p>  <p>  The system of mortgage interest relief is designed and targeted in such a way that the relief is of greater value in the early years of a qualifying loan where the interest represents a greater proportion of the repayment. First-time buyers who purchased between 2004 and 2008 when the property market was at its peak also receive an enhanced rate of relief.  Mortgage interest relief is of lesser value to individuals whose repayments are made up of a higher proportion of principal than interest, as would generally be the case for those who move in to the eighth and subsequent years of their loans. It is worth noting that the application of the ceilings already works to reduce the relief available in a gradual manner.</p></reply>

Those matters include accounts held, property situated, or income or gains arising or accruing in, a country or territory other than the State. Anybody who has tax liabilities relating to matters of that kind and who does not act to address them before 1 May will face the prospect of substantially higher penalties, publication in the Quarterly List of Tax Defaulters and possible prosecution.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that 13 voluntary disclosures relating to offshore matters have been received since 11 October 2016, resulting in settlements amounting to &euro;188,650 in tax, interest and penalties. The intention to make a voluntary disclosure has been indicated to Revenue in two other cases, and a payment of &euro;47,000 has been made on account in one of them.</p>  <p>  Where a disclosure is made which is not a qualifying disclosure, the level of penalty that applies is determined by reference to considerations such as the category of default and the degree of cooperation given by the taxpayer. It is not possible, therefore, to say precisely what levels of penalties would have applied in the case of the 13 voluntary disclosures mentioned above, had they not been voluntary disclosures. It is estimated, however, that, had those cases not been voluntary disclosures, and if the category of default had been deliberate behaviour and cooperation had been forthcoming, the penalties to be imposed would have been some &euro;75,000 higher.</p>  <p>  We are in an era of increased global financial and tax transparency, and Revenue is at the forefront of international developments for Automatic Exchange of Information. Key developments in this field are the OECD's Common Reporting Standard, the EU's Directives on Administrative Cooperation and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) initiative. Revenue has advised me that they are considering carefully how to make the best possible use of all data sources of this kind to identify any cases of tax evasion by Irish residents using offshore accounts, structures or assets, and that any cases discovered will be rigorously pursued.</p></reply>

The 12.5% rate is for trading income unless the income is from an excepted trade in which case the rate is 25%.  Excepted trades include certain land dealing activities, income from working minerals and petroleum activities.  Ireland also has a 25% corporation tax rate for non-trading income (e.g. investment income, rental income).  Additionally, our regime has a 33% rate which is applicable to chargeable gains.</p>  <p>  The Knowledge Development Box also provides an effective 6.25% rate of corporation tax on profits from certain qualifying assets that are earned by a company, chargeable to corporation tax in the State, to the extent that the assets relate to R&amp;D undertaken by that company.  </p>  <p>  I assume that the question refers to the taxation of Irish collective investment funds.  The normal tax treatment afforded to Irish collective investment funds is that the funds invested are allowed to grow on a tax-free basis within the fund.  The income is taxed at the level of the investor rather than the fund, as is standard international practice. </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that the appropriate tax is collected from Irish investors, funds are obliged to operate an exit tax regime and remit the tax deducted in this manner to Revenue.  This charge to tax does not apply in the case of unit holders who are non-resident.  In the case of non-resident investors, their liability to tax on gains from the fund will be determined in their home jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  The broad rationale for exempting such funds from direct taxation is to facilitate individuals to invest collectively, without suffering double taxation (that is, taxation both within the fund and in the hands of the investor on distribution).  Most OECD countries now have a tax system that provides for neutrality between direct investments and investments through a Collective Investment Vehicle/Fund. </p>  <p>  It is worth noting that due to the changes that I made in Finance Act 2016 this does not apply to collective investment vehicles where 25% or more of the fund derives its value from Irish real estate assets.  In such a case the vehicle is deemed to be an Irish Real Estate Fund. Certain payments from an Irish Real Estate Fund to non-resident investors are subject to withholding tax.</p></reply>

Our priorities are clear: minimising the impact on trade and the economy, protecting the Northern Ireland Peace Process, maintaining the Common Travel Area, and influencing the future of the European Union.</p>  <p>  A critical part of our work is  ensuring that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe.  Therefore, engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is critical.  A programme of intense engagement at political and official level is continuing to ensure that the EU's position for the forthcoming negotiations reflects our priorities. </p>  <p>  Our preparations for Brexit include detailed engagement with the European Commission, which we have made aware that Brexit is already having an impact on the Irish economy, and of the disproportionate consequences posed by Brexit for the Irish economy overall in comparison to other Member States.  In the context of Brexit, it is more important than ever that the EU continues to support economic growth and employment, and those Irish businesses most affected by Brexit.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, as announced at the opening of the new European Investment Bank (EIB) office in Dublin on 12 December 2016, the European Investment Fund (EIF) have provided a &euro;100 million COSME counter-guarantee facility to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), Ireland's National Promotional Institution for SMEs.  This facility will be used to support the &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Support Loan Fund, announced on Budget Day, which was developed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DFAM) in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p>  <p>  The SBCI has also submitted an application for the EU budget supported InnovFin (Finance for Innovators) Guarantee Programme and is currently engaging with potential partner banks on creating a pilot program for a guaranteed loan product.</p>  <p>  Separately, the EIB and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) have  recently announced an agreement to support a &euro;112 million investment in privately owned forests across Ireland.  This new engagement with Dasos, a specialist forestry investment fund, is the first forestry project in the EU to be supported by the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI).  The ISIF will provide &euro;55 million and the EIB, through EFSI, will provide &euro;28.5 million for the scheme.  Additional support is expected from other investors as the initiative progresses.  The scheme will seek to address issues faced by small scale forests across the country by working to improve forest management and strengthen the supply of wood for commercial use.  The investment will support crucial upgrades to Ireland's forestry infrastructure, through the consolidation of its management.  The EFSI is an important additional funding option alongside the EIB's normal lending.</p>  <p>  More generally, the EIB is also providing &euro;400 million of long-term funding at attractive rates to the SBCI so that it can improve access to finance for the SME sector, thus supporting SME growth and investment through the provision of flexible, lower cost and longer term loans.</p></reply>

In that regard it is understood that at least one school is undersubscribed and has expressed a willingness to enrol further junior infants in September 2017, if necessary.  As the Deputy will appreciate, it is important that school size is monitored and that a balance is preserved among all schools in school planning areas to ensure that one school is not expanding at the expense or the viability of another school. </p>  <p>  My Department is monitoring the position closely.  While the situation may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice, the Deputy will appreciate that my Department's main responsibility is to ensure that the existing schools can between them cater for the demand for Junior Infant places in September 2017. </p></reply>

The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.  Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings.  The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. </p>  <p>  In 2016 the issue of this limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council.  Having considered the matter and taking into account all circumstances both the union and management partners considered that their preferred option is to retain the existing scheme as set out in the published circular.</p>  <p>  However, in response to a request for consideration of a voluntary transfer scheme for Primary Teachers, I have decided to extend the maximum period for which an exchange may occur for those teachers in their fifth and sixth year of exchange for one further year.</p></reply>

This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools.  Further information on the development of the identification process is available in the DEIS Review report which can be found on my Department's website at <i>.</i></p><p>In its initial application, the new identification model has identified that there are schools in disadvantaged areas, not previously included in DEIS, whose level of disadvantage is significantly higher than many schools already in the programme.  Accordingly, we are moving as a first step to include these schools within the DEIS School Support Programme.</p><p>Schools included in the list published by the Department on 13th February are those whose level of concentrated disadvantage has been identified as being at the same level as the current DEIS category for schools serving the highest concentrations of disadvantage. </p><p>Schools which have not been included at this stage, including the schools referred to by the Deputy, are those which have not been identified as having the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage amongst their pupil cohort, under the new model which is fair and objective.</p><p>The new DEIS Plan provides for a verification process and any school wishing to seek verification of the information used to assess the level of disadvantage of its pupil cohort may submit an application for same to social_inclusion@education.gov.ie.</p><p>It is important to note that the school details published on 13th February represent a first step in the application of the assessment process to support pupils in schools with the highest concentrations of disadvantage.  I am fully aware that there are further schools whose concentrated level of disadvantage may not be at the highest level, but may nevertheless be at a level which warrants additional supports for pupils under DEIS. </p><p>However, as noted in the DEIS Plan, the implementation of a new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.</p><p>Once this work has been completed, consideration will be given to extending DEIS supports to a further group of schools as resources permit.</p><p>In delivering on the DEIS Plan 2017 we must be conscious that there are ongoing changes in demographics which may be more marked in some areas than others.  Populations in some areas have changed considerably since schools were originally evaluated for inclusion in DEIS in 2006.  The new model may reveal that some schools currently included in DEIS have a level of disadvantage within their school population much lower than that in some schools not included within DEIS.  If this turns out to be the case, then we must consider whether it is fair that those schools continue receiving these additional resources, using resources that may be more fairly allocated to the schools with greater levels of disadvantage.</p><p>It is important to note that the fact that a school has not been included in the DEIS programme on this occasion does not preclude its inclusion at a later date, should its level of disadvantage warrant the allocation of additional resources.</p></reply>

The deployment of teaching staff in the school, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the school management authorities.</p>  <p>  At post primary level and in accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e., curricular concessions.  Short term support is needed (normally for one year but not exceeding 2/3 school years) to enable the school authority to respond to the identified difficulty in meeting essential curricular commitments to pupils within the normal staffing allocation.</p>  <p>  The detail of the curricular concession process will be set out with the criteria for the allocation of posts and will also be available on the website.</p>  <p>  The allocation process also includes an appeals mechanism under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  The appeal procedures are also set out in the published staffing arrangements.  The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final. </p>  <p>  The challenge for all schools is to ensure that they utilise their allocated resources to best effect to maximise teaching and learning outcomes.</p></reply>

New students with care needs may, or may not, enrol to replace students who have left, for example, or S allocations may be decreased where a child's care needs have diminished over time.</p>  <p>  The deployment of Ss within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management. Department Circular 0030/2014 provides substantial guidance on the deployment and utilisation of Ss within schools. Ss should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom S support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the S support is utilised. </p>  <p>  Where a school wishes to appeal the S allocation which has been made to them, they may do so through the NCSE appeal process, details of which are set out at www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  The option to invoke the NCSE appeals process is open to the school/parent in question, but to date no appeal has been received by the NCSE.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  As the question to which the Deputy refers relates to an individual child, the matter has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  I also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to provision for 7452 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.5billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  It will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools will be provided with total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as school will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  This includes provision for junior infants who are newly enrolling to the school or pupils who may transfer from another school. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile.  Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  The model will, however, allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service, established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  A new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.</p></reply>

Large amounts of research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model.  In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year.  No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  I also announced that an additional 900 teaching posts will be provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model.  The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011, when 5265 teachers were allocated, as opposed to provision for 7452 posts in the current school year.</p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1000 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.  Supports for children with special educational needs is a huge priority for this Government.  We currently spend &euro;1.5billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  It will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each schools profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as school will now a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that allocations made to school will be sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review. </p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profiles remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. </p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs. In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those school.  Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources.     </p>  <p>  The model will, however, allow for some additional provision for very exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service, being established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  A new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department implemented a pilot of the proposed new Resource Teacher allocation model over the course of the 2015/2016 school year.</p>  <p>  A review of this pilot has been completed and has been published on my Departments website www.education.ie.</p>  <p>  The review has indicated that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents. </p>  <p>  Schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need.  Most schools believe the model allows more scope for team teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one to one teaching.

We currently spend &euro;1.5billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  It will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils in their school who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need and pupils in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours.  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, as school will now a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the NCSE advised schools that there was no longer a requirement for schools to make applications for special education teaching supports for individula pupils with special education teaching needs, as resources would be provided for schools by the profiled allocation.</p>  <p>  For the introduction of the new allocation model, from September 2017, the NCSE &lsquo;Low Incidence&rsquo; allocations which had been made for each school during the preceding year 2016/17 school year, have been used to establish the complex needs component of the new allocation model for each school.</p>  <p>  A model for the identification of pupils with complex needs in future is being devised by the NCSE, in consultation with the Health Service Executive and National Educational Psychological Services (NEPS).  This model will take account of the qualification criteria for the selection of children for access to HSE Children Disability Network Teams. </p>  <p>  For the next re profiling of the model, the pupils with newly identified Complex Needs will be included in this revised allocation, less any school leavers included in this category.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model.  By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria it is expected that allocations made to school will be sufficient to meet both current and future needs as they arise until the next review. </p>  <p>  Currently most schools' educational profiles remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. </p>  <p>  The model will provide, from this year, additional resources to schools where it is expected that there will be additional needs.  In protecting resources in schools where the profiles indicate that the levels of need are lower than are currently provided for some additional capacity is also provided for in those schools.  Accordingly, all schools should have the capacity to meet the needs of additional children enrolling in the school in the following school year without the need for additional or new resources.     </p>  <p>  The model will, however, allow for some additional provision for very exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.  The Inclusion Support Service, being established under the National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  A new Circular will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools</p></reply>

Students with complex special educational needs. </p>  <p>  2. Percentages of students performing below a certain threshold on standardised test results</p>  <p>  3. Social context of school which includes gender, primary school location and educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The NCSE working group report considered that standardised test data provides a broad and objective basis to establish differences between schools in levels of relative overall student educational achievement. </p>  <p>  The report recommended that standardised test results should be used in building the educational profile of schools, as they link directly to the educational achievement of students in schools.  </p>  <p>  The use of standardised test scores will ensure that the school&rsquo;s educational profile includes students with low achievement in literacy and numeracy including those students whose special educational needs affect their learning achievement levels.</p>  <p>  The previous generalised allocation model, which was based primarily on school size, did not take account of the learning needs of pupils, or of the profile of pupils in the school.</p>  <p>  It was for this reason that the NCSE recommended that a profiled allocation be made for schools, which included consideration of standardised test scores.</p>  <p>  In calculating this element of schools&rsquo; educational profile an aggregate of primary school standardised test results over 2013/14 and 2014/15 has been used for the first phase of the introduction of the new allocation model. </p>  <p>  For future re-profiling of the model, updated data will be used to create an aggregate of the school&rsquo;s learning support needs, which will ensure that an accurate picture of a school's profile over a period of time is developed.  </p>  <p>  In order to ensure that schools are not penalised for improving performance generally, no resources provided to schools under the current model will be removed from the school on the introduction of the new model. </p>  <p>  The use of standardised test data means that the school profile considers not just the number of pupils in the school, but also the learning needs of those pupils in that school who are performing at a level represented in the bottom 16% of the population, as evidenced by national attainment data.</p>  <p>  In this context, schools with strong performance on standardised tests should have no concerns on the impact of this on their profiles.  In calculating values for this component, no consideration is given to scores above Standard Ten scores 1 to 4.  Effectively, values are only accorded to the 16% of students who would ordinarily fall within, or on the margins of, the learning support needs category.  </p>  <p>  It should also be noted that the consideration of standardised test data forms only one part of the special educational needs profiled allocation for schools and there will not therefore be an over reliance on standardised test scores.</p>  <p>  A new Circular and Guidance will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools</p></reply>

They found that the percentage of students reported by teachers to have special educational needs was signifi­cantly greater for those in schools serving disadvantaged areas. </p>  <p>  On the basis of available research, the Working Group concluded that the use of a school&rsquo;s social context is valid in the development of a school&rsquo;s educational profile, as the socioeconomic status of students is linked to the incidence of certain types of special educational needs. </p>  <p>  While some areas of special educational needs may be reflected in low test scores, some students with relatively high levels of educational achievement may have emotional and behavioural difficulties. </p>  <p>  The profiled allocation for schools therefore contains provision to take account of social context, however, this only forms one portion of the overall allocation.</p>  <p>  A new Circular and Guidance will be issued to schools in the coming weeks which will provide details of how the scheme will operate, while details of the allocations for each school will also be provided to schools.</p></reply>

We currently spend &euro;1.5billion, or one fifth of the total education budget, on supports for children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a statutory role under Section 20 of the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 to advise me, as Minister for Education and Skills, in relation to matters relating to the education of children and others with disabilities.</p>  <p>  In 2014 the NCSE published a Working Group Report &ldquo;Delivery for Students with Special Educational Needs &ndash; a better and more equitable way&rdquo; which recommended a new model for allocating resource teaching support to schools, based on the profiled needs of each school, rather than being primarily based on the diagnosed disability of individual children.  A copy of this report is available on the website www.ncse.ie. </p>  <p>  This report found that some children are being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes, rather than such a diagnosis being required for health or medical reasons.</p>  <p>  The report drew on evidence from national and international research which concluded that assessment undertaken purely for diagnosis to satisfy criteria for the allocation of resources may result in the unnecessary or premature labelling of chil­dren with a disability, and may not always be in a child&rsquo;s best interest. </p>  <p>  It noted that there are a number of shortcomings to the diagnostic model of categorisation.  These include: lower expectation, stigma, issues around reliability and validity of diagnostic categories, over identification of students from certain minority and socio-economic groups, tendency to be input focused with little attention given to outcomes.  The literature suggests that the diagnostic model itself has many shortcomings as a way of identifying students for additional resources.</p>  <p>  The NCSE recommended the development of a new model for the allocation of additional resource teaching supports for schools, based on the profiled needs of schools, as opposed to being based primarily on assessments of special educational needs for individual children attending the school.</p>  <p>  On 18th January last, I announced that a new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools will be introduced from September 2017. </p>  <p>  The new allocation model is intended to ensure that schools can be resourced to provide support to all students who need additional help &ndash; whether the student has a professional assessment or is on a waiting list for a professional assessment.</p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school's profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay.  This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. </p>  <p>  Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.  A child may receive additional teaching support under the new allocation model if the school, using its school based assessment and the NEPS Continuum of Support, identifies that the child has learning needs</p></reply>

The Examination comprises an Assessment Task, undertaken in schools, which is worth 10% of the available marks and a Final Examination, in June 2017, representing 90% of the marks. Both elements are marked externally by the SEC.   </p>  <p>  Post-primary schools were advised in December 2016 of a second window for the completion by third year students of Junior Cycle English of the second Classroom Based Assessment (CBA) and Assessment Task. The new window for the Assessment Task, which forms part of the Final Examination and which is marked by the SEC, will be in the week beginning 24 April.    </p>  <p>  The SEC has stated that it will provide guidance for the completion of the Assessment Task to schools. The Department understands that the guidance to be provided by the SEC to schools will make clear that completion of the Assessment Task in English involves candidates engaging with stimulus material and questions (provided by the NCCA, having been developed in conjunction with the SEC), and then completing a booklet provided by the SEC within the set timeframe. The NCCA and SEC materials are focused on candidates referring to their collection of texts, which they have undertaken over the period of their study of the Junior Cycle English subject specification. The ASTI directive to its members makes it clear that it does not prohibit teachers from facilitating students in creating a Collection of Texts as part of mainstream classroom activity.</p>  <p>  The SEC has also stated that the arrangements are in line with those applying in schools for the conduct of externally assessed coursework in a range of subjects across both Junior and Senior Cycle. These longstanding arrangements provide for school supervision and authentication of the completion of work for external assessment by the SEC.</p>  <p>  I welcome the reassurance provided by the State Examinations Commission on this issue, and I am satisfied that all students will have the opportunity to complete the Assessment Task and Final Examination.</p></reply>

The whole staff shares responsibility for general student well-being.</p>  <p>The Well-being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and Well-being in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015)   provide a Framework for schools to present in an integrated way the existing elements of good practice to promote social and emotional learning, and mental health and direct then to appropriate practice.   They provide clear information for schools and for agencies supporting schools on how to address issues of social emotional learning and mental health promotion. The European wide HSE supported, Health Promoting School Process (HSP) is also outlined, and the Well-being Guidelines show how the HSP can be introduced to schools to complement existing good practice. The Guidelines outline how schools support young people through early intervention and prevention, modelled on the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) Continuum of Support tiered approach.  </p>  <p>  The processes outlined span the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers. It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. Schools also engage in a wide range of sport and cultural co-curricular activities which provide an important opportunity for students to experience success and personal growth. </p>  <p>   Key Messages in the Guidelines: </p>  <p>  - Schools play a vital role in providing a protective environment for young people which can counter risk factors.  </p>  <p>  - Having a whole school approach which fosters important links with the wider school community, and agencies which support schools, is key to successful implementation of the Guidelines </p>  <p>  Action Plan for Education 2016 2019 </p>  <p>   I have published an Action Plan for Education (2016-2019) in which Wellbeing is one of the key goals. The actions relating to well-being and mental health include: </p>  <p>- Delivery of a national programme to support all schools to implement the national Wellbeing in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention (2013) and Wellbeing in Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion (2015).    This will involve collaboration of the HSE and DES support services. </p>  <p>- Introduction of Wellbeing as a subject at Junior Cycle:   Guidelines on Wellbeing in Junior Cycle have been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to support the Framework for Junior Cycle 2015.   The guidelines will be introduced to post-primary schools in September this year.   The Junior Cycle team are currently planning the support that will be in place for the implementation of the well-being Curriculum.  </p>  <p>- Increasing the capacity of NEPS: It is planned to enhance educational psychological service to schools, through the appointment of an additional 10 educational psychologists this year and an additional 65 in total by 2019.    The focus of this year's additional support will be on extending the delivery of training to teachers in two specific evidence-informed programmes &ndash; the Incredible Years Teacher Programme and the Friends programmes. The Friends programmes when delivered by trained teachers, reduces anxiety and promotes coping, resilience and school-connectedness in children and young people, while the Incredible Years Teacher Programme strengthens the social and emotional competence of primary school children whose teacher has completed the programme. </p>  <p>- Enhancing Guidance Counselling provision at post-primary level:   Recent budgets saw improvements in guidance allocation to schools, with Budgets 2016 and 2017 together seeing the allocation of the equivalent of 400 ex-quota guidance posts, following budget measures in 2012 which removed the ex-quota provision for guidance posts (which amounted to some 600 posts).  The 400 guidance posts which have now been restored will be allocated separately and transparently and once again</p>  <p>- Responding to Critical Incidents Guidelines and Resource Materials  : These guidelines have been revised and re-issued to schools. Support in implementation and development of a Critical Incident Management team will be offered to schools in the 2017/2018 academic year.</p>  <p>   Interdepartmental collaboration</p>  <p>At Central Government level the Pathfinder Project: Youth Mental Health   has been initiated. This is led by the Department of Health. Finding new ways of tackling policy issues that are not the sole responsibility of any one Government Department or Agency has been prioritised by Government. Youth mental health and suicide prevention is one of three Pathfinder projects under Action 5 of the Civil Service Renewal Plan (2014) and agreed by the Civil Service Management Board.  This Pathfinder Youth Mental Health Project is an initiative to innovate and improve whole-of-Government working on cross-cutting policy issues and improve the delivery of shared whole-of-Government projects to strengthen the prioritisation, management and accountability of cross-cutting projects that involve multiple Departments, Offices and Agencies. The project aims to ensure that policies that are not the priority or responsibility of a single body are effectively managed, supported and resourced. </p>  <p>  This project focuses  on the work of three Departments &ndash; DOH, DES, and DCYA &ndash; and the HSE.  The DES has nominated a representative to work for one day each week with the DOH on this Youth Mental Health Pathfinder project.  The Pathfinder will work and report within the parameters of Connecting for Life Irelands Strategy to Reduce Suicide (2015/2020). </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that by end 2016 Pathfinder will have:</p>  <p>- developed an implementation plan to coordinate and give effect to identified actions relevant to youth mental health in Connecting for Life   and any other actions necessary to support and advance youth mental health and well-being;</p>  <p>  - determined new approaches to the implementation of these actions in conjunction with relevant delivery partners, which may involve small scale testing or piloting;</p>  <p>  - initiated implementation of priority youth mental health actions and</p>  <p>  - reported progress on a quarterly basis to the Civil Service Management Board and participated in sharing learning with other pathfinder and/or cross-government projects.</p>  <p>In addition Minister McEntee has initiated a Taskforce on Youth Mental Health   as part of the programme for Government and my Department is represented on this Taskforce.  One of the challenges of providing a coordinated, streamlined approach to promoting well-being and mental health is of course the fact that there are so many statutory and voluntary agencies/services/NGOs involved.  The Taskforce will consider how best to introduce and teach resilience, coping mechanisms, greater awareness to children and young people, and how to access support services voluntarily at a young age.  It is intended that an action plan for addressing youth mental health will be the outcome of the Taskforce.  It is likely that in this context recommendations will be made with regard to community mental health services and agencies tasked with delivering services. My Department is actively involved in this work.  </p></reply>

If this is not the case, there is the risk that capital monies made available for the purpose of accommodating children at primary and post-primary level cannot be spent and that the State cannot provide for school buildings at maximum capacity. Given that any number of issues can arise at any stage up to construction stage in the process of building schools, it is essential that other projects can be progressed if individual projects are delayed for whatever reason. This can also however have the contrary result that there may be more school projects available to proceed to construction than the available budgetary position will allow. </p>  <p>  In line with this process, the project for the school to which the Deputy refers was authorised to proceed to tender in October 2016 and is currently completing the tender stage and is expected to commence construction shortly.</p></reply>

The Examination comprises an Assessment Task, undertaken in schools, which is worth 10% of the available marks and a Final Examination, in June 2017, representing 90% of the marks. Both elements are marked externally by the SEC.</p>  <p>  Post-primary schools were advised in December 2016 of a second window for the completion by third year students of Junior Cycle English of the second Classroom Based Assessment (CBA) and Assessment Task. The new window for the Assessment Task, which forms part of the Final Examination and which is marked by the SEC, will be in the week beginning 24 April.  </p>  <p>  The SEC has stated that it will provide guidance for the completion of the Assessment Task to schools. The Department understands that the guidance to be provided by the SEC to schools will make clear that completion of the Assessment Task in English involves candidates engaging with stimulus material and questions (provided by the NCCA, having been developed in conjunction with the SEC), and then completing a booklet provided by the SEC within the set timeframe. The NCCA and SEC materials are focused on candidates referring to their collection of texts, which they have undertaken over the period of their study of the Junior Cycle English subject specification. The ASTI directive to its members makes it clear that it does not prohibit teachers from facilitating students in creating a Collection of Texts as part of mainstream classroom activity.  </p>  <p>  The SEC has also stated that the arrangements are in line with those applying in schools for the conduct of externally assessed coursework in a range of subjects across both Junior and Senior Cycle. These longstanding arrangements provide for school supervision and authentication of the completion of work for external assessment by the SEC.   </p>  <p>  I welcome the reassurance provided by the State Examinations Commission on this issue, and I am satisfied that all students will have the opportunity to complete the Assessment Task and Final Examination.</p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be </p><p>necessary.

Horizon 2020 is open to applications from individual researchers, higher education institutes, research performing organisations, private industry including SMEs etc. and these bodies apply directly for the research grants.  In the period from commencement of Horizon 2020 in January 2014 to September 2016, Ireland's drawdown is &euro;336 million.</p>  <p>  My Department will also be liable for expenditure under the Shared Education objective of the Peace IV programme (2014-2020).  The outcome of the UK Referendum on EU membership has implications for the programme which is 85% funded by the EU. But the Irish Government has been clear about its commitment to the successful implementation of the programme and its ambition to see successor programmes post-2020.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government's contingency planning for Brexit, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform identified the implications for the Peace and Interreg programmes as an issue that would have to be addressed in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Executive and the European Commission, and that process commenced immediately following the referendum result. </p>  <p>  In October 2016 agreement was reached between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and Northern Ireland counterparts on the terms of Letters of Offer to programme beneficiaries.  The objective was to Brexit-proof Letters of Offer to the greatest extent possible and to give programme beneficiaries assurance as to the legal and financial commitments they are entering into so they can plan for the future with confidence.  On this basis it will be possible to proceed with the full implementation of the Peace IV programme on a firmer basis than would otherwise have been the case.  My objective now is to see the current programme implemented fully and the Government&rsquo;s intention is to secure agreement from the EU and the UK for successor programmes post-2020.</p>  <p>  Erasmus+ is the EU Programme for Education, Training, Youth and Sport for 2014-2020.  It aims to make a contribution to meeting the key challenges facing Europe to boost growth and jobs and to foster social equity and inclusion. Erasmus+ will provide opportunities for over 4 million Europeans to study, train, gain work experience and volunteer abroad.  The Programme aims to boost skills and employability, while supporting the modernisation of education, training and youth systems.  Funding is provided for mobilities, organisational partnerships and policy work. The allocation for Ireland is &euro;169m over the seven year duration.

The Council immediately began work on a call for proposals for the development of new enterprise-led apprenticeships.  The call issued in January 2015 and over 80 proposals were received from industry stakeholders working with education and training providers.  </p>  <p>  The Apprenticeship Council has been working with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them in sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  Recently we have seen the first of these new programmes coming on stream with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship commencing in September 2016 and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship getting underway in November 2016.  13 further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.</p>  <p>  Last month, I launched the Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitment on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year.  Over the lifetime of the Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes which represents a doubling of current activity. </p>  <p>  In addition, a campaign to promote apprenticeship is currently being developed by SOLAS in consultation with key partners, including the Apprenticeship Council.  The campaign will raise awareness and promote the value of apprenticeship for individual apprentices and for employers and it will cover both existing apprenticeships and the new apprenticeships now coming on stream.</p></reply>

The Residential Tenancies Acts do not apply to these types of contracts and therefore the Rent Predictability Measure does not apply to these arrangements.  However, the limiting effect the Measure will have on market rent inflation will impact positively on costs from a local authority perspective in the context of the periodic rent reviews that form part of the SHCEP contractual arrangements.  Where a dwelling the subject of a SHCEP lease or availability agreement is subsequently let by a housing authority or an approved housing body to a social housing tenant, the tenant is charged a differential rent. </p>  <p>  Sections 19 to 22 of the 2004 Act, which include provision for the Rent Predictability Measures, do not apply to AHB tenancies.  Three new sections, sections 19A, 20A and 22A, were inserted into the 2004 Act by the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 to provide for the setting of rents and rent reviews in AHB tenancies.  Section 19A provides for the setting of rent in AHB tenancies; section 20A provides for reviews of rent in AHB tenancies; and section 22A provides for the notification of a change in the amount of rent following a review under section 20A.  In general, Approved Housing Bodies use the differential rent scheme applied by local authorities to determine the rents of their dwellings. </p></reply>

The grant scheme ensures that the limited financial resources available are targeted towards householders, particularly those on lower incomes, who incur expenditure directly as a result of the implementation of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.  The Regulations provide that, subject to the applicant meeting all qualification criteria, a local authority may pay a grant to a person who is required, following an inspection, to have repairs or upgrades to, or replacement of, a septic tank or other domestic waste water treatment system.

I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated.  The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence.  All areas that meet the criteria have now been designated but the Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation.  Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Under the Planning and Development Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned.  Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.   </p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department.

Currently, the MTR scheme relies on AHBs to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers. </p>  <p>  It is a clear priority of the Government to maximise delivery of social housing to cater for the greatest level of need, while also achieving value for money.  The provision of social housing is carried out by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) through a range of delivery methods, including construction, acquisition, leasing and other approaches, which allow local authorities, as housing authorities, to respond flexibly to meet local demand and operate within local property circumstances. Significant Exchequer support has been provided by Government to support this endeavour.  While there are obvious social and economic benefits to be derived from the MTR scheme, most significantly by facilitating individual households in mortgage arrears to remain in their home, detailed consideration needs to be given to the impact on the capacity of local authorities and AHBS to meet the ambitious targets around new social housing supply in respect of any proposal to intensify their investment and involvement in the MTR scheme. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the Government has been actively exploring potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment in the housing market, in particular social housing, in a manner that does not impact on the General Government Balance.  A number of  private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property.  They are seeking an alternative arrangement that would see the mortgaged property staying in the funding firm&rsquo;s ownership and the property itself leased back to the local authority in circumstances where the borrower is eligible for MTR and the borrower would therefore remain in their own home. </p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements.  The objective is to explore what is available within the current market and to determine if this alternative model will benefit a greater number of households.      </p>  <p>  A detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme will be undertaken in advance of the budgetary process for 2018.  The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall, including in the context of the significant investment currently being made by Government through local authorities and AHBs in terms of developing new social housing supply.</p></reply>

A notice of new rent must be in writing and include information in relation to the dispute resolution procedures that a tenant can pursue through the RTB if they do not believe the new rent is valid, e.g. if the rent is above market rent or above the permitted increase in a rent pressure zone.  The notice of new rent must also be accompanied by information in relation to the rents of 3 other similar dwellings in the area.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that tenants are adequately informed in relation to prevailing rents and are aware of their rights under the Act. </p>  <p>  In a Rent Pressure Zone, the landlord must also include information and calculations in the notice of new rent that demonstrate that any rent increase is not more than the maximum amount allowed since the rent was last set.  In addition, the new legislation provides for a statutory obligation on a landlord at the beginning of a tenancy to provide a tenant with details of the previous rent under a tenancy, and a statement as to how the rent has been calculated under section 19(4), so that a tenant can ensure that their rent complies with the legislation.  Where a tenant believes that the rent is set above the market rent or above the permitted increase in a rent pressure zone, they may refer a dispute to the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  The RTB may make a declaration as to whether the rent set complies with the legislation and if it does not comply, may make a declaration as to what amount would comply.  The rent cannot be increased pending the determination of the dispute.   </p>  <p>  Both landlords and tenants are notified by the RTB when a tenancy has been registered.  This notification advises both parties of their rights and obligations in relation to the setting and review of rent, security of tenure, the termination of tenancies, and of the dispute resolution procedures that are available through the RTB.  Ongoing education and awareness is an increasing focus of the RTB, educating tenants and landlords in relation to their rights and obligations, encouraging compliance through measures which support best-practice.</p></reply>

Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness aims to increase and accelerate housing delivery across all tenures to help individuals and families meet their housing needs.  It sets out over 80 actions that the Government is taking through new policy, new legislation and innovative Budgetary measures to achieve that aim. </p>  <p>  Pillar 4 of the Action Plan committed to development of a comprehensive strategy for the rental sector and this was delivered, with the publication of the Strategy for the Rental Sector   on 13 December 2016, which identifies high and rapidly rising rents as the key driver of accommodation insecurity for tenants and a factor in the termination of tenancies.  To address this situation, the Strategy introduced a Rent Predictability Measure to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where the imbalance between demand and supply of rental accommodation is driving rent levels upwards most acutely. </p>  <p>  The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 gave effect to, and provided for the immediate implementation of, the Rent Predictability Measure.  Areas of the country satisfying the statutory criteria will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones and rent increases in those areas are generally capped at 4% per annum for a period of 3 years.  The measure was introduced with immediate effect in the four Dublin Local Authority areas and in Cork City.  A further 12 Local Electoral Areas were designated as Rent Pressure Zones on 27 January 2017. </p>  <p>  The provisions limiting rent increases in rent pressure zones apply both at the commencement of a tenancy and at each rent review.  In addition, at the beginning of a tenancy, there is a statutory obligation on a landlord in a rent pressure zone to provide a tenant with details of the rent under the previous tenancy of the dwelling, together with a statement as to how the new rent has been calculated.  The purpose of this provision is to allow a tenant to ensure that their rent complies with the legislation.

My Department conducted a review of the existing Regulations in 2016 to bring them into line with modern requirements, with a focus on tenant safety including new measures covering heating appliances, carbon monoxide and window safety.  On 27 January, I signed the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2017 giving effect to the commitment in the Strategy.  The new regulations will come into operation generally on 1 July 2017 and will replace the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008 and the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009.</p><p>The <i>Strategy for the Rental Sector</i>also prioritises strengthening the inspection capacity of Local Authorities to increase the number and frequency of inspections of rental properties.  In addition to the updated regulations, procedures for a more efficient, standardised and transparent inspection and enforcement approach across all Local Authority areas will be introduced.  Specific ring-fenced funding for inspection and compliance activity will be identified from 2018 onwards and annual targets for both inspection and compliance will be agreed with local authorities.  The objective set out in the Strategy is to increase inspection numbers incrementally each year so that, by 2021, 25% of all rental properties are inspected annually.</p></reply>

Over one-quarter (27%) of these loans were in arrears of more than 90 days.  My Department publishes a wide range of housing statistics, including the number and value of local authority mortgages and a breakdown of those in arrears by local authority.  The statistics concerned are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: .</p><p>Local authorities generally have been lending to house purchasers at the lower end of the income spectrum. This cohort of borrowers would, in the main, be more vulnerable to unemployment, restricted working hours and downward pressure on wage rates in lower skilled jobs. </p><p>The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears requires all mortgage lenders to ensure that it has in place a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) for handling such cases.  My Department introduced guidelines for local authorities in 2012 and issued revised guidelines in June 2014.  The guidance, Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities (June 2014), is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Extending the term of the mortgage to a maximum of 35 years and a maximum borrower age of 70, depending on the type of loan, the remaining term and the circumstances of the individual borrower, as well as adding arrears and interest to the principal amount due at the interest rate applicable to the parent mortgage, are some of the long term resolutions to borrowers in mortgage arrears distress. In the case of acute mortgage arrears distress, all homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency.  In addition, a Mortgage to Rent scheme, specifically for local authority mortgage borrowers, is also available as part of the MARP arrangements.  The Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) scheme and the wider operation of MARP within local authorities are kept under regular review by my Department. </p><p>The most important step any family in arrears can take is to engage early with the Arrears Support Unit of the local authority.  Supports are available and advice should be sought as early as possible.  In addition, the Government has established a new Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, known as the Abhaile Service, and operated by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) in conjunction with the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI), the Legal Aid Board and the Citizens Information Board.  The objective of the Abhaile Service is to ensure that a person who is at risk of losing their home due to their mortgage arrears can access independent expert financial and legal advice, which will help them to identify their best options for returning to solvency - with priority to their remaining in their home, where that is a sustainable option.  The website www.keepingyourhome.ie contains comprehensive details of the supports available under the Abhaile Service.</p></reply>

Currently, the MTR scheme relies on AHBs to purchase from lenders properties that have been voluntarily surrendered by eligible borrowers.</p>  <p>  The Government has been actively exploring potential mechanisms that would facilitate investment in social housing, including the off-balance sheet potential of private institutional investment. A number of private equity firms have expressed an interest in purchasing mortgage debt portfolios from commercial banks with a view to exploring the potential for them to access the MTR scheme model for the borrowers in occupation of the mortgaged property. </p>  <p>  One of the outcomes of the Review is that in order to test the operability of alternative funding models for the scheme, the Housing Agency will work with a number of financial entities who have come forward with an interest in working with the MTR scheme to progress a number of pilot alternative lease arrangements. In advance of these pilots, a targeted market testing exercise is currently underway by the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA), on behalf of my Department, to test the suitability of the proposed enhanced leasing arrangements to ascertain if they would be viable for a mortgage to rent cohort. </p>  <p>  The agreed Programme for a Partnership Government recognises the potential role that credit unions can play in housing finance and supports the efforts of the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank to gradually lift current lending restrictions as appropriate, including for housing. The Programme further provides that we will investigate with all stakeholders how credit unions can support the delivery of social housing.  </p>  <p>  Conscious of the independence of the Central Bank in its regulatory role in respect of credit unions, bilateral engagement has taken place between my Department and the Department of Finance to consider the potential regulatory and legislative implications of credit union involvement in the social housing sector. I acknowledge the willingness of credit unions to actively seek a role in financing the delivery of social housing. I and my Department have had ongoing contact with the credit union movement to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support.  </p>  <p>  In the context of the expressed interest of credit unions in providing finance for the delivery of social housing, the potential scope for credit union involvement in the planned new MTR pilot projects is being examined. My colleague, Minister of State Damien English and my Department are currently consulting with credit union representatives in this regard. </p>  <p>  Overall, these pilot projects are in a developmental stage and my Department is working with the Housing Agency to scope out the necessary terms and conditions that should apply. It is my intention that this scoping, together with the market testing being undertaken by the NDFA and consultation with other Government Departments responsible for policy and regulation relevant to the operation of the scheme, will be concluded in the coming weeks. At that point, I will be in a better position to set-out in more detail how the pilots will operate and how the private investors will be selected.  </p>  <p>  The Review of the MTR also included a commitment to undertaking a detailed financial assessment of the structure of the funding of the MTR scheme in advance of the budgetary process for 2018. The assessment will be informed by the early impact of the other actions proposed by the review, as well as the outcome of the experience with the pilot lease arrangements, and the availability of financial resources overall.</p></reply>

Until such time as both the NPF and the RSESs are adopted later in 2017 and 2018, respectively, the existing National Spatial Strategy and existing Regional Planning Guidelines will remain in place.</p>  <p>  The RSESs will support the implementation of the NPF and the economic policies and objectives of the Government by providing a long-term planning and economic development framework to guide action at local government level such as the statutory development plan process and the Local Economic and Community Plans also provided for under the Local Government Act 2014.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2016 (currently at Committee Stage) provides for the establishment of the Office of the Planning Regulator, which will be a prescribed body for the purposes of the preparation of future Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies.

Its objective is to avoid the significant effects of social isolation and limiting of opportunities that can occur with large mono - tenure estates, frequently necessitating the irregeneration and remediation at a later stage with consider able cost exposure to the State.  This policy approach was reaffirmed in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 published in November 2014 which further defined sustainable neighbourhoods as &ldquo;areas where an efficient use of land, high quality urban design and effective integration in the provision of physical and social infrastructure such as public transport, schools, amenities and other facilities combine to create places people want to live&rdquo;.</p><p>My Department has produced considerable planning guidance, including <i>Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas </i>(2010) and the <i>Manual for Urban Roads and</i><i>Streets</i>(2013) to assist local authorities to promote Sustainable Communities. In addition, the Department guidance document <i>Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities</i>seeks to promote quality and value for money in publicly funded housing. </p><p>While delivering on this policy approach may add to the challenge of housing delivery in certain circumstances, I believe that sustainable neighbourhood housing can be delivered on in a timely manner. Rebuilding Ireland is predicated on that objective and, with respect to social housing, &euro;5.35 billion will be invested over the period of the Action Plan, delivering some 47,000 social housing units.  </p><p>This is an ambitious target but there is now a significant pipeline of projects in place, as set out in my Department&rsquo;s recently published Social Housing Construction Projects Report, that will address housing need while still respecting the important goal of creating sustainable neighbourhoods. The report outlines details of some 8,430 social housing units in more than 500 developments nationwide, backed by a &euro;1.3 billion budget for 2017 alone. The units concerned are at various stages in the development process, from initial capital investment approval to on-site development stage.  </p><p>It should be noted that these developments do not include projects which are being progressed through public private partnerships, vacant units which are being brought back into use or acquisitions.</p></reply>

My Department operates certain funding programmes to support local authorities in the development and improvement of social housing, including improving energy efficiency. Over the years 2004 to 2009, this included support for local authorities to carry out an extensive central heating upgrade programme in social housing, which saw the installation of central heating, and associated energy efficiency measures, in 27,750 such dwellings, at a cost to the exchequer of &euro;140 million. My Department is not currently operating any programme to install heating systems in existing social houses.  </p>  <p>  Local authorities are currently undertaking an ambitious programme of insulation retrofitting, with the support of my Department, on the least energy efficient social homes.  Funding of some &euro; 107 million has been provided from 2013 to end-2016 to improve energy efficiency and comfort levels in over 57,000 local authority homes, benefitting those at risk of fuel poverty and making a significant contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s carbon emissions reduction targets and energy reduction targets for 2020.  </p>  <p>  The insulation retrofitting programme is being implemented in a number of phases: Phase 1 commenced in 2013 and is focused on providing attic/roof insulation and the less intrusive cavity wall insulation in all relevant properties while Phase 2 of the programme, which has been piloted in both Fingal and Westmeath County Councils, will focus on the external fabric upgrade of those social housing units with solid/hollow block wall construction.

Indeed, a range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers. </p><p>An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers from 1 April 2016. This new restructuring option for SO borrowers involves rolling up all outstanding debt under a SO arrangement into a single annuity loan-i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance, rental equity balance, plus any arrears - with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property. The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower. This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood. The restructuring option can lead to full home ownership for the borrower and as such allows for up/down sizing to suit household needs. This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their rental equity balance. The option may not be appropriate in all cases.  For example, in some instances, continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.  </p><p>Details on the measures available to borrowers with Shared Ownership arrangements are available from their local authority. </p><p>Overall, local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement. Information in relation to local authority mortgage arrears, the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:  -</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>Information in relation to local authority repossessions is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p><i>  </i></p><p>under the heading &ldquo;Local authority repossessions&rdquo;. This data is not broken down by loan type. </p><p>My Department provides capital funding to support local authorities in transferring into permanent social housing stock, house/apartments that were financed using a local authority home loan and which are now either repossessed, voluntarily surrendered or abandoned. It is a matter for local authorities to validate the suitability of these units for social housing in terms of unit type, location and meeting local need.  Where the local authority determines any of these units as being not suitable for social housing, the local authority may offer these units for sale on the open market.  My Department does not currently hold information on the units that fall into this category.</p></reply>

New group water schemes and new group sewerage schemes are addressed by two of the measures, namely:</p>  <p>-  Measure 3 - Rural development (group water sector): This measure supports social and economic development in rural towns and villages and their hinterlands by providing new  group water schemes where public water supply schemes or private wells are not an option. </p>  <p>  Grants under this heading are 85% of necessary works costs, subject to a maximum of &euro;7,650 per house.  A supplemental grant is available in exceptional circumstances.  </p>  <p>-  Measure 4 - Transition of schemes to Public Water and Waste Water Sector (Irish Water): This measure enables group water and sewerage schemes, where they wish to do so and with agreement of Irish Water, transition to the public water and waste water sector. Grants of 100% of the cost of works for takeovers of group water schemes and grants of up to 75% of cost subject to a maximum grant of &euro;6,750 per house are available for new group sewerage schemes. Group sewerage schemes are normally extensions of existing public sewerage (Irish Water) schemes and are taken-over immediately upon their completion.  A supplemental grant is available in exceptional circumstances.  </p>  <p>  In January 2016, my Department wrote to local authorities, advising them of the new multi-annual approach to the funding of both group water and sewerage schemes under the programme for 2016 and beyond. In August 2016, my Department notified local authorities of the schemes being included in the programme for its three year period as well as final overall allocations of funding in 2016 (interim allocations were made earlier in the year in order to maintain momentum in the programme).

Indecon Consultants were originally appointed to carry out the research on the development of a deposit retention scheme and they reported in November 2012.  The provisions in the 2015 Act were developed subsequently, informed by their analysis. However, a lot has changed in the rental market since the scheme was first envisaged.  The scheme was originally intended to be financed by the interest payable on deposits lodged; this is no longer viable given the current financial market conditions. Furthermore, disputes relating to deposits are no longer the most common dispute type referred to the RTB.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-21a.720.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022100067#WRM00900"><p>The latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) results for 2015 show that the consistent poverty rate, for people in households headed by a person who was unable to work due to illness or a disability, was 22.4% in 2015.  This compared to 14.4% the year before.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate increased from 25.2% to 34.8% and basic deprivation rose from 51.3% to 53.2% for this group in 2015.  However, these figures (like other statistics for very small groups in the survey) have been volatile in recent years.  This is due to smaller sample sizes.  It is not possible to say with certainty whether the changes over the year are statistically significant and indicative of a sustained trend.</p>  <p>  Given the continuing economic recovery throughout 2016 and measures introduced in Budgets 2016 and 2017, it is reasonable to expect future figures to show improvements.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to ensure that the economic recovery is experienced in all regions and by all families, households and individuals. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s strategy for addressing poverty and social exclusion is set out in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  The Department will review the Plan this year, as it reaches the end of its current term, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  The Department will also review the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review will be undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to increasing the employment opportunities for people with a disability.  The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities adopts a cross-government approach that brings together various measures, to be taken by different Departments and State agencies, in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on the employment of people with disabilities.  The six strategic priorities are to: build skills, capacity and independence; provide bridges and supports into work; make work pay; promote job retention and re-entry into work; provide co-ordinated and seamless support; and engage employers.  These priorities are incorporated into the Pathways to Work Strategy and this ensures that there is an integrated focus on supports that enable people with disabilities to participate in employment where they have the capacity to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department provides a range of specific income, activation and employment supports for people with a disability.  For instance, the partial capacity benefit scheme enables recipients of invalidity pension and illness benefit to take-up employment, on a voluntary basis, while continuing to receive income support.  The Department manages a supported employment service (EmployAbility) which provides a dedicated job-coaching service for people with disabilities.  Intreo services are also available to provide employment support services for people with disabilities who wish to engage with the service on a voluntary basis.  There is also a focus on supports available to employers who employ people with disabilities such as the Wage Subsidy Scheme and the Workplace Equipment Adaption Grant Scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-21a.723.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022100067#WRM01100"><p>I welcome the latest CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions results for 2015, showing improvements in living conditions and at tackling poverty.  The CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) for 2015 shows that 31.4 per cent of children experienced deprivation. While this is higher than the national rate, this is a reduction on the 2014 figure of 36.1 per cent or 51,000 children.  The full impact of the recovery is not yet reflected in these figures. Ireland has returned to strong economic and employment growth.</p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with my Department and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.</p>  <p>A key driver in preventing poverty among children is social transfers, such as welfare payments and child benefit. Using Eurostat data, social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children from 42% to 18%, a poverty reduction effect of 58%. Ireland is among the best in the EU for reducing poverty through social transfers; well above the EU average of 39%, ranking 2nd of the 28 member states.</p>  <p>  The monthly unemployment rate in January 2017 announced by the CSO was 7.1%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012. As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect further decreases in poverty as the figures for 2016 and 2017 become available. The Government continues to focus helping people back into the workforce. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 increased the weekly rates of payment for working age schemes and also raised the income disregard for one-parent family payment and jobseeker&rsquo;s transition payment recipients.  These measures will help to tackle child poverty. </p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with Government action to sustain and develop the social welfare system, will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.</p>  <p>  However, reducing child poverty is not just about income supports and welfare.  Rather it is also about supporting parents to make the transition into employment and assisting families through the provision of quality and affordable services in areas such as childcare, education and health.</p>  <p>  That is why one of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.</p></reply>

The deprivation rate for lone parent households fell from 58.7 per cent in 2014 to 57.9% in 2015.  The at-risk-of-poverty rate for lone parent households is largely unchanged in 2015 at 36.2%, compared to 36.5% in 2014.  The data also shows that the consistent poverty rate for children fell from 12.7% in 2014 to 11.5% in 2015.</p>  <p>  This SILC data for 2015 also shows that being at work reduces the consistent poverty rate for lone parents by three-quarters, highlighting that the best way to tackle poverty among lone parents is to assist them into employment. </p>  <p>  The full impact of the recovery is not reflected in these 2015 figures. Macro-economic and labour market indicators have shown continued economic and employment growth since then.  Unemployment has fallen from 9.5% in mid-2015 to 7.1% in January 2017.  The number of people in receipt of working-age income and employment supports continues to fall.  The full impact of the reforms to the one-parent family payment (OFP) and the positive impact of recent Budgets on lone parents are also not reflected in these figures. </p>  <p>  In Budget 2016 lone parents benefitted from a number of measures including increases in child benefit, changes to the means test on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment to align it with the more generous means test on the one-parent family payment, and increases in the family income supplement thresholds.  In Budget 2017 all lone parents on OFP, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JA) will benefit from the &euro;5 increase in the weekly rates of payment from March. A new &euro;500 annual Cost of Education Allowance will be made available to Back to Education Allowance participants with children from the next academic year in September. In addition, the income disregards for OFP and JST have risen by &euro;20 from January this year, from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week, reversing in part previous reductions, to encourage one parent families to stay in, and return to, work.  During that time the national minimum wage was increased from &euro;8.65 to &euro;9.25 per hour.</p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s social impact assessment of Budget 2017 showed that average household incomes increase by 1%. Non-earning lone parents were the biggest beneficiary of Budget 2017 with gains of 4.5%. Working lone parents also experienced above average gains at almost 1.2%.  This represents a cumulative increase across Budgets 2015, 2016 and 2017 almost &euro;27 per week for working lone parents and of over &euro;24 per week for lone parents who are not working.</p>  <p>  One of the most important measures contained in Budget 2017 for tackling child poverty was the announcement that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will implement next year the new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme.  This scheme is a step change in State support for childcare in Ireland.  It is an important scheme as it will significantly reduce the cost of childcare for low income parents and will provide further substantial support for families to lift themselves out of poverty by taking up employment.</p>  <p>  Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: the national policy framework for children and young people, published by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in 2014, includes a target to reduce child poverty by two-thirds by 2020.  Meeting this target means lifting 102,000 children out of poverty.  Under this Framework, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in collaboration with the Department of Social Protection and other relevant Departments is taking a whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty.</p>  <p>  Eurostat data shows that social transfers (excluding pensions) reduced the at-risk-of-poverty rate from 34.9% to 16.9%, an absolute reduction of 18 percentage points.  In relative terms, this represents a poverty reduction effect of 52%.  Ireland continues to be consistently among the best performing EU countries in reducing poverty through social transfers.  But we also know that, reducing poverty for lone parents is not just about income support.  It is also about supporting lone parents to make the transition into employment and assisting these families through the provision of quality services in areas such as activation including education, training and employment supports, and childcare.</p>  <p>  As part of the OFP reforms the Department has begun engaging with lone parents whose youngest child is seven years and older, on a proactive and supported basis. To date over 9,000 lone parents, of the 14,500 lone parents who are on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, have been selected for engagement.  It will take time to see the full impact of these activation engagements as it will take time for lone parents to complete the education, training or employment support programmes.</p>  <p>  Data from the latest Quarterly National Household Survey also shows that there has been a significant increase in the percentage of lone parents in employment in the year since the end of June 2016. This increase relates to all lone parents in the State and reflects the increase in economic and employment growth generally. The magnitude of the increase for lone parents specifically, however, is clearly significant. </p>  <p>  Continued economic recovery, together with the actions outlined above will support further reductions in poverty over the coming years.  The independent review of the one-parent family payment reforms, once completed, will also assist with discussions in my Department on measures for lone parents in Budget 2018. </p></reply>

Kildare.</p><p>In view of the on-going rental market difficulties, my Department implements a targeted case-by-case policy approach that allows for flexibility where landlords seek rents in excess of the rent limits. In addition, the Protocol arrangement in place with Threshold is operational in the areas where supply issues are particularly acute covering Kildare, Dublin, Cork, Meath, Wicklow and Galway City.  </p><p>Since the introduction of this flexible approach, in excess of 11,100 persons at imminent risk of homelessness have been supported through increased rent supplement payments, of which some 550 households have been supported in Co. Kildare. A county breakdown of the number of uplift payments made under the scheme is provided in the following tabular statement. These measures in tandem with the increased rent limits introduced in July 2016 are supporting rent supplement tenants to remain in their homes. </p><p>The Deputies will be aware that the strategic policy direction of the Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term income support with the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme. HAP is currently available in 28 out of 31 local authorities, including Kildare and Kerry with some 900 and 50 HAP tenancies in place respectively. HAP contributes to a more integrated and streamlined system of social housing supports and has been designed, unlike rent supplement, to allow households with a long term housing need that finds full-time employment to remain in the scheme. It is considered that people who may have a long term housing need should engage with the local authority in that regard. </p><p>My Department will continue to provide rental support, under the rent supplement scheme, to those with a short term need, generally because of a temporary loss of employment where they satisfy the other conditions of the scheme. People who find themselves temporarily unable to meet their rental costs should contact my Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service who may be able to offer assistance.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matters raised by the Deputies.</p><p>Tabular Statement </p><p>Increased Rental Payments by County, as of 20th February 2017<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Cumulative Awards under National Tenancy Sustainment Framework</th><th>Cumulative Awards under protocol with Threshold</th><th>Total no. of increased payments by County</th></tr><tr><td>CARLOW</td><td>74</td><td></td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN</td><td>66</td><td></td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>CLARE</td><td>60</td><td></td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>CORK</td><td>454</td><td>103</td><td>557</td></tr><tr><td>DONEGAL</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>DUBLIN</td><td>4,305</td><td>2,552</td><td>6,857</td></tr><tr><td>GALWAY</td><td>206</td><td>3</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>KERRY</td><td>206</td><td></td><td>206</td></tr><tr><td>KILDARE</td><td>549</td><td>3</td><td>552</td></tr><tr><td>KILKENNY</td><td>136</td><td></td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS</td><td>119</td><td></td><td>119</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>101</td><td></td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td>LIMERICK</td><td>17</td><td></td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>LONGFORD</td><td>313</td><td></td><td>313</td></tr><tr><td>LOUTH</td><td>160</td><td></td><td>160</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>MEATH</td><td>441</td><td></td><td>441</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>OFFALY</td><td>66</td><td></td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>ROSCOMMON</td><td>57</td><td></td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>1</td><td></td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>TIPPERARY</td><td>283</td><td></td><td>283</td></tr><tr><td>WATERFORD</td><td>62</td><td></td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>WESTMEATH</td><td>379</td><td></td><td>379</td></tr><tr><td>WEXFORD</td><td>23</td><td></td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>389</td><td>3</td><td>392</td></tr><tr><td>Overall Total</td><td>8,471</td><td>2,664</td><td>11,135</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The commencement of the Act also created a new associated social welfare scheme of paternity benefit from 1 September 2016. Paternity Benefit is paid at the same rate as maternity benefit which is &euro;230 per week.</p>  <p>  Paternity Benefit is a social insurance payment with the same qualifying PRSI conditionality as maternity benefit. It is only payable to employees and self-employed who have the required number of PRSI contributions. With the introduction of two weeks of paid paternity leave in addition to twenty-six weeks of paid maternity leave the State is offering parents potentially twenty-eight weeks of paid support.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that the legislation ensures no statutory obligation on an employer to continue to pay the normal salary during paternity leave. Employers have the option of providing a further top-up to the father&rsquo;s regular salary if they so choose. In drafting the legislation we had to be conscious, in this regard, of limiting the potential additional costs for business. However, a number of employers do top up their employees paternity benefit in much the same way as they offer to top up maternity benefit. </p>  <p>  There are a number of factors that determine the take up of any new scheme including, parental choice, whether the father or relevant parent has sufficient PRSI contributions, whether they are self-employed and can afford to take the time off from their business and if an employee, whether or not their employer would top up their wages.</p>  <p>  Where fathers have the required number of PRSI contributions they have flexibility to determine according to their own circumstances whether they wish to avail of paid paternity leave or not. I have no plans to introduce a mandatory system of paid paternity leave.</p></reply>

The text of that reply is set out below.</p><p>The following tables provide the details which have been requested by the Deputy in respect of 2015 and 2016.</p><p>The schemes with the highest number of appeals to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2015 and 2016 were - disability allowance (6,435 in 2015/4,912 in 2016), carer&rsquo;s allowance (3,188 in 2015/3,887 in 2016), jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance - means (2,174 in 2015/2,050 in 2016), jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance - payments (2,058 in 2015/2,031 in 2016), supplementary welfare allowance (2,125 in 2015/1,970 in 2016), invalidity pension (1,857 in 2015/1,362 in 2016) and domiciliary care allowance (1,258 in 2015/1,198 in 2016).</p><p>Details of appeal outcomes for the above schemes are set out in the tables attached. Overall, 58.8% of the 25,406 appeals which were finalised in 2015 had a favourable outcome for the appellant, i.e. were either allowed in full or in part, or resolved by way of a revised decision by a Deciding Officer/Designated Person.  59.2% of the 23,220 appeals finalised in 2016 had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>Of the 18,913 appeals which were finalised by Appeals Officers in 2015, 6,886 (36.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,444 (64.5%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.  Of the 16,990 appeals finalised by Appeals Officers in 2016, 6,527 (38.4%) were determined following an oral hearing.  4,251 (65.1%) of these had a favourable outcome for the appellant.</p><p>There are a number of reasons why a decision which was refused at first instance might be successful on appeal and it is not necessarily the case that the first decision was wrong. </p><p>Where new evidence is provided with an appeal, the original decision may be revised by the Deciding Officer or Designated Person. This was the case in some 35% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2015 and some 37% of favourable appeal outcomes in 2016. Where the decision is not revised in the Department in light of the appeal contentions, further evidence is often provided by the appellant as the appeal process proceeds. In addition, the Appeals Officer may gain insights when they meet the appellant in person at oral hearing which may also influence the outcome of the appeal.</p><p>Social Welfare legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may determine an appeal without an oral hearing where s/he is of the opinion that it can be determined fairly on the basis of the documentary evidence provided.  In general, where there is a conflict in the documentary evidence presented, an Appeals Officer will convene an oral hearing in order to explore the evidence and seek to resolve any conflict.</p><p>In addition, where an appellant requests an oral hearing, the request is generally granted unless the Appeals Officer is of the opinion that the appeal can be allowed on a summary basis, or where there is clearly nothing to be gained by granting an oral hearing. An example of this would be where the appeal question relates to PRSI contribution conditions or means and the underlying PRSI contribution figures or means are not disputed.  </p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p>Appeal Receipts 2015 &ndash;

For example:</p>  <p>  - The evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon (report published October 2016) shows on the basis of self-reported survey results that 61% of interns aged 20 to 24 years (and 53.8% of those aged 15-19) were currently in employment at the time of the survey.  Overall, individuals similar to those who participated in JobBridge had a 36.6% probability of securing employment within one year, whereas the JobBridge interns&rsquo; probability of securing employment within one year increased to 48.4% (an 11.8 percentage point difference and a 32% increase in the probability of becoming employed).</p>  <p>  - JobsPlus provides subsidies to employers for the full-time employment of those formerly long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  In October 2016 there were 4,323 participants benefitting from JobsPlus, 765 (17.7%) of whom were under 25.</p>  <p>  - In 2015 the level of satisfaction among under 25 year old Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job was very high at 4.27, of a possible maximum of 5.</p>  <p>  - 2016 results from the Customer Satisfaction Survey will be published shortly and show a similar high level of satisfaction among under 25 year olds Intreo clients with getting on to course, training or getting a job.</p>  <p>  Under the Government&rsquo;s policies to support the young unemployed, the first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  There is monthly engagement with all young jobseekers by a case officer, and a Personal Progression Plan is developed to chart the steps to be taken to facilitate a return to employment, which may include further education and training or other opportunities.</p>  <p>  For those who do not find employment, through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes/workplace based interventions such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s and First Steps; or in subsidies to employers, through JobsPlus Youth.  Long-term unemployed jobseekers under 25 are also referred to JobPath, a contracted, payment-by-results employment services that provides additional resources and supports to those long-term unemployed.</p>  <p>  Pathways to Work 2016 to 2020 sets additional targets in relation to addressing youth unemployment: 1) increase the relative share of workplace-based interventions (Gateway, T&Uacute;S, Positive to Work etc.) for youth unemployed; 2) to ensure the frequency of engagement with all young unemployed people is a minimum of one case officer meeting per month; 3) restructure the First Steps programme for young unemployed people to improve take-up by offering a higher level of support to jobseekers and employers &ndash; these consolidate reforms undertaken in previous Pathways to Work strategies; the fourth action, to implement the Defence Forces Skills for Life employment support programme, is a new programme.  The First Steps Programme has now been restructured and the pilot Skills For Life programme has been completed.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that these policy measures, together with an improving labour market, will continue to address youth unemployment.</p></reply>

Kildare, the restructured Community Welfare Service which was formerly available two mornings per week at walk-in clinics is now available at all times through initial telephone contact, which means the service can be delivered without the need to attend a clinic.  Telephone calls are followed by appointments or home visit if necessary, or application by post for non-urgent claims.  All calls are returned within 1 working day and emergency calls are prioritised.  Where any customers are not able, for reasons of illness or disability, to attend an appointment, arrangements will be made to see them in their home.</p><p>Prior to the restructuring, several changes to the operation of the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme (SWA) in Kildare had already been made.  All claims for Rent Supplement were centralised to a dedicated unit.  A system of Integrated Decisions was put in place in Newbridge Local Office in order to expedite claims for Jobseekers Allowance, Jobseekers Benefit and One Parent Family payment and thus minimise the recourse to SWA in these cases.  The result of these initiatives has been to greatly reduce the dependence on SWA, and the local Community Welfare Service, in local areas.  The main business now transacted locally is applications for Exceptional Needs Payments.</p><p>All services are monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure adequate services continue to be available.  In addition, the mobile phone numbers of the Community Welfare Officers in North Kildare are with the Superintendent Garda in Leixlip, in case of emergency.</p><p>Contact details for the service are as follows:<table><tr><th>Area</th><th>Phone Number</th></tr><tr><td>Athy - Castledermot</td><td>087 9138246</td></tr><tr><td>Dunlavin &ndash; Ballitore - Baltinglass</td><td>086 0202997</td></tr><tr><td>Monasterevin &ndash; Rathangan - Kildare</td><td>087 9638588</td></tr><tr><td>Newbridge &ndash; Curragh - Suncroft</td><td>086 7810420</td></tr><tr><td>Clane &ndash; Kilmeague &ndash; Prosperous &ndash; Robertstown - Allenwood</td><td>087 2950536</td></tr><tr><td>Naas &ndash; Caragh &ndash; Sallins &ndash; Johnstown &ndash; Kill - Kilcullen</td><td>087 7806165</td></tr><tr><td>Persons awaiting Jobseeker or One Parent Family Claims at Newbridge Local Office</td><td>087 6473528</td></tr><tr><td>Maynooth &ndash; Leixlip &ndash; Straffan &ndash; Rathcoffey</td><td>01 6106143</td></tr><tr><td>Celbridge &ndash; Kilcock &ndash; Ardclough</td><td>01 6303196</td></tr></table></p><p>I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

As a result good progress has been made in this regard.</p><p>The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from a peak of 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 28.6 weeks in 2014, 25.5 weeks in 2015 and 24.1 weeks in 2016 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 21.1 weeks in 2014, 18.1 weeks in 2015 and 17.6 weeks in 2016.</p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.

The number of applications awaiting decision and the average time to award for each main social welfare scheme is set out in the table appended.</p><p>The time taken by my Department to process applications depends on a number of factors, primarily the conditionality and relative complexity that applies to the relevant scheme.  The quality and completeness of the application form and other supporting material is also an important factor.  When the number of people applying to any particular scheme increases significantly, it can put pressure on my Department&rsquo;s capacity to process those claims in a timely manner.  Finally, long term schemes with medical or caring conditionality are relatively complex to decide upon and, consequently, can take longer to process.</p><p>Reducing waiting times is a priority for my Department and we are working hard to make this happen.  As part of its programme of service delivery modernisation, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims, supported by modern technology, have been implemented by my Department in recent years.

Both the jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance schemes provide significant support to unemployed persons so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.</p>  <p>  In addition to the two jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes my Department&rsquo;s main in-work support is the family income supplement (FIS), which targets families with children on low incomes and who work at least 19 hrs per week.  The payment effectively preserves the incentive to take up or remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if s/he were claiming other social welfare payments.</p>  <p>  Where a long term unemployed jobseeker is offered employment of more than 3 days but less than 24 hours a week, they may be eligible for the part-time job incentive scheme.  Under this scheme they can receive a weekly payment of &euro;119 per week if they are single or &euro;193.90 if they have an adult dependent.</p>  <p>  My Department is also currently analysing incentives to work in the social welfare system for jobseekers with children with a view to developing the Working Family Payment.  The two main principles guiding the development of the Working Family Payment are to make work pay and to reduce child poverty.</p>  <p>  This analysis is supplemented by research from the ESRI, which shows that people are better off in work than on welfare.  The ESRI research, based on an analysis of current incomes, benefits and taxes, demonstrates that more than eight out of ten unemployed jobseekers would see their income increase by at least forty per cent upon taking up employment.  Fewer than three per cent would, in the short-term, be financially better off not in work.</p>  <p>  The risk of facing weak financial incentives to work is higher for unemployed persons with a spouse and children, as the income support goal of the welfare system means that they tend to have higher welfare payments.  However, even among that group, fewer than one in fifteen would be financially better off not working.  With the introduction of the Back to Work Family Dividend (BTWFD) scheme, that figure drops to one in twenty.</p>  <p>  The combination of jobseekers, FIS, BTWFD and the part-time job incentive schemes provides considerable income support for individuals who have part time employment by allowing them retain access to a social welfare payment.</p>  <p>  Reflecting the impact of government policy, and the overall improvement in the labour market, long term unemployment continues to fall. The most recent data show that unemployment has fallen from a peak of 15% in 2012 to 7.1% in January 2017.</p></reply>

Measures of unemployment from the QNHS are based on International Labour Office (ILO) definitions.  To be &lsquo;ILO unemployed&rsquo; a person must in the week before the survey be without work but available for work and have recently taken specific job-search steps.  The Live Register, which captures those registering for unemployment benefits (including those working part-time and in casual work who draw partial unemployment payments), is an administrative record.  It is not the official measure of unemployment, but can give indicative trends.  My Department uses both Live Register and QNHS data for reporting and monitoring trends and adjusting policies accordingly at national level.</p>  <p>  This includes providing data and trends broken down by age categories as well as by duration categories (long term and short term).  The QNHS data, being prepared as part of the EU-wide Labour Force Survey, also allow Irish trends to be compared with international developments.</p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work strategy, the key document setting out policy to facilitate the unemployed of all ages back into work, is underpinned by analyses of the labour market situation based on the statistical sources mentioned above.</p>  <p>  By allocating activation resources to persons on the Live Register, the government&rsquo;s policy tends automatically to focus on those areas and age-groups in which unemployment is most concentrated.  The focus on those most in need is further reinforced by the use of profiling to identify, among the newly unemployed, those most likely to face severe difficulties in re-entering employment.  People who are identified as having a low PEX (probability of exit from unemployment) score are prioritised for intensive engagement and support from the Intreo employment service with a view to preventing a move into long-term unemployment.</p></reply>

These include the European Globalisation Fund (EGF), the European Social Fund (ESF)/Youth Employment Initiative, and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD).  These funds each operate on different timelines and have different rules and procedures.</p><p>The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (the EGF) supports workers made redundant as a result of major changes in global trade patterns.  Along with the redundant workers, some young people under the age of 25 and not in employment, education or training (NEETs) in selected areas are also eligible for funding.  The purpose of the EGF is to provide relevant supports to redundant workers to assist them back into employment.  The scope of the EGF covers education and training programmes, career advice and guidance, and enterprise supports.  The Department of Education and Skills is the Managing Authority in Ireland for the EGF and my Department works with<font color="#004080"> it </font>to determine whether schemes and supports are eligible for funding.</p><p>The European Social Fund (ESF) is the European Union&rsquo;s financial instrument for investing in people and provides additional funding under the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) which aims to assist Member States in their efforts to put their Youth Guarantee implementation plans into practice.  A number of schemes including T&uacute;s and JobsPlus have been selected to assess eligibility under the 2014-2020 ESF Operational Programme.  Again, my Department liaises with the Managing Authority, the Department of Education and Skills, in this regard.  In addition, EURES and some Disability schemes are also considered to determine eligibility.</p><p>My Department is the Managing Authority for the delivery of the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD).  The aim of FEAD is to break the circle of poverty and deprivation.</p><p>Clearly, a key area of concern is the impact of Brexit on the current reciprocal arrangements for social security schemes and services between Ireland and the UK, including Northern Ireland.  The Government's long-term objective is to ensure that the reciprocity of civic rights and, specifically in the context of the meeting, social welfare rights and entitlements, which currently exist for Irish and UK citizens moving within Ireland and between Ireland and Britain under the Common Travel Area [CTA], are safeguarded and maintained.  I will take every opportunity to protect and advance this objective as well as keeping the matter of EU funding under close review as will my officials.</p></reply>

These are minimising impact on trade and the economy, protecting the peace process and Northern Ireland, maintaining the Common Travel Area and influencing the future of the European Union.</p>  <p>  The Government welcomed the further clarity provided by Prime Minister May in her address of 17 January.  Prime Minister May has made clear that she wishes to secure the closest possible future economic relationship for Britain with the EU, a goal that Ireland shares.  In her speech, Prime Minister May highlighted the specific and historic relationship between Britain and Ireland.  In this context, she made clear that her priorities include maintaining the Common Travel Area and avoiding a return to a hard border with Northern Ireland, both of which are welcome.</p>  <p>  I am not aware of the kind of plans referred to by the Deputy.  When the negotiations start, we, together with our EU partners, will face the UK across the negotiating table and will strive for a deal that everyone can accept but more importantly that protects Ireland&rsquo;s fundamental interests, including maintaining the open border on this island.  However, the Government is under no illusions about the hard work that will be needed to deliver this.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister May the serious implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the imperative of retaining the open border on the island of Ireland, at their meeting in Dublin on 30 January.  There will be a need for the British Government to reflect the unique challenges Brexit poses for Northern Ireland in the position they adopt in the negotiations with the EU27.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.</p>  <p>  As part of our preparations for the negotiations, I have been in contact with all of my EU counterparts in order to sensitise them to the need for specific arrangements which protect the key gains of the peace process on this island &ndash; a process to which the EU has already made a key contribution.</p>  <p>  From my engagement with all of my EU counterparts, as well as with the EU Institutions, most notably my recent discussions with Michel Barnier, Chair of the European Commission Taskforce on Brexit, and Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit negotiator for the European Parliament, there is deep appreciation of the EU&rsquo;s role and contribution in support of the peace process and a wish to continue that support, regardless of the challenges and impacts of Brexit.</p>  <p>  The Government will continue to engage with all of our EU partners to highlight the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, and the consequences for North-South cooperation on the island as a whole, which must be factored into the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and any new EU-UK relationship.</p></reply>

As a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government is determined that all aspects of the Agreement are fully respected in the context of the Brexit process.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union.  The potential impacts on the Good Friday Agreement are being considered from legal and other perspectives as part of this ongoing work, with advice and assistance by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and my own Department&rsquo;s Legal Division as required.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach and Prime Minister May have reaffirmed that the Agreement remains the basis for the two Governments&rsquo; approach to Northern Ireland.  It is important to underline that the legal obligations and political commitments of both the Irish and British Governments under the Good Friday Agreement remain unchanged, regardless of the status of the UK within the EU.</p>  <p>  As we look to protect and preserve the gains of the peace process through the challenges of Brexit, the crucial importance of achieving the full promise of the Good Friday Agreement is further underlined.  The Government&rsquo;s firm position is that the Good Friday Agreement and the successor Agreements must be implemented in full, and this is reflected in the Programme for Partnership Government.  The Agreements, and the principles and values underpinning them, are at the core of the Government&rsquo;s approach to peace, reconciliation and prosperity on this island.  The Government will continue to work tirelessly for that full implementation in both letter and spirit.</p>  <p>  Achieving the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement was a key theme in the very productive Sectorial Dialogue on Human Rights under the Good Friday Agreement that I convened on 13 February, as part of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit.  As co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement, the Government takes very seriously its responsibility to safeguard its institutions and principles including in the area of human rights.  Human rights are central to the peace process and must be protected and sustained, regardless of the UK&rsquo;s status in the EU.  The Government will continue to work closely with the British Government and the Northern Ireland Executive to ensure that the protection of human rights remains at the heart of civic life, politics and ongoing societal change in Northern Ireland.  This includes the continued incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights in Northern Ireland law as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement.</p>  <p>  The interlocking political institutions represent the heart of the Good Friday Agreement.  It is therefore critical that the devolved Assembly and Executive are promptly re-established after the forthcoming elections.  There is an indispensable role for the devolved power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland in managing the implications of Brexit.  This includes the very good work and cooperation at the North South Ministerial Council, which the Government is keen to see resumed at the earliest possible opportunity after the upcoming elections.</p>  <p>  Effective devolved Government, underpinned by a genuine spirit of partnership, is what the people of Northern Ireland voted for in 1998 and what they expect their politicians to deliver.  After the election, it will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require the parties to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election.  In this regard, it is of the utmost importance that all parties bear in mind the principles of mutual respect, partnership and equality, which underpin the Good Friday Agreement.  The Government is of course always ready to support and assist the parties in any way we can - our commitment as a co-guarantor of the Agreement is a constant one.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-21a.852.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017022100068#WRN07000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 339, 341 and 345 together.</p>  <p>  With regard to the Executive Order signed by President Trump on 27 January, 2017, I made clear in my statement on 29 January last that, while US immigration policy is a matter for the US authorities, it is clear that the recent decision could have far-reaching implications &ndash; both on humanitarian grounds and on relations between the US and the global Muslim community.  Accordingly, I share the concerns of other EU partners regarding this development.  I have noted the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January, 2017, to the effect that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  Since then, the US courts have intervened and imposed a temporary suspension on the implementation of the Executive Order.</p>  <p>  Both the recent Executive Order and the question of immigration reform were high on the agenda during my visit to Washington DC from 31 January to 2 February.  I had a number of engagements with the Administration and Congressional leaders, including the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, the House majority leader and the House minority leader, among others.</p>  <p>  In my meetings with Congressional leaders, as well as with the &ndash; now former &ndash; US National Security Advisor, General Flynn, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concerns with regard to the nature and impact of the recent Executive Order.  In response, General Flynn outlined to me the rationale - in terms of US immigration policy - for these temporary measures, while I pointed out their damaging consequences in humanitarian terms, as well as for the international reputation of the United States.</p>  <p>  Achieving relief for the undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and securing greater legal pathways for migration to the United States remain key objectives for the Government.  These priorities featured in all of my meetings in Washington, DC &ndash; including with General Flynn, with Speaker Ryan and with other Congressional leaders.</p>  <p>  Both the Administration and members of Congress are fully aware of the importance of this issue for Ireland and appreciate our strong and continuing interest in securing immigration reform.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s forthcoming visit to Washington, DC, for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day will provide a key opportunity to raise the issue of immigration reform &ndash; especially the plight of our undocumented &ndash; directly with the US administration at the highest levels.</p>  <p>  During my recent visit, I also met with members of the Irish community in Washington, DC, and re-assured them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to immigration reform.  I emphasised that, while the political context in Washington may have changed, the Government&rsquo;s objectives remain constant: relief for the undocumented and finding greater pathways for legal migration.  I noted that we can only advance these objectives if we engage and articulate our views with key policymakers in the Administration and Congress.</p>  <p>  I would like to stress the fact that the Embassy in Washington, DC, and our Consulates across the United States, continue to work with Irish Immigration centres on a daily basis in providing support to Irish citizens in the United States.</p>  <p>  Our Ambassador to the United States, Anne Anderson, held a workshop with key immigration stake-holders from across the United States at the Embassy on 12 January last.  The Government and my Department is committed to providing practical support to undocumented Irish citizens across the US, while also continuing to advocate for immigration reform.</p></reply>

The Government has made clear that we will be working for special arrangements which take account of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s unique circumstances.  Our priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union and of course to maintain the open border on the island of Ireland and the Common Travel Area.  The hard-won peace on the island must be protected.</p><p>The established framework for all engagement on Northern Ireland is the Good Friday Agreement.  This has been strongly reaffirmed by the Government and the British Government following the UK decision to leave the European Union.  The Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty, registered with the United Nations and it provides for a unique political and constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland, which is the foundation of the peace process.  This is something the European Union as a whole has long recognised and supported.  From my engagement with all of my EU counterparts, as well as with the EU institutions, most notably my recent discussions with Michel Barnier, Chair of the European Commission Taskforce on Brexit, and Guy Verhofstadt, Brexit lead for the European Parliament, there is deep appreciation of the EU&rsquo;s role and contribution in support of the peace process and a wish to continue that support, regardless of the challenges and impacts of Brexit.</p><p>At their meeting in Dublin on 30 January, The Taoiseach discussed with Prime Minister May the serious implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the imperative of retaining the open border on the island of Ireland.  There will be a need for the British Government to reflect the unique challenges Brexit poses for Northern Ireland in the position they adopt in the negotiations with the EU27.  I reinforced this message in my meeting with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland James Brokenshire in our meeting on 14 February.</p><p>The UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU will be a complex and lengthy political negotiation, involving all EU Member States and EU institutions as appropriate.  The Government&rsquo;s focus in relation to Northern Ireland is the substantive outcome on each of the key issues, rather than the label ascribed to the overall package.  The Government will maintain its focus on pursuit of specific, effective, and realisable measures that address each of the issues of concern under Brexit.  We will continue to do this in cooperation with our European partners and as a clear and committed EU Member State, as the best means of protecting the interests of all of the people on the island.</p><p>The Government has been clear that there are entirely unique circumstances in respect of the island of Ireland that must be taken account of in the negotiations for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union and the future EU-UK relationship.  The Good Friday Agreement, an international treaty, registered with the United Nations, provides for a unique political and constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland, which is the foundation of the peace process.</p><p>It is worth recalling that the Good Friday Agreement recognises the &ldquo;birthright of all the people of Northern Ireland to identify themselves and be accepted as Irish or British, or both&rdquo;.  This means that virtually everyone born in Northern Ireland can of right choose to be an Irish citizen, and therefore a citizen of the European Union, with all of the attendant rights and obligations of both.  There is no parallel for this anywhere in Europe &ndash; a point I have been highlighting to all my EU foreign ministerial colleagues.  The Agreement also contains very important provisions on the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.  The Government has been clear that Brexit causes no legal impediment to the mechanism set out in the Agreement for a united Ireland, in accordance with the principle of consent.</p><p>&ldquo;Special status&rdquo; for Northern Ireland is taken to mean a specific request for Northern Ireland to remain within the EU with a special status post Brexit.  While the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the European Union is something that the Irish Government strongly opposed, our task now is to face up to the unwanted result and outcome with all of the challenges that brings, in order to secure the best outcome for the island of Ireland as a whole.</p><p>While the Irish Government is actively seeking recognition and accommodation of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, our extensive discussions with partner governments across the EU &ndash; including the UK - have made clear that concepts and terms like &ldquo;special status&rdquo; give rise to serious concerns for other EU partners about precedents that might be set elsewhere.<b></b>This would risk undermining the Government&rsquo;s efforts to specifically address and mitigate the very real impacts facing our island &ndash; and the people of Northern Ireland in particular - due to Brexit.  While I entirely understand the rationale of those seeking a &ldquo;special status&rdquo; designation, the fact is that such a proposal would unnecessarily distract from work to secure arrangements which reflect the genuine uniqueness of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s situation, founded in the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, as well as its geographic status as the only land border between the UK and the EU27.</p><p>Last week I outlined to the House the need for specific, effective, and realisable measures that could address the major issues of concern under Brexit, whether these relate to the border, or to the citizenship, constitutional and human rights provisions of the Agreement, or otherwise.  The Government will also be advocating for the continuation of the range of EU policy supports to Northern Ireland and the peace process, including in relation to EU funding and is looking at existing precedents and potential innovative approaches in this regard.</p><p>The Government will continue to work with our EU partners and prepare comprehensively in support of our overall objectives.</p></reply>

The need for the Statement to comply with EU and international law was a key concern for all EU Member States, including Ireland.  The legal advice of the EU institutions and of the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was that the terms of the Statement were not in breach of EU or international law.  Progress on the implementation of the Statement is monitored by the European Commission, which publishes quarterly reports.  The latest report, from 8 December 2016, confirms the substantial fall in the number of crossings since the Statement was agreed.  The European Commission monitors the return of new irregular migrants and asylum seekers to Turkey, which is carried out strictly in accordance with the requirements of EU and international law, and in full respect of the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>. </p><p>The European Commission also reports on progress under the Facility for Refugees in Turkey, which is designed to ensure that the needs of refugees and host communities in Turkey are addressed in a comprehensive and coordinated way, including through humanitarian assistance, education, health, and socio-economic support.</p><p>The Fifth Report on progress made on the implementation of the Statement is expected in early March.</p></reply>

We also meet through the means of the British Irish Council, where the UK&rsquo;s exit from the European Union is discussed at its summit meetings and where the Scottish government is a member administration. My most recent discussions with the Scottish government took place around the time of the publication of their policy paper &ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Place in Europe&rdquo; in December, when I spoke with the Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs, Ms. Fiona Hyslop MSP. A short period prior to that, I met with the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, at Iveagh House during her visit to Dublin.    Day-to-day contacts with the Scottish government are carried out by our diplomatic representatives at the Consulate General of Ireland in Edinburgh, while the Scottish government is represented at its Innovation and Investment Hub based in the British Embassy in Dublin. Such contacts of course include discussions of the UK exit from the EU, including in recent weeks.

These ceilings take into account expenditure pressures in Health, Education and Social Protection arising from demographics.  The amounts included in respect of this additional expenditure are consistent with the Pre-Budget position detailed in Table 1.7 of the Mid-Year Expenditure Report last year.  The ceiling for Social Protection reflects an adjustment to take account of expected lower numbers on the Live Register.</p>  <p>  The ceilings in respect of current expenditure have not been set on a Departmental basis for periods beyond 2019. Consequently, the figures used in Table 12 of the Budget 2017 Department of Finance publication for the years beyond 2019 include the aggregate overall increase of c. &euro;0.4 billion in respect of demographic related costs for 2019, adjusted for a lower amount being available for reallocation within expenditure from Live Register savings in subsequent years.</p>  <p>  Any savings that arise from the increase in the qualifying age for State Pension recipients in 2021 will not have an impact on the gross fiscal space but will have a positive impact on the net fiscal space as detailed in Table A7 of Budget 2017. </p>  <p>  In estimating the likely savings of this measure, it is useful to note that this is the second phase of the legislated increase in the State pension age that was initially detailed in the National Pensions Framework in 2010.  The first phase of this process occurred in 2014 when the pension age was increased to 66 with the abolition of the State Pension (Transition) payment. </p>  <p>  In Table 2 of the Report of the Interdepartmental Group on Fuller Working Lives, work undertaken by the Department of Social Protection details the projected savings as a result of the first phase of the pension reforms in 2014.  The net savings estimated were &euro;37.7 million (a "half year" effect) for 2014 and &euro;76.2 million for 2015.  These savings take into account the projected increases in claims of working age payments, such as Jobseekers Benefit and various disability and illness payments.</p></reply>

The cost of these changes is estimated at about &euro;90 million on a full-year basis from 2018.</p>  <p>  As we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR restoration towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service, the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages will be considered by Government.</p></reply>

Flood levels on Lough Mask reached levels of over 400mm higher than the next highest level recorded in February 2014 and over 600mm higher  than December 2006.</p>  <p>  I am advised that following this flooding, the Office of Public Works (OPW) carried out heavy woody vegetation management along the Cong Canal (CM1) channel which links Lough Mask with Lough Corrib.  At the northern end of channel CM1 there are redundant sluice gates and other eel fishery structures.  During the flood it was observed that these structures may also be affecting Lough Mask&rsquo;s ability to discharge efficiently.  OPW regional staff are in the process of securing access such that appropriate alterations can be made to these structures to minimise their contribution to the larger flooding issue between Mask and Corrib, while having regard to any downstream effects.</p>  <p>  Proposals are in hand to have the disused walkway structure removed from the existing weir in Cong in early summer (outside of salmon spawning season) and to have some additional selective  heavy woody vegetation management carried out at specific locations along the river from Cong Village to Lough Corrib later this year. </p>  <p>  Mayo Co. Co. has retained the services of consulting engineers to look at the flooding issues in and around Cong village and in other specific areas of South Mayo.  To date they have carried out a preliminary flood study of the Cong area  and are currently providing some additional information on a number of Minor Works Applications which were forwarded to OPW in December 2016. </p>  <p>  West Region OPW staff have met with Mayo Co. Co. on a number of occasions since Christmas and separately with the consulting engineers.

The Programme is focussing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs) including 90 coastal areas, mainly in urban locations nationwide, identified as being at potentially significant risk of flooding.  It is the principal vehicle for implementing the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy.   </p>  <p>  The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. </p>  <p>  The Careysfort Maretimo catchment is within the Dublin City AFA of the Eastern CFRAM programme.  The preferred option developed by the CFRAM Study, to protect at risk properties along the Carysfort Maretimo watercourse, consists of five offline storage areas in combination with flood defence walls.  The proposed storage areas will reduce the flow along the Carysfort Maretimo watercourse, while the hard defences provide additional protection against the 1% Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) flood event.  Approximately 250 meters of hard defence is required with an average and total height of 0.8 meters and 1.4 meters respectively.</p>  <p>  The Carysfort Maretimo Stream Improvement Scheme works were previously completed along this watercourse.  The scheme was constructed between 2010 and 2012 and comprised improved channel conveyance, raised walls, culvert bypasses and screen upgrades.  The completed works provide protection, against a 1:50 to 1:100 year flood event (1%-2% AEP), for in excess of forty properties previously at risk of flooding from the Carysfort Maretimo watercourse. </p>  <p>  The OPW will shortly finalise the Flood Risk Management Plans that will include a prioritised set of flood risk management measures, both structural and non-structural, that will set out the measures to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  These will then be submitted for approval by the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform, and subsequent implementation.  The approved Final Plans may then subsequently be adopted by the Local Authorities.</p></reply>

The process included full public consultation and an in-depth review of all proposed candidate sites.</p>  <p>  The Tentative List produced by the expert group contains a list of seven potential nominations, including Early Medieval Monastic Sites of which Kells forms part, along with Clonmacnoise, Durrow, Glendalough, Inis Cealtra and Monasterboice.  The expert group considered that these six sites were exemplars of the early Church&rsquo;s rich cultural and historical past which played a crucial role in Europe&rsquo;s educational and artistic development.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department has engaged with local authorities and local groups from the areas with proposals on the Tentative List to gauge the extent of the support available to advance the proposals and to clarify the work and resources required for that purpose.  The fundamental requirement is that each site must be capable of demonstrating Outstanding Universal Value to UNESCO. </p>  <p>  As Kells is included in a serial nomination, and is part of a representative sample of Irish monuments, all the component parts must enjoy local support to ensure that the overall proposal can proceed to formal nomination stage.  My Department is happy to continue to engage with representatives of the areas in the Early Medieval Monastic Sites  nomination if the local communities and especially the local authorities, who must generally take the lead, consider that it would be of assistance.</p>  <p>  I am committed to supporting the current proposals in every way that I can.  The process is undoubtedly both complex and lengthy and the work at every stage must be supported and developed from the local level up with stakeholder buy-in and commitment at every stage. While this adds to the timescale, it avoids a top down approach lacking the engagement necessary with local communities to secure full support for the proposals and for the protection and preservation of the sites into the future. </p></reply>

They can be found throughout the countryside and are present in many parts of the country.  There is an annual open season during which deer can be legally shot under licence.  The open season for deer operates generally from 1 September to 28 February, depending on the species and gender of deer.  My Department carries out localised annual deer counts on State lands such as the National Parks.  Where appropriate, and depending on the annual count and instances of damage caused by deer to habitats, especially woodland, culls may be carried out to ensure that deer populations do not reach levels that would have negative ecological consequences.</p>  <p>  Control of deer on private property is the responsibility of landowners, who may apply to my Department for a permission under section 42 of the Wildlife Acts to cull deer where this is necessary outside the annual open seasons.  These permissions offer a facility whereby a person can obtain a permit, on a case by case basis, to prevent serious damage caused by individual deer on specific lands.  Permissions are only issued where there is evidence of such damage.</p>  <p>  In relation to preventing road accidents involving deer, my Department is of the view that improving sight lines for motorists as well as improved (and possibly larger) signage is likely to be the most effective measure to assist motorists to be vigilant when driving through areas where populations of deer can be expected. </p>  <p>  In relation to deer policy in general, my Department, together with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, published Deer Management in Ireland &ndash; A Framework for Action in 2015, which recommends a series of actions on deer management and conservation in a number of areas, including addressing the impact of deer in places where they are widespread.  An Irish Deer Management Forum has been established to implement the various actions listed in the Report.  The Forum itself comprises representatives from the main stakeholder areas such as landowners, forestry, hunting and conservation organisations, as well as representatives from both Departments  .</p></reply>

The Bill as proposed will update all existing laws on the regulation of gambling including betting and gaming but excluding the National Lottery.

Counselling and rehabilitation services provide care to those presenting with a gambling addiction through one to one counselling, financial advice and onward referral to other services and supports, where appropriate, such as Gamblers Anonymous.</p>  <p>  Psychotherapists and counsellors are not currently regulated under the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005.

As a result of investment, we made some progress but there is much more to do to provide the level service that is needed.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with the CEO of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and of Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC) to discuss immediate action that can be taken to reduce waiting times for children and adolescents with scoliosis.  </p>  <p>  While the new theatre in OLCHC was commissioned in 2016, it is only now being used for scoliosis surgery due to challenges with recruiting nurses.  The hospital has undertaken an aggressive recruitment drive to attract new theatre nurses with the necessary paediatric training.  As a result four new nurses will be in place by April.  A further 16 international nurses have been offered posts, and have commenced the registration process.  The recruitment of these nurses means that the new theatre will be used to provide the additional capacity for scoliosis procedures in OLCHC from April.  This will allow an additional day of procedures to be carried out in the medium term.  I am advised by OLCHC that an orthopaedic surgeon post in the hospital will also be filled by June.  This means that from July, the hospital expects that the theatre use will be further increased.  In addition I will receive an Action Plan for Scoliosis from the HSE by the end of February which will take on board the concerns of the advocacy groups.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy regarding the waiting list and waiting times for children for scoliosis surgery and activity levels in hospital across the country, as this is a service issue, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

It confirmed that all duties would be undertaken as normal however requests to redeploy, or stay on for additional periods, would not be agreed by INMO members during the dispute.  It further stated that the action would be escalated to a nationwide work stoppage in the second week, commencing with a one day work stoppage; in the week beginning 14th March 2017.  It has confirmed that emergency services would be provided, in line with the Framework for Dispute Resolution in the Health Services (Framework Agreement) which sets out the procedures to be followed in order to make the required arrangements in such circumstances.</p>  <p>  Pursuant to the notice and the INMO confirming that it would be available to meet to agree national and local contingency arrangements in accordance with the Framework Agreement a meeting has been arranged between the HSE and the INMO to consider these arrangements and it is taking place this afternoon.  My Department will be in attendance.  The INMO has also confirmed it is available to meet in respect of the substantive issues.  The parties had an initial engagement with the Lansdowne Road Oversight Body on 9th February and it has been in contact with the parties in the interim.  Arising from this it is expected that there will be further engagement between the parties in advance of 7th March.  In relation to the industrial action underway involving support staff, I can confirm that discussion between the parties is ongoing.  With regard to any contingency planning, the parties concerned would also engage in accordance with the Framework for Dispute Resolution in the Health Services.</p></reply>

THC is a psychoactive substance and as such is strictly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977, as amended, and Ministerial regulations made thereunder along with the cannabis plant.</p>  <p>  However, since CBD does not have psychoactive properties it is not controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  There is no prohibition on an Irish registered doctor recommending CBD for a patient under his/her care if they deem that treatment option to be clinically appropriate for their patient.</p>  <p>  I am aware that CBD oil is sometimes marketed as a nutritional or dietary supplement, and it is reported that a number of Irish patients are accessing CBD Oil from shops or online and using it to self-medicate for a variety of medical conditions.  However,  it should be noted that it is not authorised as a medicinal product in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency. A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicinal product is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements.  I have no role in the process of medicinal product authorisation. </p></reply>

In determining  the services covered by the NHSS it was considered very important that the care recipient and the taxpayer would be protected and would not end up paying for the same services twice.  For this reason, medications and aids that are already prescribed for individuals under an existing scheme are not included in the services covered by the NHSS, as this would involve effectively paying twice for the same service.</p><p>As transport is not a core health service it is not covered by the medical card.</p><p>Although the NHSS covers core living expenses, residents can still incur some costs in a nursing home. In recognition of this, anyone in receipt of financial support under the NHSS retains at least 20% of their income.  The minimum amount that is retained is the equivalent of 20% of the State Pension (Non-Contributory).  An operator should not seek payment from residents for items which are covered by the NHSS, the medical card or any other existing scheme.</p></reply>

The capital value of an individual&rsquo;s principal private residence is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of their time in care.  This is known as the three year cap.</p>  <p>  Importantly, a farm (or relevant business) can also qualify for this three year cap where unexpected health events prevent early succession arrangements.  This applies where:</p>  <p>  a) The applicant has suffered a sudden illness or disability which caused them to require care services and</p>  <p>  b) A substantial part of the working day of the applicant or their partner was regularly and consistently applied to the farming of the farm or carrying on of the relevant business until the onset of the sudden illness or disability, and</p>  <p>  c) A family successor certifies in writing that he or she will on a consistent and regular basis apply a substantial part of his or her working day to the farming of the farm or the carrying on of the relevant business.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Review was published in July 2015.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  An Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group has been established to progress certain recommendations contained in the Review.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The IFA made a submission to the Working Group on the treatment of farms for the purposes of the Scheme.  These proposals are currently being considered.  An initial report on progress was submitted to the Cabinet Committee on Health in September 2016.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has also committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms.</p>  <p>  The Fair Deal Scheme operates under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act, 2009.  There are no provisions in the Act to reimburse family members for out of pocket expenses for visiting relations in nursing homes.  Under the Scheme, the choice of nursing home lies with the applicant, who can choose any public, voluntary or approved private nursing home.  The home must have availability and be able to cater for the applicant's particular needs.</p></reply>

This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.  </p>  <p>  The provision of transport to adults with a disability attending HSE-funded day services is not a core health service, and the HSE endeavours to ensure that all service users access public transport, including rural transport services, if possible.  This is in keeping with the principle of mainstreaming with a clear focus on ensuring persons with a disability have access to the normal range of services and participate in community life as far as possible.  In general, day service users are in receipt of disability allowance and are automatically entitled to the Free Travel Pass, so there should be no additional cost burden at an individual level. </p>  <p>  However when all other options are exhausted, and a person cannot avail of a day service because they do not have transport to attend, some transport is provided by disability service providers on a case by case basis as resources allow.  Service providers are continuously reviewing their transport arrangements to ensure that they are used as effectively and equitably as possible within available resources.  This may result in the provision of a reduced quantum of service to the service user, and the HSE does its best to provide transport in certain cases without reducing services.  Service providers continue to keep the matter of transport under review.</p>  <p>  The HSE has committed to establishing a high level cross divisional working group this year to rationalise the provision of transport and to maximise equitable access and efficiencies.  The HSE also intends to liaise with the National Transport Authority and disability service providers to explore ways in which the Authority&rsquo;s services could assist people with disabilities.  The National Transport Authority has a total of 17 Transport co-ordinating units called Local Link which provide safe secure and reliable Public Transport services in local and rural areas of Ireland through a combination of scheduled Public Transport services and door to door services.  The HSE plans to explore the opportunities these units may provide to people with disabilities to access day services and participate in the social, educational and economic life of their local communities.</p></reply>

When I initiated the review of policy on the use of cannabis and cannabis-based products for medicinal purposes I requested that the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) provide expert advice on the issue.  The HPRA&rsquo;s statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products and it has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to provide advice on this issue. </p>  <p>  I requested that the HPRA provide advice on recent developments in the use of cannabis for medical purposes including an overview of products that have been authorised in other countries and an overview of the wider on-going and emerging clinical research in new indications and evidence of efficacy.  The HPRA convened an expert working group as part of their review which comprised experts from various medical fields, including a Consultant Anaesthetist/Pain Specialist, a Consultant in Palliative Medicine and a Palliative Care Pharmacist.  </p>  <p>  On 10th February I published the HPRA&rsquo;s Report &ldquo;Cannabis for Medicinal Use &ndash; A Scientific Review&rdquo; and announced my decision to establish an access programme for cannabis-based treatments for the following conditions, spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis resistant to all standard therapies and interventions, intractable nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, despite the use of standard anti-emetic regimes and severe, refractory (treatment-resistant) epilepsy that has failed to respond to standard anticonvulsant medications.  Patients accessing cannabis through the programme will be under the care of a medical consultant.</p>  <p>  The HPRA Report did not recommend the inclusion of chronic pain in the access programme.  However, this position will be kept under review, and if better clinical evidence becomes available in future, the inclusion of chronic pain can be reconsidered.</p>  <p>  Until such time as the necessary legislative amendments have been made to facilitate the implementation of the access programme, it remains open for an Irish registered doctor to apply for a licence for such preparations for an individual, named-patient under their care. </p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependents.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they may face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from illness.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying  for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  </p>  <p>  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.  Assistance in completing the forms can be obtained from the nearest Local Health Office or by calling 1890 252 919.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that a priority within the 2017 HSE National Service Plan is to improve health outcomes for the most vulnerable in society including those with addiction issues, the homeless, refugees, asylum seekers, Traveller and Roma communities.  Within this priority it details an aim to improve health outcomes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, particularly those with addiction and mental health needs, by providing key worker, case management, general practitioner (GP) and nursing services.</p></reply>

An Interdepartmental Working Group, chaired by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, was established in early 2016.  This Group was to examine the issues arising from prevailing retirement ages for workers in both the public and private sectors, in the context of the increase in the State Pension age from 65 to 66 in 2014 and the scheduled further increases to the State Pension age in 2021 and 2028. </p><p>The Group, whose Report was agreed by Government last August, considered policy around retirement age in both the public and private sectors, examining implications arising from retirement ages now and in the future.  The Group identified a set of framework principles to underpin policy in the area and made a number of recommendations assigned to Government Departments and Employer bodies for follow-up in that regard. A copy of the Report is available online at</p><p>.</p><p>On foot of one of the recommendations of the Report, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with Public Service employers, was tasked to review the current statutory and operational considerations giving rise to barriers to extended participation in the public service workforce up to and including the current age of entitlement to the Contributory State Pension.  This review is currently underway and is expected to be completed by Q2 2017.</p><p>In relation to the specific matter of the recruitment and retention of nursing staff there are many initiatives currently underway to improve nursing and midwifery staffing levels throughout the country.  In September 2016 the HSE set up a Project Group to review nursing workforce planning, recruitment and retention.  The main objectives of this Project Group include identifying current recruitment black spots in a coordinated way and developing measures to incentivise and attract nurses to these essential posts.  The HSE is continually running open recruitment campaigns with no closing date to ensure that all eligible applicants for nursing posts can apply at any time to work in public hospitals around the country.  The number of nursing and midwifery staff increased by 1,650 whole time equivalents between December 2013 and December 2016, notwithstanding intense global competition for our nurses and midwives and the HSE is committed to increasing the number of permanent nursing and midwifery posts by over 1,200 in 2017.  </p><p>Given recruitment difficulties in psychiatric nursing special arrangements were introduced last summer to enable retiring nurses return to employment at the rate of pay at which they had retired, rather than the 1st point of the scale rule that generally applies across the public service. A similar arrangement for other nursing categories is under consideration at present, recognising that recruitment is an issue across categories.</p></reply>

The Government decision in 2012 to locate the hospital on St James&rsquo;s Hospital campus was made in the best interests of children from a clinical perspective.  St. James's has the broadest range of national specialties of all our acute hospitals, in addition to a strong and well-established research and education infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to enable the children&rsquo;s hospital achieve our vision of excellence in modern paediatric practice. </p><p>A major milestone was achieved in this long awaited, much needed project when An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission in April 2016 to build a state of the art hospital on a campus shared with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, together with two Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital.  The first phase of construction (site clearing works) on the site of the new children&rsquo;s hospital began in August 2016 and will be substantially completed within a matter of weeks.  Following decades of discussions and debates, Ireland is about to get the new children&rsquo;s hospital that it badly needs and deserves.  A world class design, with child-friendly, high spec, modern interiors and acres of outdoor space has been completed.  Hundreds of staff from the three children&rsquo;s hospitals continue to input into the fit out and internal design to ensure that the children, young people and their families can be treated in the best possible environment &ndash; helping to improve clinical outcomes as well as overall well-being and patient experience.  </p><p>The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was appointed in 2013 to design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital for children, young people and families in Ireland.  An internationally recognised design team supported by an experienced Board and Project Team are in place, have followed best international design, planning and procurement process at each stage of the project and are now in a position, subject to Government approval, to appoint a contractor to deliver this long awaited hospital.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital will open and provide services to children and young people in Ireland in 2021, and the Urgent Care Centres at Tallaght Hospital and Connolly Hospital will open on a phased basis from 2018.</p><p><b></b>The Project Team, during the design, planning and tendering phases, has constantly monitored the external environment &ndash; tracking construction inflation and market costs.  The cost estimate for the core construction elements of the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals was prepared in early 2014.  This estimate, prepared at a time when annual construction inflation predicted at 3% per annum, was &euro;650m.</p><p>The recently concluded tendering process for the main construction works determined the actual market cost of the construction elements of the project.  Due to annual construction inflation rising from 3% in 2013 to more than 9% in 2017 and the lengthened project timeline in the planning, design and procurement process, the cost of the core construction of the hospital and Paediatric Outpatients and Urgent Care Centres has increased from the original estimate.  The increase reflects the increasing volume of activity in the Irish construction industry which is having a significant impact on construction inflation.  However, I understand that the final construction elements of the project compare favourably to the costs of international projects of a similar size and scale. </p><p>The NPHDB and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group Board continue to work closely with the HSE and the Department of Health to deliver this much-needed world-class hospital.  My priority, as I have stated before, is to make progress on the new hospital as soon as possible so we can ensure children, young people and their families have the facilities they need and deserve.</p></reply>

Last year saw the launch of the first Action Plan for Education by the Department of Education.  This included a section on Mental Health and Wellbeing.  The aims in this section were to roll out a national programme to support the implementation of Well-being Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools; to implement Well-being at Junior Cycle; and to publish the 2015 Lifeskills survey, providing information on how schools cater for the well-being of their students.  This plan outlines hundreds of actions and sub-actions to be implemented across 2016-2019, with timelines and lead responsibility assigned.  I will be working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education on this issue to ensure these actions are implemented. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health and the Department of Education have a strong history of working together to support youth mental health.  In 2013, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, and the Department of Health jointly developed Well-Being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention.  This was followed in 2015 by the publication of Guidelines setting out a framework for mental health promotion in primary schools.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, the Government launched Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide with the aim of reducing suicide and self-harm over 2015-2020.  The Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  It will provide community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention. </p>  <p>  One of the main goals in Connecting for Life is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups, including young people.  Several key actions have been identified to further this goal in the Education sector, including:</p>  <p>  - Support the implementation of the relevant guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention across primary and post-primary schools;</p>  <p>  - Guide and encourage the implementation of the relevant policies and plans in schools, including support for Student Support Teams and for critical incident management;</p>  <p>  - Work with the HSE to develop national guidance for higher education institutions in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response;</p>  <p>  - Implement the National Anti-bullying Action Plan including online and homophobic bullying;</p>  <p>  - Support all junior and senior schools to implement a new Wellbeing programme; and</p>  <p>  - Deliver early intervention and psychological support service for young people at primary care level. </p>  <p>  These actions are part of the overall policy objectives of the Department of Education and Skills.  They are supported by my Department and the HSE through the inter-agency implementation arrangements provided for in Connecting for Life and overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria:</p>  <p>  1. the health needs of the public;</p>  <p>  2. the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p>  <p>  3. the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement;</p>  <p>  4. the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p>  <p>  5. the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p>  <p>  6. the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p>  <p>  7. the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p>  <p>  8. the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and</p>  <p>  9. the resources available to the HSE. </p>  <p>  I am informed that, following a request from the HSE, the NCPE carried out an assessment of the manufacturer's economic dossier submitted in March 2016 on the cost effectiveness of Orkambi.  This dossier included details on all relevant costs and relevant cost offsets including those associated with hospitalisation, disease management costs, intravenous antibiotics, adverse events and any additional costs arising in patients not taking Orkambi.</p>  <p>  The NCPE has completed its Health Technology Assessment and this is available on its website. It was submitted to the HSE in June 2016.  The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis.  In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. </p>  <p>  The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.  A meeting was held in December and again in early January.  Following completion of the negotiation process, I am advised that the HSE&rsquo;s Drugs Committee met at the end of January and considered the manufacturer's latest price offerings.  The matter is currently under consideration by the HSE Directorate, in accordance with the criteria set out in the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

The development of a regulatory and funding model for homecare services is a complex undertaking involving very significant legislative, operational and financial resources.</p>  <p>  A significant amount of detailed preparation needs to be done before final decisions are taken on the form of a home care scheme and the regulation of these services.  In 2016 the Department commissioned the Health Research Board to carry out an evidence review of international approaches to the regulation and financing of home care services.  This will be published shortly.  The Department will also undertake a mapping exercise of current service provision nationally, taking into account the scale and diversity of services funded by the HSE.  This work will be used to identify major policy options for a new  homecare scheme-around the areas of regulation, financing, assessment and eligibility.</p>  <p>  Once this is complete a public consultation will be launched to allow stakeholders, including older people themselves, their families and healthcare workers to express their views regarding a new homecare scheme.  It is my hope and intention at this stage that this consultation on this important issue can be launched in May of this year.</p></reply>

Indeed, in the last 12 months alone we have launched the National Maternity Strategy, the HSE National Standards for Bereavement Care following Pregnancy Loss and Perinatal Death and the HIQA National Standards for Safe Better Maternity Services.  In addition, each of our 19 maternity hospitals/units is now publishing Maternity Patient Safety Statements on a monthly basis.  Such initiatives represent essential building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service.</p>  <p>  I share the Deputy's desire for robust maternity service governance structures, and to this end a National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme (NWIHP) has been established within the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecological and neonatal services.  The Programme will ensure the consistent delivery of high quality care in these services and oversee the development of Maternity Networks.  The Maternity Strategy provides that all development funding for maternity services will be ring-fenced and allocated through the NWIHP.  Thus the Programme will facilitate greater oversight and support for service providers and ensure the appropriate allocation and targeting of new resources.  It is expected that the establishment of Maternity Networks across Hospital Groups will assist in the development of a sustainable service model that ensures that all women within each Hospital Group can access a full range of maternity-related services. </p>  <p>  The Strategy will be implemented on an incremental basis, and work in this regard is ongoing.  &euro;3 million development funding provided for maternity services in 2016 was allocated in line with the Strategy and included funding for additional staff, including 100 midwives, the development of specialist bereavement teams and for the implementation of the Maternal and Newborn Clinical Management System.  Increased funding of &euro;6.8m will be provided for maternity services in 2017 which will provide for the continued implementation of the Strategy.  My Department has asked the NWIHP to develop and submit a detailed Implementation Plan as a priority.  </p></reply>

The Government is focused on protecting and advancing Ireland's interests before, during and after the negotiations.  Our priorities are clear; minimising the impact on trade and the economy, protecting the Northern Ireland Peace Process, maintaining the Common Travel Area, and influencing the future of the European Union.  A critical part of our work is in ensuring that our priorities are heard and understood across Europe, therefore engagement with our EU partners and with the EU institutions is critical.  A programme of intense engagement at political and official level is continuing to ensure that the EU&rsquo;s position for the forthcoming negotiations reflects our priorities.  The Taoiseach has stated that we will make a strong case at EU level that Ireland will require support that recognises where Brexit represents a serious disturbance to the Irish economy.  Accordingly, our preparations for Brexit include detailed engagement with the European Commission, where we have made them aware that Brexit is already having an impact on the Irish economy, and of the disproportionate consequences posed by Brexit to the Irish economy overall in comparison to other Member States.  </p>  <p>  The Department of Health has and will continue to access a range of EU funding and will seek to maximise opportunities in this context.  The Department of Health is the Accountable Department for the health theme of the cross border INTERREG V Programme, which is managed by the Special EU Programme&rsquo;s Body (SEUPB). The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility at central level for the INTERREG and PEACE programmes and the SEUPB is an agency under its remit.  These cross border Programmes are 85% funded by the EU.  I am pleased to note that following intensive discussions by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with the Department of Finance in Northern Ireland and the Welsh European Funding Office, agreement was reached at the end of October on a safeguard clause that has enabled funding agreements to be put in place and Letters of Offer to issue to programme beneficiaries for both PEACE and the two INTERREG Programmes including the INTERREG V Programme.  Now that the short term objective has been achieved, the medium term objective is to ensure the full and successful implementation of the programmes to 2020, during a period in which the UK may leave the EU and the UK allocation of European Regional Development Fund funding may no longer be available.  The long term objective is to secure agreement to successor programmes post-2020 in the context of not just Brexit but also the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF).    </p>  <p>  In addition, European Investment Bank (EIB) funding is being provided to a Public Private Partnership (PPP) project to develop Primary Care Centres, in the form of an EIB loan taken out by the PPP company.</p>  <p>  A range of supports are also being provided in the field of eHealth. These include support for the development of an eHealth architecture through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) that supports trans-European networks and infrastructures.  Ireland was also successful in its recent application for CEF funding for ePrescribing and Summary Care Records. </p>  <p>  My Department and/or its agencies are also involved in a number of European collaborative initiatives in the area of health such as Joint Actions and Joint Programming Initiatives and in the Horizon 2020 EU Research and Innovation Programme.  EU funding and collaboration will become more important in view of Brexit and these issues will continue to be examined and pursued by my Department, including through centrally coordinated structures such as the Interdepartmental Group on Brexit and its workgroup on EU programmes.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding this, the amount of CAP funding per Member State is fixed until 2020 under Regulations of the Council and European Parliament.  Any changes to the current figures will require a co-decided amendment of those Regulations.</p>  <p>  The CAP accounts for some 37% of the EU budget, and there has been ongoing pressure from some Member States to reduce this proportion and to divert EU spending to newer policy issues such as migration, external action and development cooperation. The size and distribution of the future CAP budget will be determined as part of the process for agreeing the next EU multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the post 2020 period, discussions on which are due to commence later this year. One of the key challenges we see is maintaining a strong CAP budget in the post 2020 period.</p>  <p>  The future of CAP is an issue of enormous importance for the agriculture sector in Ireland and across Europe. The CAP has evolved considerably and very effectively in recent years, in response to changing market, consumer and environmental demands.  It also plays a central role in delivering the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth sought under the Europe 2020 strategy.</p>  <p>  It is important that the CAP continues to evolve in a way that supports the achievement of European priorities, particularly in the context of securing a strong CAP budget for the post 2020 period.  This can only be achieved by reinforcing the relevance and effectiveness of the policy in helping to achieve broader societal goals.  This is something that I strongly believe in and will actively pursue at Council level as the debate on the future CAP and its budget intensifies over the coming months.</p></reply>

There is also the risk to the health and safety of staff from the fire services and other volunteers when they attempt to bring the fires under control. </p>  <p>  As a result of significant fire damage to forestry plantations some years ago, the Forest Service of my Department has overseen a number of initiatives in efforts to educate farmers and land owners of the legality and the risks of burning vegetation, while alerting forest owners and managers to the dangers. </p>  <p>  A code of practice for safe, legal burning was developed and published by my Department. As well as the production of the Code, a number of training courses, seminars and demonstration events have taken place, in conjunction with local farming associations, Garda&iacute;, Emergency Services and Local Authorities.</p>  <p>  The Forest Service also issues Forest Fire Risk Warnings periodically during the main wildfire risk season from February through to July. These warnings provide forest owners and managers with advance warning of high risk weather conditions, alerting them to the need for extra vigilance and allowing them to take appropriate readiness and mitigation measures in advance of fire outbreaks.</p>  <p>  In 2016, in advance of a high risk period, my Department sent a text message to all hill farmers who had registered for the Department's text messaging service, warning them of the danger of starting fires on their land.  </p>  <p>  The Helpsheet and Terms and Conditions booklet for the Basic Payment Scheme and other area-based schemes, which issues to approximately 130,000 farmers annually, contains a section detailing the requirements for and the dangers of burning vegetation.</p>  <p>  The burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts. It is an offence under Section 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 (amended by Section 46 of the Wildlife Act, 2000) to burn, from 1st March to 31st August in any year, any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated. Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS).</p>  <p>  Applicants under the Basic Payment Scheme and other area-based schemes are obliged to comply with Cross Compliance which includes requirements in relation to the burning of vegetation.

In animal welfare terms there are no specific regulations concerning &ldquo;exotic animals&rdquo;. The conditions under which they are kept and managed comes under the scope of the sections 11 and 12 of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which contain the rules relating to the welfare of all animals and require a person having an animal under his or her control to safeguard and not endanger it's health and welfare.  </p><p>A number of EU Directives and regulations address trade in, and imports to the EU of common domestic species such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, poultry and domestic dogs and cats. Trade in and imports to the EU of certain 'other' live animals are provided for under EU Council Directive 92/65/EEC (the &ldquo;Balai Directive&rdquo;). This Directive includes certain categories of hoofed animals (e.g. llamas, alpacas, giraffe, antelope), cats and dogs and ferrets (for commercial imports only) and certain carnivorous species (e.g. mink and foxes, big cat species), bees, apes, rabbits and hares, and birds other than poultry. The Balai Directive harmonised the rules for trade within and imports into the EU of the species within its scope and established the animal health guarantees needed for the trade in these animals between EU Member States. </p><p>The Directive also sets out special provisions for the registration and authorisation of Bodies, Institutes or Centres engaged in the intra-Community movement of animals falling within the scope of this legislation such as zoos. </p><p>TRACES (TRAde Control and Expert System) is the online management tool for all EU Member States on intra-EU trade and importation of animals, semen and embryo, food, feed and plants. It therefore serves as a record of movements of animals between EU Member States.</p><p>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) regulates international trade in close to 35,000 species of plants and animals, including their parts and derivatives, ensuring their survival in the wild with benefits for the livelihoods of local people and the global environment. The CITES permit system seeks to ensure that international trade in listed species is sustainable, legal and traceable. </p><p>The Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is the Cites Management Authority for Ireland and submits an annual report to the CITES Secretariat containing all Imports and Exports of CITES listed specimens. This can be found on <i>www.cites.org</i>.  Under the terms of the EU Wildlife Trade Regulations, no CITES Import/Export Permit is required for the movement of a CITES listed specimen within the EU. A CITES import permit is required from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and a CITES export permit is required from the country of origin, should the CITES specimens come from outside the EU.</p></reply>

I am advised that the practice of pair trawling in inshore waters and estuaries around Ireland is confined to fishing for sprat.  The Irish Wildlife Trust also identifies sprat as the target species for this activity.</p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation.  The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock.  In order to address that paucity of accurate information in respect of sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry, began in October 2014 under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</p>  <p>  Through the Birds and Habitats Directive, among other instruments, Ireland is committed to ensuring the conservation of biodiversity of the sea birds and mammals around our coast.  Regarding fish by-catch in sprat fisheries, I am advised that the most likely by-catch is of herring but that catches of juvenile mackerel cannot be ruled out.  It should be noted that by-catch is a feature of a number of the fisheries around our coast given the mixed nature of many of our stocks.  All catches of quota species are  logged and landed and taken in to account by ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) when providing stock advice.</p>  <p>  The Marine Institute are working on adding sprat to the species covered under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Marine Biodiversity Scheme in 2017.  This would allow for more intensive data collection to enhance scientific knowledge and underpin any future  management actions for the stock.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have asked the Marine Institute to work in conjunction with the National Parks and Wildlife Service to consider how we can improve our knowledge, through observer programmes, of the possible impacts of these fisheries on by-catch of other fish, sea birds and mammals.</p></reply>

One of my priorities has been to address the impact of the change in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices in some sectors, which have caused cash flow difficulties for farmers.  The Scheme, which was developed in co-operation with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), makes &euro;150 million available to farmers throughout Ireland at interest rates of 2.95%.</p>  <p>  Distributed through AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank, the Scheme provides farmers with a low cost, flexible source of working capital and will allow them to pay down more expensive forms of short-term debt, ensuring the ongoing financial sustainability of viable farming enterprises.  Loans are for amounts up to &euro;150,000 for up to six years.  The loans are flexible with interest only facilities of up to three years.  However, normal lending criteria apply and the terms and conditions of each individual loan is agreed between the financial institutions and the applicants according to their individual circumstances.  Further details on the application process are available from local branches of the participating banks or from their websites.</p></reply>

I note also the concerns expressed in relation to both the short-term impacts of Brexit arising from the decline in the value of Sterling, and in relation to the medium- and long-term implications.  These concerns echo in large part those expressed by other sectors of the agri-food industry, and are also consistent with those that I and my Department have been highlighting as priorities from an Irish perspective.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of the range of measures that I have already implemented in the context of Budget 2017 to help deal with exchange rate difficulties, including additional funding for Bord Bia and BIM, agri-taxation measures, increased funding under the Rural Development Programme and Seafood Development Programme, and the new &euro;150m low-cost loan scheme.  On the longer-term implications, my Department continues to deepen its analysis, to consult with the sector and to engage with other EU Member States and the European Commission, with a view to ensuring that agri-food concerns are adequately reflected in the negotiations.</p></reply>

The scheme will carry out regulatory functions on behalf of its members.  All operators will be obliged to provide data on the numbers of tyres coming on and off the market.  This will be the first time that there will be clarity in this regard.  It will be mandatory for anyone placing tyres on the market in Ireland to join the compliance scheme.</p>  <p>  The vEMC for car tyres has been set at &euro;2.80 per tyre.  There is currently insufficient market data to enable me to set the vEMC for agricultural tyres.  However, this will not delay the establishment of the scheme.  The vEMC for agricultural tyres will be set at zero in the new regulations.  Producers of agricultural tyres will still have reporting obligations and the collection of this data will inform my decision on the level of fee to be set at a future date.  I am awaiting a recommendation from the Tyres Working Group before I further consider what level of vEMC I will set for truck tyres.</p>  <p>  I met with tyre industry representatives.  I listened to their concerns and I have done my best to address as many of them as possible.  Tyres will be a priority area for enforcement in 2017 for the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities and I will be asking them to give particular attention to the border regions.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint.</p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:</p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The company referred to by the Deputy is in the Blue area that will be served by commercial operators. </p><p>Approximately 71,000 of the circa 133,000 premises in County Galway are located in the BLUE area  and will be served by commercial operators while the remaining 62,000 premises represent the target areas for the State Intervention.</p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>My Department is actively monitoring commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all households and businesses can get access to the services.  My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.  This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. </p><p>I should add, however, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is primarily a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.  The specific query on timelines for upgrade of commercial broadband services to specific premises is best targeted at the service provider.  </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p></reply>

Prior to the Eircode launch approximately 80 million public sector database records were encoded with Eircodes, costing &euro;11.5m (VAT inclusive).</p>  <p>  Public sector bodies have used their regular on-going ICT software upgrades to incorporate Eircodes as part of other changes to their systems.  Therefore, public sector bodies with large number of complex ICT systems have implemented Eircodes on an incremental basis as systems come up for change or renewal.  This has resulted in no significant cost to those bodies.  </p>  <p>  Staff in my Department when communicating with households include Eircode on outgoing mail, on department publications, application forms, headed paper, e-mail signatures, complementary slips and on the website.  In all correspondence with the Department, staff request and use Eircodes.  My Department continues to identify opportunities to realise the benefits integrating Eircodes will bring within the various areas of the Department and agencies under our aegis.</p>  <p>  Eircodes are being used by the large public sector bodies, including, Revenue, Department of Social Protection, Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, and the Health Service Executive.  Many other state bodies and agencies that have interaction with the public have also incorporated the Eircode into their systems.  These include the Department Transport, Tourism &amp;amp; Sport; Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Local Government Management Agency; Central Statistics Office; Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills; Residential Tenancies Board; Companies Registration Office; Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland; Ordnance Survey Ireland; An Post; National Treasury Management Agency; Electric Ireland and ESB Networks. </p>  <p>  Some examples of how the Eircode has been successfully implemented in public sector bodies are described below:  </p>  <p>  - National Ambulance Service (NAS) have integrated Eircodes into their Computer Aided Dispatch system (CAD).  This means that the patient&rsquo;s address and the position of the nearest available ambulance can be accurately pinpointed on a digital map, enabling an ambulance to be quickly and accurately routed to someone in need of medical help.  This is of particular benefit to rural Ireland with 35% non-unique addresses which caused significant operational challenges in the past;</p>  <p>  - Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) has integrated Eircodes into its educational grants award system which assists students apply for the correct rate of grant; </p>  <p>  - Central Statistics Office (CSO) utilises Eircode as part of their core data and launched the new Residential Property Price Index covering all market purchases of houses and apartments, including in rural Ireland.  Eircodes provide the necessary addition of better quality location information, allowing the register measure prices with greater accuracy by using the Eircode Routing Key;</p>  <p>  - National Broadband Plan. Currently Eircodes are in use on the Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map 2020.  Users simply enter the Eircode of the residential or commercial premises and the map indicates whether the premises falls within the Blue area that is being served by commercial operators or within the Amber area which will be covered by the State intervention; </p>  <p>  - National Transport Authority (NTA) has incorporated Eircodes within the National Journey Planner app for use by the public.  The app provides journey planning, timetable and travel information from all licensed public transport providers across Ireland; </p>  <p>  - Waterford City and County Council have incorporated the Eircode into customer management systems, used by members of the public to report incidents to the Council; and </p>  <p>  - The HSE have incorporated Eircodes into the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) system.  The IHI system is a key enabler for the Governments eHealth strategy. </p>  <p>  Increasing numbers of the public are looking-up Eircodes on the free to use Eircode Finder website, which remains very popular, with just under 10m searches since the finder went live at launch.  In addition, Capita provide regular updates to Google who have now integrated Eircodes within Google Maps.</p>  <p>  Capita have run a number of national advertising campaigns on television, radio and online to raise public awareness of using Eircodes for deliveries and during emergency situations.  Capita will continue to promote and market the use of Eircodes in the coming year to increase uptake and usage of the Eircode system among members of the public and businesses.</p></reply>

This will provide the initial stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention and it is expected that further funding will be available over the lifetime of any contract(s).  Funding of &euro;75m is committed through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); State expenditure of &euro;150m is required before the &euro;75m under the European Regional Development Fund can be drawn down.</p>  <p>  In the energy sector the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, which provides free energy efficiency upgrades to the homes of people in energy poverty, is already co-funded under the ERDF.  My Department continues to explore, along with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, the other European funding opportunities that may potentially support the development of energy efficiency incentive schemes in Ireland.</p>  <p>  My Department promotes and facilitates the administration of the EU LIFE Programme in Ireland.  In addition to traditional projects proposed by relevant bodies (Small and Medium Enterprises, Non-Government Organisations), the Department proposes, in the current 2014-2020 round of the Programme, to mobilise an integrated (State-sponsored) project on climate action.</p>  <p>  The Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI), which comes under the remit of my Department, receives EU funds principally through project participation, where the UK may or may not be a partner and may or may not be critical to the projects.  The GSI also participate in specific InterReg Projects where only Ireland, UK, Northern IrelandI Scotland and/or Wales are specific partners.  The GSI have just commenced an InterReg Ireland Wales Project CHERISH (Climate Heritage &amp;amp; Environments of Reefs, Islands &amp;amp; Headlands) mapping and recording onshore and offshore heritage in the context of potential Climate Change effects.  The project has a total grant value of just over &euro;4.1m, with about &euro;1.3m coming to the GSI over the period 2017-2021.  Funding from the UK side has been assured in the event of any Brexit changes and the GSI continue to deal with the InterReg funding bodies.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  Maintenance of private laneways/roads not taken in charge by local authorities is the responsibility of the landowners concerned.  Due to the major cutbacks in roads funding it was necessary for the Department to cease making separate allocations to local authorities in respect of LIS.  The approved scheme remains intact and local authorities can use a proportion of State grant funding for LIS should they wish to do so.  While there is a modest increase in funding for roads this year, it will take some years yet under the Capital Plan to restore "steady state" funding levels for regional and local roads.  The primary focus has to continue to be on the maintenance and renewal of public roads.  Local authorities can continue to use a proportion of their Discretionary Grant for the Local Improvement Scheme in 2017.</p>  <p>  In light of the provision in the Programme for Government indicating that, as the economy recovers, the Government will promote increased funding for Community Involvement and Local Improvement Schemes, I will review the scope for making a separate grant allocation once the planned Review of the Capital Plan is completed.</p></reply>

Within its annual budget the planning, design and implementation of individual road projects, such as the Ardee Bypass is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland under the Roads Acts 1993-2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.  As indicated previously to the Deputy,  the Ardee Bypass was not included in the Capital Plan published in September 2015.  Decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department&rsquo;s Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority over the next period and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already underway.  In this context the Ardee bypass was one of a range of projects that it was not possible to include given the overall funding envelope available.  As regards the possibility of additional funding within the Plan period, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is now commencing the Capital Plan review and has indicated that the additional capital funding for allocation totals &euro;2.6billion.  While there is a strong case for additional funding for the transport sector, there are a multitude of possible national, regional and local projects around the country, the cost of which far exceed available funding and unfortunately, this means that only a limited number can be considered for funding.</p></reply>

On this basis, we have exchange of driving licences with other EU Member States.  In the case of non-EU States, we may reach bilateral agreements on driver licence exchange.  Reaching bilateral agreements is not a simple matter.  It requires the relevant authorities in both jurisdictions to compare the two licensing regimes in detail, in order for each side to be satisfied that the standards of the two systems are compatible.  On the Irish side, this task is undertaken by the Road Safety Authority (RSA).  For some time now, the RSA has been working with the Canadian authorities with a view to mutual recognition of driving licences.  However, as Canada operates driver licensing at provincial rather than national level, we must reach agreements with each individual province.  To date, agreements are in place with three of the ten provinces - Manitoba, Newfoundland &amp;amp; Labrador, and Ontario.</p>  <p>  The RSA is working to reach agreement with the remaining provinces.  I understand that it is likely that the next such agreement will be with British Columbia, but that it is not possible at this stage to give a precise date for when this will happen.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the local authority's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  While notification of the flooding damage in Cahersiveen, including the culvert on the Killoe Road, was received from Kerry County Council in October 2016, all available funding under the Severe Weather Grant made available to local authorities last year on the basis of additional funding sanctioned by Government had been allocated by then and no separate allocation could be made.  Kerry County Council had to  prioritise the works that could be completed within their Severe Weather grant and it is understood that the Council did undertake some remedial works in the Caherciveen area but not on this particular culvert.  This project would need to be addressed within the normal allocations made available to the Council or the Council's own resources as all available grant funding for 2017 has now been allocated.</p>  <p>  In this context my Department  allocates funding to Local Authorities under a Bridge Rehabilitation Grant Programme.  Under this programme local authorities submit a list of bridges in order of priority for consideration for funding.  Kerry County Council were allocated &euro;237,637 under this programme in 2017 but the Council did not submit an application for reconstruction of the culvert at Killoe Road.</p></reply>

In preparing its Transport Strategy, the NTA is required to have regard to a number of matters, including the National Spatial Strategy and local authority development plans.  The Act also specifically requires the NTA to ensure the Strategy is consistent with the GDA's regional, spatial and economic strategy, including any relevant regional planning guidelines.  The Strategy itself is subject to update and review every six years and at each review point, adjustments can be made to reflect relevant prevailing circumstances.  Both my Department and the NTA have been involved in the process of the development of the new NPF and this input will continue over the coming months in finalising the work.  The Transport Strategy states its purpose as establishing &quot;the framework for transport provision necessary to achieve the land use vision set out in the Regional Planning Guidelines&quot;.  That land use vision is the statutory responsibility of relevant local authorities, the regional assembly and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government at national policy level.  The crucial link between the GDA transport strategy and the forthcoming NPF will arise at regional level.  There is much to be done therefore before the impact on the Transport Strategy can be assessed.</p><p>I should also point out in the context of this work that the Issues and Choices paper recently published as part of the public consultation for the NPF- <i>Ireland 2040: Our Plan</i>makes reference to the unique statutory relationship between the GDA regional spatial and economic strategy and the GDA Transport Strategy.  The paper notes that an extension to other parts of the country of the approach that already exists in the GDA would greatly strengthen the levels of integration between land use planning and transport planning across the country.</p></reply>

However, the NCPF has been integrated into the Development Plans of the majority of local authorities so ensuring that the objectives and policies to support and promote cycling are taken account of in current and future planning.  In addition, the National Transport Authority (NTA) published the GDA Cycle Network Plan covering the seven local authority areas in the Greater Dublin Area in 2013. </p>  <p>  While a formal review of the framework has yet to be undertaken, I think that the success of the framework can be seen in the significant increase in the numbers of people cycling numbers shown in the Dublin City Canal Cordon Report for 2016 published last week by Dublin City Council and the NTA.  This showed that over 12,000 people cycled into Dublin's centre in November last year in the morning peak, nearly the same number as used the LUAS during the morning peak commuting hours.  It must be remembered that this figure does not include the numbers using Dublin Bikes between the canals.</p>  <p>  In 2013 and 2015 my Department requested local authorities and other stakeholders for an update on progress on implementation.  The Department now intends to undertake a full review of the framework and we will be pursuing this during 2017.</p></reply>

The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) forms one component of the wider European Structural and Investment (ESI) Fund.  Within Ireland the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform has overall responsibility for EU Cohesion Policy and primary responsibility for the ERDF.  Two agencies under the aegis of my Department (Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland) are key contributors to two Operational Programmes (OPs) to implement the strategic priorities set out in our Partnership Agreements with the European Commission.  These OPs are co-funded by the ERDF under the auspices of the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform - one for the Southern region and one for the Northern and Western region.  </p>  <p>  The focus of these programmes is on jobs and growth; combatting unemployment and social exclusion; promoting research, technological development and innovation (RTDI) and information and communications technology investment and the competitiveness of the business sector; and promoting an environmentally friendly and resource-efficient economy.</p>  <p>   The total programmed expenditure for the ERDF operational programmes will be &euro;818 million, with an ERDF contribution of 50%, i.e. &euro;409 million.  My own Department has responsibility for &euro;406.2 million (&euro;177m from SFI and &euro;229.2m from EI) of this programmed expenditure with a return of &euro;203.1 million.  Total programme expenditure is broken down as follows:</p>  <p>  Southern &amp;amp; Eastern NUTS II Region - total expenditure of &euro;498 million (ERDF contribution of &euro;249 million); and </p>  <p>  BMW NUTS II Region &ndash; total expenditure of &euro;320 million (ERDF contribution of &euro;160 million).  </p>  <p>  The current ESI phase which is scheduled to run between 2014 and 2020 has been agreed with the Commission and is not open to amendment.  No additional funding mechanisms under the ESI are anticipated during this period.  </p>  <p>  The activities of the Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are funded through the Irish Exchequer, and up to 50% co-funded by the EU European Regional Development Fund on a retrospective basis.  </p>  <p>  As set out in the Action Plan for Jobs 2017, the LEOs will be focused on supporting companies in navigating the challenges presented by Brexit, including:  </p>  <p>- Technical assistance support for exporting microenterprises;</p>  <p>- Roll out of a national Lean for Micro initiative to drive firm level competitiveness;</p>  <p>- Targeted mentoring and training initiatives; and </p>  <p>- Local level awareness raising and information sharing.</p>  <p>  The EU Programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (COSME) runs from 2014 to 2020, with an overall budget of &euro;2.3bn.</p>  <p>  COSME's objective includes facilitating access to finance for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) and to increase the sustainable competitiveness of EU companies and help small businesses operate outside their home countries.  It is also hoped that COSME will create an environment which is favourable to business creation and growth, and encourage an entrepreneurial culture in Europe.</p>  <p>  One of the means by which this objective can be achieved is through the use of EU financial instruments, which are a key component of the COSME programme.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), which comes under the remit of the Department of Finance has recently signed the first COSME agreement in Ireland with the European Investment Fund.  This transaction is guaranteed by the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), the heart of the investment plan for Europe.  This agreement will allow SBCI to support &euro;100m of loans to SMEs in Ireland over the next three years and support attractive loans to around 2,000 SMEs through risk sharing initiatives.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently working with the SBCI utilising the terms of the Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Act 2016 to see if there are other mechanisms by which we can leverage additional EIB/EIF funds through risk sharing instruments.  I am confident that this work will lead to the development of additional products to facilitate the flow of credit to Irish SMEs.  In addition, Microfinance Ireland benefits from a guarantee funded by the European Union under the Programme for Employment and Social Inclusion (EASI) Programme.</p>  <p>  My Department is actively involved with our Northern Ireland counterpart in the Research and Innovation strand of the EU's INTERREG VA Programme, a cross border initiative which will benefit colleges and companies in Ireland, Northern Ireland and, in some cases, Western Scotland.  The two Departments contribute the 'match funding' required, i.e. 15% of the total, with the EU contributing 85%.  Arrangements have been put in place which will ensure that this programme can continue despite the closure date of 2023 being after the likely date at which the UK will leave the EU.  The overall financial envelope for the full  programme (the total EU allocation for this Research and  Innovation strand is &euro;60m), was settled by the EU quite some time ago, being part of their wider Territorial Cooperation initiative, so the level of funding for this programme cannot be increased at this stage. </p></reply>

I wish to assure the Deputy that at present schools in receipt of the grant will continue to do so, up to September 2017.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by Tusla that the School Counselling Grants scheme, was established in 1994, to provide counselling support for children affected by bereavement or loss.  In 2011 this scheme was closed to new entrants while under the remit of the Family Support Agency.  The scheme came under the remit of Tusla upon its establishment in 2014. </p>  <p>  Tusla has informed me that the School Completion Projects have until April to complete the Annual Retention Plan for the School Completion Programme.  This provides an opportunity, within the return, for the Projects to inform Tusla of its counselling needs.</p>  <p>  Tusla recognises the necessity for bereavement and loss counselling in schools and those schools in receipt of funding under the School Completion Programme may utilise up to &euro;5,000 of this funding for such services.  In addition Tusla provides child counselling through the Agency&rsquo;s Family Support Services funding.  In 2016 funding for child counselling was increased under this scheme by &euro;154,000 to &euro;680,000.  In particular child counselling funding to approximately 70 Family Resource Centres around Ireland was increased to &euro;242,000. </p>  <p>  Tusla is the main funder of Barnardos Children&rsquo;s Bereavement Service, which works to support children and families coping with bereavement.  Funding of &euro;154,600 was provided to this service in 2016.  The Agency is also committed to the funding of Rainbows Ireland, which provides group based support to children dealing with loss following parental separation/divorce or a death.  The Rainbows programme is currently delivered in over 250 schools and community based centres around the country.  Funding in 2016 was increased by &euro;15,000 to &euro;250,000 annually.  Together with the Irish Hospice Foundation Tusla co-funds the Irish Childhood Bereavement Network, which works to improve awareness and support of bereaved children.  It provides information on how to support bereaved children targeted at professionals, teachers, schools and families.  Tusla provided &euro;35,000 in funding to this initiative in 2016.</p></reply>

Because childcare costs to parents in Ireland are one of the highest in the OECD, we need to address affordability and quality at the same time.  My Department is not an employer of childcare workers but it is a significant funder of childcare services.  I am very conscious that there is an issue with regard to the pay and conditions of workers in the sector and my Department is engaging with the early years sector to explore how this can be addressed in the short, medium and long term. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government commits to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing quality childcare.  This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme, and we are progressing this work in that context.  The review will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.</p>  <p>  I am pleased that the last two budgets delivered a 35% increase each year in funding for childcare.  In Budget 2017, this amounted to an increase of &euro;121.5m for Early Years, increasing investment from &euro;345m per annum to &euro;466.5m.  This represents an additional &euro;86m for the full year 2017 costs of the extension of ECCE, the further roll out of the Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) within ECCE and, &euro;35.5 for further measures to address affordability and quality.  For the first time, total early years spending (including spending on infant classes in primary schools) will now exceed &euro;1 billion per year.  We need to continue to invest and I will be arguing for further increase in funding in Budget 2018. </p>  <p>  To go some way towards addressing cost pressures faced by providers in the sector, I have secured &euro;10m to enable providers to be paid for non-contact time, where they will have no children present and they will be able to pay staff to concentrate on administrative workload.  Services themselves can decide how to use the payment when it is received.  For the average ECCE service with 25 children, this will mean an additional annual payment of approximately &euro;2,400 per annum.  We are also giving additional funding to CCS and TEC providers on a pro-rata basis to acknowledge their administrative burden. </p>  <p>  The Affordable Childcare Scheme, when introduced, will replace CCS and TEC and will have recognition of non-contact time built into its cost base.  In addition, I made provision under Budget 2017 for a fund of &euro;1m to assist in the investigation of sustainability issues being faced by childcare providers, and to develop a policy to guide any future interventions. </p>  <p>I want to reiterate my respect for childcare professionals, and I am committed to addressing these issues effectively.  As the Deputy may know, I established the Early Years Forum shortly after my appointment, and my Department and I will continue to engage with the sector on these important matters.  The next meeting of the Forum is scheduled to take place on March 6th, 2017.</p></reply>

In the main, these emergency situations arise out of hours.</p>  <p>  Out-of-Hours Services are provided outside of normal office hours including Saturdays, Sundays and Bank holidays.  These services can be contacted directly by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, hospital staff or other professionals who have a concern regarding the safety and welfare of a child outside of normal office hours.  Where a young person is referred, or self refers, out of office hours and  are out of home and seeking accommodation, an initial social work assessment is carried out to ensure the safety and welfare of the young person.  Where a young person who is out of home, and requires accommodation for the night, there are a number of placement options available suited to the child's age and vulnerability.  An emergency placement may be provided until the next working day when the case can be referred to the local Tusla Social Work Department. Out-of-Hours services are currently provided to all areas of the country under the following arrangements:  </p>  <p>  - The Crisis Intervention Service (CIS) provides an Out-of-Hours emergency social work service to young people aged 0 -18 years who are in crisis and reside in Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow. </p>  <p>  - The Cork Out-of-Hours Service provides an emergency social work service to young people aged 0 -18 years in crisis who reside in the Cork North Lee and Cork South Lee areas. </p>  <p>  - The Emergency Out-of-Hours Social Work Service covers areas outside of Counties Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Cork city. This service allows An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to contact a national emergency social work out-of-hours phone service for general advice or consultation.  This on call service is staffed by social workers operating from the out-of-hours service in Dublin, supported by on-call social workers in different parts of the country. The social workers providing this service are employed by Tusla. </p>  <p>  In 2017, Tusla plans to coordinate the three existing out-of-hours services into a national service.</p>  <p>  The aim of Out-of-Hours Social Work Services is to ensure that the disruption and upset to which children may be exposed in emergency situations is minimised and the rights of parents and guardians are respected.</p></reply>

The scheme is designed with the specific aim of equipping participants with life and other marketable and certifiable skills which will assist them both in their capacity to participate fully in society as well as their ability to enter the workforce and or to pursue further education for this purpose. Participation in the scheme is voluntary.</p>  <p>  The scheme and the programme content have been developed through detailed discussions involving the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Department of Social Protection and the Dublin and Dun-Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  The Department of Social Protection identifies suitable participants.  Participants retain any Department of Social Protection benefits that they are currently entitled to for the duration of the Scheme.  Participants do not receive any payment from the Department of Defence.     </p>  <p>  The scheme is a training programme of ten (10) weeks duration, consisting of five (5) weeks of training delivered by the Defence Forces interspersed with five (5) weeks of educational orientated training by the Education and Training Board.</p>  <p>  A successful pilot programme was held in Gormanston Camp from Monday 20th June 2016 to 26th August 2016 with 25 participants.

A properly constituted Medals Board considered the various cases presented and made a decision that no medals would be awarded.  The Chief of Staff of the day considered the decision of the Board and was satisfied with the findings.  Subsequently, the question was raised again in a letter to a newly appointed Chief of Staff.  He forwarded the letter to the original Medals Board and asked that they reconvene and review their decision.  The Board indicated that the issues raised had received due consideration and that they were not prepared to alter their findings.  On the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the Siege of Jadotville, I decided to issue a Unit Citation to honour the collective actions and bravery of the men of &ldquo;A&rdquo; Company.  I organised and hosted a ceremony in Custume Barracks, Athlone on Saturday 17th September 2016 at which a Unit Citation was presented to the Company in recognition of their collective heroism and professional performance during the Siege of Jadotville whilst cut-off from support and reinforcements.</p>  <p>   During the ceremony I presented a copy of the Citation to each member of the Unit or next-of-kin in the case of deceased members.  This was the first time a Unit Citation was awarded within the Defence Forces and I was delighted to be able to formally recognise the brave actions of these men.  In addition, a specially commissioned insignia will be provided to the members and the next of kin of deceased members of &ldquo;A&rdquo; company in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>   These are awards that are used internationally by other militaries to recognise those Units that have served with particular distinction.

I have no doubt that my predecessors in various Governments over the years share that appreciation and depth of gratitude.</p>  <p>  There are currently two medals that mark the service of personnel with either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force.  The medal known as the &ldquo;The Service Medal&rdquo; may be awarded to an officer, non-commissioned officer or private of the Defence Forces, or a member of the Army Nursing or Chaplaincy Service who possess the qualifying criteria for the award.  The qualifying service for officers and members of the Chaplaincy Service and Army Nursing Service is 5,475 days satisfactory and continuous service.  The qualifying service for NCOs and Privates is 3,650 days satisfactory and continuous service.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;The Service Medal (Reserve Defence Force)&rdquo; (formerly known as the The Service Medal FCA and An Slua Muir&iacute;) was introduced in 1961 for members and former members of the Reserve and is awarded after 7 years service.</p>  <p>  The award of either of these medals to qualifying personnel reflects the service given by those personnel to either the Permanent Defence Force or the Reserve Defence Force as the case may be, and by extension the wider public, during the periods for which they served.   </p>  <p>  Whilst acknowledging the significant role of all Defence Forces personnel to the security of the State throughout the period of the &lsquo;Troubles&rsquo;, I am satisfied that these medals meet the need of marking service of personnel with either the Permanent Defence Force or Reserve Defence Force as the case may be, and I have no plans to introduce additional medals in this regard.</p></reply>

The Operational Programme provides for funding of &euro;18.5 million, of which &euro;12 million is EU funding, for the replacement and upgrade of ships and aircraft, for undertaking Specific Control Inspection Programmes and for other control priorities.  In addition the programme provides for shared funding with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority of &euro;5.5 million, of which &euro;4.95 million is EU funded, for the renewal of technologies as well as for training and compliance promotion.  In addition, the Department of Defence is also accessing EU funding through the Horizon 2020 programme.  Government approved arrangements in July 2011, whereby Enterprise Ireland (EI) would support the Department of Defence and Defence Forces capability development through engagement with Irish-based enterprise and research institutes on the use and application of innovative civilian technologies in the military sphere.</p>  <p>  The Government decision allows for greater engagement with EI and EI supported companies, which contributes to Defence Forces capabilities across the full range of its activities.  It is through this engagement that the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence has been involved in accessing EU funds under the Horizon 2020 programme.  Horizon 2020 is an EU Research and Innovation programme with nearly &euro;80 billion of funding available over 7 years (2014 to 2020).  The Defence Forces has been involved, as a consortium member, in a number of proposals for Horizon 2020 funding since the launch of the programme and enjoyed their first success in 2016 as a consortium member of the ROCSAFE project.  Over the next three years, funding of up to &euro;90,000 can be accessed for the Defence Forces role in this project.   </p>  <p>  A further defence related proposal, known as the European Defence Action Plan was made by the Commission in November, 2016 which includes details of a future European Defence Fund.  The purpose of this Fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technological and industrial base, and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.  The Commission has proposed that the fund would have a research and capability windows.</p>  <p>  Under the "research window", &euro;90m in funding would be made available for collaborative defence research projects over the period 2017-2020 in what is known as the &ldquo;Preparatory Action&rdquo;.  The Commission also propose that post 2020, a European Defence Research Programme will be established with funding of &euro;500m per annum.  It should be noted that this has yet to be negotiated as part of the post 2020 Multiannual Financial Framework.  The &ldquo;capability window&rdquo; of the fund may also bring opportunities for Irish Industry.</p>  <p>  While the Action Plan is at the very early stages and a lot has yet to be finalised, a co-ordinated approach is being adopted by relevant Government Departments to ensure that Ireland is optimally positioned to avail of the industrial and employment opportunities that may eventually arise from the Commission proposals.  In that regard, officials in my Department are co-ordinating with their counterparts in other Government Departments in relation to the proposals.  These include the Departments of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  As the UK has not left the EU and withdrawal negotiations cannot begin until Article 50 has been triggered by the UK, it will not be known what impact Brexit may have on these two particular EU Programmes for some time.  The Government has adopted a contingency framework to deal with all issues arising in respect of the UK vote to leave the EU. Accordingly, any issues arising will be addressed within that framework.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that all efforts are being made to access EU funding that is available to the Defence sector.</p></reply>
