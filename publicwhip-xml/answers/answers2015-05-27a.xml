This represents an increase of &euro;34 million and is a 5.6% increase on funding provided to the Agency in Budget 2014. </p>  <p>  This funding increase demonstrates that, despite the budgetary constraints, this Government remains strongly committed to delivering the critically important support and reforms needed to supporting Ireland&rsquo;s children and families. This additional funding will help drive key priorities in the reform of services, and assist the Agency to deliver on its mandate from Government. </p>  <p>  Since its establishment, Tusla has been engaged in a comprehensive and much needed programme of reform across our child welfare and protection system.  In December, I notified Tusla of its funding allocation for 2015 and on foot of this, Tusla prepared its Business Plan for this year.</p>  <p>  Like all State agencies, Tusla has reviewed the scope to make savings across various areas of expenditure and to ensure that services are developed where possible.  It has identified areas where resources need to be provided and it has also identified areas where available funding can be used to better effect to support service delivery.</p>  <p>  The key focus has been on ensuring that services are streamlined and rationalised where necessary, with any overlap in service provision and duplication of costs eliminated. I have specified to Tusla that they should do everything to defend front-line services to children.  This has implications for some organisations when services do not reflect the statutory remit of Tusla at this time. </p>  <p>  I am very supportive of the approach that Tusla is adopting in terms of the reform of services, the targeting of funding at front-line services and the work being done in developing a new approach to the commissioning of services.</p>  <p>  I want to assure the House, that in furtherance of the Government&rsquo;s policy and commitment to child and family services, Tusla will continue to work very closely with service providers in managing budgets and in the delivery of services to children and families across the country. Priority will be given to front-line services as we seek to address identified service requirements, together with a strong focus on early intervention and prevention.</p></reply>

The programme builds on and continues the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) 2007 - 2013 which was co-funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) and Atlantic Philanthropies (AP).</p>  <p>  The ABC Programme targets joint investment of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and The Atlantic Philanthropies of &euro;29.7m in evidence-informed interventions to improve the long-term outcomes for children and families living in disadvantaged areas. It aims to break &ldquo;the cycle of child poverty within areas where it is most deeply entrenched and where children are most disadvantaged, through integrated and effective services and interventions&rdquo; in the areas of child development, child well-being, parenting and educational disadvantage. </p>  <p>  The ABC programme is currently being evaluated under the guidance of an Expert Advisory Group. The evaluation adopts a shared measurement framework across all ABC programme sites. The evaluation will consider the implementation and cost of programmes, and crucially how the outcomes for children and families in ABC areas have changed during the course of the programme. The findings from this evaluation will be key to informing considerations in mainstream the learning from the ABC programme.</p>  <p>  In parallel with the evaluation of the ABC programme my Department has established a task-focused group to examine how best to mainstream the learning from the ABC programme in the domains of policy and provision to improve outcomes for children and young people. This Task Group comprises representatives of the ABC sites and will explore how the mainstreaming of the learning from effective evidence-informed approaches can best be progressed. </p>  <p>  It is anticipated that the group will provide a succinct discussion paper outlining feasible options relating to the mainstreaming of learning for the consideration of the ABC Interdepartmental Project Team in the last quarter of 2015.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-27a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052700077#WRA01300"><p>I am aware of the relatively high cost of childcare to parents in this country and of the difficulties that this presents, particularly where both parents are in employment outside of the home.  To help address the issue, funding of more than a quarter of a billion euro is provided annually by my Department to support the implementation of a number of childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality childcare services.  This funding, which is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, supports more than 100,000 children each year.  </p>  <p>  The most significant of these programmes is the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, which represents an annual investment of approximately &euro;170 million, enables 67,000 children each year to benefit from free pre-school provision.  The standard weekly capitation payment for each eligible child enrolled is &euro;62.50 with a higher capitation of &euro;73 paid for eligible children enrolled in services where staff hold higher childcare qualifications.  Parents who qualify for support under this programme can have their annual childcare costs reduced by as much as &euro;2,375 for each qualifying child. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families. In the region of 25,000 children benefit  from this programme each year. In the case of full day care, parents can have their weekly childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week.   </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the:</p>  <p>  - Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses; </p>  <p>  - Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and </p>  <p>  - After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   </p>  <p>  The high level of funding to support these childcare programmes has been maintained despite the difficult budgetary position that has prevailed in recent years.  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children.  The Group will submit its report to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

As I mentioned earlier, I must give due regard to fair procedures for the individuals involved. </p>  <p>  As part of the immediate actions, Tusla carried out an urgent review of the affected referrals out between the 5th and 8th of May.  Measures are already underway to manage the referrals that were not processed as they should have been in Laois Offaly.  </p>  <p>  Tusla's analysis to date indicates that all of the referrals involved had been seen by the social work team.  It shows that 90% of these had been received since 2012.  Of all of the referrals involved, 11% required no further child welfare or protection actions.  There was a recommendation for one in five of the referrals to be allocated for immediate assessment to identify whether the child concerned needed a response from the protection or family support services, or if the case could be closed.  The remaining referrals were recommended to be dealt with by way of active management of risk while awaiting an initial assessment.  Tusla has put in place the resources needed to progress all of these referrals, including those in need of immediate assessment.</p>  <p>  Tusla has reported that only about half of the referrals showed evidence of review since the date of referral.  In some cases there was evidence of steps being taken but that the recording of progress was not sufficient to formally progress or close the case.  </p>  <p>  At this stage, I have not been informed by Tusla of any children that were at immediate risk who did not receive an urgent response.  I welcome the speedy and appropriate response by Tusla to put in place resources to implement the action plan.  Tusla has in place a mechanism to monitor the action plan.  I will have been receiving regular updates and will keep Deputies informed on this matter.  I will meet with Tusla later today for a further update on progress.</p></reply>

It is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified under the Department of Education and Skills DEIS Action Plan. It involves 124 locally managed projects and provides targeted supports to approximately 36,000 children and young people.</p>  <p>  Since 1st January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has had operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects. In 2014, Tusla allocated &euro;24.756 million, and a similar allocation is being made for 2015. Tusla has asked Chairpersons of Local Management Committees to prepare their school retention plans for the 2015/2016 school year based on the expenditure allocated last year and to return them to the Agency by June 5th. Following receipt of these plans, all school completion projects will be notified of their allocations for the 2015/2016 school year. </p>  <p>  The ESRI is currently reviewing the School Completion Programme, which will help in future decisions on its structure, governance and operation.  The report is almost finalised and it is expected it will be available next month. </p>  <p>  I have advised the Agency of my commitment to ensuring that there is no diminution in the school completion programme services.The School Completion Programme is an important service within the Agency&rsquo;s educational welfare services. It is highly regarded as a key response in securing improved educational outcomes for children and young people at risk of early school leaving.</p></reply>

It brings together a range of measures designed to support providers in the challenge of continually improving the quality and standards of early years services throughout the country. One of the most important measures relates to the inspection of early years services. </p>  <p>  I am preparing new Regulations to strengthen the current inspection regime, under which a new registration system will require that anyone who wants to establish an early years service must register with Tusla before they open. Services will be inspected by the Early Years Inspectorate before registration is granted, and there will be on-going inspections once the service is operating and children are attending.  Importantly, these new Regulations will also be accompanied by new National Standards for Early Years Services, against which services will be inspected. </p>  <p>  In addition to this work, the Inspectorate of the Department of Education and Skills is leading focussed inspections of the quality of educational provision in the free pre-school year provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme. </p>  <p>  New qualification requirements for staff working directly with children in early years setting are also planned. All staff will be required to have a minimum Level 5 qualification on the National Qualifications Framework in early years care and education, or an equivalent qualification. In addition, pre-school leaders delivering the free pre-school year, who are currently required to hold a Level 5 qualification, will be required to have a minimum Level 6 qualification, or equivalent to qualify for ECCE. To support staff to meet these new qualification requirements, my Department established the Learner Fund which allocated &euro;3 million to almost 2,500 staff for the purpose of up-skilling </p>  <p>  The recent establishment of Better Start further demonstrates my commitment to ensuring excellence in early years services. The aim of Better Start is to provide a nationally coherent continuum of support to providers to help them to improve quality, incorporating the work of the City and County Childcare Committees and the National Voluntary Childcare Organisations.  Every year, we provide some &euro;13 million to City and County Childcare Committees and National Voluntary Childcare Organisations under the programme. This funding supports the valuable work of these bodies in supporting early years&rsquo; services around the country, through training, continuing professional development programmes, networking and cluster-type support groups. </p>  <p>  Better Start also incorporates the work of a new nationally coordinated Early Years Specialist Service. This Service has recruited and trained 30 graduates in early childhood care and education to work directly with services in a mentoring capacity to improve quality, including assisting services in the implementation of the S&iacute;olta Framework and the Aistear Curriculum. </p>  <p>  While significant progress has been made, my Department will continue to progress the Early Years Quality Agenda. Indeed, this is one of a number of issues that will be considered by the Inter-Department Group on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Care and Education.</p></reply>

This Programme, which has an annual cost of &euro;170 million, benefits in the region of 67,000 children every year. </p>  <p>  To deliver the free pre-school year, a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating early years services.

These capitation payments are paid to services in advance of, and during, each school term. </p>  <p>  I do not have the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the expected margins for providers.  Despite the downturn and the difficult budgetary situation, and the need to reduce capitation payments in 2012, the Government did maintain the pre-school year on a universal and free basis and, importantly, the number of  early years services participating in the  Programme, at approximately 4,200, remained consistent. The funding provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme to these services was a guaranteed source of income at that time and ensured that early years services were able to continue to deliver services at a time when the demand for childcare had fallen considerably.  </p>  <p>  One of the issues to be considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education will be capitation rates and funding options overall for this area.

More than 100,000 children benefit from these programmes each year.  The support provided under these programmes is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit. </p>  <p>  The funding provided through the childcare support programmes has a significant impact on the affordability of childcare services and has ensured that many children, who otherwise would not be in a position to avail of childcare services, are able to access quality services.  The support has also enabled many childcare providers to continue to deliver childcare services at a time of severe economic difficulty.  The funding has also ensured that employment levels across the sector have been maintained. The retention of the current level of investment in childcare is a considerable achievement given the pressure on the public finances over the last number of years. </p>  <p>  All childcare programmes supported by my Department currently provide funding directly to early years services either in the form of capitation or subvention payments. This enables my Department to use this funding  as leverage for ensuring high quality early years services while, at the same time, reducing the costs for parents . </p>  <p>  To deliver the free pre-school year under the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating early years services. A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is paid per eligible child to services with more highly qualified staff. Parents who qualify for support under this programme can have their annual childcare costs reduced by as much as &euro;2,375 for each qualifying child. </p>  <p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme provides funding to community childcare services to support disadvantaged or low income families, and in the case of full day care, parents can have their weekly childcare costs reduced by up to &euro;95 per week for each qualifying child.   </p>  <p>  Further childcare support is provided under a number of labour activation measures which support parents returning to the workforce or availing of education or training opportunities. These include the:</p>  <p>  - Childcare Education and Training Supports programme for parents availing of training and education courses; - Community Employment Childcare programme for parents in Community Employment schemes; and </p>  <p>  - After-School Childcare programme for after-school care.   </p>  <p>  For all of these programme, the maximum contribution a parent makes to the cost of childcare is capped at &euro;15 per week for part-time and after-school care and &euro;25 per week in the case of full-day care.   </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to maintaining and improving the quality of childcare services and I consider that the funding provided by my Department through the childcare programmes is the most effective way of achieving higher quality while continuing to support parents with the cost of childcare. </p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group, which is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children, will consider a variety of mechanisms to address the objectives set out in the Deputy's question.  The Group is expected to submit its final report to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

To date, Tusla has given me their view that the management of staffing numbers in the area was not the only factor involved in the very unsatisfactory situation that was identified there.  The Tusla management view is that existing resources were not being managed as effectively as they might be.  In taking action in Laois Offaly, Tusla has made additional staff available to address the backlog. </p>  <p>  Nationally, Tusla's child welfare and protection services are subject to the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority, and their reports are a matter of public record.  As the child protection services are rightly undergoing scrutiny, other aspects of service delivery will no doubt be identified for improvement.  Tusla has also recently developed the first ever quality assurance programme for child protection services. This programme is identifying areas in service improvement needs and is used to address resources and practice issues.  </p>  <p>  I have been reassured by Tusla that the day to day work with children and families is being done.  I agree that the resources to support this work are a key priority and that we need to examine this for the system as a whole.  I requested a report reviewing the situation with cases awaiting allocation.  This report is at an advanced stage and I expect that it will be submitted to me shortly.  It will provide Tusla with an opportunity to outline objective information on the road blocks we need to remove in the system.  I am confident that this will reveal that the reforms that are underway are on the right track to deliver a fully quality assured service for all children at risk or in care.</p></reply>

In these cases, the primary need is for a family home and responsibility for this lies with local authorities and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. </p><p>The December 2014 <i>Action Plan to Address Homelessness</i>includes a commitment for Tusla and Dublin City Council to coordinate operations to ensure that services are fully responsive to the need for family support services, including, where necessary, protection and welfare services that might arise for families in emergency accommodation.  </p><p>When there is no child welfare and protection concern, the role of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, is to provide family support, in the same way as it does for families in the general community.  Where circumstances permit, Tusla can assist families by way of guidance and parenting supports through its family support services.  Where Tusla identifies underlying problems, for example mental health issues, it can refer the family to the appropriate services.  Tusla has had meetings with Focus Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and Dublin City Council in relation to vulnerable families and it is intended to develop a multi-agency protocol to clarify responsibilities with regard to homelessness.  </p><p>I am well aware that homelessness is very disruptive to normal family life and is a major issue that this Government is intent on tackling.  The effects on children can be damaging, particularly where the parents may be experiencing their own problems.  We are all familiar with the benefits for a child of good routine, stable friendships and family ties.  Homelessness can only have a negative impact on a child's personal growth, security and education.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, with the local authorities, is working hard to address this problem.  Earlier this year, for example, the Minister issued a formal instruction to local authorities in Dublin and other urban centres on social housing, with a particular reference to those who have used emergency accommodation.  </p><p>I consider family homelessness to be a very serious issue, and central to this are efforts to end the need to use emergency accommodation.

Under these Acts, the Child and Family Agency has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. The definition of a child contained in both Acts is that of a person under 18 years of age who is not or has not been married. A child may be brought into care in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991 on a voluntary basis or, if necessary, a child may be received into care by Court order.</p>  <p>  Young people leaving the care of the State at 18 years of age are entitled to an aftercare service. Aftercare is the term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of such young people to assist them in making the transition to independent living. </p>  <p>  The Child Care Act 1991 provides that the core eligible age range for aftercare is from 18 years up to 21 years. This can be extended until the completion of a course of education and training in which a young person who has left care, or is leaving care, is engaged, up to the age of 23 years.</p>  <p>  The situation regarding leaving care in Scotland differs from the Irish situation. The majority of young people leave care in Scotland between the ages of 16 and 18 years. The provisions of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014 are being introduced on a phased basis. The Act provides for a number of supports to those in care and care leavers. These include the introduction of &lsquo;continuing care&rsquo;, a new legal term to describe care leavers who remain in their &lsquo;looked after&rsquo; (care) placement up to the age of 21. Local authorities have a new duty to provide care leavers with a continuation of the kinds of support they received prior to leaving care. In essence, the young person has ceased to be looked after but the local authority continues to provide them with a looked after placement and any necessary support until their 22nd birthday. This is akin to aftercare services for children leaving care in this State.</p>  <p>  93% of children in care in Ireland are in foster care. At the end of December 2014, 58% of the 1,685 young people aged 18 to 23 years in receipt of an aftercare service were in full-time education. A significant number of these care leavers are supported financially to remain living with their foster carers, in addition to having access to an aftercare worker.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy is aware, it has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare in Ireland. The approach proposed is to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person. It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly.</p></reply>

As part of this process, all staff working directly with children in pre-school services will be required to hold a major award in early childhood care and education at Level 5 on the National Framework of Qualifications, or the equivalent. This minimum qualification will be a requirement under the revised Childcare Regulations and, when commenced, staff who wish to continue in employment in the childcare sector must satisfy this new qualification requirement. </p>  <p>  Specific funding of &euro;3 million has been provided in 2014/15 under the Learner Fund to assist staff already working in the childcare sector to meet these new childcare qualification requirements.  I understand that all eligible applicants were approved for funding and that in the region of  2,500 childcare staff are now being supported to meet the new qualification requirements.</p>  <p>  To deliver the free pre-school year, a standard capitation fee of &euro;62.50 per week per eligible child is paid to participating early years services. A higher capitation fee of &euro;73 per week is paid per eligible child to services with more highly qualified staff.  These capitation payments are paid to services in advance of, and during, each school term. </p>  <p>  In 2012, it was necessary to reduce the level of capitation provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme in order to ensure that the Department's spending remained within the restricted limits set by Government following the severe downturn in the economy.  Despite the downturn and the difficult budgetary situation, the Government did maintain the pre-school year on a universal and free basis and, importantly, the number of  early years services participating in the Programme, at approximately 4,200, remained consistent. The funding provided under the  Early Childhood Care and Education Programme to these services was a guaranteed source of income at that time and ensured that early years services were able to continue to deliver services at a time when the demand for childcare had fallen considerably.  </p>  <p>  The restoration of capitation payments to pre-2012 levels would improve margins for providers. However, this would cost in the region of &euro;5 million annually.  While we have made very considerable progress in correcting the overall budgetary situation, the revenues generated by the improving economy has not yet provided the  funding necessary for my Department to increase the current  capitation payments. I have indicated previously that, if sufficient resources become available to my Department, I will consider the scope for this. </p>  <p>  Indeed, this will be one of a number of options that will be considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education, which I established in February this year. This Inter-Departmental Group, which is tasked with setting out a range of options for current and future investment, will consider options to enhance affordability, options to increase the accessibility of provision and options to build the quality of provision and support the sustainability of the early years sector. The Group is expected to submit a series of recommendations to Government in June 2015.</p></reply>

In excess of &euro;40 million is provided annually by my Department to support the CCS programme and this enables the parents of some 25,000 children to avail of affordable childcare. </p>  <p>  In the region of 900 community childcare services participate in the CCS programme and they qualify for funding on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  The subvention is used by the services to reduce the weekly fees charged to disadvantaged or low income working families based on eligibility criteria.  </p>  <p>  Currently, there is no funding to allow for the entry of new community childcare services to the CCS programme. New applications can only be accepted if the new service is replacing an existing community childcare service that is leaving the programme.

It is an early intervention, multi-agency (when necessary) response tailored to the needs of an individual child or young person. </p><p>Meitheal is voluntary and can only be undertaken when the parent/carer provides their written consent. Meitheal is used in partnership with parents to help them share their own knowledge, expertise and concerns about their child and hear the same from practitioners.

The cross-departmental national framework for children and young people - Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures is the framework for supporting the integration of these reforms and in driving a focus on prevention and early intervention through cross-sectoral implementation planning.

Tusla's statutory duty is to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  There are many reasons for children coming into Tusla's care including abuse and neglect but disability alone, whether intellectual or physical, is not one.  </p>  <p>  Of course, as children in care are a heterogeneous  group, some will have a disability.  I am advised by the Agency that approximately 8% of children in care have been diagnosed by a clinical specialist as having a moderate or severe disability.  These children also avail of disability services operated by the HSE.  In some cases, this includes residential care provided by Disability Services. </p>  <p>  It is Tusla&rsquo;s responsibility to respond to any concern or report of abuse or risk of abuse to any child, irrespective of a disability or whether they are at home, already in care or living in a HSE residential centre provided by Disability Services.  In such circumstances, Tusla will assess the child's situation.  Any decision Tusla take to apply for a care order with respect to a child with a moderate or severe disability is taken at a multidisciplinary case conference where the views of professionals who have long established knowledge of the child and family are heard. </p>  <p>  Placement is based on assessed need.  A child with a disability may be placed with a Tusla foster care family or residential unit and receive disability services.  Where a child is already attending a disability service it may be in the child's best interests to be placed in the disability service's residential care to allow for continuation of relationships, care planning and to avoid a disruption in placement when the child reaches the age of 18 and is discharged from care. </p>  <p>  Tusla and the HSE have a joint protocol for inter-agency collaboration which underpins service provision for children whose needs span health and child protection.</p></reply>

In March 2012, the Ombudsman for Children produced a report on the Operation of the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. In this report, the former Ombudsman for Children, Ms Logan, made a number of recommendations proposing amendments to the 2002 Act and highlighting the need for clarity in respect of policy on certain aspects of the remit of that Office. Among her recommendations, she called for an expansion of her remit in certain areas, including in relation to Education. This Government has already expanded the remit of both the Ombudsman for Children and the Ombudsman by the enactment of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012. </p>  <p>  In light of the fact that the issue being raised by the Deputy relates to the education sector, I would suggest that it might be more appropriate for the Deputy to pursue this matter with the Minister for Education and Skills.</p></reply>

Corporal punishment in schools is banned, regulations and standards for creches, foster care and residential settings address the use of appropriate discipline.  In order to copperfasten the position with regard to care settings, I have instructed officials in my Department to prepare regulations providing for the explicit prohibition of corporal punishment where a child, in the care of the State, is placed in foster care, foster care with relatives or in residential care.</p><p>Corporal punishment in the home, while not specifically outlawed, is subject to provisions of certain laws, namely, the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997 which deals with the assault of any person and Section 246 of the Children Act, 2001 which deals with cruelty to children.  In the case of parents, or persons acting in <i>loco parentis</i>(other than teachers), a common law defence of reasonable chastisement may be available where a prosecution arises.  Such a defence exists in a number of common law countries.  While corporal punishment of children is unacceptable in all instances it is important to clarify that the defence is not an immunity and it is a matter for a court to objectively determine what is &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; in the context of the currently applicable social norms.</p><p>The established position has been that to remove the common law defence would, in principle, expose the family extensively to the intrusion of the criminal law.  However, my Department has commenced work, including consultation with the Department of Justice and Equality, on examining the possibility within the Irish legal framework for removing the common law defence.</p><p>All aspects of the issue of a total prohibition of corporal punishment whether from a policy, legislative or constitutional perspective continue to be kept under review.  More broadly, significant progress continues to be made in relation to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to protect the rights of children, including the amendment to the Constitution in relation to children&rsquo;s rights, progress in relation to fundamental reform of the child protection services with the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, and drafting legislation in relation to putting Children First on a statutory basis.</p></reply>

This funding, which is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, supports more than 100,000 children each year.  </p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of current (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in childcare. This Group is considering the needs of children in their early years as well as the needs of school-going children.  The Group will submit its report to Government in June 2015. </p>  <p>  The issue of school ownership impacts on the extent to which the State can influence how primary schools use any additional facilities or space they may have.  The vast majority of primary school buildings in the country are in private ownership. Of the 3,278 primary schools in 2014, only 190 (6%) are in the ownership of the Minister for Education and Skills. The remaining 94% of primary schools are in private ownership.  The State has no authority to compel Patrons who are the owners of school sites to accommodate childcare services on their own property.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Minister for Education and Skills is, however, supportive of coherent measures that facilitate greater community use of schools while respecting the core role of schools. In relation to use of existing school premises, my colleague is of the view that, in the first instance the core role of a school in delivering education to its student body has to be paramount and any additional activities have to adhere to that core role.  There are also a number of practical issues, such as lease terms, insurance, etc., that need to be properly examined for schools considering additional activities on their premises.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these issues, the Inter-Departmental Group will give consideration to the use of the school infrastructure for future delivery of childcare, particularly for after-school and out-of-school care.</p></reply>

However, in relation to the specific issue raised by the Deputy there are particular practical problems in achieving this. The calorie intake required by children varies enormously by age and gender and activity levels. For example a relatively sedentary 5 year old girl will require around 1200 calories, whilst an active teenage boy may require 3000 calories per day, making the calculation of the percentage it contributes a particular daily total for a child or young person complex.  Confectionary should, ideally, not form part of any child&rsquo;s everyday diet, and be seen as an occasional treat. The campaign currently being run by SafeFood in partnership with ourselves and the Department of Health has had this as one of its key messages.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently in the process of developing new healthy eating guidelines for children aged under five which will help parents and professionals advising them make the best choices in relation to the nutrition of their children.</p></reply>

This includes a provision of &euro;992 million in current expenditure and &euro;35 million in capital expenditure, which in Vote terms, represents an overall increase of &euro;30 million, or 3%, over the 2014 allocation. </p>  <p>  The Estimate for 2015 contains significant additional resources to fund the services and programmes provided by the Child and Family Agency. This amounts to &euro;643 million, which accounts for 63% of the Vote allocation, and represents an increase of &euro;34 million or 5% against the 2014 allocation. While I understand that this level of funding cannot address all of the challenges that the new Agency faces in doing its work, I believe that the additional funding will allow the Agency not only to alleviate the pressures on the range of services currently in place, but also to build on the extensive programme of reform across the range of services for children and services which is well underway. The balance of funding in the Vote, which amounts to &euro;384 million, relates to a range of other programmes administered by my Department including those relating to child-care and youth services.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department continue to closely monitor the cash position of the Agency and are working with the Agency on an ongoing basis to monitor the Agency's financial requirement.

The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in delivery on a child poverty target and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - economic security and opportunity.</p><p>This child target relates to lifting over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  </p><p>To inform the development of a mutli-dimensional approach to tackling child poverty, a national seminar on &lsquo;Investing in children &ndash; breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo; was held with the European Commission and attended by national stakeholders in November 2014.  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection supporting this mutli-dimensional approach to child poverty.</p><p>As regards my own Department there are a number of areas of focus that support this response to child poverty.  My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group is focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.</p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services. </p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people are provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  The forthcoming National Youth Strategy will ensure that the social inclusion of young people is a key aim.</p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the child and family agency is also responsible for the delivery of educational welfare services which involves intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach to address the child's needs and support school attendance. During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.</p><p>Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes over 100 family resource centres.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit. The Programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.</p></reply>

Almost 93% of children in care were in a foster care setting.  Of all children in care, over 92% (5,878) have an allocated social worker and 90% (5,739) have an up to date written care plan.  This indicates that 515 children in care are without a dedicated social worker and that there were 654 who did not have a current care plan.  Tusla's policy is that all children coming into care and those in high risk placements have an allocated social worker.  Subsequent gaps may be attributed to a number of factors including maternity leave, vacancies and competing priorities.  I would note that figures provided by Tusla for children with a written care plan only include care plans that have formally completed the review process required under the Child Care Regulations 1995.  Where a review is taking place, the existing care plan remains in place.  </p>  <p>  Tusla's policy is that, where a child is awaiting the allocation of a social worker, this is responded to by a duty team on a risk management basis.  During this time, specific pieces of work on the child's case may be undertaken by staff working in the duty system.  Structures are in place to regulate and inspect service provision, including the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority.  I am satisfied that, overall, the necessary services and supports are in place to ensure the care and welfare of children in State care.</p></reply>

Tusla has clear operational guidance for its staff on the assessment of allegations of abuse, whether current or historical.  An Garda Siochana carries out criminal investigations into allegations of abuse. </p>  <p>  When Tusla receives an allegation of abuse, their first duty is to the safety of the child concerned and to gather sufficient information in order to come to a professional opinion regarding risk to that child and any other child posed by the person against whom the allegation has been made. When Tusla receives information from an adult about abuse he/she suffered as a child, Tusla have the same responsibility to assess the current risk that may be posed to children by the adult against whom the historical allegation has been made.  Tusla has a duty of care to apply fair procedures and natural justice to any adult where they are undertaking an assessment of the risk that adult may pose, but where they conclude that the allegation is founded, they will share that information with relevant third parties to ensure that children are protected. </p>  <p>  Tusla publishes data on all abuse referrals, by type (neglect, physical, emotional and sexual abuse) and on referrals concerning welfare issues.  Tusla's data shows many referrals proceed to initial assessment, and how many are confirmed as requiring a child protection plan. The data, as nationally collected, is not broken down into investigations of historical and present abuse. Consequently, Tusla has informed me that it does not have data in the form requested by the Deputy.  Tusla has informed my Department that, as part of the standardisation of data collection, it intends to disaggregate the total number of referrals and assessments to allow reporting on historical allegations separately.</p></reply>

This funding is largely directed towards a number of childcare programmes, which aim to improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of early years and school-age care and education. These programmes support the provision of early years and school-age care and education for more than 100,000 children each year.</p>  <p>  To ensure that all the benefits of this (and future) investment are fully realised, it must be evidence-based and strategically coordinated. It is critically important that any investment is designed to achieve the best outcomes for children and their parents. Accordingly, I have established an Inter-Departmental Group to develop a coherent whole-of-Government approach to investment in early years and school-age care and education. </p>  <p>  Membership of the Group includes representation from right across Government, including the Departments of Education and Skills, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Social Protection and as well as the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform, Finance and an Taoiseach. </p>  <p>  The work of the Group is being informed by research and evidence of best practice and by existing policy commitments, including those set out in Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures, the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People.</p>  <p>  To inform its work, the Group has also solicited the views of key stakeholders, interested parties and the general public through a number of consultative processes, including:</p>  <p>  - A series of bilateral discussions with relevant Government Departments, including the Departments of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Education and Skills, Finance, Jobs and Innovation, Justice and Equality, Public Expenditure and Reform and Social Protection;</p>  <p>  - Two separate online consultation processes - one with the early years sector, which resulted in approximately 400 submissions and one with parents and guardians, which resulted in almost 1,000 submissions; and</p>  <p>  - An Open Policy Debate on Future Investment in Early Years and School-Age Care and Education Services, which is referred to by the Deputy. </p>  <p>  This Open Policy Debate, which was carried out in line with the Civil Service Renewal Programme, was hosted by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on 31st March 2015 and attended by some 40 invited representatives including parents, providers, academics, childcare committees, and NGOs. </p>  <p>  Reports on the online consultations and the Open Policy Debate are currently being compiled and will be published in due course.</p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Group will submit its report to Government by end June 2015.</p></reply>

There are approximately 69,000 rent supplement recipients, for which the Government has provided a total of over &euro;298 million in 2015. </p>  <p>  The Department works closely with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) to help ensure that rent supplement tenancies comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards. The Department advises the PRTB, on a quarterly basis, of all new rent supplement tenancies to assist them in implementing tenancy regulations and co-operates in any initiatives taken by the PRTB to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act. </p>  <p>  Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant. This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department.</p>  <p>  The efficiency of the rent supplement scheme would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords, for the provision of short term support. The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme (HAP).  HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system and is currently being rolled out in selected local authority areas. Under HAP the local authority pays the rent directly to the landlord.</p></reply>

They can work part-time without restrictions, participate in education and still receive the transitional payment &ndash; subject to a means test.  As such, the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment takes into account the specific caring responsibilities of these customers, allows them to balance their work and caring responsibilities and, significantly, reduces their requirement for child care.</p>  <p>  As the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment is part of the JA scheme, both its means test and its maximum weekly rate of payment are the same as that of the JA payment.  Income from work is assessed with an earnings disregard of &euro;20 per day of employment, up to a maximum of &euro;60 per week, and any income above that is assessed at 60%. </p>  <p>  Recipients of the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment also have access to the Department&rsquo;s range of Intreo services, and to related supports, to enable them to become job-ready and/or to find employment.

Choices available to individuals (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity with the remaining funds, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate income tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an Approved Minimum Retirement Fund (AMRF), once certain conditions are met. </p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 introduced changes relating to the imputed distribution rate for certain ARFs as well as provisions to allow owners of AMRFs to draw-down up to 4% of the assets of such funds on one occasion in each year instead of the facility to draw-down the accrued income and gains of such funds, as had applied heretofore. </p>  <p>  A system of imputed distributions of the value of ARF assets was introduced because an internal review of tax relief for pensions provision undertaken by my Department and the Revenue Commissioners in 2005 found that the ARF option was largely not being used as intended to fund an income stream in retirement but was, instead, being used to build up funds in a tax-free environment over the long-term. In an effort to counteract this, Budget and Finance Act 2006 introduced, with effect from 2007, an imputed or notional distribution of 3% of the value of the assets of an ARF on 31 December each year (subsequently changed to 30 November each year). The notional distribution arrangement only applies where the ARF owner is 60 years or over for the whole of a tax year. The notional distribution was phased in over the period 2007 to 2009, with 1% applying in 2007, 2% in 2008 and the full 3% from 2009. The notional amount is taxed at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate. Funds actually drawn down by ARF owners are credited against the imputed distribution in that year to arrive at a net imputed amount, if any, for the year. Budget and Finance Act 2011 increased the rate of the notional distribution to 5% of the value of the assets of an ARF, while Finance Act 2012 further increased the rate to 6% in respect of ARFs with values over &euro;2 million.</p>  <p>  Finance Act 2014 reduced the annual imputed ARF distribution rate from 5% to 4% for ARF owners in the age group 60 to 70 years whose ARFs have assets of &euro;2 million or under. This change was introduced in order to reduce the risk that individuals in that age group might outlive the funds in their ARFs. </p>  <p>  As regards the changes to AMRF access, I should explain by way of background, that under the flexible options at retirement arrangements, where an individual in a DC pension savings arrangement is under age 75 at the time of exercising the option and does not meet the guaranteed pension income requirement of &euro;12,700 per annum, that individual must place a maximum "set aside" amount of &euro;63,500 (or the remainder of the pension funds if less than &euro;63,500 after taking the retirement lump sum) in an AMRF or purchase an annuity with the &euro;63,500.</p>  <p>  Any amount of remaining pension funds in excess of &euro;63,500 can be invested in an ARF with access to those funds at the owner's discretion (subject to tax, at the marginal rate and having regard to the imputed distribution requirements). </p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension "nest-egg" to provide for the latter years of his/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, up to now, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. </p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs so as to allow AMRF owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year up to the point at which the AMRF becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.</p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. </p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has not purchased a pension annuity in the meantime.</p>  <p>  Individuals whose AMRF represents a less significant part of their retirement funds and whose circumstances would allow for greater investment risk and, therefore, potentially greater investment returns will be limited to the 4% level of asset draw down. However, this draw down will also be available to them for periods when their AMRF investments make losses or returns of less than 4% of the value of their AMRF assets and where, under the previous arrangement, they would not have been able to make a draw down or the draw down would have been of a lesser value than will now be permitted. I consider that the change will be to the benefit of AMRF owners, generally, over the medium to longer term and I have no plans to reverse it.</p></reply>

This amount represents a reduction of &euro;145 million (8%) on the equivalent 31 March 2014 figure. The total 'debt available for collection' (DAC) figure at that point (31 March 2015) was &euro;907 million, which is a reduction of &euro;102 million (10%) on the equivalent 2014 figure. </p><p>The DAC figure, which is in line with other comparable jurisdictions, is a more accurate indicator of progress on tax debt reduction because it excludes elements of the overall amount that are beyond Revenue's control. These elements include debts that are under appeal to the Appeal Commissioners or the Circuit Court or that are subject to the various insolvency processes.</p><p>Approximately &euro;384 million of the &euro;907 million DAC figure is already subject to collection enforcement activity while a further &euro;112 million is controlled under phased payment agreements between Revenue and the taxpayers in question. These phased payment concessions are only granted to taxpayers or businesses that are viable and have proved their capacity to meet the terms of any such agreement. The remaining &euro;411 million is relatively new debt that is at various stages in the pre-enforcement collection cycle. This cycle can include, for example, discussions with the taxpayer or may involve the issuing of a 'final demand' for payment, which is a precursor to enforcement that affords the defaulter a finite period of time to get his/her affairs in order.  <b></b></p><p>Revenue has successfully reduced the DAC figure by over &euro;536 million since the economic downturn peaked in 2009 and on that basis I am happy that the balanced approach of limited debt rescheduling combined with early enforcement action where compliance is not forthcoming is delivering strong results. </p><p>Revenue has confirmed to me that it anticipates the current approach will deliver further positive outcomes in the coming year and I have no plans to introduce any changes at this time.</p></reply>

As Minister for Finance, I have no role in such day to day decision making of regulated financial services providers.</p>  <p>  On a general level, mortgage lending decisions must be undertaken on a sustainable and prudential basis by financial institutions and must also conform with relevant regulatory requirements, both in relation to the financial institution itself and also in the best interest of the customer.  In this regard, I have been informed by the Central Bank that prior to offering a product or service a bank must gather and record sufficient information from the consumer appropriate to the nature and complexity of the product or service and must carry out an assessment of affordability to ascertain the personal consumer's likely ability to repay the debt over the duration of the agreement, in accordance with the requirements of the Consumer Protection Code 2012.  In the case of all mortgage products provided to personal consumers, the assessment must include consideration of the results of a test on the personal consumer's ability to repay the instalments, over the duration of the agreement, on the basis of a 2% interest rate increase, at a minimum, above the interest rate offered to the personal consumer. This test does not apply to mortgages where the interest rate is fixed for a period of five years or more. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware, the Central Bank of Ireland has put in place new macro prudential regulations for residential mortgage lending. These regulations provide that, in respect of mortgage for a principal dwelling, first time buyers will be subject to a maximum mortgage LTV of 90% for a property valued up to &euro;220,000, and subject to an 80% LTV on any excess value above that amount. For non-first time buyers, a mortgage will be limited to 80% of the value of a principal dwelling house. In addition, there is a loan to income limit of 3.5 times gross annual income. However, these macro prudential regulations also allow a certain flexibility and lenders can exceed these limits when assessing individual cases.  However, the final decision on whether or not to grant a mortgage, or the amount of credit that should be provided in an individual case, remains a commercial matter for an individual lender having regard to its commercial position and other relevant factors.</p></reply>

The IGEES website () presents a range of analytical and statistical outputs from the Service.</p></reply>

On average the Labour Court can provide a hearing date within 13 weeks of referral and deliver a recommendation within three weeks from the date of hearing in industrial relations cases and a determination within six weeks of hearing in employment rights and equality cases. The Court meets that target in 80% of cases. Delays in issuing recommendations/determinations, where they occur, are frequently caused by a failure on the part of parties to provide the Court with all of the information that it requires in order to fairly dispose of a case. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Labour Court is not currently experiencing long delays in issuing its recommendations/determinations. </p>  <p>  As part of the reform programme underway to deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure, the appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. The Labour Court currently has three Divisions. A new Division of the Labour Court is to be established. The Public Appointments Service have finalised the selection process for two new Deputy Chairs of the Labour Court, and following consultation with employer representative groups and trade unions, the Minister will select two additional Ordinary Members. This will facilitate the appointment of an additional Division to the Labour Court. While the Labour Court will have four Divisions, it will be restructured for greater efficiency to allow the Court deal with additional appeals. </p>  <p>  I am confident that these changes will further enhance the efficiency and productivity of the Court and will allow it to cope with an increased caseload without a corresponding increase in its strength.</p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s Scheme of a proposed Consumer Rights Bill which I launched on Monday includes a number of proposals aimed at strengthening the rights of consumers who purchase gift cards. The Scheme provides that contracts for the supply of a gift card or voucher must not include a term that makes the card or voucher subject to an expiry date. Traders would also be required to inform consumers of any charges applying to a gift card, or any restrictions on the use of the card, before the consumer was bound by the contract. The charges applying to a gift card would also be assessable for fairness under the provisions of the Scheme on unfair contract terms. I am prepared to consider additional protections for consumers in this area if the consultation on the Scheme of the Bill shows a need for them.</p>  <p>  The particular gift card referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s question comes within the scope of the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 183/2011) enacted by the Minister for Finance and enforced by the Central Bank. These Regulations deal with the taking up, pursuit, and prudential supervision of electronic money institutions and the issuance and redeemability of electronic money.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-27a.220.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052700080#WRD01400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 to 78, inclusive, together.</p><p>The Beef Data and Genomics Programme (BDGP) forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme and will provide suckler farmers in Ireland with funding of some &euro;300 million over the next 6 years. The BDGP builds on the investment in data recording and genomics in recent years, and will ultimately bring about long-term improvements to the sector by fundamentally improving the genetic quality of the beef herd. It is a unique opportunity for farm participants to improve the efficiency and profitability of their herds, with significant state support.</p><p>It can also make an important contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the national herd and has been approved as an agri-environment measure under the Rural Development Programme. The six year commitment arises from the requirements of the EU Rural Development Regulation under which this scheme is co-funded by the EU and Irish taxpayers. Article 28 of this Regulation stipulates that all agri-environmental schemes must be at least 5 years in duration and farmers will be familiar with multi-annual schemes such as GLAS and REPS where similar conditions apply.</p><p>The six year timeframe for the BDGP provides a guaranteed and stable payment for suckler farmers, allowing them to plan and budget on their farms for the duration of the programme. It is important to note that the penalty system includes appropriate tolerances where only minor non-compliances occur and no penalty will apply in these cases. In more serious cases there must of course be an applicable penalty. However, on balance, I am satisfied that the approach proposed reflects the most proportionate response consistent with the Regulations. The requirement to seek full refund of payment only applies in the event of permanent withdrawal from the scheme. As always in such cases, <i>force majeure </i>clauses have been included in the Terms and Conditions where withdrawal is due to circumstances beyond the applicant&rsquo;s control such as illness or disease. There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.</p><p>Participants in the programme will receive a payment of &euro;142.50 per hectare for the first 6.66 payable hectares under the scheme, and &euro;120 per payable hectare after that. Payment to scheme participants is on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone for each of the actions undertaken. All of the costs to the farmer, including in terms of time and effort, have been factored into the payment for the farmer as agreed with the European Commission. The payment includes a cost associated with the tissue tag sample and subsequent processing, and this genotyping cost will be deducted at source from the farmer&rsquo;s payment. The cost of the genotyping will be finalised following the conclusion of a public tendering process undertaken by the ICBF in relation to laboratory analysis, tissue tags and the DNA chip. It is expected that this will result in a reduced sampling/genotype cost compared to the 2014 scheme</p><p>The number of animals to be genotyped each year will be equal to 60% of the number of calved suckler cows that the applicant had on his/her holding in 2014 &ndash; known as the applicant&rsquo;s &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo;. The number of &ldquo;reference animals&rdquo; will be advised to applicants upon acceptance into the scheme. For example, an applicant with 15 reference animals in 2014 must have sufficient animals to genotype 9 cows/heifers/calves/stock bulls, in each year of the programme, without repetition. In specific circumstances, 2015 may be used as the base year. </p><p>While the level of testing required has increased compared to the 2014 pilot scheme, the payment to the farmer has also increased significantly so the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes. The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP. </p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping also adds value to the breeding indexes.</p><p>The BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose. The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review. If aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission. For now I am satisfied that the scheme provides the long term support that is required to ensure the future sustainability of our suckler herd, within the parameters laid down by the relevant regulations.</p></reply>

The licensing process must take full account of the outcome of that assessment in reaching a determination on any particular licence application.</p><p>The Appropriate Assessment report has been completed by the Marine Institute in respect of Lough Swilly.</p><p>My Department is currently examining the outcomes of the Appropriate Assessment with a view to formulating policy recommendations in respect of individual licences held by operators in the Lough. Such policy recommendations will take account of all national and EU legislative requirements and will reflect engineering, scientific, environmental, legal and public policy aspects of each licence application. This process which is very detailed in nature is ongoing. </p><p>In accordance with protocols governing the Appropriate Assessment procedures my Department has not issued any new aquaculture licences or renewals of same in the designated Natura sites in Lough Swilly.</p><p>My Department is in ongoing communication with the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the EU Commission on all aspects of the Appropriate Assessment process. </p><p>I am aware that some Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the aquaculture sector have, similar to SMEs in other sectors, experienced difficulties in accessing credit in recent years. The Minister for Finance established the Credit Review Office (CRO) to assist SMEs in this situation. The CRO helps SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to &euro;3 million declined or reduced by either Bank of Ireland or AIB, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. They also look at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. This is a strictly confidential process between the business, the CRO and the relevant bank. Further details are available at .</p><p>The European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Regulation (508/2014) and the Fisheries Block Exemption Regulation (1388/2014) are the State Aid instruments that specify what aid may be made available to the seafood sector. These Regulations do not provide any State Aid basis for providing compensation to aquaculture operators whose licence is not renewed or is revoked.</p></reply>

There is also a provision included for transfers by gift or inheritance whereby the transferee can decide to take over the commitments or exit from the programme entirely.</p><p>While the BDGP is an area based payment, the area upon which payment is made is based on the number of suckler cows calving in the herd in 2014. Using a range of 2012-2014 stock numbers would disadvantage some applicants, and on the basis of AIM calf registration data, would appear to increase the burden of testing on average. It was not possible to select a future date because a scheme approved under the RDP could not provide an incentive for increasing stock numbers. Selecting 2014 also adds a measure of administrative simplicity for farmers that will facility early payments under the scheme. The provisions do, however, allow the use of 2015 as an alternative base on an exceptional basis for new entrants or applicants impacted by force majeure circumstances in 2014.  Such farmers should apply for the scheme before the 29 May deadline and the decision regarding whether to use 2015 as basis, where appropriate, will be decided after the closing date for applications. I should also add that the above provisions relate only to the calculation of payment under the BDGP &ndash; there is no restriction on individual farmers increasing their output and cow numbers during the course of the scheme. </p><p>The 60% of the herd that will be genotyped each year represents an increase compared to the 15% under the 2014 Beef Genomic Scheme, however the percentage of the overall payment related to genotyping is broadly the same under both schemes. The 15% genotyping in 2014 was undertaken to develop the training population for genomic which provides the platform for the more widespread application of genomics and higher level of genotyping now made possible under the BDGP.</p><p>The 60% genotyping requirement reflects the need to genotype a high percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that sufficient 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. The 60% requirement will also include pedigree males and cows for ongoing research and knowledge development. This increased level of genotyping improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and, importantly, ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star females required by BDGP herds.</p><p>Finally, I should add that the BDGP is a substantial commitment to the beef sector over the next 6 years and I will continue to monitor its implementation to ensure that it is fit for purpose. The BDGP, like all RDP Schemes, will be subject to mid-term review over the next five years. If that finds that aspects of the scheme can be improved in the future, I will seek to address these issues in consultation with the EU Commission. For now I am satisfied that the scheme provides the long term support that is required to ensure the future sustainability of our suckler herd.</p></reply>

Bord na gCon is a body corporate and a separate legal entity to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that in addition to the Laboratory Services employed at the National Greyhound Laboratory in Limerick, they also engage with the drugs surveillance services of the Laboratory of Government Chemists (LGC) in the United Kingdom, which according to BNG, is one of the world&rsquo;s premier independent drug surveillance laboratories, providing internationally trusted expertise in all aspects of doping control for sports. The LGC has extensive experience working with professionals in animal sports. </p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has informed me that it operates an anti-doping control policy within an intelligence-led framework and that the strategy involved is confidential in the context of enhancing BNG&rsquo;s ability to monitor and control this area effectively. </p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has advised that a total of 128 samples have been sent to LGC since January 2015 and the findings are put before the Control Committee as part of due process and having regard to all of the circumstances in each case before a final determination is made.</p>  <p>  As part of the ongoing regulatory reform, Bord na gCon has completed a public consultation process in relation to the possibility of publication of all adverse laboratory analytical findings at the time the report is received from the laboratory.  Legislative proposals required to give effect to such publication are currently being considered by Bord na gCon.</p>  <p>  Bord na gCon has assured me of its ongoing commitment to a robust regulatory framework based on an intelligence-led strategy. I understand that Bord na gCon is currently finalising a comprehensive review of all aspects relating to integrity, including its sampling and analysis procedures for prohibited substances and medication control.</p>  <p>  Following the review, Bord na gCon will consider amendments to legislation, modify practices and policies as appropriate, and assess whether any improvements can be made to the current anti-doping and medication control structures that are in place. The objective is to ensure that Bord na gCon will conform with the best international practice in this area.</p></reply>

It was designed to allow tourism and business visitors to the UK to add on a visit to Ireland without the need for a separate Irish visa.  Under the Programme certain visas issued by the authorities of the United Kingdom are recognised for the purposes of travel to Ireland. It permits nationals of eighteen countries (including Thailand) who are holders of Short Stay 'C' UK visas i.e. for the purpose of stays of up to six months only, to travel to Ireland, within the time remaining on their current leave to remain in the UK, without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.</p>  <p>  It should be borne in mind, however, that, as the Programme only applies to holders of Short Stay 'C' UK visas and it would appear, from the details supplied by the Deputy, that the person referred to is the holder of a Long Stay UK visa, she would therefore not come within the remit of the Programme.  In such circumstances, the person in question would be required to be in possession of an Irish visa for the purpose of travel to the State.  The visa application will be processed by the Visa Office at the Embassy of Ireland in London.  Guidelines regarding the visa application procedures, and an information note on the Visa Waiver Programme, are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service at www.inis.gov.ie.</p></reply>

An au pair is regarded not as an employee but is received by a family and treated as a family member in exchange for certain services, such as a limited amount of light housework or baby-sitting. This activity is regarded as primarily cultural rather than economic and its main focus is the learning of English by the au pair.</p>  <p>  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation does not issue employment permits to au pairs, child minders or domestic workers and accordingly, there is no immigration permission specifically assigned to these categories of activity.  A non-EEA national who applied to do au pair work or for a visa on this basis would be refused. This does not prevent EU nationals the right to exercise free movement and engaging in this activity.</p>  <p>  However, a person who is granted permission to enter and remain in the State on the basis of being an English language student could undertake an au pair arrangement on the understanding that such an arrangement would not impinge upon, or in any way detract from, the primary purpose of the person&rsquo;s presence in the State, namely as a student. Classes must be attended and evidence of attendance be available for inspection if requested.</p>  <p>  Regulation of working conditions is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I am informed that in situations where a complaint is received involving a person described as an au pair, the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), which comes within his remit, will investigate with a view to establishing the person&rsquo;s statutory entitlements under employment law &ndash; including whether the term &ldquo;au pair&rdquo; is being used to avoid statutory obligations or indeed to get around the fact that the person might actually be a domestic employee and, if a non-EEA national, possibly unlawfully employed.  In such cases NERA will act in accordance with its mandate and powers under employment legislation.</p>  <p>  I understand that officials from my Department (from an immigration perspective), the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and NERA are currently considering the situation with regard to au pairs in Ireland.</p></reply>

The first is where the details are provided by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to submission of an application for a summons in respect of the offence.  Where the driving licence number is so collected, the driving licence number is sent electronically to the Courts Service with the summons application and the licence number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.  Under the second method, the details are collected by the Court Registrar where a licence is produced to the Court at the hearing of the offence.</p>  <p>  As outlined above, if the licence is produced to the Court, the Court Registrar records the licence number and the number is updated to the Courts Service computer system.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has indicated that it is not possible to differentiate between the two methods above to provide statistical data in relation to the number of driving licence numbers actually collected within a Court.  However, the Courts Service has informed me that 7,790 defendants were listed for Court for drink driving prosecutions in 2014 with 983 driving licence numbers recorded.  It should be noted that the information provided by the Courts Service relates to all drink driving prosecutions in 2014, whether or not the summons was served.  In addition, some of the prosecutions may be ongoing.</p>  <p>  I am informed that where an accused is summonsed to appear before a Court in respect of a penalty point offence and is convicted of the offence, if a driving licence is not produced to the Court, the Court Registrar records on the Court Minute Book or on the summons that no driving licence was produced.  The non-production of the driving licence is recorded whether or not the accused appears before the Court.  The Courts Service computer system does not currently support the updating of data in relation to the non-production of driving licences in Court.  I want to assure the Deputy that my Department is in contact with the relevant agencies with a view to ensuring that the most efficient and effective processing and recording of data in respect of non-production of licences is in place. I am informed that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service are actively engaged in a process that will facilitate prosecution of those who fail to produce a driving licence or permit and the copy of a licence or permit before the Courts.  The Courts Service and the Garda personnel required, in accordance with agreed procedures, have been identified and it is expected that cases will come before the Courts for hearing in the coming months.</p></reply>

The General Scheme includes wide ranging provisions to enhance the protection of children and vulnerable persons from sexual abuse and exploitation.  In addition, the Bill will provide for new offences of purchasing, in the context of prostitution, sexual services.</p>  <p>  The first is a general offence of purchasing sexual services which carries a penalty of a fine of up to &euro;500 for a first offence and fines of up to &euro;1000 for a second or subsequent offence.  The second is the more serious offence of purchasing a sexual service from a trafficked person and carries a potential penalty of up to 5 years imprisonment and/or a fine.  In both cases, the person selling the sexual service will not be subject to an offence.</p>  <p>  These proposals have been developed following extensive consultation, initiated by my Department, dating back to 2012.  The new offences also implement the recommendation from the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence which called for the introduction of an offence criminalising the purchase of sexual services.</p>  <p>  The Bill is priority legislation and is currently being drafted, with a view to publication in this parliamentary session.</p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the existing legislative provisions addressing the trafficking of persons for the purpose of exploitation (including sexual exploitation) which can attract significant penalties.  Under the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008, any person found guilty of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation shall be liable to imprisonment for a period up to life.  It is also an offence for a person to solicit or importune a trafficked person for the purposes of prostitution with a potential penalty of imprisonment for up to 5 years.</p></reply>

The Act provides that the Service is independent in the performance of its functions, including the provision of courthouse facilities.</p>  <p>  Formal requests for the hearing of evidence by video conference in criminal matters can be made under the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.  If my Department receives such a request and is satisfied that all is in order, a request is sent to the Courts Service to provide a courtroom with video-link services to facilitate the taking of evidence from a victim or witness for a criminal trial in another jurisdiction. Separately, my Department contacts the President of the District Court to request that a District Court Judge be assigned to preside over the hearing of evidence in the Irish Court.</p>  <p>  For civil proceedings it is not necessary for the person who is giving evidence from Ireland by way of video-conference to a foreign court to do so from an Irish court room. Furthermore, if persons giving such evidence were to do so from an Irish court it would be necessary to defer or interrupt cases going through the Irish courts, thus increasing waiting times for litigation.

The Government accepted all of the recommendations of the Ryan Report, and in response developed an Implementation Plan. The Implementation Plan set out a series of 99 actions which addressed the recommendations to improve services to children in care, in detention and at risk.</p><p>The Government has approved the Fourth and Final Monitoring Report of the Ryan Implementation Group which illustrated that the vast majority of the recommendations (i.e. 94 out of a total of 99), have been implemented or are being implemented on an ongoing basis. The Report, which was published in March 2015, is available on the websites of my Department and the Oireachtas.  It should also be noted that the Monitoring Group, which authored the Report, welcomed the significant positive developments that have taken place over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan. </p><p>I share the concern of the Monitoring Group that five of the actions are incomplete. These incomplete actions are in relation to the erection of a memorial to the survivors of institutional abuse; a longitudinal study of children in care; the maintenance of records of children in care and the development of an archive for same, and research into best practice in family law court processes. As the Government has committed to the full implementation of all 99 of the Implementation Plan actions, I will continue to liaise with relevant Government colleagues and the Child and Family Agency as regards implementation and I have also undertaken to keep the Government informed of progress until full implementation is achieved.</p><p>I presume that the Deputy is referring to Action 69 of the Ryan Implementation Plan which states that <i>&quot;the OMCYA, in conjunction with the HSE, will consider how best to provide necessary once-off supports for care leavers to gain practical life-long skills&quot;.</i></p><p>Young people leaving the care of the State at 18 years of age are entitled to an aftercare service. Aftercare is the term used to describe the planning and support put in place to meet the needs of such young people to assist them in making the transition to independent living. Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical (including accommodation and financial) support. Advocating on behalf of young people to support their development as fulfilled adults in their community and, when necessary, to link them to targeted adult services, are also crucial elements of an aftercare service.</p><p>It has been decided to strengthen the legislative provisions regarding aftercare. The Child Care Act 1991 is to be amended to impose a statutory duty on the Child and Family Agency to prepare an aftercare plan for an eligible child or eligible young person. The aim is to create an explicit, as opposed to implicit, statement of the Agency&rsquo;s duty to satisfy itself as to the child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s need for assistance by preparing a plan that identifies those needs for aftercare supports.</p><p>It is anticipated that the Aftercare Bill will be published shortly. </p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people. It is estimated that the voluntary youth services throughout the country involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2015, current funding of &euro;49.93m has been provided to my Department for these schemes.</p>  <p>  The funding for local youth projects and services is administered in the main by Education and Training Boards. In Dublin City, City of Dublin Youth Service Board under City of Dublin Education and Training Board undertakes this role. Some eighty local projects and services are in receipt of funding under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and Local Drugs Task Force Projects and &euro;10m in 2015 has been allocated to City of Dublin Youth Service Board for distribution to the projects.</p>  <p>  An allocation of &euro;407,267 in 2015 has been made by my Department to the Stoneybatter Youth Service, unchanged from 2014. </p>  <p>  The Stoneybatter Youth Service provides youth services to young people aged 10 to 21 years in the Stoneybatter area, particularly targeting those affected by a range of economic and social factors. </p>  <p>  My Department works closely with City of Dublin Youth Service Board and Education and Training Boards throughout the country in the administration of youth services. In determining the annual allocations to youth programmes, in the challenging budgetary situation that has applied in recent years, my Department has sought to ensure that, as far as possible, the focus was maintained on the frontline youth services, particularly those for vulnerable young people.  </p>  <p>  With regard to the details requested by the Deputy about the employment arrangements and assignment of youth work staff employed in the Stoneybatter Youth Service by City of Dublin Education and Training Board, officials of my Department are making enquiries in the matter and I will revert to the Deputy as soon as the reply is received.</p></reply>

The regulations stipulate that all care plans are to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis and sets out the frequency for these reviews to take place. A review of the care planned for a child under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, is a process to monitor and review the progress of the plan and to update it if required.  A key consideration for the social worker is to consult with the child, family members, foster carers, and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met and that the care being provided is optimal.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that where a review is underway, the existing care plan remains in place.  When reporting on the number of care plans in place, Tusla only includes figures for care plans that are currently up to date and does not include those under review.</p>  <p>  In putting together its practice handbook, Tusla took into account the regulatory requirements and listened to children who were in care.  This consultation showed that the perception of the children involved was that reviews were not working as well as they should and the child friendly aspect could be improved.  This has been highlighted in Tusla's practice handbook to ensure that reviews are designed for all the participant's voices to be heard and that the child is, in every practical way, at the heart of the process.</p></reply>

Preliminary screening is aimed at establishing the appropriateness of the referral to Tusla services and if necessary is followed by an initial assessment of the concern to determine the best course of action for the child and their family.  At any stage, if a determination is made that there is abuse, whether physical, emotional, sexual or neglect, from which there is an ongoing risk of significant harm, the child protection pathway is followed.   This may lead to the child being placed on the child protection notification system (CPNS).</p>  <p>  In accordance with Children First National Guidance and the Agency's standard business processes, a child's name is placed on the Child Protection Notification System (CPNS) in the following circumstances:</p>  <p>  -  Following the child protection conference, where the end decision is that a  child protection plan is required to ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place;</p>  <p>  -  Where a review child protection conference - held at a minimum of 6 monthly intervals - confirms that the child remains at ongoing risk of significant harm necessitating a child protection plan.</p>  <p>  The protection plan for a child can involve a range of interventions and services provided by Tusla directly, through commissioned services or provided by other State bodies, including mental health services for the child and parent, family therapy, courses to support parenting skills, addiction services and other family supports.  A child protection conference is a interagency meeting that will draw on the expertise of relevant professionals and persons involved in the child's care, and, where possible, seek the views of the child.  Every effort is made to minimise the disruption to the life of the child in their community.  However, if a protection plan is reviewed and it is found that it is not being effective in keeping a child safe, then the option to take the child into care is given further consideration.</p></reply>

Cyberbullying is just one aspect of bullying, but one given the rapid expansion of access to technology by young people has come much more sharply into focus.</p>  <p>   It is important for parents to talk to children about bullying whether it is through social media or not.  Data gathered from nine year old children as part of Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Survey commissioned by my Department, showed that based on responses from their mothers, 24% of children had been victims of bullying in the past year. This represents a significantly lower proportion than that reported by children themselves, which was reported at 40%, suggesting either that many parents are unaware that their child has experienced bullying in the previous year, or that they may have different perspectives about what constitutes bullying.</p>  <p>  Schools are strengthening collaboration and interaction with youth services and promote the active participation by pupils in youth focused services within their local communities. DCYA supports the National Youth Health Programme which is in partnership with the HSE and the National Youth Council of Ireland. The programme's aims are to provide a broad-based, flexible health promotion/education support and training service to youth organisations and to all those working with young people in out-of-school settings, and includes programmes aimed at exploring bullying and cyberbullying with young people</p>  <p>  The Minister of Communications established an Internet Content Governance Advisory Group under the chair of Dr. Brian O&rsquo;Neil in 2013 to ensure our national policy represents best practice in offering the same online protections to our citizens as those available in the offline world. The Group&rsquo;s report was approved by Cabinet and published in May 2014 and makes several recommendations aimed at protecting children and young people without unduly limiting their opportunities and rights online.  Along with changes to institutional, administrative and legal structures, the report makes four specific recommendations on cyberbullying, aimed at providing stronger supports for tackling this issue through primary and post-primary curricula, and additional training and awareness measures</p>  <p>  The Office for Internet Safety is an Executive Office of the Department of Justice and Equality and has been established by the Government to take a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children. As part of its work it holds an annual Safer Internet Day, which has included a rollout of a social marketing campaign specifically targeted at young people.</p></reply>

Under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, only children may be received into care and this can be up to the age of 18 years.  </p><p>Children who are received into care, depending on their identified need, may be placed in foster care either with relatives or general foster carers, residential care, special care or other placement types.  The majority of these children are in stable placements, with over 92% of children in care currently in foster family setting.  Residential settings represent most of the remaining placements, usually between 5 and 8% of all children in care.  A residential setting will typically have 3 to 4 children in residence, who are usually older teenagers, allowing for their individual needs to be met.  Regulations under the Child Care Act 1991, as amended, underpin a number of safeguards for children in care, including the frequency of reviews of care plans and of visits by social workers to the child's care setting.  In addition there are standards in place for foster and residential placements and there is a regime of regular monitoring and inspections.</p><p>Data, made available by Tusla, on children in care are on the basis of the type of care placement that is involved.  Tusla does not provide data on the residence of the child at the time of the referral.  However, feedback from practice information and from the independent inspection regime of the Health Information and Quality Authority shows that the most likely source of risks that lead to a child protection response is located in the wider community.  </p><p>Tusla's data shows that in 2013, it received a total of 41,599 referrals, of which 19,407 related to abuse referrals.  Figures to date for 2014 indicate that there had been 14,112 abuse referrals out of a total of 32,687 referrals up to the end of quarter three.  It should be noted that more than one referral can be received in relation to a child so referrals data does not equate to the number of children that come to the attention of Tusla.</p><p>Data published in recent years indicate that the numbers of children entering care has been decreasing.  This indicates that the increase in the number of children in care seen between 2012 and 2013 is a result of fewer children leaving care during the period.  Tusla has reported that the number of children in care at year end, and most recently up to the end of February 2015, are as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015 (to end of Feb)</th></tr><tr><td>Children in Care</td><td>6,332</td><td>6,462</td><td>6,449</td><td>6,393</td></tr></table></p></reply>

My Department provides funding to Kildare Youth Services under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme in respect of six local youth projects in Athy, Naas, Leixlip, Newbridge, the Curragh and Kildare town and a Youth Information Centre in Naas.  In addition, Kildare Youth Hub, Kildare Town has received approval under the 2013 Capital Scheme for the development of a new youth caf&eacute; facility.  Officials of my Department continue to be available to meet with youth services to discuss any issues that arise for them in the provision of local services within the budgets available.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-05-27a.361.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015052700082#WRF03500"><p>It is important to note that a range of rehabilitative supports is offered to every child entering the children detention schools as part of an overall programme, focused on their individual needs. The extent to which each child avails of these services depends on the individual profile in each case. </p>  <p>  On admission, every child is assigned a specific member of staff who acts as the child&rsquo;s "keyworker". The focus is on developing supportive relationships with the main emphasis placed on education and rehabilitation rather than on control and security.  Each child is also the subject of an individual screening to determine any clinical services required, such as psychology, psychiatry or speech and language therapy.  A &ldquo;Placement Plan&rdquo; is developed and reviewed at regular intervals during each child&rsquo;s stay in detention. This ensures that all relevant supports that may be available in the community on a child&rsquo;s release are put in place. The plan identifies responses to the identified needs of a child on release and names persons willing to assist in the rehabilitative process. </p>  <p>  In addition, a strong ethos of school attendance, education and training is in place in the children detention schools, tailored to each child's individual needs.  Education and training services are provided by the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  </p>  <p>  The key principles of the Children Act 2001 are that detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort. Among the other options that may be considered are the programmes provided by the Probation Service and Garda Youth Diversion Programme.  In 2012, a total of 12,246 children were referred to the Garda Diversion Programme and a total of 134 children were either remanded or sentenced to a period of detention in the children detention schools. This would indicate that when all children in contact with the criminal justice system are considered, there is an emphasis on the promotion of non-custodial options as a first priority.</p></reply>

With regards to the welfare of children in Direct Provision centres, there are a range of supports available to families resident within the centres facilitated by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, as well as other bodies such as the Department of Education, Department of Social Protection, Department of Health and the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA). </p>  <p>  The Child and Family Services unit within RIA that monitors the child and family services for asylum seekers is headed up by a seconded member of Tusla and links, where necessary, directly with An Garda S&iacute;ochana. RIA and other State service providers, particularly the HSE and the Child and Family Agency, link in with Direct Provision centres to provide on-site monitoring of children and families through services including Public Health Nurse and GPs.</p>  <p>  The needs of children in direct provision include education, child care such as preschool, medical and health issues.  Tusla provide a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes family support workers, social workers, youth workers, family resource centres, support groups and counselling services.  Preschools under Tusla have monitoring and inspection systems in place, according to national regulation and standards.  While children living in Direct Provision are in their parents' care, any concerns about the welfare, safety or well-being of a child in Direct Provision are reported to the Child and Family Agency in line with Children First guidelines.  Referrals include welfare concerns such as a parent being hospitalised, parental illness, a child being left unsupervised by an adult or mental health concerns regarding the parent, while a smaller number would relate to child protection concerns. </p>  <p>  The Department of Justice and Equality has established a Working Group to review a range of issues pertaining to the protection process, including Direct Provision and supports to asylum seekers.  The first meeting of the Working Group on the Protection Process was held on the 10th November 2014, chaired by Judge McMahon.  A representative from my Department sits on this Working Group.  I look forward to learning of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group in summer of 2015.</p>  <p>  There has been correspondence between my Department and the CEO of the Child and Family Agency on Direct Provision, and this issue will be kept under review in the context of my overarching responsibility for child protection generally.</p></reply>

The Department of Social Protection have the lead role in delivery on a child poverty target and are the Sponsor of outcome 4 of Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - economic security and opportunity.  </p><p>This child target relates to lifting over 70,000 children out of consistent poverty by 2020, a reduction of at least two-thirds on the 2011 level.  In order to meet this target 101,000 children will need to be lifted out of poverty by 2020.  The Department of Social Protection also has lead responsibility for the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.  </p><p>Through social transfers, the at-risk-of-poverty rate for children is reduced from 45.5 per cent to 17.9 per cent in 2013 a poverty reduction effect of 60.7 per cent.  The comparable figure in 2008 was 56.6%. Ireland remains one of the best performing EU countries in reducing child poverty through social transfers, according to Eurostat data.  </p><p>The Government is implementing a whole-of-government, multi-dimensional approach to tackling child poverty.  This builds on the life-cycle approach in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 and is informed by the European Commission&rsquo;s Recommendation, &lsquo;Investing in Children, Breaking the Cycle of Disadvantage&rsquo;.</p><p>To inform the development of a mutli-dimensional approach to tackling child poverty, a national seminar on &lsquo;Investing in children &ndash; breaking the cycle of disadvantage&rsquo; was held with the European Commission and attended by national stakeholders in November 2014.  My Department continues to work closely with the Department of Social Protection supporting this mutli-dimensional approach to child poverty.</p><p>The Government acknowledges the challenge in successfully achieving the child poverty target, but remains committed to meeting it.  The timescale for achieving the target will be influenced by the pace of economic and employment growth.  However, we believe having an ambitious target and actively monitoring it will provide a roadmap towards which we can develop and implement a strong multi-dimensional policy response.</p><p>As regards my own Department there are a number of areas of focus that support this response to child poverty.  My Department invests &euro;260 million annually on early childhood care and education and after-school support programmes which provide care to 100,000 children. A number of these programmes are targeted at those on lowest incomes. In addition in early 2015, I established an Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Early Years and After-School Care and Education.  The work of the group is focused on identifying policy objectives to guide future investment in this area.  </p><p>My Department is also leading the implementation of the Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme (2013-2016).  The ABC Programme is co-funded by Atlantic Philanthropies and will have a total funding allocation of up to &euro;29.7 million.  The ABC Programme draws on best international practice to break the cycle of child poverty where it is most deeply entrenched, and improve the outcomes for children and young people and existing services.</p><p>My Department also provides targeted support for disadvantaged, marginalised and at risk young people provided through a range of schemes totalling &euro;49.93m of funding.  The forthcoming National Youth Strategy will ensure that the social inclusion of young people is a key objective.  </p><p>Finally, as part of my Department's response, Tusla, the child and family agency is also responsible for the delivery of educational welfare services which involves intensive intervention and a multidisciplinary approach to address the child's needs and support school attendance.  During this period the School Completion Programme provided targeted support to approximately 36,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving across 124 community based programmes.  </p><p>Tusla also provides a range of services that offer advice and support to families.  This includes over 100 family resource centres.  The aim of the Family Resource Centre Programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the functioning of the family unit.  The Programme emphasises involving local communities in tackling the problems they face, and creating successful partnerships between voluntary and statutory agencies at community level.</p></reply>

The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed by the Department of Health and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association for the assessment of new medicines. </p>  <p>  An Expert Group, chaired by the Clinical Lead of the HSE Diabetes Programme, was convened by the HSE to (i) assess the clinical evidence to support the use of the product, (ii) consider whether the product is appropriate for reimbursement status under Schemes and (iii) assist in the determination of the &lsquo;value&rsquo; that the innovation presents. The Expert Group did not find that the product was either clinically effective or cost effective, and therefore did not recommend that the product should be reimbursed.  The Director of Primary Care accepted the recommendation of the Expert Group and the company was informed of the HSE's decision on the 20 April 2015.</p></reply>

It is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years).  The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, where these children go to school or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties.</p>  <p>  The Programme is a key priority for the HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Directorate.  An additional &euro;4m was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts, and further investment in the Programme will take place in 2015.  Further investment of &euro;4m will be made in 2015 (equating to &euro;6m in a full year).</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the Executive to provide the Deputy with the detailed information that he has requested.

It is true that costs for public nursing homes are higher than in the private sector and vary considerably even within the public system.  There are valid factors for a difference, in that more complex and highly dependent residents are often catered for by the public system, and conditions of employment and tenure etc. are different too.</p>  <p>  It is however, important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible and towards that end, the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities.

Applications for a new round of funding, which commenced on 1 July 2014, were subject to an appraisal process. 55 applications were approved for funding for the two-year period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2016.  A number of previously funded organisations were not approved for funding on this occasion.</p><p>On 18 July 2014, it was announced that bridging funding of &euro;1.4million would be allocated for a twelve month period to a number of previously funded health, disability and other organisations that were not approved for funding under the new scheme, pending the carrying out of a review of the public funding of national organisations in the health and disability sector.</p><p>On 25 May 2015 I announced that that funding will be provided from 1 July this year to t 30 June 2016 to a number of health, disability and other organisations, including the Irish Deaf Society following a review in relation to the impact of the cessation of their current funding on 30 June 2015.</p><p>Funding of &euro;1.32 million is being made available for this 12 month period to organisations, currently funded under a bridging scheme which was put in place to support the majority of organisations who were unsuccessful in their applications under the Scheme to Support National Organisations (SSNO) but had received funding previously from it up to 30 June 2014 and submitted a valid application in 2014.  This further support will be based on current levels of funding to the organisations in question and is being provided through a Developmental Scheme to Support National Organisations. The funding to be provided to each organisation is set out in the table below.</p><p>It is envisaged that the new Scheme to Support National Organisations will be advertised in early 2016 and all groups will be required to apply for funding under the Scheme and meet the criteria required for funding.  The funding over the next 12 months will give time for organisations to prepare their applications.<table><tr><th>Association</th><th>Bridging Funding Provided 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015</th></tr><tr><td>Arthritis Ireland </td><td>53,882 </td></tr><tr><td>Asperger Syndrome Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Asthma Society of Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Breaking Through Limited </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Chronic Pain Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>Dyslexia Association of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Genetic and Inherited Disorders Organisation Ltd </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>GROW in Ireland </td><td>16,580 </td></tr><tr><td>Huntington's Disease Association of Ireland Limited </td><td>19,066 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Deaf Society The National Association of the Deaf Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Heart Foundation </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Mountain Rescue Association </td><td>58,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish National Council of Attention Deficit Disorder Support (INCADDS) </td><td>33,158 </td></tr><tr><td>Irish Stammering Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Migraine Association of Ireland Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Motor Neuron disease Association </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>MOVE Ireland </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Muintir na T&iacute;re </td><td>70,462 </td></tr><tr><td>Muscular Dystrophy Ireland </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland Limited </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>National Association for Youth Drama Ltd </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>New Communities Partnership (NCP) Ltd </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Peter Bradley Foundation Limited </td><td>41,448 </td></tr><tr><td>Post Polio Support Group Limited </td><td>24,868 </td></tr><tr><td>Safe Ireland </td><td>74,606 </td></tr><tr><td>Show Racism The Red Card Limited </td><td>29,014 </td></tr><tr><td>Suas Educational Development </td><td>37,304 </td></tr><tr><td>The Alzheimer Society of Ireland </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Carers Association Limited </td><td>62,172 </td></tr><tr><td>The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Neurological Alliance of Ireland </td><td>49,738 </td></tr><tr><td>The Union of Voluntary Organisations of People with Disabilities </td><td>45,592 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

By June 2002, Wicklow County Council investigations concluded that in excess of 200,000 tonnes of waste material had been dumped at the site. Wicklow County Council also requested the assistance of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation conducted an investigation. There have been a number of criminal convictions subsequent to the Garda investigation.</p><p>This site was cited in the European Court of Justice Judgment in Case C - 494/01 as an example of Ireland&rsquo;s failure to comply with the 1975 Waste Framework Directive.  My Department, on behalf of the State, has been liaising with the European Commission to ensure that the requirements of the judgment are fully met and it is in these circumstances that my Department, in June 2011, requested Wicklow County Council to remediate the site, pursuant to its powers under section 56 of the Waste Management Act 1996.</p><p>In response, the Council, working with the EPA, established a technical working group (TWG) to oversee a programme of detailed investigation and processing methodology of the areas of illegal waste at the Whitestown site.  The TWG agreed a programme for the remediation of the site which involved waste removal and capping of the effected site zones.  The excavation of waste from Zones A and B was completed during September 2014, with some 120,000 tonnes of mixed waste and soil excavated and processed, while the capping of Zone C was finalised last November.  Due to poor weather conditions, the final landscaping of the site is now being completed and should be finalised next month. </p><p>Full details with respect to the background of the site, the role of the TWG, the tier 3 risk assessment undertaken, the remediation works proposed, methodology employed and status of the project are publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>The European Commission have been fully briefed at all stages of the remediation process and have expressed their satisfaction as to the progress being made.  The cost of remediation is being funded by the State, with Wicklow County Council seeking cost recovery through the Courts.  As the matter is the subject of on-going legal proceedings, I do not propose to comment further.</p></reply>

Environ&rsquo;s role includes, but is not limited to:</p><p>-  the carrying out of onsite monitoring including spot checks on the construction activities of the Corrib Partners to determine compliance with the consent conditions;</p><p>-  reporting on a regular basis to my Department;</p><p>-  attending meetings of the Consent Conditions Monitoring Committee established pursuant to the above consents; and</p><p>-  liaising with other relevant authorities with respect to ensuring the implementation of the consent conditions.</p><p>I will arrange to have a copy of the Terms of Reference for this consultancy forwarded to the Deputy.</p><p>Responsibility for adherence to the conditions of the mentioned consents is a matter for the developer and Environ&rsquo;s role is to assist my Department in monitoring compliance by the developer. </p><p>The contract awarded to Environ UK Limited commenced in June 2011.  The total sum of payments made to date under the contract in respect of invoices submitted by Environ to the Department for the period June 2011 to March 2015 inclusive, is &euro;772,624.80 (including VAT).</p><p>The consents granted to Shell Exploration and Production Ireland Ltd (SEPIL) provide that costs incurred by my Department in monitoring compliance with those consents may be recouped from the developer.  To date a total of &euro;738,961 has been reimbursed from SEPIL in respect of fees/VAT payable in respect of the Environ contract for the period June 2011 to January 2015 inclusive.  A request for a further reimbursement of fees covering the period February to June 2015 will be issued to SEPIL in mid July 2015. </p><p>As mentioned, the requirement for SEPIL to reimburse my Department for costs incurred results from a consent condition and there is not a separate contract with SEPIL governing this.  The committee established by my Department to assist it in monitoring compliance with the consents is called the Consents Conditions Monitoring Committee.  The committee mentioned by the Deputy, the Project Monitoring Committee, is a committee established by Mayo County Council.</p></reply>

Accordingly I have referred the question to the agency for direct reply.  Please contact my private office if a response is not received within ten working days.</p><p>All tourism businesses can also avail of the supports and services offered by Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) nationwide.  The LEOs are the 'first stop shop' for people interested in starting up a new business or already in business.  They provide advice, information and support in starting up or growing a business and have the most up-to-date information on supports and services across all state agencies and bodies &ndash; see .  Both F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the LEOs can advise tourism businesses as to their eligibility or otherwise in relation to various tourism-related tax schemes, including the Startup Relief for Entrepreneurs (SURE) and the Employment Investment Incentive (EII) schemes.</p></reply>
