Nonetheless, the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage are kept under ongoing review having regard to the resources available to my Department.  Funding for the protection of built heritage will continue to be provided by my Department via a number of measures, which will be either directly administered or delivered through local authorities and agencies.  <br/><br/>In 2014, my Department was provided with an allocation of &euro;5m Capital Stimulus funding for a new Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme to assist with works to safeguard protected structures, in private and civic ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000-2012.  <br/><br/>In 2011, 2012 and 2013, my Department operated a <i>Structures at Risk</i>Fund to assist with works to safeguard structures protected under the Act, where an urgent need for works to such structures had arisen and had been demonstrated.  Both of these schemes were administered by local authorities.<br/><br/>My Department also provided funding for conservation works to heritage structures in State care in 2014 and previous years.This funding supported works to structures both under the management of the Office of Public Works and in local authority ownership or management.<br/><br/>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  <br/><br/>Finally, my Department provides support for the Irish Heritage Trust, which has a mandate to acquire for public access important heritage properties where the State does not wish to acquire them directly and where there is imminent risk to their heritage value.</p></reply>

This allocation will support a wide range of activities and events by interested groups, including local community groups and the arts.  There will also be a special emphasis on education projects, as recommended by the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations.<br/><br/>A widespread public consultation process is now underway in order to encourage and facilitate the involvement of ground-up initiatives in the wider commemorative programme.  I look forward to working with the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations, the Expert Advisory Group and a wide range of stakeholders over the coming 18 months to make the events of Easter 2016 a very special and poignant tribute to all those involved.</p></reply>

This brought to an end the cycle of unavoidable cuts that have taken place at all of our national cultural institutions in recent years, as the Government worked to rebalance the public finances.</p><p> I was, of course, aware of particular funding issues that continued to exist and I have been engaged in ongoing discussions with Chairs and senior management at a number of our cultural institutions, including the National Museum, about addressing those challenges. I was delighted, therefore, to be able to announce last week that I have secured an agreement with the Minister for Public and Reform Expenditure, Brendan Howlin TD, to provide an additional &euro;2 million in funding for the National Cultural Institutions as part of the Revised Estimates, to be published later this month. </p><p>  The additional funding secured will be used to deal with a number of issues across the cultural institutions. I believe that it gives more certainty to the institutions and will allow them to continue to deliver on their core objectives, while attracting large numbers of people through their doors, including overseas and domestic tourists.</p><p>  Our national cultural institutions are an essential component of our cultural fabric. Through their collections and exhibitions, they make a huge contribution to our society. I can assure the Deputy of the Government's interest in, and continuing support for, our national cultural institutions and I remain hopeful that, notwithstanding the continuing pressure on the State's finances, it will prove possible to ease the resource constraints on the institutions even further in the future.</p><p>  With regard to the issue of the National Museum remaining open from January next, I am aware that the Museum has issued a statement to the effect that its four sites are, and will remain, open to visitors, and that media reports that the sites face closure are incorrect.</p></reply>

Dublin, is privately owned and there are no proposals to take it into State ownership. </p><p>  The site is, however, subject to a Preservation Order under section 8 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended.  The effect of the Preservation Order is that any works affecting the site require my consent, as Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, under section 14 of the Act.  In that context, consent was recently given to the landowner for the replacement of the perimeter fence to facilitate agricultural activity and to protect the site from alleged incidences of anti-social behaviour. The monument is regularly inspected by my Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service. </p><p>  The offer to provide advice or guidance to the landowners or to Fingal County Council on any matter relating to the protection of the national monument, as referred to by the Deputy, was made in the context of my Department&rsquo;s understanding of contacts between the parties with regard to public access to the site.  My Department has not received any communication from either party in the meantime.  </p><p>  I am generally supportive of all initiatives that may help to facilitate greater public access to our archaeological heritage.  My Department&rsquo;s National Monuments Service continues to be available to discuss any archaeological protection issues that might arise in that context with regard to this particular monument.</p></reply>

Guidelines in this regard have just been published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I am now working to implement this revised model in my Department..<br/><br/>In that context, and in order to ensure that the boards of our national cultural institutions possess a suitable mix of skills to address the numerous challenges that they face, I am working with the Chairs of the institutions and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to develop appropriate criteria for the filling of vacancies on these boards, as they arise. This process will take account of such issues as<br/><br/>(i) specialist skills and technical knowledge required;<br/><br/>(ii) relevant experience/sectoral expertise;<br/><br/>(iii) educational and other qualifications;<br/><br/>(iv) particular personal attributes; and<br/><br/>(v) the range of skills of existing board members<br/><br/>I have written already to the Chairs of the national cultural institutions asking them to set out the skill sets that they consider relevant for people who might sit on their boards.  When I have received their views, I will consider the matter further in conjunction with PAS with a view to developing the criteria for assessing candidates to fill vacancies on the various boards, as they arise. I anticipate that the skill sets will be published in due course by PAS in the context of inviting candidates to apply for particular vacancies.</p></reply>

The package includes a gas/electricity allowance of &euro;35 per month and a free television licence which is normally &euro;160 per year.

The electricity or gas allowance of &euro;35 per month is also paid to 415,000 customers at an estimated cost of &euro;230 million in 2014. </p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, exceptional needs payments may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which customers are unable to meet out of their own resources; this may include exceptional heating costs. There is also a special heating supplement, paid to assist people with special heating needs because of ill health or infirmity. The provision for exceptional needs payments in 2014 is &euro;31.3 million, with an additional &euro;9.8 million for supplements. </p><p>  It is recognised in the Government&rsquo;s Energy Affordability Strategy that the best way to tackle fuel poverty in the long term is to improve the energy efficiency of the dwelling. The Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme, administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty. Measures available include draught proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation, and are free of charge to the customer.</p></reply>

The legislation governing the use of the PPS Number is contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 (as amended).  Under social welfare legislation, only bodies specified in statute or their agents can use the PPS Number.  It is an offence for any person or body to request or hold a record of a PPS Number unless they are permitted by law to do so. </p><p>  There is no basis for a prospective employer to capture a candidate's PPS Number at the application stage.  An employer should only seek a PPS Number if the person is successful at recruitment stage and is actually taking up employment with the organisation.  At that point an employer requires the PPS Number of the employee for Revenue purposes.  When it comes to the attention of my department that an employer is inappropriately requesting PPS numbers my Department contacts the organisation in question informing the organisation that they are not permitted to request the PPS Number at the job application stage and informing them to take the action necessary (including the destruction of the PPS Numbers collected) to remedy the situation.  They are also requested to advise my Department when this has been done. If no response is received, the organisation is contacted again.  The experience of my Department to date has been that implementing the procedure outlined above has resulted in full compliance.  As a result, my Department has no record of any organisation not becoming fully compliant once the issue has been highlighted to them.</p><p>  In relation to the particular case referred to by the Deputy, my Department has both written to and telephoned the organisation in question in recent days informing it that it is not permitted to request the PPS Number at the job application stage, informing it to take the action necessary (including the destruction of the PPS Numbers collected) to remedy the situation, and requesting it to advise my Department when this has been done.  I wish to assure the Deputy that, as in all such cases, the matter will be pursued vigorously to ensure compliance.</p></reply>

This requirement is often referred to as the funding standard.  This standard provides a benchmark against which the &ldquo;health &ldquo;of a scheme can be tested.  Where a scheme fails to meet this requirement the trustees of the scheme are required to submit a funding proposal to the Pensions Authority setting out how it is proposed to restore scheme funding. </p><p>  A range of legislative measures have been put in place in recent years to help employers and the trustees of schemes to secure the sustainability of those schemes.  One of these measures is a requirement on pension schemes to maintain an additional level of funding in the form of a risk reserve to protect the interest of scheme members against future volatility in financial markets.  This requirement will come into effect from 2016.</p><p>  As pensions accounting figures are based on volatile corporate bond yields, the resulting figures are volatile from year to year.  This is especially true of accounting deficit or surplus figures.  It has been the case, since 2000-2003, and in particular since the 2008 financial crisis, that many DB schemes are struggling financially.</p><p>  As a result of the measures put in place in recent years, almost all defined benefits pension schemes are either meeting the funding standard or are on a recovery plan with the objective of meeting the funding standard.  These measures have been put in place not only with the objective of removing or minimising State exposure, but with ensuring that schemes meet their objective of paying benefits to members.</p><p>  It is possible that the State would be exposed to the risk of financial loss under conditions of double insolvency, i.e., where a sponsoring employer and an associated underfunded defined benefit scheme goes into windup.  The changes made to the Pensions Act in 2013 addressed this situation specifically and carefully in a manner designed to support such schemes, particularly the pensioner members, without placing an enormous burden on the taxpayer.</p><p>  Due to the 2013 legislation which placed boundaries on the situation, the exposure to the State is now considered relatively modest and is expected to diminish as more and more schemes improve their funding position and meet the funding standard.</p><p>  My officials have taken steps to ensure that pensions scheme financial data is submitted to the Pensions Authority more regularly than previously, enabling my Department to closely monitor the situation on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  Expenditure on FIS for 2014 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;280 million and it is currently paid to some 49,000 families in respect of almost 109,000 children. </p><p>  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment. However, in the following two circumstances, the weekly rate of FIS can be revised during the year:</p><p>  - If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks.</p><p>  - If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit, then the FIS rate can be reassessed to take account of the loss of their one-parent family payment.</p><p>  The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings. A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period. This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities. For those who experience a reduction in their income over the course of the year, the rate of payment will be reassessed at the end of the 52 weeks upon renewal of a FIS claim. This aspect of the FIS scheme is also important in minimising the administrative effort associated with the operation of this scheme and helps to speed up processing times for claims for FIS, which could otherwise be subject to delays due to frequent reviews.</p><p>  I have no plans to change the existing arrangements.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only.<br/><br/>MIS is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of his or her mortgage interest, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  The minimum contribution for couples towards MIS increased from &euro;35 to &euro;40 per week (since 1 January 2014). This change applies to new and existing recipients.</font><br/><br/>Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.<br/><br/>The rate of interest payable by the person referred to by the Deputy is less than the weekly minimum contribution for a couple of &euro;40 per week, therefore the person referred to is no longer eligible for a mortgage interest supplement.</p></reply>

The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, Section 201 provides the legal basis for exceptional needs payments.  Entitlement to an exceptional needs payment for funeral expenses is discretionary.  The primary consideration in determining that a payment is warranted is that there is an inability to pay the costs, in part or in full, by the family of the deceased person without causing hardship. </p><p>  A designated person of my Department will examine and establish the circumstances of the person applying for assistance, the circumstances of that person&rsquo;s household, the circumstances of the deceased and the ability of other members of the family to meet, or contribute to, the cost involved.  The designated person will seek to establish whether the deceased had funds by way of savings, insurance policies, bereavement grants, credit union savings, etc, to meet the burial costs; whether the bill, or a portion of it, has been paid; whether the deceased left property (apart from the home in which the applicant resides) that would render the applicant or anybody else liable for the burial cost; whether a bereavement grant is available from any source (e.g. former employer, credit union, trade union etc.) and whether funds are available from any other source to meet the funeral cost.</p></reply>

The provision of insurance cover and the price at which it is offered is a commercial matter for insurance companies and is based on an assessment of the risks they are accepting and adequate provisioning to meet these risks. Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, as regulator, interfere in the pricing of insurance products.<br/><br/>The EU framework for insurance expressly prohibits Member States adopting rules which require the prior approval or systematic notification of certain matters, including general and special policy conditions and scales of premiums. Furthermore, in the context of non-life insurance, which includes public indemnity insurance, the EU framework provides non-life insurers with the freedom to set premiums.  This has been acknowledged by the European Court of Justice. <br/><br/>The Central Bank does not regulate premiums in the insurance market. Insurance companies consider a number of risks when determining the premium for a proposed insurance policy, whether that is a general insurance policy such as motor or home insurance, or a life assurance policy. A premium is based on the actuarial calculation of risk.<br/><br/>Consumers are encouraged to shop around at the time of insurance renewal. The National Consumer Agency has information which may assist a consumer to shop around.  It can be found at .</p></reply>

In particular where a regulated entity has identified that a personal consumer is a vulnerable consumer, the regulated entity must ensure that the vulnerable consumer is provided with such reasonable arrangements and/or assistance that may be necessary to facilitate him or her in his or her dealings with the regulated entity. </p><p>  Furthermore, chapter 5 of the CPC sets out requirements in relation to 'knowing the customer and suitability' prior to offering, recommending, arranging or providing a product or service to a consumer.  The level of information gathered should be appropriate to the nature of the particular product and must include details of the consumers' needs and objectives from the product or service, their personal circumstances, their financial situation and their attitude to risk.  </p><p>  The CPC also sets out procedures for errors and complaints resolution and if a consumer is dissatisfied about the way a regulated entity has handled their particular case a complaint can be taken under these provisions.</p></reply>

The profit figures declared may also be reduced by capital allowances or losses to which that taxpayer may be entitled.  Secondly, previous independent reviews of the stallion sector confirmed that the sector is capital intensive and requires significant on-going investment with profits made normally re-invested to produce new stock.  It is also a fact that a large number of stallions are not successful at stud and it is likely that the uncertainty of the breeding business impacts the bottom-line profits made.  Thirdly, the short nomination life and the uncertainty of success in the industry are recognised by the fact that an annual 25% of the initial value of each stallion can be deducted for tax purposes.</p><p>  I am informed that based on the latest data produced by Horse Racing Ireland in their &quot;Factbook 2013&quot; there were 206 stallions at stud in 2013.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that significant economic activity in the thoroughbred industry is also generated from broodmare breeding operations.  By way of comparison, based on the latest data produced by Horse Racing Ireland in &quot;Factbook 2013&quot;, there were 12,643 mares at stud in 2013.</p><p>  Profits associated with this aspect of the thoroughbred industry were not included in the figures provided in my previous reply as the questions related to stallions.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that profit figures in connection with broodmares cannot be provided as they are not separately identified on tax returns nor were profits from this activity previously exempt from tax.</p><p>  Consequently, given the range of variables associated with the stallions industry and the fact that the profits from a number of activities within the thoroughbred breeding sector are not separately identifiable, it is not appropriate for me to comment on the quantum of tax payments from the sector.</p></reply>

This is known as the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT and was introduced by the Finance Act 2006, with effect from 7 December 2005, and amended since (most recently in Finance (No 2) Act 2013 which, among other things, reduced the SFT from &euro;2.3 million to &euro;2 million from 1 January 2014).</p><p>  A higher limit, known as a Personal Fund Threshold or PFT, may be claimed where the capital value of an individual's pension benefits exceeded the SFT on the date of its introduction or on the dates of its subsequent reduction.</p><p>  The SFT regime was introduced, and subsequently amended, mainly to deal with the abuse of the tax-relief arrangements for pensions, which resulted in pension overfunding by individuals and to place a constraint on the cost to the Exchequer of tax relief for pension saving.  The regime deals with these issues at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront.</p><p>  There is no restriction or limit on the contributions that an individual can make to his or her pension savings on an ongoing basis (other than the standard earnings and age-related percentage limits that determine the annual level of tax-relieved contributions that can be made by an individual).  As regards restricting  the level of pension benefits, in the case of occupational pension schemes, statutory rules in relation to tax relief restrict the maximum pension benefits payable under both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes to a pension of two-thirds of pre-retirement earnings, taking account of any benefits paid as retirement lump sums.  This funding restriction does not apply to the personal pension plans (e.g. Personal Retirement Savings Accounts) of individuals who are self-employed or in non-pensionable employment for practical reasons.  The SFT regime, on the other hand, does apply to all supplementary pension arrangements whether employer sponsored pension schemes or personal pension plans and across both the private and the public sector.</p><p>  The SFT regime does not in itself, however, impose an actual restriction on the level of pension benefits. Instead, a significant tax charge is imposed on the capital value of retirement benefits above the SFT or PFT, as appropriate, when they are drawn down.  In this way, the SFT regime acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of funding for benefits above the SFT or PFT limits by clawing back, through the significant tax charge, the tax relief granted.</p><p>  The SFT has relevance and potential application only to individuals who are funding for or accruing pension benefits in pension saving arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners and who have relevant earnings out of which contributions to such arrangements are, or are capable of being, tax-relieved or tax subsidized.  It has no direct application or relevance to individuals or taxpayers who are not in this position.  Moreover, since the SFT operates as a limit or threshold at a relatively high value and only impacts when that threshold (or the higher PFT limit, if applicable) is exceeded, the funding for or accrual of pension benefits by the vast majority of individuals in pension saving arrangements are unaffected by the SFT regime.</p><p>  Within the confines of its application as described, however, the SFT regime makes no distinction between individual taxpayers based on gender so that the Deputy's references to discrimination on these grounds is not understood.</p></reply>

For ease of reference, I have included an excerpt from my Budget day speech:</p><p>&quot;The reduced 9% rate of VAT on tourism related activities has been a great success and there are now an extra twenty three thousand employed in the sector since mid-2011.</p><p>  This initiative is delivering and I am retaining the 9% VAT rate for these services.  In the light of reports of rising prices in this sector, it is incumbent on the industry to ensure that this relief continues to be passed through fully to the consumer.  However, let me be very clear, the taxpayer cannot be the only stakeholder keeping costs down in the sector. If prices begin to rise, the case for retaining the measure diminishes.&quot;</p><p>  When I originally announced the Jobs Initiative in 2011, I made it clear that the effects of the VAT reduction would be reviewed before Budget 2013 to ensure that it encouraged employment in the affected sectors.  This analysis of the VAT rate reduction, carried out by my Department, looked at the rate of pass through to final consumers and the employment effects. It demonstrated that prices in the basket of goods and services covered by the Jobs Initiative had fallen by 1.5% between June 2011 and June 2012.  This is compared to inflation of 0.3% for non-Jobs Initiative goods and services even after removing the effects of rising energy prices.  My Department will continue to monitor developments in this regard.</p><p>  In addition to presenting evidence on the pass through of the VAT rate reduction the paper also noted evidence of job growth as a result of the policy.  The 'accommodation and food services' sector of the economy (which accounts for 70% of the Jobs Initiative basket) experienced employment growth of nearly 6% over the period June 2011 to June 2012.  This is compared to a fall in employment of 3% in the services sector (excluding the public sector).  While it cannot be known with certainty what the true impact of the VAT rate reduction was this research suggests that the VAT rate reduction had the desired effect on prices and employment.</p></reply>

Where mountain rescue teams provide their services free of charge, this does not change the VAT treatment of equipment they purchase.</p></reply>

When it is complete, it will be valued by a Revision Officer and a proposed valuation certificate will be issued to the occupier of the property, in accordance with section 29 of the Act.</p><p>  It is a &quot;new build&quot; and, therefore, will be liable for rates under the new 'property entry levy' charge which is levied on all newly erected or newly constructed properties.  The final valuation certificate for the relevant property  is likely to be issued for  early in 2015. </p></reply>

There is no funding available from the Office of Public Works for this purpose.  As regards the flooding in Ramelton it is a matter for Donegal County Council, in the first instance, to investigate and address flooding issues in the County. </p><p>  Ramelton was identified through the national Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment in 2011 as an area where the flood risk was potentially significant.  It is therefore designated as an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) under the North Western/ Neagh Bann Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study. OPW is currently undertaking this study in partnership with the relevant local authorities including Donegal County Council.  An engineering consultancy company has been commissioned to carry out the study on behalf of the OPW.</p><p>  Following the significant flood event in August, the engineering consultants were on site in Ramelton and collected data on flood extents, levels and cause of the flooding.  The flooding in Pound Street resulted from intense rainfall over a short period of time.  It exceeded the capacity of the drainage infrastructure and river channels in the area.  The information collected will contribute to the analysis of flooding in the town under the CFRAM study and to ensuring that any future mitigating measures proposed are robust and effective.  Public consultation on the draft flood maps for Ramelton will be held in early 2015 and this will be advertised locally.  A Flood Risk Management Plan for the study area will be produced which will include an integrated and prioritised set of measures to address flood risk.</p></reply>

The deduction is calculated by reference to remuneration. Remuneration is defined at section 1 of the Act as emoluments to which Chapter 4 of Part 42 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 applies or is applied and payable by or on behalf of a public service body to a public servant for his or her services as a public servant.  The PRD is not a pension contribution and does not confer pension entitlements.

Funding was approved and the tendering process to procure consultants is currently ongoing. The OPW understands that the Council expects to appoint consultants shortly, most likely early in 2015.  </p><p>  Louth County Council has submitted an application under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation and Coastal Protection Works Scheme for funding of &euro;26,000 in relation to a project for coastal remedial works at Whitestown.  This is being assessed by the OPW engineering staff currently.</p><p>  Louth County Council was allocated up to &euro;191,000 for repairs to damaged coastal protection infrastructure arising out of the severe weather in the period 13 December, 2013 to 6 January 2014.  The Council has to date submitted a claim to the OPW to draw down &euro;118,494 of this total amount.  This is expected to be processed before end 2014.</p><p>  Meath County Council was allocated up to &euro;75,000 for repairs to damaged coastal protection infrastructure arising out of the severe weather in the period 13 December, 2013 to 6 January 2014.  The Council has to date not submitted a claim to the OPW to draw down any of this total amount. </p><p>  With regard to flood relief proposals in counties Meath and Louth generally, the OPW's Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme is assessing the most significant flood risk in those counties and, under the programme, Flood Risk Management Plans will be produced to include measures to address that risk.  The North Western/Neagh Bann Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) study, which is one of six such studies currently ongoing, will assess flood risk in 40 areas of significant risk, known as Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs), a number of which are in County Louth.  The areas of flood risk in east Meath have already been studied under the Fingal/East Meath CFRAM pilot study. </p><p>  Currently, draft flood maps are being produced under the North Western/Neagh Bann study and Public Consultation Days will be held in each location in early 2015. These will be advertised locally and members of the public will have an opportunity to provide comments on the draft maps.  Following completion of the mapping phase, the study will examine all options to reduce flood risk, including both structural and non-structural measures, and will also consider related environmental issues. Structural measures would involve constructing flood defences or increasing conveyance capacity where appropriate, while the non-structural options would include such measures as the introduction of flood warning systems.  Further information and updates on the North Western/Neagh Bann study are available on the website www.neaghbanncframstudy.ie </p><p>  Pending completion of the CFRAM Programme subject to cost benefit and funding availability, it would be open to local authorities to apply for funding to undertake minor flood mitigation measures under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme.  It is also open to the local authorities to undertake measures using their own resources.  </p></reply>

There are currently 117 such centres across the country.  There is no new Community Enterprise Centre Scheme to fund Business Development Management in 2014.  The last scheme rolled out was in 2012 and 2013 when Enterprise Ireland provided funding of &euro;2 million to support the recruitment of a total of 46 Business Development Managers.  That programme included funding to support the employment of 9 Business Development Managers for a two year period in 2013-2015.</p><p>  On the wider issue of the Centres, the success levels, occupancy levels and sustainability of jobs at the Centres varies and therefore I have asked Enterprise Ireland to review the operations of the Community Enterprise Centres in the context of regional enterprise development and how the Community Enterprise Centres and the Local Enterprise Offices might work more closely in support of business start-ups before giving further consideration to the matter.  </p><p>  There are a number of dimensions to this issue such as the role of other players such as the Local Authorities, private sector involvement and the level of supply and demand for business space in the locality.  </p><p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for Regional Enterprise Strategies that will enable us to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders, including Community Enterprise Centres, in supporting enterprise growth and jobs in the regions.  While there is already a significant amount of practical cooperation taking place at local and regional levels between many public bodies, developing a framework in which cooperation can be improved, is timely.  </p><p>  I have been actively working on a template for the development of Regional Enterprise Strategies and it is my intention that this framework will be applied initially on a pilot basis to produce action-oriented plans to support enterprise growth and jobs in the Midlands region and the South East region.  These pilots will inform any adaptations that might need to be made prior to the framework being applied to other regions.  I fully expect that the existing network of Community Enterprise Centres will have a role to play in the creation and implementation of enterprise strategies in their regions.</p></reply>

In this context the Court undertook a review of the ten existing JLCs in 2013 and made recommendations to me on the issue.  On January 28th   2014, I signed Orders to give effect to recommendations of the Labour Court Review.</p><p>  In this context, the Labour Court recommended that the Hotels JLC for the Dublin area should be abolished and that the Hotels JLC for outside of Dublin should be retained and its Establishment Order amended to clarify the classes of workers covered. </p><p>  With regard to the two Catering JLCs, I accepted the Labour Court recommendation that the existing scope and structures remain in place and that one person be appointed to chair both JLCs in order to ensure consistency in respect of the related terms and conditions of employment across all of the sector covered by two Joint Labour Committees.  Accordingly, it was not necessary to make Orders in these instances.  </p><p>  Industrial Relations Officers of the Labour Relations Commission have been appointed to the positions of JLC Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson.</p><p>  Under the Industrial Relations Act 1946, it is a matter for the Labour Court to ensure that equal numbers of representatives of workers and employers in the relevant sectors are on each of the JLCs.  In this context, I understand that nominations have been sought from employer and worker representatives in respect of each JLC.  To-date, employer representatives have agreed to participate on three JLCs &ndash; Security, Contract Cleaning and Hairdressing.</p><p>  In terms of the hospitality sector, Judicial Review proceedings seeking to have the decision to reconstitute the Hotels JLC quashed have been launched by William Neville &amp;amp; Sons Properties Ltd, trading as the Riverside Park Hotel, and the Irish Hotels Federation.  These proceedings are ongoing.</p><p>  It should be borne in mind that JLC Establishment Orders provide in themselves only a framework within which employers and employee representatives can come together voluntarily and negotiate terms and conditions of workers in their respective sector.  For vulnerable workers, the advantage of JLCs is that they see fair terms and conditions such as wage rates, sick pay etc. agreed and given effect by ERO, while for some employers, the advantage of the JLC system, based as it is on the principle of self-governance, means that they can agree and set minimum pay and conditions, agree on work practices which are custom-made to their industry &ndash; a flexibility which cannot be achieved by primary legislation.  Where both parties to a JLC see commonality of purpose and outcome then an agreement may emerge.</p><p>  This process sits very much within the context of Ireland's voluntarist system of industrial relations.</p></reply>

The main products exported were soft drink concentrate and medical and pharmaceutical products.  Imports in 2013 from Iran amounted to under &euro;1 million, most of which was accounted for by vegetables &amp;amp; fruit.  Due to the EU sanctions that have been in place, Enterprise Ireland has not considered Iran a focus market for some time and has concentrated all efforts on developing opportunities in other more accessible Middle Eastern markets.  Commercial conditions currently remain quite adverse and most international banks will not offer standard financial tools to facilitate trade with Iran.  However, with the possible lifting of some sanctions and in recognition of the potential represented by the Iranian market, Enterprise Ireland are planning to carry out an exploratory visit to the market during the early part of 2015, the first visit by the agency to this market in over 7 years, to investigate opportunities in different sectors.  Following this visit, a strategy will be put in place as to how best to support those client companies who may want to explore the market further.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-09a.390.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120900086#WRL01300"><p>I assume the Deputy is referring to the publication of the Teagasc Annual Review and Outlook for 2015.  Dairy Prices are a function of global  market dynamics, with supply and demand issues in markets across the globe affecting prices  across different dairy commodity groups in domestic markets. Price volatility is a continuing feature of dairy commodity markets, and it is clear that managing the price peaks and troughs in a way that allows farmers and others to plan ahead is a significant challenge for the sector.</p><p>  After two years of extremely high prices, the combination of strong production in key dairy producing countries, including the USA, New Zealand, Australia and the European Union, driven by good weather, increased cow numbers in the US and strong cereal harvests, has seen the emergence of a surplus in dairy products on international markets coming into 2015. Furthermore, with Russia and China accounting for 27% of the traded world market in the dairy sector, the effect of surplus stocks in the Chinese market along with the displacement effect of the Russian ban can be seen as critical factors in setting the context for price evolution in the sector.   </p><p>  The anticipated decline in 2015  largely reflects the impact of the aforementioned developments on global dairy markets. Teagasc expects that average Irish milk prices in 2015 will fall to 27 cent per litre, a reduction of over 10 cent per litre on the average for 2014. However it should be noted that this follows several years of very good incomes on dairy farms. Furthermore, Teagasc are clear that these negative effects are expected to be temporary in nature. </p><p>  Under the new Common Agriculture Policy there is a range of tools available to mitigate the worst impact of downward price volatility, including Aids to Private Storage, Intervention and Export Refunds and I have called on the EU Commission to deploy these tools as appropriate. The Single Farm Payment will also provide a measure of income stability during this difficult period. I have also asked the banking sector to tailor their financial products  to allow for the kind of price volatility that will be a feature of international dairy markets, and  of course  co-ops have a role to play in ensuring that their contractual arrangements with suppliers provide a measure of stability.  A focus on innovation and the production of added value products will also have a role to play in mitigating the impact of volatility, and a greater use of futures markets may also feature among the tools deployed by the sector. </p><p>  In terms of how this will evolve in the medium term, Teagasc, in common with a number of other commentators, anticipate that lower milk prices will lead to a slowdown in the expansion of milk production globally through 2015, with global dairy markets set to witness signs of recovery as the year progresses. In the medium to longer term population growth and increasing affluence in developing countries will continue to drive strong growth in demand for dairy products, and Irish producers will be well placed to take full advantage of this demand.</p></reply>

Given its population I am confident Iran will in the future be a growing market for exports of dairy products.</p><p>  My Department has been actively engaged with the Iranian authorities with a view to re-opening access to that market for beef and sheepmeat products.  We hosted an inspection visit from an Iranian delegation between 29 April and 6 May 2012 when they received an overview of our control and inspection policies as well as visiting plants interested in exporting to Iran. </p><p>  The visit was successful and resulted in the Iranians lifting their ban on Irish beef on 26 July 2012.  Subsequently initial agreement was reached on a Veterinary Health Cert for beef.  This veterinary health cert, however, is restricted to boneless beef from animals aged under 30 months and requires that slaughter of animals whose meat is destined for Iran be overseen by their veterinary authorities.  My Department are currently working with industry to analyse the implications of this requirement. </p><p>  A draft veterinary health certificate for sheepmeat was sent to the Iranian authorities in October 2014.  We are currently awaiting a response.   </p><p>Since 2011, I or officials from my Department have met on 5 separate occasions with Iranian officials, in most cases headed up by the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland.  These meetings were helpful in facilitating the progress of access for Irish Beef to the Iranian market and also discussed the possibility of cooperation on food safety between both countries. </p><p>  I myself have met Ambassador Javad Kachoueian twice in 2014, once on 16 September as a courtesy call as the then new Ambassador but again on 23 September when the Ambassador was accompanied by a wider group of Iranian delegates attached to the Iran-Ireland Parliamentary group.</p><p>  These meetings were extremely useful in allowing us to begin exploring the potential in Agri-trade between both countries.  Given Iran&rsquo;s growing population, I highlighted the potential for further trade between Ireland and Iran in the Agri-food sector, in particular, the dairy, processed food and meat sectors.</p><p>  My plans for trade missions for next year are not yet finalised.</p></reply>

This is a particularly difficult and sensitive issue, including for other Members States, and raises complex questions for Ireland from a legal, operational and management perspective.  In this context it is critically important that the Defence Forces are fully operational at all times, and it must be emphasised that the taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military law.  These issues require careful detailed considered input from all relevant parties. </p><p>  My officials are fully committed to engagement with all the relevant parties on these issues with a view to seeking solutions which respect the Charter and developments in other sectors.

The purpose of the EU Battlegroup is to provide a rapid response capacity for crisis management and peacekeeping operations. The development of EU Battlegroups has, in addition, been welcomed by the United Nations and the UN Secretary General as an important potential support to UN peacekeeping, particularly where UN operations run into difficulty and require rapid reinforcement. They can also be deployed as an initial entry force for follow on missions which will allow the UN or the EU to generate a force for crisis management and peacekeeping. Any deployment of the Irish contingent of the Nordic Battlegroup will require a United Nations Security Council Resolution, a Government decision and the agreement of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts, known as the triple lock.<br/><br/>The number of Irish Defence Forces personnel participating in any deployment of the Nordic Battlegroup, which will be on standby during the first six months of 2015, will be approximately 175. <br/><br/>The Irish element of the Battlegroup is a Reconnaissance Task Force and as such is integral to the operation of the Battlegroup. However, as mentioned above, should a deployment take place it will be subject to the triple lock. Should it be the case that Ireland does not participate in the deployment of the Battlegroup the responsibility of making the Battlegroup available to the EU will lie with the other Troop contributing Nations and primarily with the Framework Nation, in this case Sweden.<br/><br/>The Battlegroup concept, as devised, allows for a deployment of up to a maximum of 120 days. It is anticipated that should any deployment last longer than this the European Union would generate a follow-on force to take the place of any Battlegroup that would be deployed.<br/><br/>In relation to the exact numbers of vehicles being deployed this is a security issue. However I can assure the Deputy that the contingent will have all the requisite equipment necessary to provide force protection to minimum risk. In relation to costs and compensation, the operation of the Battlegroup is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding between all the participating states. The Memorandum states that &ldquo;each Participant will bear its own costs resulting from Battlegroup activities&rdquo;. As such it is not envisaged that compensation would be paid for damage, destruction or loss of equipment. </p></reply>

This is because the oversight model proposed in the Legal Services Ombudsman Act of 2009 does not meet this Government&rsquo;s policy commitment to greater independence in the regulation of the legal profession. The 2009 Act is, therefore, to be repealed with the enactment of the new Legal Services Regulation Bill which sets out an alternative and more independent supervisory regime.<br/><br/>Having been a core undertaking of the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Memorandum of Understanding<i>, </i>the Legal Services Regulation Bill is, in succession to the Troika programme, now a Country Specific Recommendation under the EU Semester Process. The Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to the Bill&rsquo;s wide-reaching structural reforms is also reflected in the fact that the Bill continues to be a key component of the Action Plan for Jobs<i>, </i>the Medium Term Economic Strategy 2014-2020<i>(MTES) </i>and of the National Reform Plan. <br/><br/>The proposed regulatory system will include an independently appointed and operated Legal Services Regulatory Authority; independent procedures to deal with complaints of professional misconduct, inadequate services and excessive fees; and the establishment of an independent Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal dealing with both solicitors and barristers. The Bill also provides for a more modern, consumer-friendly and transparent legal costs regime including under the Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator that will take over the existing functions of the Office of the Taxing-Master. The Bill also provides for the introduction of alternative business structures for the provision of legal services including by legal practitioners in partnership with other non-legal service providers.<br/><br/>The Legal Services Regulation Bill is due to resume D&aacute;il Report Stage on 16 December 2014 in support of its early enactment so that the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority will come into operation in the first half of 2015.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that from 1 January 2015, non-EEA nationals wishing to obtain a student immigration permission to study English in Ireland will only be permitted to do so at an ACELS recognised school or college.  This new policy was jointly announced by myself and the Minister for Education and Skills on 2 September as a response to the closure of several private sector English Language Schools on foot of revelations of malpractice and immigration abuses.  My officials inform me that the final applications for ACELS accreditation are currently being assessed by the ACELS Recognition Committee on which my Department is represented.  Where immigration officials are aware of discrepancies between the numbers of students declared by a college in the ACELS application process and the numbers registered with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, there is necessity for such anomalies to be thoroughly investigated before a final decision on ACELS recognition can be made.  The Deputy will appreciate the necessity of ensuring that all English Language Colleges operate to the highest standards in light of recent events.  My officials inform me that a decision will be made on the application in question by 12 December next.</p></reply>

However, the Deputy will appreciate that, on occasion, it is necessary for vulnerable prisoners and others to be separated from the general prison population.<br/><br/>The restriction of a prisoner's regime can occur due to a number of factors, including the protection of vulnerable prisoners.  This is provided for under Rule 63 of the Prison Rules 2007.  A prisoner may, either at his/her own request or when the Governor considers it necessary, in so far as is practicable and subject to the maintenance and good order and safe and secure custody, be kept separate from other prisoners who are reasonably likely to cause significant harm to him/her.<br/><br/>In addition, the Governor may decide, for the maintenance of good order in the prison, to remove a prisoner from general association or structured activity to reduce the negative effect that a prisoner or prisoners may have on the general population.  This is provided for under Rule 62 of the Prison Rules 2007.  There may also be a smaller number of prisoners who would be restricted for medical (Rule 64) or discipline reasons (Rule 67).<br/><br/>The fact that prisoners seeking protection are immediately separated from the general population or from specific prisoners identified as presenting a threat, clearly demonstrates the commitment of the Irish Prison Service to ensure their safety and security.  The status of each prisoner on restricted regime within the prison system is regularly reviewed and they have access to full medical services.  If possible, prisoners can be transferred to other institutions where a restricted regime would not be necessary.<br/><br/>The Irish Prison Service Statistics Unit commenced the collation of a quarterly Census of Restricted Regime Prisoners in 2013.<br/><br/>The number of prisoners on a Restricted Regime on 1 October 2014 is set out in the following table.<table><tr><th><div>-</div></th><th><div>Prisoners on Restricted Regime</div></th></tr><tr><td><div>Mountjoy Male</div></td><td><div>54</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Dochas</div></td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>St. Patrick&rsquo;s</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cork</div></td><td><div>32</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Limerick </div></td><td><div>60</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Castlerea</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Cloverhill</div></td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Wheatfield</div></td><td><div>65</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Portlaoise</div></td><td><div>6</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Arbour Hill</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Midlands</div></td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Training Unit</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Loughan House</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Shelton Abbey</div></td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td><div>Total</div></td><td><div>246</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

The counsel appointed to the panel were all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.

This would be unfair.  Therefore, persons receiving disability benefits are considered eligible sponsors, subject of course to meeting any other necessary requirements.  Furthermore, financial capacity is just one of the conditions that is considered when making a determination on a family reunification application and the circumstances of the parties concerned are considered in the round on a case by case basis.</p></reply>

I understand that this operation was conducted on a quarterly basis during 2014 and that targeted enforcement measures with respect to learner drivers will continue to be applied into the future.</p></reply>

The Programme is a targeted intervention aimed at school communities identified through the Department of Education and Skills&rsquo; DEIS Action Plan for Educational Inclusion.  It provides targeted supports annually to approximately 36,000 children. <br/><br/>Since 1 January 2014, the Child and Family Agency has operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme, including the allocation of funds to local projects.  In 2014, an allocation of &euro;24.756 million has been provided for the School Completion Programme.  The Agency has approved local projects' school retention plans for the 2014/2015 academic year.  The first instalment of 2014/15 funding issued to local projects last September.  Further payments totalling approximately &euro;9.5m will issue this month, with a third instalment in May 2015.  <br/><br/>The schools to which the Deputy refers are two of six primary schools which, together with two post-primary schools, form the School Completion Project for the area.  I am advised that an amount of &euro;214,183.93 was allocated by the Agency to the project for the school year 2014-2015.  The amount provided for 2014-2015 takes account of the savings requirements in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure 2012-2014.  The allocation of the funding across the range of interventions planned for young people and between the local schools in the School Completion Programme project for the area is a matter for the Local Management Committee.<br/><br/>The estimate for the Child and Family Agency for 2015 is &euro;635 million, a 4.3% increase on its 2014 allocation.  My Department will issue a Performance Statement this month under Section 45 of the Child and Family Agency Act, 2013.  This will include my priorities for consideration in the development of the Agency's 2015 Business Plan.  The Business Plan will set out the Agency's proposed activities, programmes and priorities for 2015, including provision for the School Completion Programme, in the light of the monies available.<br/><br/>  A review of the School Completion Programme has commenced. It is being carried out by the ESRI following a procurement process managed by the Agency.  The programme has been in operation since 2002 and I believe that it is timely that a review be carried out.  The Review is an important initiative to plan for the future development of this Programme.  It is envisaged that the review will be completed during the 2014/2015 academic year.</p></reply>

The Government did announce in Budget 2015 an increase of &euro;5 per month in child benefit for each eligible child. This measure brings the monthly payment per child to &euro;135 and will benefit more than 600,000 families. </p><p>  My Department provides annual funding in the region of &euro;260 million to the childcare sector to support a number of childcare programmes.  These programmes include the Community Childcare Subvention programme, the Early Childhood Care and Education programme and a number of labour activation initiatives under the Training and Employment Childcare programmes.  The programmes provide direct support to more than 4,200 childcare services.  This investment ensures that many parents who would otherwise not be in a position to avail of pre-school care and education for their children are able to avail of quality services. </p><p>  Despite the budgetary situation that prevailed in recent years the Government has maintained the funding necessary to support the childcare programmes and has introduced new initiatives to meet the changing circumstances, particularly in regard to the improved employment opportunities in the economy.  As funding becomes available, I would hope that the capitation rates for all programmes could be increased to provide further support.  </p><p>  Following concerns expressed by childcare providers throughout the country, the issue of commercial rates on pre-school services was raised with the previous Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The concerns of childcare providers in relation to commercial rates were also brought to the attention of officials in the Department of  Public Expenditure and Reform.  Officials from my Department recently met with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of the Valuation Bill currently going through the Houses of the Oireachtas and discussed the issue of commercial rates on pre-school services. </p><p>  The Government has recently approved an amendment to the Bill to exempt not-for-profit childcare providers from rates. Private commercial childcare providers are subject to commercial rates except those whose funding is provided only through capitation provided under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The new Bill does not provide for any changes in relation to the issue of commercial rates on private childcare services. </p><p>  I must emphasise that my Department has no role in determining exemptions to commercial rates and this issue is a matter for the Department of Finance who have responsibility for fiscal policy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-09a.546.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120900091#WRQ01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 287 to 289, inclusive, together.</p><p>  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides support for sessional pre-school, full time, part time and after school places, is targeted at disadvantaged or low income families and eligibility is based on means-tested entitlements.   </p><p>  In 2013 an allocation of &euro;44 million was made to provide for the expected demand from eligible parents enrolling their children under the CCS programme.  However the demand was in excess of that provided for and the actual spend for the year totalled &euro;47 million.  It is expected that approximately &euro;45 million will be spent on supporting eligible parents availing of the programme in 2014.</p><p>  The number of parents who availed of support under the CCS programme in the school year  2012-2013, from information provided in the parental electronic returns, was 19,844 with 24,907 children enrolled.  In the school year 2013-2014 the number of parents supported under the programme was 19,079 with 23,728 children enrolled.   The figures provided reflect the number of parents and children included in the electronic parental returns and are a measure of the number of children enrolled in a 'snap shot' week early in the school year.  It is the case that some of these children will leave the programme and be replaced by other eligible children as the school year progresses.  The figure for these replacements is not available but from information provided by participating childcare services it is shown that a substantial number of additional children not covered in the electronic returns would receive support under the programme.  </p><p>  The parental returns for the current school year 2014-2015 are presently being submitted and therefore figures for this period are not currently available.</p><p>  The JobBridge scheme, which is implemented by the Department of Social Protection, is a National Internship Scheme which provides work experience placements for unemployed people.  Participants in the JobBridge scheme receive a weekly allowance of &euro;50 in addition to any social welfare entitlement they may have. </p><p>  Participants in the JobBridge scheme do not, on the basis of participation in the scheme, automatically qualify for subvention under the CCS programme but qualify on the basis of their underlying social welfare entitlement.  For example, a parent who was in receipt of Job Seekers benefit and who holds a medical card qualifies for a subvention payment of &euro;50 per week towards the cost of full-time childcare.  If the parent enters the JobBridge scheme they will continue to be subvented at the rate of &euro;50 per week for the duration of their participation in the scheme.</p><p>  The first applications from parents participating in the JobBridge scheme were submitted in the parental returns made by childcare providers to this Department in October 2012.  </p><p>  The data in relation to the number of parents who qualified for support under the CCS programme on the basis of their participation in State sponsored schemes or the receipt of allowances as outlined in the Deputy's Questions, and the data in relation to the JobBridge scheme is currently being compiled by officials in my Department and will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</p></reply>

The allocation in 2014 was increased to &euro;17 million and it is expected that all of this funding will be used this year.  This funding provides for 2,500 full time equivalent places which supports in the region of 4,500 children each year. </p><p>  The CEC programme was introduced this year to support parents availing of Community Employment (CE) work opportunities.  Funding of &euro;7 million was allocated and it is expected that the final spend will be in the region of &euro;2 million.  The funding allocation is sufficient to provide for at least 1,200 part-time child care places and 800 after-school child care places.  The uptake of the programme steadily increased throughout the year and there are now in the region of 950 childcare places being supported. </p><p>  The ASCC programme was introduced in 2013 to support parents returning to the workforce who were deemed qualified for support by the Department of Social Protection.  Funding totalling &euro;11.5 million was made available in 2013 but only a small number of parents availed of the programme and the spend was  in the region of &euro;18,000.  The funding allocation this year has been reduced to &euro;2.5 million with the uptake again lower than expected with a spend of &euro;0.26 million.  The uptake of the programme did increase as the year progressed and there are now approximately 235 children availing of after-school places. </p><p>  Details of the funding provision in relation to the childcare support programmes in 2015 will be confirmed in the revised estimates for the Public Services which will be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on Wednesday 17 December 2014. </p></reply>

There is currently no structured public access defibrillation programme in operation in Ireland that specifies the conditions for providing defibrillators in public places.</p><p>  The Public Health (Availability of Defibrillators) Bill 2013 that is currently at Committee stage outlines a scheme that would require the owners of particular types of premises or venues to install and maintain defibrillators so that they would be available for public use.  The Bill sets out the requirement to provide defibrillators in a range of settings and for events which have a regular attendance in excess of 100 persons per day.  It was agreed that there are a number or questions that need to be considered when designing a public defibrillation programme for Ireland and Government approval was therefore granted for the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) of a Public Access Defibrillator Programme for Ireland.  </p><p>  The health technology assessment of public access defibrillation conducted by HIQA has examined the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different configurations of any potential public access defibrillation programme.  No information is available on the exact numbers of AEDs that are currently in use in Ireland and no information is currently available on the locations of these devices, what proportion are maintained and functional, and how many are available for use by the public. </p><p>  The Expert Advisory Group on Public Access Defibrillation has now concluded its investigations and a report has been forwarded to the Department of Health which is currently  under consideration.</p></reply>

It is my policy, and that of the HSE, that only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route. As a first step, in 2014 &euro;23m was redirected from long term residential care to strengthen community and home-based services and to develop more flexible and responsive approaches to care. This was in addition to the budget of &euro;315m provided for home help and home care package services which are delivered to some 56,000 people at any one time. <br/><br/>The budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme (NHSS) in 2014 was &euro;939 million.  Over the course of the year to date, demand for the NHSS has exceeded what could be funded and the national placement list has grown as a result.  This has resulted in the waiting times on the NHSS placement list growing to about 15 weeks.  This is not a satisfactory situation and I am trying to address it.  In July the HSE allocated &euro;5 million for an initiative to improve access to appropriate care for older people.  To date, this has funded over 300 transitional care beds for patients in acute hospitals from the placement list for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme and over 200 home care packages to assist patients in the acute hospitals who require a home care package to be discharged.<br/><br/>In Budget 2015 the Government has provided additional funding of &euro;25 million for next year to address delayed discharges. This will fund a range of community and non-acute supports as follows;<br/><br/><b>- &euro;10m</b>to fund an additional <b>300</b>NHSS places, which increases the gross budget to almost &euro;949m.<br/><br/><b>- &euro;5m</b>for provision of comprehensive home support services, <br/><br/><b>- &euro;8m</b>to provide an additional <b>115</b>short stay beds, including the phased opening of Mount Carmel Hospital, and <br/><br/><b>- &euro;2m</b>for Community Intervention Teams (Primary Care).<br/><br/>In anticipation of the &euro;10m allocation coming on stream in 2015 the HSE has released funding to support some 300 people in long term residential care. This is in addition to HSE's normal scheduled release of funding.I expect this will have a positive impact by reducing the waiting times on the placement list from about 15 to 12 weeks.<br/><br/>The Deputy will be aware that the NHSS is currently being reviewed. The review is considering the long term sustainability of the Scheme as well as looking at how well the current model of provision is currently balancing residential care with care in the community, and whether this needs to be adjusted to better reflect what older people want.  Work on the Review is advanced.  It is expected that it will be completed in the coming months and the Report will then be made publicly available.<br/><br/>As well as considering how the Scheme has operated to date, the Review is expected to  identify some of the issues that will need to be considered and tested more fully into the future, including  possible new models of residential care.</p></reply>

These are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and often on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.</p><p>  The HSE received an application for the inclusion of Eculizumab in the community drugs schemes.  The application was considered in line with the procedures and timescales agreed in 2012 by my Department and the HSE with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association.</p><p>  In accordance with these procedures, the NCPE conducted a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of Eculizumab and concluded that, at a total cost per patient per year of &euro;437,247 and a cumulative gross budget impact over 5 years estimated at &euro;33 million, the therapy did not represent value for money for the treatment of patients in the Irish healthcare setting. In addition, the manufacturer did not include an economic model as part of their submission and failed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this therapy. Consequently, the NCPE was unable to recommend reimbursement of the product under the community drug schemes. The report is available on the NCPE's website.</p><p>  In relation to the Treatment Abroad Scheme I understand that the individual in question has appealed the decision by the HSE.  As this is currently going through the appeals process it would not be appropriate to provide further comment at this time.</p><p>  With regard to the 10 people that currently have access to this drug an interim agreement was put in place to fund these patients.  This was to allow the pharmaceutical company, Alexion Pharma to have developed additional evidence to enable the HSE to make a long-term decision in relation to the funding of this incredibly costly agent.</p><p>  Many countries have struggled to accept the pricing point put forward by Alexion. The HSE has been engaging with Alexion for some time to arrive at a pricing point that would assist it in its efforts to fund this medicine for as many patients as possible. The HSE met the company again in November and is currently considering the outcome of that engagement.  It is worth noting that the current Irish list price of &euro;4,557.50 per vial substantially exceeds the list price in the UK (&pound;3,150 sterling).</p><p>  I would like to assure the Deputy that I fully understand the concerns of patients regarding the availability of this drug. While I appreciate that some may take the view that the taxpayer should reimburse every licensed medicine for whatever price the drug company demands, I hope the Deputy will appreciate that the better interests of the health service require that we reimburse only the most effective medicines and only at a fair price.</p></reply>

This report recommends the following Hospital Groups:<br/><br/>1. <b>RCSI Hospitals Group </b>(Estimated Population, 800,000):<br/><br/>Beaumont Hospital; Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda; Connolly Hospital; Cavan General Hospital; Rotunda Hospital; Louth County Hospital; Monaghan Hospital. <br/><br/>2. <b>Dublin Midlands</b>(Estimated Population, 800,000):<br/><br/>St James's Hospital; The Adelaide &amp;amp; Meath Hospital, Dublin, including the National Children's Hospital (AMNCH); Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore; Naas General Hospital; Midlands Regional Hospital at Portlaoise; The Coombe Women and Infant University Hospital. <br/><br/>3. <b>Ireland East</b>(Estimated Population 1,000,000):<br/><br/>Mater Misericordiae University Hospital; St Vincent's  University Hospital;  Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar; St Luke's General Hospital Kilkenny; Wexford General Hospital; National Maternity Hospital; Our Lady's General Hospital Navan;  St Columcille's Hospital; St Michael&rsquo;s Hospital, Dun Laoghaire; Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital;  Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital.<br/><br/>4. <b>South/South West</b>(Estimated population 850,000): <br/><br/>Cork University Hospital, incorporating Cork University Maternity Hospital; Waterford Regional Hospital; Kerry General Hospital; Mercy University Hospital; South Tipperary General Hospital; South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital; Bantry General Hospital; Mallow General Hospital; Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene. <br/><br/>5. <b>Saolta Health Care Group</b>(Estimated Population, 700,000): <br/><br/>University Hospital Galway and Merlin Park University Hospital; Sligo Regional Hospital; Letterkenny General Hospital; Mayo General Hospital; Portiuncula Hospital; Roscommon County Hospital.<br/><br/>6.<b>UL Hospitals</b>(Estimated Population 400,000):  <br/><br/>Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick; Ennis General Hospital; Nenagh General Hospital; St John's Hospital; Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital;  Mid-Western Regional Orthopaedic Hospital. <br/><br/>7. <b>Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group</b><br/><br/>Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital, Crumlin, Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street and the paediatric service in AMNCH.<br/><br/>On 8 October 2014, the HSE launched the Community Healthcare Organisations (CHO) Report.  The Report sets out plans for a comprehensive reorganisation of health services outside the acute hospital system into nine CHOs.  The primary focus is to meet the maximum proportion of people's care needs in the communities where they live and to achieve joined-up, integrated services.  The text of the report and associated appendices, together with a &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; (FAQ) document, is available on the HSE website www.hse.ie.  <br/><br/>In determining the optimum organisational model for the CHOs, the HSE identified a requirement for integration between the different parts of the community healthcare services; between community healthcare services and acute hospitals; with wider public service organisations such as local authorities, the Child and Family Agency (Tusla), the education sector and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and with local voluntary organisations.<br/><br/>The option selected was arrived at after consideration of a number of options, details of which are contained in the HSE report on Community Healthcare Organisations  The option selected was deemed the most appropriate on the basis that it met a key requirement of linking primary care networks and teams and secondary care with acute hospitals; it provided a strong basis for linkage with local authority boundaries and it struck an appropriate balance between an organisation of sufficiently large scale to support organisation and business capability, while at the same time being of sufficiently small scale to provide the local community connection and response required to deliver integrated care.<br/><br/>The nine Community Healthcare Organisations and the general areas to be covered by each are set out below.More detailed information, with maps indicating the geographic areas involved, is contained in the HSE report and associated FAQ document.  The population figures quoted are derived from the 2011 Census.<br/><br/><b>Area 1</b>(Population 389,048)<br/><br/>Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim/West Cavan, Cavan/Monaghan<br/><br/><b>Area 2</b>(Population 445,356)<br/><br/>Cos. Galway, Roscommon and Mayo <br/><br/><b>Area 3</b>(Population 379,327):<br/><br/>Clare, Limerick, North Tipperary/East Limerick<br/><br/><b>Area 4 </b>(Population 664,533)<br/><br/>Cos. Cork and Kerry<br/><br/><b>Area 5</b>(Population 497,578):<br/><br/>Carlow, Kilkenny, South Tipperary, Waterford, Wexford<br/><br/><b>Area 6 </b>(Population 364,464):<br/><br/>Dun Laoghaire, Dublin South-East, Wicklow<br/><br/><b>Area 7</b>(Population 674,071)<br/><br/>Kildare/West Wicklow,  Dublin South City, Dublin South-West, Dublin West<br/><br/><b>Area 8</b>(Population 592,388):<br/><br/>Laois, Offaly, Longford, Westmeath, Louth, Meath<br/><br/><b>Area 9</b>(Population 581,486):<br/><br/>Dublin North, Dublin North-Central, Dublin North-West<br/><br/>The process of implementation of the CHO structures is currently under way and they are due to come into being in January 2015.  It is envisaged that the principal day-to-day linkages at clinical and patient level will be between the primary care networks and the relevant service within the Hospital Group.  There will also be significant inter-Hospital Group interfaces for certain national services and it is envisaged that individual CHOs will interface with hospitals from more than one Hospital Group.  Work to give effect to these interfaces is comprehended by the reform programmes currently underway in the HSE.</p></reply>

This MOU has underpinned cooperation between the two bodies since then.</p><p>  HIQA recognises the Mental Health Commission's role in helping to drive improvements to the quality and safety of social care services that are provided for people being cared for in the mental health services. In fulfilling its statutory responsibilities, since September 2013 HIQA has used the MOU to ensure that its work is consistent with its statutory remit and with the terms of the MOU.</p><p>  HIQA has also used the MOU to inform its regulatory work when that work relates to care settings for which the Mental Health Commission also has a regulatory duty.  This results in a complementary approach which ultimately serves the best interests of people who use social care services.  HIQA has a strong and positive working relationship with the Mental Health Commission in this regard.</p><p>  On 25-26 September, 2014, HIQA and the Mental Health Commission jointly hosted a two-day conference of EPSO (European Platform for Supervisory Organisations) in Dublin. This conference facilitated exchange of international information about the use of information in regulation, risk management, indicators of health system coverage and mental health services during economic crisis, and methodological frameworks and models for supervisory organisations.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission also interact through the work of Ireland's Health and Social Care Regulatory Forum.</p></reply>

The National Assessment Guidelines are available on the HSE website and can be accessed at the following link: . <br/><br/>I can advise the Deputy that the means assessment of eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is based on the income of the applicant, and his or her spouse or partner (if any), after direct taxes - income tax, PRSI and USC - have been deducted. Certain additional allowances are available for necessary expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care costs, and travel to work costs. Where a person&rsquo;s assessable income is within the relevant income guidelines, a Medical Card or a GP Visit Card will be granted. Utility charges and indirect taxation are not deductible under the assessment process. </p></reply>

The additional staff will work to foster a strong culture of organ donation, to optimise conversion rates and, ultimately, to increase the number of transplantations that are carried out each year.

Since July, 2009 the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is the statutory independent body responsible for the registration and inspection of all residential care services for older people.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive regulatory framework comprising of the Health Act 2007, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, as amended, the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 and the <i>National Quality Standards for Residential Care Settings for Older People in Ireland.</i><br/><br/>All nursing homes are subject to the standards and regulations in relation to quality and safety in order to ensure the well-being of their residents.  In the context of continuity of care the regulations require that an individual care plan must be developed and agreed with each resident and this plan must be kept under review as required by their changing needs or circumstances.  <br/><br/>The staffing requirement of each nursing home is dependent on its configuration, occupancy and the dependency levels of its residents.  Staff must be appropriately supervised and have access to appropriate training.  It is a matter for HIQA's Chief Inspector of Social Services to determine, for each nursing home, whether the staffing level and mix is appropriate.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-12-09a.735.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014120900097#WRW01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 358 and 362 together.</p><p>  Eltroxin, which contains the active substance levothyroxine, is a long-established medicine that is used to control hypothyroidism, congenital hypothyroidism and juvenile myxoedema. It is marketed in tablets containing 25, 50 and 100 micrograms and is the subject of a marketing authorisation in Ireland.</p><p>  Before anyone is allowed to market a medicine in Ireland they are required to apply for a marketing authorisation from either the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The HPRA and EMA examine the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) for Eltroxin is Amdipharm Mercury Company Ltd. (AMCo)) and it is the only supplier of the brand Eltroxin in Ireland.</p><p>  On 19 November 2014, the Health Service Executive (HSE) received a query from a pharmacy in relation to the availability of Eltroxin 50 mcg. At that time, the supplier AMCo had not notified the HSE of any issue with the supply. The HSE immediately contacted the company with regard to the supply of Eltroxin.</p><p>  The HSE has implemented emergency reimbursement arrangements to deal with this shortage. If pharmacists are unable to access Irish market authorised packs of Eltroxin the HSE is reimbursing imported alternatives (subject to the alternatives being reasonably priced) under existing protocols. The HSE has also been in discussion with other suppliers and expects on the basis of current feedback from suppliers that imported stocks would be available at the same price as the Eltroxin price if the shortage were to continue long term. It should be noted that the HSE cannot obligate any generic supplier to enter the market. Additionally the HSE has been working closely with AMCo and has required it to provide weekly reports of stock availability of all strengths of Eltroxin Tabs until supply is re-established to an acceptable level.</p><p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) became aware of a shortage of Eltroxin 50mcg tablets during the week of 1 December 2014.  It understands that the shortage was due to a regulatory non-compliance by the manufacturer.  The non-compliance was that a registered in-process test was not being applied during manufacture of current batches of Eltroxin.  A regulatory request from the MAH was approved by HPRA on 5 December 2014 to allow the release of four batches of Eltroxin 50mcg tablets to the market to resume supply of this medicine.  The four batches were at the distributor in Ireland at the time of approval of the variation and are expected to supply the market for 3-4 months. It is expected that a similar regulatory request will be made by the MAH to the HPRA during the week of 8 December 2014 to ensure continued supply of Eltroxin 100mcg tablets.  In the meantime, prescriptions for Eltroxin 100mcg can be met with the Eltroxin 50mcg tablet product.</p><p>  Parallel exporting is the exporting of medicines intended for use in one market to other countries in the EEA.  EU law provides for the free movement of goods across borders within the EU so the practice of parallel import and parallel export of medicines is legal.  Member States may restrict the free movement of goods only in exceptional cases, for example when there is a risk resulting from issues such as public health, environment, or consumer protection. In Sept 2011 the HPRA wrote to the majority of wholesalers regarding the public service obligations contained in the Medicinal Products (Control of Wholesale Distribution) Regulations, 2007. The HPRA is following up on the possibility of Eltroxin product being parallel exported from Ireland.</p></reply>

My officials could not consider favourably,  as proposed by the applicants, removing this core eligibility criterion by  providing Home Tuition funding for children who were ineligible for Home  Tuition under the terms of the scheme. Similarly, my officials could not agree  to a proposal to guarantee continued funding for such children until the age of  6. <br/><br/>  Having rejected the application on these grounds , the third change, which  related to direct payment arrangements to the applicants to support the  proposed venture did not arise.</p></reply>

I have listened to their concerns and reflected on  how I could present the necessary reforms to address their concerns and those  of other partners. <br/><br/>  On November 10th I presented my revised proposal to the Teacher Unions. It  includes a combination of 60% of marks to be allocated to a final exam at the  end of third year which will be set and marked by the SEC, alongside 40% of  marks to be allocated for school based work such as portfolios and projects to  be assessed by teachers which will be accompanied by the SEC monitoring 10-15%  of these marks.  <br/><br/>  What is assessed is valued; school based assessment promotes a learning culture  in schools. It recognises and rewards skills which cannot readily be assessed  through externally assessed written final examinations. <br/><br/>  It is essential that students are marked by their own teachers to promote  better student learning and improved student outcomes. School based assessment  empowers teachers to support the unique talents and skills of the students in  their classrooms. It allows for a much more rounded picture of student  achievement to emerge.  <br/><br/>  This combined approach with its external checks and balances will lead to state  certification on completion of junior cycle.It will have integrity and  validity and teachers will be supported in this change. <br/><br/>  This reform is not about protecting systems, it is about improving standards.

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene at the appropriate level with such pupils. Schools are supported in this regard by the National Educational Psychological Services. <br/><br/>My Department has provided guidelines for schools in relation to the utilisation of additional teaching resources which have been allocated to them for pupils with high incidence special educational needs. These include Circular SpEd 02/05 and the National Edcuational Psychological Services (NEPS) Continuum of Support Guidelines.<br/><br/>It is a matter for schools to then monitor and utilise their allocation of additional teaching support to best support the needs of identified pupils, in accordance with my Department's guidance. The teaching time afforded to each individual pupil is decided and managed by schools, taking into account each child's individual learning needs. <br/><br/>A parent who feels that their child requires additional learning support in school should raise this matter directly with their school Principal in the first instance, or with the Board of Management of the school.<br/><br/>Finally, I wish to explain that further resources provided to schools to support pupils with SLDs include funding for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers and/or software to assist children with special educational needs, including children with SLDs, once relevant professionals recommend the equipment as being essential for the provision of education. Schools can apply to the local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) directly for this support. <br/><br/>An information resource pack on dyslexia in CD-Rom, DVD and video format, has been developed by my Department in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. This product has been made available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video provides support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-Rom assists teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom. </p></reply>

At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. At post-primary level, learning/language support is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.</p><p>  The new arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support. Further additional temporary support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils (at least 20% of total enrolment) that require language (EAL) support. These allocations are made on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the Staffing Appeals Board. The appeal criteria are set out in the published staffing arrangements.</p><p>  The Teaching Council's criteria for Initial Teacher Education (ITE) sets out the mandatory elements to be contained in all Initial Teacher Education Programmes. These include Inclusive Education, (Special Education, Multiculturalism, Disadvantage, etc) Literacy, Numeracy and Differentiation. The Council's criteria does not overly prescribe what should be covered in programmes, rather, the approach is that ITE is about the development of critical core skills, which can then be applied to any range of issues in the classroom, possibly with the benefit of further up-skilling post-qualification.</p><p>  The Professional Development Service for Teachers offer workshops and school support in the area of EAL to primary schools.  The purpose of the workshops is to provide key information on EAL to both language support teachers and teachers supporting children with EAL under the general allocation model.  At post-primary level, support is made available to schools on request in the area of EAL and work on literacy incorporates aspects of EAL in many cases.</p></reply>

The Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006 require our higher education institutions to promote gender-balance and equality of opportunity among students and staff, and to prepare and implement statements of policy in respect of equality, including gender equality, across all of their activities. The HEA has a role in reviewing these policies. </p><p>  The HEA also publishes profiles of individual higher education institutions and these provide the framework for the enhancement of data-collection by the HEA across all areas of the mission of higher education, and they will be complemented by the development of a database of staff employed in the sector, empowering us to ensure that gender-equality at all levels within the academic profession in Ireland becomes a reality.</p></reply>

Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs and the Department does not stipulate how secretarial services are to be obtained. Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. The Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the above, a forum was established under the Towards 2016 Agreement involving the Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, IMPACT and SIPTU to examine the factual position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of employment of secretaries (and caretakers) employed using grant funding. However, it was not possible to progress the forum's agenda beyond the initial fact finding survey, due to the State's budgetary and financial position. </p><p>  Secretaries employed by schools using grant funding are not regarded as public servants except for the purposes of the pay reduction under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No.2) Act 2009, due to the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; used in that Act. The fact that such staff come within the definition of &quot;public servant&quot; solely for the purposes of the Act does not alter their employment status in any other respect.</p></reply>

The total targeted provision of over 110,000 social housing units, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme, will address the needs of the 90,000 on the housing waiting list in full, with flexibility to meet potential future demand.<br/><br/>The Strategy delivery target of 35,000 new social housing units is in line with the level of necessary new provision which the Housing Agency has identified based on their analysis of the results of the Housing Needs Assessment. The Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2013 identified 89,872 households assessed by local housing authorities as being eligible and in need of some form of social housing support. As part of the reporting exercise, additional information on households was collected including, household composition, category of need and current tenure type for each household.

I have asked the Housing Agency to publish a report of its analysis and findings on its website, .<br/><br/>Chapter 2.4 of <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform,</i>entitled the &ldquo;The Nature and Scale of Social Housing Need&rdquo;, provides details on the factors that were taken into account in arriving at the overall delivery target of 35,000 new social housing units. <br/><br/>The Strategy contains 37 actions, including a commitment to carry out the Housing Needs Assessment on an annual basis from 2016 onwards and to review progress on delivery of the Social Housing Strategy, including all targets and underlying assumptions, by Q1 2017. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role relates to overseeing the implementation of the overarching Construction Products Regulation (and its predecessor , the Construction Products Directive). In this regard, my Department has been working with a wide range of organisations in both the public and private sectors in order to ensure that the construction industry was made aware of, and could prepare for, the Construction Products Regulation, and that an effective system of market surveillance would be in place, when it came into full effect in Ireland (and throughout the European Union ) on 1 July 2013. <br/><br/><i>EN 1090-1 Execution of steel structures and aluminium structures - Part 1: Requirements for conformity assessment of structural components</i>is one of a series of standards for the execution of steel and aluminium structures developed by a European standardisation technical committee, CEN TC 135, which is responsible for the standardisation of rules for execution of steel and aluminium structures for building and civil engineering works, including rules for inspection and control. Membership of CEN TC 135 is open to all CEN members, including the National Standards Authority of Ireland. Harmonised European standards are developed through an open and transparent process, are built on consensus between all interested parties and are published as national standards when formally adopted and published. My Department understands that public engagement was held in late 2004 - early 2005 on the standard when it was in draft form , ahead of its adoption in 2008, and its ultimate entry into force earlier this year. <br/><br/>I understand that a significant number of steel fabricators operating in the State have already established the systems necessary to comply with their obligations under the Construction Products Regulation and the requirements of I.S. EN 1090-1.  While my Department will continue to work with all stakeholders to facilitate the implementation of the Construction Products Regulation in Ireland, I would urge all affected steel fabricators to make the arrangements necessary to comply with their obligations under both the Construction Products Regulation and I.S. EN 1090-1 at the earliest possible opportunity. </p></reply>

In recent years and following a transitional phase in some cases whereby local authorities continued to offer services in parallel with private operators, the significant majority of local authorities fully exited the waste collection market at different times with private collectors now providing household waste collection services in all but three local authority areas. </p><p>  For those authorities still active in the waste collection market, the making of a charge in respect of a waste service is a local authority executive function under section 75(8) of the Waste Management Act 1996, as amended. Authorities that have now withdrawn from the market would also have set their own fees under the relevant legislative provisions in force at the time. Where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges. Consequently, the information sought in relation to charges either by local authorities or private collectors or the introduction of private collection services in different local authority areas is not held in my Department.</p></reply>

The provision of CAS properties is funded through the capital funding programme and local authorities do not make a rental payment to the approved housing body in respect of these properties.  Under the scheme, approved housing bodies are responsible for amongst other things, the proper management of their dwellings, the operation of letting policies and fixing of rents. It is a condition of advancing a loan under the scheme that housing authorities have a clear right of consultation in relation to the fixing of rents generally and housing bodies have a responsibility to fix rents at levels which are reasonable having regard to tenants&rsquo; incomes and the outlay of the approved housing body on the accommodation including the ongoing costs of management. Full details of the scheme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<br/><br/><br/><br/>My Department does not hold data on the amount directly paid by authorities to landlords in respect of individual lettings under the Rental Accommodation Scheme. However, based on data provided by local authorities, the average monthly rent paid under the scheme in 2013 broken down by different types of units was as follows:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>1 bed unit</th><th>2 bed unit</th><th>3 bed unit</th><th>4 bed unit</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;499</td><td>&euro;569</td><td>&euro;651</td><td>&euro;708</td></tr></table><br/><br/>With regard to the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme , the statutory pilot phase of the scheme has commenced in seven local authority areas - Limerick and Waterford City and County Councils, and Cork, Louth, Kilkenny, Monaghan and South Dublin County Councils.Limerick City and County Council is providing a transactional shared service to other local authorities during the pilot phase.<br/><br/>There are currently 307 households in receipt of HAP across 6 of the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot HAP scheme. South Dublin County Council is currently assessing new applicants for HAP and expects to start moving recipients onto HAP in the coming weeks. Roll out to the remaining local authorities is scheduled to begin on a phased basis in 2015.

Phase 1 targets the delivery of 18,000 additional housing units and 32, 4 00 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units, by the end of 2017. In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the delivery of 17,000 additional units and 43,000 Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) and Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units.<br/><br/>While proposals for delivery of social housing at local authority level is a matter for individual authorities taking account of statutory functions under the Housing Acts 1966 to 2014, proposals must be cognisant of measures outlined in the strategy. For 2015, I expect that some 7,400 new social housing units will be provided under the range of existing initiatives broken down as follows: 3,000 units through the leasing initiative; 2,000 new Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) units; 1,000 vacant local authority units will be refurbished and brought back to use; with a further 1,400 units to be built or acquired by local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies through the Social Housing Investment Programme and Capital Assistance Scheme. A further 8,400 households will be assisted through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).<br/><br/>The strategy provides a clear governance structure, which I will personally oversee, to ensure delivery.  Action 1 of the Strategy requires the agreement of targets for delivery of social housing next year and in subsequent years. These specific targets will be agreed through the governance structure , which is currently being put in place, in collaboration with local authorities and with input from the approved housing body sector. <br/><br/>The Strategy also provides for a dedicated work-stream to provide for an enhanced role for Approved Housing Bodies in the provision of new supply. A number of actions are proposed that will help to promote optimal configuration of what is a very diverse sector, and encourage the formation of the large scale providers that the sector needs.</p></reply>

The HAP scheme will bring all social housing supports provided by the State under the aegis of local authorities. The scheme will remove a barrier to employment by allowing recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment. HAP will also improve regulation of the rented accommodation being supported and provide certainty for landlords as regards their rental income.<br/><br/>It is intended that the strategy will be delivered in two phases. Phase 1 will target the accommodation of 32,400 households through HAP and RAS in the period to the end of 2017. In phase 2, spanning the years 2018 to 2020, the strategy targets the accommodation of some 43,000 additional households through HAP and the Rental Accommodation Scheme ( RAS ). The table below details the breakdown by scheme of additional households expected to be accommodated through HAP and RAS in the period 2015 to 2020.<table><tr><th><b>Delivery</b></th><th><b>2015</b></th><th><b>2016-2017</b></th><th><b>2018-2020</b></th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>Units </td><td>Units </td><td>Units </td></tr><tr><td><b>HAP</b></td><td>8,400 </td><td>20,000 </td><td>41,040 </td></tr><tr><td><b>RAS</b></td><td>2,000 </td><td>2,000 </td><td>2,000 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Period Total</b></td><td>10,400 </td><td>22,000 </td><td>43,040 </td></tr><tr><td><b>Cumulative Total</b></td><td><b>10,400</b></td><td><b>32,400</b></td><td><b>75,400</b></td></tr></table><br/><br/>It is intended that some 8,400 households will be accommodated through HAP in 2015. There are currently 307 households in receipt of HAP across 6 of the local authority areas taking part in the statutory pilot HAP scheme.  South Dublin County Council is currently assessing new applicants for HAP and expects to start moving recipients onto HAP in the coming weeks.  Roll out to the remaining local authorities is scheduled to begin on a phased basis in 2015.<br/><br/>Throughout the development of the HAP Scheme discussions have taken place with a wide variety of interested stakeholder s including landlord representative groups. This engagement will continue, as appropriate, as the scheme moves towards full roll out.<br/><br/>The delivery of the HAP Programme is being overseen by an Oversight Group co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Social Protection, and also including representation from the County and City Management Association (CCMA). The Oversight Group, taking account of the experience of the local authorities involved in the first phase of HAP, is considering the service delivery options, including the costs and resource requirements.</p></reply>

Of the units approved for leasing, over 5 ,500 are tenanted or in the process of being tenanted.  A further 1,500 units have received full funding approval and negotiations and legal agreements are being finalised.The remaining units are at approval in principle stage.<br/><br/>The <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>, which I launched recently, contains a number of actions to reform the delivery and management of social housing and one such action will be to increase the delivery of accommodation through the leasing initiative.<br/><br/>Since the initiative was announced in 2009, SHLI has expanded on a number of occasions to provide for new types of supply and to involve a wider range of agencies and bodies in delivering or managing leased accommodation. In that context housing units are acquired in a number of ways and through a variety of sources.

The Act provides that Irish Water can collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. The Act also provides that responsibility for the independent economic regulation of the water sector is assigned to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and the CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.<br/><br/>Existing arrangements for all non-domestic customers are remaining in place with no changes for the time being. On this basis, any agreements individuals have with their local authorities will remain, and the local authorities will continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water. Within this framework, I would expect that specific contractual arrangements entered into by local authorities would continue to remain in force, but this will depend on the nature of the contract or agreement. The CER will be reviewing all aspects of non-domestic water tariffs under a series of public consultations, so that an enduring tariff framework can be established for non-domestic charges. The CER will publish the time-line for this process before the end of 2014.<br/><br/>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives and has contacted all Oireachtas members to provide details of an improved level of service which it is aiming to provide. The team can be contacted via email to or by telephone on a new dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

The purposes for which housing authorities may incur expenditure in addressing homelessness are prescribed in Section 10 of the Housing Act 1988. <br/><br/>The Section 10 funding provided by my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis for the years 2009 to 2013 is set out in the following table.<br/><br/>In the period 2009 to 2012, Section 10 funding was provided by my Department at the rate of 90% of the costs incurred with the housing authority providing 10% from their own resources. From 2013 onwards, Section 10 funding is allocated to housing authorities on a regional basis through delegated funding arrangements. The basis for the 2013 allocations was to use the 2012 levels of recoupment as a percentage of the overall budget. Those proportions were maintained in 2013 and 2014 as outlined in the following table.<br/><br/>During 2013 a national allocation of &euro;45 million was available through my Department to housing authorities under Section 10 which represented a decrease of 3.32% on the 2012 outturn of &euro;46.546 million. This 3.32% reduction was applied equally to each of the 9 regional allocations for homeless services in 2013. <br/><br/>In 2014, regional allocations were maintained at the same level as 2013 and &euro;649,707, representing approximately 1.4% of the national budget, was allocated in respect of the Midlands Region. <br/><br/>Budget 2015 confirmed that an additional &euro;10.5 million will be available for homeless services across the country in 2015. This is an increase in funding of over 20% bringing the Exchequer contribution to &euro;55.5 million. The additional funding will ensure continued progress toward the achievement of the 2016 target of ending involuntary long-term homelessness and will assist in meeting commitments outlined in the Implementation Plan on the State&rsquo;s Response to Homelessness. My Department is currently considering the appropriate allocation of the 2015 homelessness budget so as to ensure that Section 10 homeless funding contributes to meeting the needs in the various regions. <br/><br/><b>Funding provided under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988</b><br/><br/><br/><br/><table><tr><th>Region</th><th>2009</th><th>2009</th><th>2010</th><th>2010</th><th>2011</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td><b>Amount</b></td><td><b>%</b></td><td><b>Amount</b></td><td><b>%</b></td><td><b>Amount</b></td><td><b>%</b></td><td><b>Amount</b></td><td><b>%</b></td><td><b>Amount</b></td><td><b>%</b></td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>&euro;38,967,542</td><td>69.51</td><td>&euro;40,521,375</td><td>74.07</td><td>&euro;35,732,525</td><td>74.25</td><td>&euro;32,398,290</td><td>69.60</td><td>&euro;31,322,223</td><td>69.60</td></tr><tr><td>South East</td><td>&euro;1,945,792</td><td>3.47</td><td>&euro;1,742,886</td><td>3.19</td><td>&euro;2,110,476</td><td>4.39</td><td>&euro;1,848,877</td><td>3.97</td><td>&euro;1,787,469</td><td>3.97</td></tr><tr><td>North East</td><td>&euro;1,197,451</td><td>2.14</td><td>&euro;1,037,617</td><td>1.90</td><td>&euro;912,250</td><td>1.90</td><td>&euro;910,194</td><td>1.96</td><td>&euro;879,963</td><td>1.96</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>&euro;872,375</td><td>1.56</td><td>&euro;666,344</td><td>1.22</td><td>&euro;624,897</td><td>1.30</td><td>&euro;672,027</td><td>1.44</td><td>&euro;649,707</td><td>1.44</td></tr><tr><td>South West</td><td>&euro;5,458,211</td><td>9.74</td><td>&euro;4,270,143</td><td>7.81</td><td>&euro;3,505,749</td><td>7.28</td><td>&euro;4,418,967</td><td>9.49</td><td>&euro;4,272,197</td><td>9.49</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>&euro;4,110,166</td><td>7.33</td><td>&euro;3,435,607</td><td>6.28</td><td>&euro;2,905,457</td><td>6.04</td><td>&euro;3,516,119</td><td>7.55</td><td>&euro;3,399,336</td><td>7.55</td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td>&euro;2,175,312</td><td>3.88</td><td>&euro;1,699,288</td><td>3.11</td><td>&euro;1,227,696</td><td>2.55</td><td>&euro;1,581,478</td><td>3.40</td><td>&euro;1,528,951</td><td>3.40</td></tr><tr><td>Mid East</td><td>&euro;885,801</td><td>1.58</td><td>&euro;906,842</td><td>1.66</td><td>&euro;697,665</td><td>1.45</td><td>&euro;839,146</td><td>1.80</td><td>&euro;811,275</td><td>1.80</td></tr><tr><td>North West</td><td>&euro;444,206</td><td>0.79</td><td>&euro;423,355</td><td>0.77</td><td>&euro;406,335</td><td>0.84</td><td>&euro;360,865</td><td>0.78</td><td>&euro;348,879</td><td>0.78</td></tr><tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td><b>&euro;56,056,856</b></td><td></td><td><b>&euro;54,703,457</b></td><td></td><td><b>&euro;48,123,050</b></td><td></td><td><b>&euro;46,545,963</b></td><td></td><td><b>&euro;45,000,000</b></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In addition, the Department assesses threats as they arise and issues advisory notices to Government Departments, energy and telecommunications companies, to assist these entities in addressing such threats.</p><p>  Building on existing capacity, my Department is preparing a new national cyber security strategy that will focus on improved cybersecurity capabilities.  This will include improved protection and resilience for digital public services and the users of the services, as well as plans to formalise a National Cyber Security Centre, based on structures that have been established over the last number of years.  I intend to publish the draft strategy for public consultation early next year, in consultation with colleagues in the Departments Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Public Expenditure and Reform, all of whom have specific roles in relation to cyber security and who are working collaboratively with my Department to develop the strategy.</p></reply>

While it is acknowledged that fossil fuels will remain part of the energy mix for some time to come, progress is being made towards increasing the share of renewable energy in our energy mix.  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020, to be achieved through 40% renewables in electricity, 12% in heat and 10% in transport.</p><p>  There are significant policies in place to incentivise the increased use of renewable energy.  The REFIT schemes underpin the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including hydro, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind.  To date, wind energy has been the most cost effective renewable technology in the Irish electricity market, contributing most towards the achievement of the 2020 target.</p><p>  Part L of the Building Regulations supports the uptake of renewable heat and the recently published Draft Bioenergy Plan recommends the introduction from 2016 of a Renewable Heat Incentive for larger heat users to change to heating solutions that produce heat from renewable sources.  The Biofuels Obligation Scheme and grant support for the purchase of electric vehicles underpin the deployment of renewable energy in the transport sector.</p><p>  In 2013, 7.8% of Ireland's overall energy requirement was met by renewable energy.  This equated to 20.9% of electricity demand, 5.7% of heat demand and 2.8% of transport being met from renewable sources.</p></reply>

The draft Plan will undergo Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments, including public consultation, which will inform the content of the finalised Plan.  These assessment processes will commence shortly.</p><p>  The draft Plan recognises that, although Ireland will remain a net importer of biofuels in the transport sector, meeting demand for biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant economic benefits.  Consequently, the draft plan contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass.  In this regard, the key recommendations include: the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na Mona and Coillte.</p><p>  Furthermore, in terms of developing new sources of biomass, the draft Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products.</p><p>  As regards electricity generation, technology choices are commercial matters for project developers.  The fuel used in the plant at Moneypoint is a matter for the operator and not a matter in which I, as Minister, have any role or function.  I am advised, however, that there are a number of important issues that would demand further consideration before biomass could be used at Moneypoint including a requirement for substantially more biomass than is available domestically, with large amounts of the resource having to be imported.  Furthermore, the commitment of substantial amounts of biomass to Moneypoint would divert scarce biomass away from the renewable heat sector, where biomass could be used more efficiently and where fewer alternative technologies exist.</p></reply>

No other electricity supplier had chosen to provide such a tariff, to either domestic or commercial customers, though they had been invited to do so by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER is the independent statutory body responsible for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets.<br/><br/>While Section 10A of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, as amended, provides that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources may give &ldquo;<i>general policy directions</i>&rdquo; from time to time, the Minister is expressly precluded from giving any policy direction in respect of any individual undertaking or person.<br/><br/>I am aware of the need to give further policy consideration to the place of microgeneration in our energy mix.  Analysis of the potential of micro-generation technologies such as small scale wind, solar and small scale hydro, has been carried out for my Department by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  It shows that while microgeneration has the technical potential to make a significant contribution to Irish electricity consumption, careful consideration would have to be given to the design of any potential future support scheme to ensure it is cost-effective.  The SEAI's findings, along with responses to the recent consultation on the Green Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland, will inform future policy on the provision of any market support for micro-generation.</p></reply>

Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a smaller contribution.</p><p>  There are already a number of supports in place for the deployment of electric vehicles.  The Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme, subject to finalisation of the budgetary arrangements, will continue next year as will the VRT relief for electric vehicles.  Additionally, the ESB is continuing to roll out both publicly accessible charging infrastructure and domestic charge points. </p><p>  Interest in electric vehicles is growing and in 2014 there was a significant increase in electric vehicle purchases through the grant scheme compared to previous years.  Of the 558 vehicles grant aided since the scheme commenced in 2011, 276 were grant aided in 2014 alone and demand is expected to continue to grow in 2015.  Furthermore, it is expected that the biggest technological developments in the sector will take place in battery and vehicle design and this will continue to address concerns regarding the battery range of electric vehicles.</p></reply>

This initiative is aimed at dealing with excessive speeds in residential areas which poses a serious danger to vulnerable road users within housing estates such as cyclists and pedestrians and especially children at play.  An increased use of a 30km/h speed limit and other associated measures in such areas can go a long way to addressing this problem.   </p><p>  Among the recommendations contained in the Circular to local authorities is that the latter should, as part of the measures to improve safety, go through the process of adopting bye-laws for the 30km/h limit for the selected estates.  As the Deputy may be aware, 30km/h is a special speed limit and statutory responsibility for setting such limit in respect of any specific road is vested in local authorities under section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 and requires a public consultation process followed by a decision by the Elected Members.  In order to go through this process, the Circular makes clear that it will be necessary, where relevant, for the housing estate to be taken in charge.   </p><p>  The taking in charge of housing estate roads by local authorities is provided for under section 11 of the Roads Act, 1993.  Where there is an undue delay by a road authority in taking a road in charge, there is provision under section 180 of the Planning Act 2000 for a majority of the qualified electors who own or occupy the houses within the estate in question to require the road authority to initiate proceedings under section 11 of the Roads Act, 1993.</p></reply>

These changes relate to a range of measures, including the National Car Test (NCT) system.  The commencement of these provisions was tied to a periodic update of the Garda PULSE system.  The update of PULSE involves extensive preparation and a long lead-in time.</p><p>  It has, for some years, been an offence to use a vehicle on public roads without a valid NCT certificate. Prior to yesterday&rsquo;s change, this offence involved a direct summons to court and the assignment of 5 penalty points on conviction.  The provisions in the 2014 Act bring this offence within the fixed charge notice system.  An alleged offender will now be issued with a fixed charge notice and, on payment of the &euro;60 charge, will have 3 penalty points assigned to their licence.  The driver will, of course, continue to have the option of going to court where 5 points will still apply on conviction.</p><p>  Enforcement of the relevant legislation is a matter for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If a person&rsquo;s NCT test date is imminent, it will be a matter for the Gardai to use their discretion.  However, responsibility rests with owners and users of vehicles to ensure their vehicles are in compliance with the law.</p><p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) informs me that it is able to deal with current demand and has also run a campaign to get people to book early, as the test may be undertaken up to 90 days in advance of the due date without affecting the expiry date of the new certificate.  This system, which is in place since September, is to ensure that owners have ample time to have their vehicle tested before their current NCT certificate expires and there are no plans to increase this voluntary early test period.</p><p>  The RSA also advise me that the vast majority of car owners, including those who require an early test, will receive an NCT appointment within 28 days.  The average waiting time for a full test in the month of November was 11.35 days.  I understand from the RSA that the availability of appointments on the NCT website is not a reflection of the total number of slots available to customers.  The NCTS website clearly advises customers that if they cannot obtain a suitable slot online to contact the NCTS call centre directly on (01) 413 5992.</p><p>  The recent changes to the penalty points system represent a further important contribution to making our roads safer for all users.</p><p>  Issues with road traffic legislation arose last week which have revealed that technical legislative amendments may be required in relation to the operation of penalty points.

In that regard, the Business Case is now being reviewed and assessed by the National Transport Authority (NTA). The NTA will ensure that the new business case is based on the latest data on population, transport demand, construction costs etc and meets all the requirements of the revised public sector code for capital projects which was published last year. I expect to receive it in Q1 2015. At the same time I expect to receive the outcome from the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study and the preliminary Business Case for the BRT to Swords. </p><p>  Following receipt and assessment of the reports I will then consider the options and priorities for addressing key public transport deficits in the GDA having regard to the costs and benefits and affordability of each project as well as funding sources and options including private funds, EIB loans and EU grants. </p><p>  Some of the DART Underground associated sub-projects which have benefits in and of themselves are either underway already, such as the City Centre Resignalling project, or preliminary studies have commenced, such as for the new CTC. Subject to funding availability, some of the other sub-projects may proceed over the next number of years.</p></reply>

Ireland operates within a framework of EU driver licensing law, and on this basis we recognise other EU driving licences for the purposes of mutual exchange, as all EU licences are issued according to the same standards.</p><p>  In addition, we have bilateral agreements with a number of non-EU states, where detailed study has shown that their licensing regimes and ours are compatible.</p><p>  We do not have such an agreement with the USA. This is because American driver licensing operates at State level, with widely varying systems and standards of licensing. Even if we were to recognise licences from some States, it could draw us into extremely complicated difficulties over the mutual recognition arrangements which those States would have with other American States.</p><p>  As a result, regrettably, people moving here with a US licence may drive only for a period up to a year on a visitor basis, but must then acquire an Irish licence. While they are required to undertake a theory test, mandatory lessons and driving test, they are not bound by the usual rule to be a learner for six months before taking the driving test.</p></reply>

The strategy also outlines the promotion of the voluntary use of high visibility material for pedestrians.     </p><p>  The Road Safety Authority has introduced road safety awareness campaigns that promote Personal Protection Equipment for vulnerable road users (pedestrians and cyclists), and which support a modal shift to healthier forms of mobility such as walking and cycling.

It is my intention to allocate the current provision of &euro;4 million in a manner that will help to support a wide range of activities and events by interested groups, including local community groups and the arts sector. There will also be a special emphasis on education projects, as recommended by the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations.  A widespread public consultation process is now underway, the aim of which is to encourage and facilitate the involvement of ground-up initiatives in the wider commemorative programme.<br/><br/>A number of solemn State events will take place in 2016 to commemorate the events that took place during the 1916 Easter Rising.  On Easter Saturday, 26 March 2016, there will be a remembrance ceremony at Arbour Hill followed by a special State reception for the 1916 relatives.  On Easter Sunday, 27 March 2016, there will be a wreath-laying ceremony at Kilmainham Gaol in the morning, followed by a formal State parade to be led by representatives of the relatives who fought and died in 1916. On the evening of Easter Sunday there will be a State reception in Dublin Castle.  On Easter Monday there will be an interfaith service at St. Mary's Pro-Cathedral.  On Sunday 24 April, the actual date of the Rising, there will be a commemoration at Arbour Hill, hosted by the Minister for Defence, and ceremonies will be held at the graves of the 1916 leaders.<br/><br/>In addition, a capital provision of &euro;22 million will be allocated in 2015 to a number of flagship projects, including:<br/><br/>- the development of a permanent exhibition space and interpretative centre at the GPO;<br/><br/>- the restoration of Kilmainham Courthouse to enhance the visitor experience at Kilmainham Gaol;<br/><br/>- the provision of a permanent visitor facility at Cathal Brugha Barracks for the Military Service Pensions Archive;<br/><br/>- the development of visitor facilities at Teach an Phiarsaigh, Ros Muc;<br/><br/>- refurbishment works at Richmond Barracks;<br/><br/>- the development of a Tenement Museum in Dublin; and<br/><br/>- the commencement of refurbishment and development works at the National Archives and the National Concert Hall's Kevin Barry rooms.</p></reply>

After extensive deliberations, a final consent under the National Monuments Acts was given by my predecessor to the monument owners in April 2014 for the creation of a 1916 commemorative centre in the monument buildings, involving the full repair and conservation of the structures, both internally and externally. The advancement of these proposals is a matter for the monument owners and Dublin City Council. </p><p>  The development plans for the wider Moore Street area have been approved in decisions made by Dublin City Council and An Bord Plean&aacute;la under the Planning Acts and are entirely outside my remit under the National Monuments Acts. </p></reply>

The 1926 Census is the next full set of Census records, after the 1911 returns, which is available to the State. However, current legislative provisions, as contained in the Statistics Act 1993, require that census data must be withheld for 100 years. Accordingly, it is not possible at this time to release the 1926 Census returns before the statutory period has elapsed in 2026. If the records were to be released before the expiry of 100 years, a<font color="#004080"> </font>major<font color="#004080"> </font>change in legislation and policy would be required to allow for the early release.  This is not currently being proposed. <br/><br/>A 1926 Census Working Group has been formed, comprising officials from my own Department, the National Archives and the Central Statistics Office. The Group has examined this complex project and has assessed the significant resources - in terms of additional financial, staff and infrastructural resources - that will need to be in place to move the project forward to completion. I can say that, following discussions within the Working Group, I am of the opinion that the extensive preparatory work required to prepare the 1926 Census database for processing, and eventual digitisation to facilitate the release of the data into the public domain, should continue. It must be recognised, however, that, in light of the level of additional resources that will be necessary, and of the current engagement by the National Archives on a number of other important projects, including some that form a key part of the programme for the Decade of Commemorations, it will be necessary to work over time towards building the necessary capacity to undertake and oversee the 1926 Census project. </p></reply>
