Other investment commitments in the Plan in relation to rural development, education and innovation and compact growth, will also benefit the AEC region as a whole.  </p>  <p>  In order to support the development of the AEC, I have offered to co-fund the appointment of an AEC Officer in each of the Local Authorities along the Corridor.  The role of these officers will be to support the work of the Taskforce which was established to progress the AEC proposal, and which I chair.  The AEC Officer network will also ensure a coordinated approach in each Local Authority area to developing the concept.</p></reply>

The Government recognises the importance and worth of every type of volunteering activity, irrespective of its scale or the sector involved. The ongoing and future development of volunteering is key to ensuring that the sector continues to thrive and that we all benefit from the social enrichment that volunteering provides. </p>  <p>  The current policy on volunteering is set out in the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity, published in 2000, and the subsequent report by the National Committee on Volunteering,  "Tipping the Balance".   Much has changed in Irish society since then and we need to ensure that our volunteering policy is fit for purpose to support the sector into the future. </p>  <p>  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has commenced exploratory discussions with stakeholders on the need to review the current policy and develop a new national vision and action plan for volunteering in Ireland. This will ensure that our volunteering policy meaningfully supports the on-going development of this important sector.</p>  <p>  My officials will be reporting to me later this year with recommendations on how a new national strategy should be developed in partnership with the relevant stakeholders.  </p></reply>

In line with this commitment, Minister Michael Ring established the Atlantic Economic Corridor Taskforce in March 2017, and I now chair this Taskforce. </p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the AEC proposal is to maximise the assets along the western seaboard and connect the economic hubs, clusters and catchments of the region to attract investment, support job creation and contribute to an improved quality of life.  The Taskforce meets on a regular basis and has established a number of sub-Groups to assist it in its work.</p>  <p>  Project Ireland 2040 fully supports the development of the AEC and specifically highlights the contribution that the AEC can make to achieving the regional growth objectives of the National Planning Framework.

To date, &euro;1.16m of this funding has been drawn-down by Local Authorities. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that the 2017 Scheme was expected to operate over a 12-15 month period.  Therefore, it was always anticipated that a significant portion of the funds allocated would be drawn-down in 2018/2019 but only when the draw-down conditions are met, including the full completion of works which is required for final payments to issue. </p>  <p>  Under Budget 2018 I secured a funding allocation of &euro;15M for the Town and Village Renewal Scheme and officials are currently reviewing the scheme criteria with a view to launching the 2018 scheme during April. The deputy should note that I recently wrote to all Local Authorities advising them of an indicative schedule of scheme launch dates in respect of the Local Improvement, CL&Aacute;R, Town and Village Renewal and the Rural Recreation schemes. </p></reply>

I announced the reopening of the CL&Aacute;R Programme in October 2016.  CL&Aacute;R 2016 provided funding for three measures, Safety Measures for Schools and Community/Sports Facilities, Playgrounds and Multi-Use Games Areas (MUGA) and Local Access Roads.Following an assessment of the applications received I announced funding of &euro;8.24 million to 651 successful projects under the programme in December 2016.</p><p>The 2017 CL&Aacute;R programme was launched in March 2017 and The allocation for CL&Aacute;R for 2017 was &euro;5 million and funding was available under the following measures:</p><p>Measure 1:Support for Schools/Community Safety Measures </p><p>Measure 2:Play Areas </p><p>Measure 3:Targeted Community Infrastructure Needs </p><p>Measure 4:First Response Support Measure </p><p>Applications under Measures 1, 2 and 3 were submitted through the Local Authorities. Measure 4 was targeted at voluntary organisations involved in emergency rescue or first response efforts. The Department received 438 applications under Measures 1, 2 and 3 and 81 applications under Measure 4. </p><p>In May 2017 I announced &euro;1.21 million to the successful applicants (organisations) under measure 4 First Response Support<b>.  </b>This was a very successful measure that provided support for organisations that are involved in a voluntary capacity to respond to emergency situations in CL&Aacute;R areas all over Ireland.  </p><p>I subsequently announced &euro;768K in funding for measure 3 Targeted Community Infrastructure.  This funding provided support for the renovation and upgrade of community infrastructure. </p><p>I also announced &euro;2.7M for successful applicants under Measure 1 Safety Measures for Schools and &euro;2.2M for measure 2 Play Areas. This brings the total funding allocated under CL&Aacute;R in 2017 to &euro;6.91M for 231 projects across the 4 measures. </p><p>The CL&Aacute;R programme is an important part of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development, and makes a huge contribution to supporting the most depopulated areas in rural Ireland.  Over 800 projects have now been approved for funding since the scheme was re-launched last year. </p><p>I have secured an allocation of &euro;5m for CL&Aacute;R for 2018. I propose to launch a further round of the CL&Aacute;R programme in March and I will be considering the measures to be supported over the coming weeks</p></reply>

The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector.  Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection. This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention. </p>  <p>  In April 2017 the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment (DCCAE) published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available on his Department&rsquo;s website, www.broadband.gov.ie.  This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. </p>  <p>  The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p>  <p>  -  The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p>  <p>  -  The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p>  <p>  -  The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to rollout high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with Minister Naughten in April.      </p>  <p>  In the South Dublin County Council area 98% of premises fall into the BLUE area while 1% of premises are in the AMBER area.  Approximately 1% of premises fall into the LIGHT BLUE area. Individuals can check which category their premises falls into accessing www.broadband.gov.ie and entering their eircode into the High Speed Broadband Map.</p>  <p>  The DCCAE is in a formal procurement process to engage a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area.  That procurement process is now at an advanced stage. &ldquo;Detailed Solutions&rdquo; have been evaluated by the NBP specialist team. This is the last stage of the procurement process before moving to the final tender stage, which will be followed by the appointment of a preferred bidder and contract signature.  When the procurement process reaches a satisfactory conclusion and a subsidy level is agreed by Government, a contract will be awarded and the network rollout will commence.</p>  <p>  In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p>  <p>  Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.

A comprehensive structure is in place to govern the relationship between my Department and Pobal.  </p>  <p>  As a body under my Department's aegis, the overall governance arrangements between my Department and Pobal are set out in an overarching Service Level Agreement (SLA), as required by the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.  In addition, there are programme-specific Service Agreements in place in respect of each individual programme which Pobal operates on my Departments behalf.  The previous overarching SLA relating to Pobal was signed by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in July 2015 and expired in December 2017.  My Department are currently in the process of finalising the text for the new overarching Service Level Agreement/Oversight Agreement with a view to signing same in the coming weeks.

The service agreement outlines the range of services to be provided by Pobal and the agreed payments to be made based on the projected levels of activity in each given year. The services provided by Pobal for specific schemes include detailed programme design, information events, application processes, application appraisal, contract administration and financial management. </p>  <p>  A 2016 Dormant Accounts Action Plan was put in place in May 2016, again by the then Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government. A transfer of functions to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs subsequently took place in June 2016. Following this transfer of functions a service agreement was put in place for the administration of 4 measures under the 2016 Action Plan.  This service agreement again outlines the agreed payments to be made based on services to be provided and the projected level of activity in each given year. </p>  <p>  All payments made to Pobal in relation to the Dormant Accounts Fund are covered by the service agreements for the 2014 and 2016 Action Plans.  To date, Pobal have not run any measures associated with the 2017 Action Plan.

The report also identified a number of reasons for the underspend, including delays in implementing programmes and a lower than expected level of uptake for some schemes.<b></b></p><p>My Department has commenced a full review of the Disbursement Scheme 2013-2016.  This review, which will be completed by the end of June 2018, will set out to improve the administrative procedures governing Dormant Accounts funding to maximise the effectiveness with which funds are distributed in order to better support the people and communities at whom the funding is aimed.

The Company operates under the aegis of my Department, which has an oversight and governance role.  </p><p>The overall governance arrangements between my Department and Pobal are set out in a framework Service Level Agreement (SLA).  In addition, there are programme-specific Service Agreements in place in respect of each individual programme which Pobal operates on my Department's behalf.  The most recent framework SLA relating to Pobal was signed by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in July 2015 and expired in December 2017.  My Department is currently in the process of finalising an updated SLA and the previous SLA remains in operation until the new agreement is concluded.</p><p>Pobal currently has responsibility for delivery of approximately 25 programmes on behalf of four different Government Departments.The majority of the programmes operated by Pobal are managed on behalf of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs; other Government Departments who use Pobal&rsquo;s services are the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, the Department of Health and my own Department.  Each programme that Pobal manages and supports differs, as does the extent of Pobal&rsquo;s involvement.  The company operates within programme-specific Service Agreements established with each individual Department.  Each year the Company agrees a Programme of Work with each Government Department for any work they are requested to undertake.  </p><p>With regard to procurement, legal advice was obtained a number of years ago from the Attorney General's Office to the effect that, due to the nature of its work which is exclusively on behalf of the State, Pobal was exempt from the requirements of the EU Procurement Directive.  Accordingly, the services provided by Pobal on behalf of Government Departments in the management and operation of state funded programmes are not subject to a tendering process.

The Plan contains over 270 actions for delivery across a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations to support the economic and social progress of rural Ireland.  </p>  <p>  My Department has been liaising with our implementation partners since late last year with a view to compiling the second six-monthly Progress Report on the implementation of the Action Plan.  The Monitoring Committee for the Action Plan will meet this week to consider the draft Progress Report and I expect to be in a position to publish the report in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I intend that the Action Plan will continue to deliver progress on rural development issues across Government in 2018.  In terms of actions being progressed by my own Department, I am pleased to report that many of the funding schemes run by my Department which were such an outstanding success in the first year of the Action Plan's implementation, such as Town and Village Renewal, Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure, CL&Aacute;R, and the Local Improvement Scheme, will also be run again in 2018.</p>  <p>  I would also note that the recently launched Project Ireland 2040, gives clear support to the objectives of the Action Plan for Rural Development.  One of the ten strategic objectives set in the National Planning Framework is to ensure strengthened rural economies and communities.  The NPF highlights both the continued potential of the traditional pillars of the rural economy as well as the opportunities that will arise through new technologies and investment. </p>  <p>  In addition to funding across sectors such as transport, tourism, energy and communications, the National Development Plan commits to establishing a Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which will provide &euro;1bn over ten years to support the sustainable growth of towns, villages and rural areas.  This will support the achievement of the objective of strengthened rural economies and communities. </p></reply>

This includes the Copenhagen Economics report on <i>Strategic Implications for Ireland arising from changing EU-UK Trading Relations</i>, which was commissioned by the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  This authoritative and independent report sets out the possible economic consequences, both macro-economic and sectoral, of various Brexit scenarios. It will help in the further preparation of our priorities for the negotiations and the consideration of possible additional mitigation actions over and above the many which are already in train.</p><p>Achieving the best possible outcome for Ireland in the negotiations remains a central dimension of Ireland&rsquo;s strategic response to Brexit. In this regard, both I and my officials are continuing to work closely with EU partners and the European Commission Task Force, and with the UK, to ensure the commitments made in phase one are delivered in full and that Ireland&rsquo;s interests are advanced in the EU&rsquo;s position for the negotiations on transitional arrangements and the future relationship. In the course of these engagements, as has been the case to date, Ireland will continue to make proposals to seek to deliver on our objectives and priorities for the Brexit negotiations. </p><p>In parallel, intensive work on a no-deal or worst-case outcome is also ongoing.  Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which would result from such an outcome. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.It also takes account of the planning being undertaken at EU level by the new Commission Preparedness Unit, which is issuing information notes aimed at different business sectors.</p><p>The Government is already acting in order to get Ireland Brexit ready. Dedicated measures were announced in Budget 2018, including a new &euro;300m Brexit Loan Scheme for Business and a &euro;25m Brexit Response Loan Scheme for the agri-food sector as well as additional supports for capital investment in the food industry and Bord Bia marketing and promotion activities, amounting to over &euro;50m in total.  Additional capital expenditure allocation of &euro;4.3bn over four years will also allow the State and its agencies to properly plan major infrastructure projects while ensuring that communities and businesses can plan ahead. There was also increased funding provided to my Department for the opening of six new diplomatic missions as part of Global Footprint 2025, which will contribute to helping our exporters find new markets. Our Government&rsquo;s enterprise agencies continue to work with companies, helping them to deal with Brexit &ndash; making them more competitive, diversifying market exposure, and up-skilling teams. </p><p>Our longer-term economic strategies will also be critically important in addressing the challenges of Brexit, notably Ireland 2040 &ndash;the National Development Plan. The Enterprise Strategy 2025 is also under review,  and we are in active discussions with the European Investment Bank for a potential increase in investment in the country. </p></reply>

The Passport Service has received over 129,000 applications between 1 January and 16 February 2018, which represents an increase of 16% on the same period last year.  In order to respond to seasonal demands and anticipated application increases, the Passport Service has received sanction for 210 Temporary Clerical Officers (&ldquo;TCOs&rdquo;) to be appointed to the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork this year. Training for the first intake of TCOs has already commenced, with a sizeable proportion already in place.  All TCOs are expected to be fully trained and in place by the end of March at latest.   The Passport Service is currently processing over 59,000 passport applications. These applications are going through the normal checking, processing and security stages. </p>  <p>  Of these current applications, approximately 23,000 are for passport renewals while approximately 12,000 are first time applications. Some 24,000 are in the early stages of the application process and as such, the type of application has yet to be identified.  The turnaround timeframe for processing these applications will depend in the first instance on the channel through which the application was submitted. </p>  <p>  The target turnaround time for applications made via the Online Passport Renewal Service is 10 working days plus postage. The vast majority of online applications are currently being processed within 7 working days, well ahead of the target.  At present, the online service only accommodates adult renewals and passport card applications. It is planned to further extend the online application facility to all citizens, including first-time applicants and children, by 2019.</p>  <p>  The current average turnaround time for applications submitted through An Post Passport Express has now increased to 17 working days for both first time applications and renewals. It is expected that this turnaround time will return to the target turnaround time of 15 working day in the coming weeks, as more temporary staff are trained and placed.</p>  <p>  The average turnaround time for postal applications submitted through the Passport Office in London is currently 4 weeks for renewals with a minimum of 7 weeks for first-time applications.  Applicants resident in Great Britain also have the option of submitting Passport Express applications through two selected post offices in Liverpool and Glasgow, with applications submitted through this channel taking an average 17 working days to process. </p>  <p>  Applications submitted through the worldwide network of Irish Embassies and Consulates are currently taking a minimum 6 weeks to process from the date the application is registered at the Passport Office. Delivery times will vary depending on the location of the applicant. I would urge applicants wishing to renew their passports who reside overseas, including Great Britain, to avail of the online passport renewal service where possible.</p></reply>

At a cost of &euro;80, which breaks down to &euro;8 per year, the Irish passport fee compares with approximately &euro;8.20 per year for a British passport, &euro;8.50 per year for a French passport, &euro;8.90 per year for renewal of an American passport and &euro;18.10 per year for an Australian passport.    Given that the production cost of a passport is the same, irrespective of validity, and given that the shortfall in revenue would have to be met by the taxpayer, I do not have any plans to offer a three year passport at a reduced cost for persons over 70 years of age.</p></reply>

The National Plan aims to give effect to the Guiding Principles through the promotion of responsible business practice at home and overseas, and was developed following an extensive consultation process. </p>  <p>  The National Plan is designed to be a living document which will permit updates to reflect contemporaneous developments.  One goal of the National Plan is to assist and encourage businesses to understand that respect for human rights is good for business.  Part of this process is to encourage businesses to promote human rights within their business operations and engage positively with organisations and individuals seeking to do the same.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has responsibility for the operationalisation of a number of actions set out in the National Plan, including the establishment of a Business and Human Rights Implementation Group.  This group will consist of representatives from Government, the business community and civil society.  It is envisaged that the group will meet twice a year to review implementation of the National Plan.  Work is underway to establish the Group and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is liaising with stakeholders in this regard.  A key priority is to identify an individual with a strong track record in the promotion of human rights in a business environment to chair the Group.</p>  <p>  Preliminary work has also been undertaken to commission a baseline assessment which will complete a comprehensive study of the legislation and regulatory framework pertaining to business and human rights as it applies in Ireland. </p>  <p>  Business and Human Rights has been added as a regular item on the agendas of both the Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Rights and the DFAT NGO Standing Committee and will be discussed at upcoming meetings of both bodies. </p></reply>

As such expenses are not subject to deduction of tax under the PAYE system, they are not included on the P60.  </p>  <p>  2018 will be the final year in respect of which an employer will be obliged to issue a P60 to employees and I understand from Revenue that the format for the 2018 P60 has recently been finalised.  With significant reform of the PAYE system applying from January 2019 under the PAYE modernisation programme, which will involve a new real-time reporting regime for all employers who make taxable payments to employees, employers will no longer be required to provide employees with a P60.  Instead, Revenue will provide employees with relevant pay and tax details.  I understand from Revenue that there are no proposals to collect information from employers regarding payments to employees which are not subject to deduction under the PAYE system.</p></reply>

Expenditure on petrol, as well as expenditure on food, drink, accommodation, and entertainment is specifically excluded from deductibility entitlement, even where the petrol or other goods and services are acquired or used for the purpose of a taxable business.  </p>  <p>  Under Article 176 of the EU VAT Directive, Ireland can retain certain restrictions on VAT deductibility that were in place before 1979. As VAT input deductibility has been restricted on petrol since 1972, Ireland can retain that block on deductibility. If this restriction is removed or eased, it would not be possible to reintroduce it.</p>  <p>  There is a case for petrol and diesel to be treated equally in terms of input deductibility entitlements as there is a greater level of diesel run personal motor vehicles in operation today than in the past. However, the provisions of Article 176 prohibit the application of a new deductibility restriction on diesel expenditure. As the anti-avoidance concerns regarding petrol expenditure deductibility continue, the restriction on VAT deductibility remains valid.</p></reply>

The CCMA applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.  </p><p>The CCMA sets out how mortgage lenders must treat borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears, with due regard to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits.  All cases must be handled sympathetically and positively by the lender, with the objective at all times of assisting the borrower to meet his/her mortgage obligations.  The CCMA sets out the framework that lenders must use when dealing with borrowers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears. </p><p>In relation to repossessions, Provision 56 of the CCMA provides that a regulated entity may only commence legal proceedings for repossession of a borrower&rsquo;s primary residence where the regulated entity has made every reasonable effort under the CCMA to agree an alternative repayment arrangement with the borrower or his/her nominated representative, and the specific timeframes set out in the CCMA have been adhered to or the borrower has been classified as not co-operating and notified in accordance with the CCMA.  <b></b></p></reply>

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Lansdowne Road Agreement, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and IMPACT, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school / ETB.</p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.  The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2017/2018 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0042/2017 which issued on 25 May 2017 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0042/2017 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed.  Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment. If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment.  Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/2006) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (IMPACT and SIPTU).</p><p>My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. </p></reply>

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary. </p><p>This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p><p>Section 29 of the Education Act, 1998 provides for an appeal by a parent or guardian to the Secretary General of my Department, or in the case of an Educational Training Board (ETB) school to the ETB in the first instance, where a Board of Management of a school, or a person acting on behalf of the Board, refuses to enrol a student in a school, expels a student or suspends a student for 20 or more days in any school year.

The Bill which passed Committee Stage on 28<sup>th</sup>June 2017 and will shortly proceed to Report Stage, is an important piece of legislation which strives to create a new more parent-friendly, equitable and consistent approach to how school admissions policy operates for the almost 4,000 primary and post-primary schools in this country. </p><p>The main provisions of the Bill include measures to: </p><p>- Ensure that where a school is not oversubscribed (which relates to 80% of schools ) it must admit all students applying;</p><p>- Ban waiting lists, thus ending the discrimination against parents who move in to a new area;</p><p>- Require all schools to publish their admissions policies, which will include details of the provisions for pupils who decline to participate in religious instruction;</p><p>- Require all schools to consult with and inform parents where changes are being made to admissions policies;</p><p>- Provide for a situation where a child (with special needs or otherwise) cannot find a school place, and allow the National Council for Special Education or Tusla (Child and Family Agency) to designate a school place for the child.</p><p>Last June during Committee Stage debate on the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill I advised that my preference is to make changes to the Equal Status Act, 2000 that would remove the capacity for state-funded denominational primary schools, where they are oversubscribed, to use religion as a criteria in admissions process.  In my proposal I also made it clear that I was anxious to deal with the position of minority religions. </p><p>My officials are currently engaging with the Office of the Attorney General on the development of legislative proposals on this matter and this work is nearing conclusion.

However sufficient demand for more choice emerged in 28 areas, including in Tramore, New Ross, Trim, Tuam and Castlebar. </p>  <p>  In the majority of the 28 areas surveyed where sufficient demand emerged, the level of parental demand for a wider choice indicated a size of a four classroom school being required to accommodate such a level of demand.</p>  <p>  Under the patronage divesting process, a school could be opened where a school building became, or was due to become available as a result of an amalgamation/closure of an existing school.  In some areas, in responding to demand for diversity where existing patrons were unable make school properties available, the Department also included an examination of properties held in public ownership.</p>  <p>  In order to facilitate the opening of these schools, their initial establishment, as with most new schools, has been in temporary start-up accommodation, pending a permanent school building being made available.  All schools, irrespective of their location, have to operate within their available accommodation and manage annual pupil intake accordingly.</p>  <p>  The initial establishment of these schools as four-classroom schools and the need to be cognisant of managing the available accommodation has been reflected in my Department&rsquo;s engagement with the patron body of the schools, Educate Together.  Indeed, a case has been submitted by Educate Together to my Department to further expand Tramore ETNS, New Ross ETNS, Trim ETNS, Tuam ETNS and Castlebar ETNS and this is currently under consideration.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently carrying out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to identify areas of demographic growth and determine where additional school accommodation is needed in order to plan for school provision nationwide and this work is almost complete.  In this context, the outcome of the nationwide demographic exercises will input into consideration of the case submitted by Educate Together. </p>  <p>  I have announced a new Patronage Reconfiguration process, which will accelerate the delivery of multi-denominational and non-denominational schools, to reach 400 live schools by 2030. Unlike the previous process, this plan will focus on live transfers, so that a school which transfers under this process would not be reliant on temporary accommodation</p></reply>

This new Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) will form part of the Government&rsquo;s commitments under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme (IRPP).  The Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) will see, over a two year period, up to 530 immediate family members of refugees or beneficiaries of subsidiary protection from established conflict zones come to Ireland as part of our overall commitment to accept 4,000 persons under the IRPP. </p>  <p>  This humanitarian admission programme is an initiative of the Government for the benefit of the families of those in receipt of international protection in Ireland and is not part of any EU programme.  The FRHAP will be operated under Ministerial discretionary powers and it will be in addition to the family reunification provisions provided for in the International Protection Act 2015.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the UNHCR and other stakeholders on developing the full operational details of the programme.</p>  <p>  I will also continue to apply my discretion in the area of family reunification for those outside of the International Protection process in the ways described in the Non-EEA Policy Document on Family Reunification and operated by INIS. </p>  <p>  The design phase of the FRHAP programme is at an advanced stage and additional details on the operation of the programme will be announced on the websites of the Department of Justice and Equality (www.justice.ie) and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie) in the coming period.

It is also the subject of a stakeholder conference today in Croke Park.</p><p>The report examines the Strategic Implications Arising for Ireland from Changing EU-UK Trading Relations and provides an evidence base on key trade and investment questions which will help to inform Ireland&rsquo;s position as part of the wider negotiation on the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.</p><p>It will also help to inform our evolving domestic policy response and measures necessary to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities arising as a result of Brexit.  Using a computable general equilibrium model to quantify new barriers to trade in goods and services which might emerge as a result of Brexit, the study: </p><p>- Quantifies impact of six possible Brexit scenarios on trade and investment &ndash; the impact of these scenarios on metrics such as GDP and exports is considered, and analysis of both short and long term impacts is examined; and </p><p>- Provides analysis of the likely impact of Brexit on key sectors. </p><p>All of the scenarios examined produce a result that is less favourable than a non-Brexit scenario.  However, regardless of the scenario, the Irish economy is still expected to record strong, positive growth out to 2030 - Brexit has a dampening impact, resulting in a lower growth rate than would otherwise have occurred. </p><p>Given the scale of the Brexit challenge, detailed cross-Government work is continuing at home to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit, in parallel to work in Brussels.  This includes contingency planning for all possible scenarios. </p><p>My own Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) continues to work with colleagues across government through the various structures including the Cabinet committee on all aspects of Brexit, to ensure the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise. </p><p>My Department plays a key role in implementing the Government&rsquo;s policies to stimulate the productive capacity of the economy and create an environment which supports job-creation and jobs maintenance.  Brexit impacts upon all of these areas, and on many others within the Department&rsquo;s remit. </p><p>In relation to Brexit, our objective is to support firms to adapt to the challenges and opportunities Brexit presents by ensuring we have fit for purpose policies.  Our strategy is to minimise risks and maximise opportunities by ensuring the growth and resilience of Irish enterprise post-Brexit working across four pillars which are: </p><p>- Helping Firms to Compete;</p><p>- Enabling Firms to Innovate</p><p>- Supporting Firms to Trade;</p><p>- Negotiating for the Best Possible Outcome;</p><p>My Department recently published &ldquo;Building Stronger Business&rdquo; which summarises the issues facing enterprise, the policy measures my Department has already taken, those we plan to take, our research programme designed to inform these policies, and the Departmental structural reforms put in place to ensure that we can work as efficiently and effectively as possible to support our companies.</p><p>Several important steps have already been taken to prepare our economy, including through a range of measures announced in Budgets 2017 and 2018, the commitments included in APJ 2017, and the targets included in the Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy. </p><p>From my Department&rsquo;s perspective, we are leveraging the expertise and enhancing the capacity of our Agencies to ensure that they are in the best possible position to address the needs of their clients in relation to competitiveness, innovation and trade diversification. This is being achieved through the provision of information, advice, training and other supports. </p><p>Specific DBEI actions to date include:</p><p>- DBEI has made an additional &euro;6 million in funding to its agencies, in 2017 and 2018, to recruit up to 100 additional staff, specifically to assist in the response to the evolving Brexit situation.  These resources have been distributed across Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority<b>.</b>These additional resources will be assigned to both overseas offices in markets that are growing and in Irish offices to address a range of Brexit issues, including the support for internationalisation activities, a strengthening of the LEOs ability to respond locally to help micro-enterprises, and enhanced support for innovation.</p><p>- The rollout of the Brexit Loan Scheme to provide affordable financing to Irish firms impacted by Brexit.  The scheme aims to make up to &euro;300 million available to business with less than 500 employees.</p><p>- We are developing proposals for a Longer-Term Business Investment Loan Scheme together with a new Business Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position themselves for a post-Brexit environment. </p><p>- The EU Commission has approved a &lsquo;rescue and restructuring&rsquo; scheme.  The scheme can be drawn on in exceptional circumstance for a company severely affected by Brexit.</p><p>- We are working with DG Competition examining other possible measures to support some of our most exposed and impacted companies should the need arise.  Such measures may need a greater level of support than is required under current State aid rules.</p><p>Looking forward, Action Plan for Jobs 2018 will continue to act as an effective lever for driving reforms that enhance the competitiveness of Irish firms, increase jobs and grow the resilience of our economy in the context of Brexit, while we are also finalising a review of Enterprise 2025 to take account of Brexit and other global challenges over the longer term.</p><p>Our response to Brexit will continue to evolve and the Copenhagen Economics study, along with evidence emerging from other relevant studies, as well as continued engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, will assist in informing the evolution of that response. </p></reply>

The Brexit Loan Scheme will be open to businesses of fewer than 500 employees which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit.  They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy demonstrating that they plan to innovate or adapt in response to Brexit.

The fund was administered by Enterprise Ireland.</p><p>The State Aid basis for the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund was the Temporary Aid Framework 2008.  Based on this derogation from the EU, the ESF was open for the years 2009 and 2010.</p><p>Enterprise Ireland approved &euro;80.4 million under the non-competitive ESF and paid out &euro;80.018 million.  223 companies were approved funding, and the average funding per enterprise was &euro;375,000. </p><p>The majority of the companies supported are still trading as viable entities, and continue to contribute to the Irish economy.  As of March 2017, over &euro;22.5 million has been redeemed to date from companies that were legally in a position to do so.  (A company must have distributable reserves to be in a position, legally, to repay the State.

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the  health service.  However, the challenge is to do this in an affordable and sustainable manner.  The medicines bill for the community drugs schemes &ndash; primarily the GMS, Long Term Illness and Drugs Payment schemes and the High Tech Arrangement &ndash; was approximately &euro;1.8 billion in 2017. </p><p>To ensure patients receive the highest quality care, resources invested in medicines must be used efficiently and effectively.  This requires an integrated approach to secure best value for money for all treatments, greater efficiencies in the supply chain and the use of the most cost-effective treatments.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is licensed for the symptomatic relief of neuropathic pain associated with previous herpes zoster (shingles) infection, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in adults.  It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.  The projected budget impact on introduction was low due to the specific licensed indication but total expenditure trebled between 2012 and 2016, from &euro;9.4 million to over &euro;30 million, mainly from off-license use for pain not associated with shingles. </p><p>An HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) review of this product highlighted that the clinical evidence for its use in PHN is limited due to lack of comparative data, and its value is uncertain for other types of pain.  The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that, in Ireland, only 5-10% of prescribing of this product has been for the licensed indication of PHN.</p><p>Following the MMP review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement system for the product from 1 September 2017.  This process supports its appropriate use, ensuring that PHN patients continue to receive this treatment. </p><p>Under the protocol, all patients who were receiving antivirals for shingles were automatically approved for the lidocaine medicated plaster.  No action was required by GPs and the patient&rsquo;s pharmacy was notified of his or her approval status.</p><p>However, since 1 December 2017, non-shingles patients no longer automatically receive this item under the community drugs schemes.  In August 2017, the HSE advised GPs and pharmacies of the changes and of treatment alternatives. </p><p>It is possible for non-shingles patients to be approved for the patch through the community drug schemes.  The patient's GP should apply to the Medicines Management Programme through the online system, and the MMP will review the application and inform the GP of its decision. </p><p>I am advised that the MMP has received over 4,700 applications from GPs, of which some 14% have been approved.  For many of the conditions applied for, prescribing of the patch was inappropriate, for example for conditions such as deep venous thrombosis, angina, gout and endometriosis.</p><p>Where a GP&rsquo;s application is rejected, it may be appealed.  The HSE advises that over 60% have been accepted on clinical grounds.</p><p>Full details of the review are available on the HSE website at <i>.</i></p><p>This decision is a matter for the HSE.  However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

The Directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross border healthcare within the EU, for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another Member State rather than in their home country. </p>  <p>   The HSE, as the National Contact Point (NCP) for the Directive has the responsibility to ensure Irish patients who seek to have healthcare abroad under the terms of the Directive are assisted with access to the information they need to make an informed choice. The HSE  advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorisation before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP.  The NCP will advise patients of the reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment/treatment being accessed. </p>  <p>  Regarding prior authorisation of healthcare, Article 8 of the Directive permits this in certain circumstances and was transposed into Irish law by Regulation 12 of S.I. 2013 of 2014 on 14 July 2014.  Regulation 12 lists the circumstances where the HSE may specify particular cross-border healthcare as subject to prior authorisation.  These circumstances are as follows:</p>  <p>  (a) involves planning requirements relating to the object of ensuring sufficient and permanent access to a balanced range of high quality treatment in the State, or the wish to control costs or avoid, as far as possible, any waste of financial, technical and human resources, and -</p>  <p>  (i) involves overnight hospital accommodation of the insured person for at least one night, or</p>  <p>  (ii) requires the use of highly specialised and cost-intensive medical infrastructure or medical equipment,</p>  <p>  (b) involves treatments presenting a particular risk for a patient, or,</p>  <p>  (c) is provided by a healthcare provider that, on a case-by-case basis, could give rise to serious and specific concerns relating to the quality or safety of the care, with the exception of healthcare which is subject to European Union legislation ensuring a minimum level of safety and quality throughout the European Union.</p>  <p>   However, the HSE may refuse to grant prior authorisation in the following circumstances:</p>  <p>  (a) the patient will, according to a clinical evaluation, be exposed with reasonable certainty to a patient-safety risk that cannot be regarded as acceptable, taking into account the potential benefit for the person of the sought cross-border healthcare;</p>  <p>  (b) the general public will be exposed with reasonable certainty to a substantial safety hazard as a result of the cross-border healthcare in question;</p>  <p>  (c) the healthcare is to be provided by a healthcare provider that raises serious and specific concerns relating to the respect of standards and guidelines on quality of care and patient safety, including provisions on supervision, whether these standards and guidelines are laid down by laws and regulations or through accreditation systems established by the Member State of treatment; or</p>  <p>  (d) the Health Service Executive can provide healthcare that is the same as, or equivalent to, the healthcare sought by the patient within a time limit which is medically justifiable, taking into account the patient&rsquo;s current state of health at the time the decision under this Regulation is taken and the probable course of the medical condition to which the healthcare relates.</p>  <p>  Nevertheless, a patient may, if they wish, request prior authorisation for any procedure regardless of whether or not this is required under Regulation 12.  This has the advantage for the patient as they will receive an indication of the level of reimbursement to expect and also an assurance they are complying with any conditions necessary under the terms of the Directive.</p>  <p>  As the HSE has responsibility for the administration of the Cross Border Directive I have asked the HSE to examine the issues raised concerning the information on the Cross Border Directive on its website and to reply to the Deputy as soon as possible. </p></reply>

This EU funding is supplemented by exchequer funding bringing the total allocation to &euro;4 billion, a substantial vote of confidence in Irish farming.</p>  <p>  The programme covers a suite of measures both ambitious and broad, and supports all farming sectors.  These measures reflect the issues, challenges and opportunities which Irish agriculture faces, and were put in place after lengthy consultation and analysis.  The Programme aims to enhance competitiveness, to encourage more sustainable farming practices and to deliver real and quantifiable results for rural communities and the rural economy generally. Achieving these results is very much dependant on farmers engaging with and participating in the various schemes and initiatives on offer, and I am pleased to say that, as with previous RDP programmes in Ireland, farmers are enthusiastically signing up to schemes under this RDP.  </p>  <p>  In fact, Ireland leads other Member States in terms of our implementation of the Rural Development Programme and currently has the second highest rate of drawn-down of EU funds among all Member States.  The average EU financial rate for draw down of funds up to the end of December 2017 was 25.9%, whereas Ireland&rsquo;s execution rate was 44.3%.  This progress is testament to the successful roll-out, uptake and implementation of schemes under the Programme to date.</p>  <p>  I fully anticipate that based on current up-take and projections, the entire budget allocation of some &euro;4 billion for the Rural Development Programme will be spent and that the entire &euro;2.19 billion of EU co-funding will be drawn down.  It is expected that the majority of funds will be spent by the end of 2020, although there will be some carry-over. Under EU regulations governing the Rural Development Programme, funds for multi-annual commitments entered into by the end of 2020 may be claimed up to the end of 2023.  RDP spending is also subject  to the annual estimates process and budgetary rules, but this should not affect the overall spend and any EAFRD funds unspent in a year are carried forward to subsequent years.</p>  <p>  In terms of RDP participation levels, I am pleased to say that there has been  excellent uptake to date.  At this stage of the programme, some multi-annual schemes such as GLAS, BDGP and the Organic Farming Schemes are fully subscribed. Other schemes such as ANC are applied for on an annual basis, and others such as TAMS will continue to recruit participants in tranches. </p>  <p>  Reaching the targets set out within the RDP is central to meeting the objectives of the Programme and to producing the desired results and outcomes.  It is therefore important that progression toward these targets is kept under review. To this end, and in line with EU regulatory requirements, my Department carries out an annual review of implementation by reporting on indicators collected on all schemes and measures.  This Annual Implementation Report, and a Citizens Summary on the results of this assessment is, once approved by the Commission,  published on the Department&rsquo;s website.  We will continue to review the implementation of the programme to ensure that we  are on target to meet all identified objectives and that all EU funding is fully drawn down.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.  Premises in the area referred to by the Deputy are in a BLUE area on my Department&rsquo;s High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>.  They are therefore in an area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p><p>While I have no statutory authority to intervene in the day to day operations of commercial operators, my Department is collating information in relation to individual cases where commercial plans to provide access to high speed broadband to premises within a BLUE area do not materialise.  I would encourage businesses in the referred area to provide my Department <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie</i>with details of the attempts made by the businesses to access a high speed broadband connection, with a view to my Department engaging further on this issue. </p></reply>

The cost of illegal dumping is not collated by my Department as it includes local authority enforcement, disposal and legal costs and also involves costs for other State agencies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>Illegal dumping is first and foremost a matter of individual responsibility and compliance with the law.  While enforcement action in this area is a matter in the first instance for local authorities, the Department encourages a multi-facetted approach to tackling the problem, incorporating enforcement, public awareness and education and, as such, the Department provides funding to support the activities of the Waste Enforcement Regional Lead Authorities (WERLAs) of approximately &euro;1 million per annum and of the network of local authority waste enforcement officers of approximately &euro;7.4 million per annum.  Dublin City Council receives an annual grant of &euro;982,000 in this regard. </p><p>In addition, the Department has developed an Anti-Dumping Initiative to work in partnership with local authorities and community organisations in identifying high risk or problem areas, developing appropriate enforcement responses and carrying out clean-up operations.  The 2017 Anti-Dumping Initiative saw funding of &euro;1.26 million provided by the Department which supported 229 projects across the country. This year, I am increasing the allocation to &euro;2 million to build on the momentum that has now been created and to provide for an increased focus on identifying and prosecuting illegal dumpers. </p></reply>

This proposal will allow mobile broadband services to use this part of the spectrum band. </p>  <p>  The EU Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy highlights the importance of this band for ensuring the provision of broadband services in rural areas.  The band is particularly attractive for wireless broadband services, allowing higher speeds and greater coverage over long distances.  </p>  <p>  In Ireland, the 700MHz band is currently used by digital terrestrial television services (DTT) and to meet the timeline of June 2020 for clearance of broadcasting services from this band, my Department and ComReg have been working to ensure the necessary measures are taken to facilitate a clearance of the spectrum.  This work is being carried out with the cooperation of RT&Eacute; (as owner and operator of the two DTT public service multiplexes) and its subsidiary, 2rn, as the owner and operator of the national broadcasting transmission network.</p>  <p>  Ireland does not foresee any difficulties which may prevent the signing of cross-border agreements with relevant countries.  ComReg and my department have fully engaged in the necessary technical and policy cross-border coordination work with the UK authorities and, in that regard, the date of 4 September 2019 has been identified as the start date for the coordinated migration of terrestrial broadcasting services from this spectrum band in both jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>  This date represents the beginning of a period of simulcast, which is designed to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that those households that rely solely on the Saorview DTT service can undertake the necessary preparations without undue interruption to their reception of that service.  It is considered that the period of simulcast will end by March 2020 and, at that time, all terrestrial broadcast transmissions in the 700MHz band will be required to cease. </p>  <p>  The management of radio spectrum is a matter for ComReg, which is independent in the exercise of its functions, including the future allocation of the 700MHz band and any terms and conditions attached to any licenses issued.  Having regard to the independence of ComReg in the matter, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further at this time.  I have no reason to believe that any process undertaken by ComReg will not result in the fair allocation of any future spectrum assignment and I expect the outcomes of any such process to provide a level of certainty and transparency for all stakeholders. </p></reply>

The consequence over many years has been that members of the public are put through a series of different and time-consuming processes in order to prove their identity when dealing with different public bodies.  </p>  <p>  In order to reduce this burden on both the citizen and the State, the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 - the legislative basis for the PSC - provided for all Government Departments and a range of public bodies, referred to in the Act as 'specified bodies', to request the PSC as part of transactions such as application processes.  The intention was to enable people to have one point where they could verify their ID for public services, which they could then use to access other public services.</p>  <p>  While the Road Safety Authority, which has responsibility for the National Driver Licensing Service, did not exist in 2005, it was later added to the list of 'specified bodies'.</p>  <p>  The requirement introduced in June 2016 for applicants for the driver theory test to produce a PSC is part of the gradual roll-out of this ID process.  </p></reply>

The programmes will operate under the following five strands:</p><p><b>Early Years Care and Education</b></p><p>Strand 1: New or expanding services; &euro;50k maximum grant size</p><p>Strand 2: Essential maintenance; &euro;20k maximum grant size</p><p>Strand 3: Natural outdoor play area; &euro;7k maximum grant size</p><p><b>School Age Childcare</b></p><p>Strand 4:  New or expanding services; &euro;20k maximum grant size</p><p>Strand 5:  Essential maintenance; &euro;5k maximum grant size </p><p>Grant funding under each strand will be allocated in a competitive process, for which applications opened on 12<sup>th</sup>February 2018 and will remain open until 3pm on Friday 9<sup>th</sup>March 2018.  Full details can be found in the applicant guidelines. </p><p>Of the five strands of funding available, Strands 1 (Early Years) and 4 (School Age) relate specifically to the creation of new childcare places.  In predicting the outcomes of these strands at such an early stage, it is important to note that every application for funding is subject to a number of variables.  For example, for Strand 1 (Early Years), applicants may apply for any amount between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000 in grant funding; for Strand 4 (School Age), the equivalent amount is between &euro;3,000 and &euro;20,000.  Individual projects for these strands can exceed the maximum available grant but evidence of funding for the full project must be demonstrated. </p><p>Further to this, there is a large variance in the amount of childcare places that must be created per grant approved under each strand.  In early years services, the age group for which places are being created is a significant factor.  As you will be aware, childcare regulations require different staff ratios and floor-space per child.  This is considered in the design of the Early Years capital programme so that, for example, under Strand 1 (Early Years), applicants must create a minimum of either 3 new places for 0-1 year olds, 5 new places for 1-3 year olds, or 11 new places for ECCE (3-5 year old) children. </p><p>For an applicant seeking funding under Strand 4 (School Age), the minimum amount of places to be created is determined by whether the project for which funding is sought is a relocation/expansion project (11 places), or a new build project (8 places).</p><p>At this early stage, and given the variables mentioned above, it is not possible to give an accurate prediction of the amount of new childcare places to be created under the Early Years and School Age Capital programmes in 2018.  In particular, it will not be possible to estimate how many places might be created - and for which age groups - until the appraisal process is concluded in May 2018.  </p><p>As the Minister I am committed to continuing to ensure access to high quality and affordable childcare.  To this regard I ensured that childcare capacity was identified as a strategy priority in the recently published National Planning Framework which attracted additional funding of &euro;250m in the National Development Plan.  I am also committed to further research to comprehensively identify the capacity needs of the sector which may emerge over the next decade.</p></reply>

However, I was very conscious of the underlying demand for the scheme in rural areas throughout the country. </p>  <p>  I therefore announced the provision of &euro;10 million to Local Authorities for a Local Improvement Scheme last September.  Based on demand and the capacity of Local Authorities to complete works before the end of 2017, I allocated an additional &euro;7.4 million to Local Authorities for LIS roads at the end of November. </p>  <p>  &euro;1 million was allocated to Co. Cork under the first LIS allocation in September 2017.  An additional &euro;151,985 was allocated to Co. Cork under the second round of allocations, bringing the overall allocation for Cork to &euro;1,151,985 in 2017.  Cork County Council drew down &euro;1,055,313 of that allocation by the payments deadline of 31st December 2017. </p>  <p>  It is clear that there is a continuing demand for LIS funding in rural communities across Ireland, and I have therefore secured an allocation of &euro;10 million for the scheme in my Department's Estimate for 2018.

It underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that the economic recovery can be felt by every community and that we build greater resilience for the future.  My Department's role is to enable economic development through the creation of jobs and the infrastructure required to support those jobs, and to support our communities to become sustainable and desirable places to live, work and raise families. </p><p>Our vision is that all communities will have the opportunity to grow and develop economically and socially.  To help bring this about, the Department will work across Government to:</p><p>- Create the conditions to support increased economic opportunities and local employment in all areas of the country</p><p>- Deliver schemes and programmes that support the revitalisation of towns and villages</p><p>- Improve access to services and social networks that ensure a high quality of life</p><p>- Enable communities disadvantaged by location or social issues to reach their full potential now and in the future</p><p>- Support all communities to be able to have a voice in shaping their own futures and addressing their common goals</p><p>Ireland is a dynamic place. Every day I see examples of the dynamism and ability to adapt that are happening right across Ireland.  It is local communities which are driving and delivering economic growth regionally and throughout the entire country.  The Government must enable and harness that potential and it is crucial that there is access to the services that are necessary to thrive in the 21st century economy.  </p><p>The Government launched Project Ireland 2040 on 16 February last.  This initiative emphasises social outcomes and values ahead of economic targets, and, outlines how Ireland should develop over the next 20 years, and where best to direct major capital spending.  It prioritises the wellbeing of all of our people, wherever they live, and whatever their background, and it is a plan for both rural and urban Ireland. </p><p>In Budget 2018, my Department secured in excess of &euro;220 million giving us the foundation we need to drive both the rural and community agenda and to deliver initiatives that can foster growth right across the country.</p><p>My Department delivers a variety of programmes that provide support for the sustainable development of communities in line with commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government and the Action Plan for Rural Development.  These schemes and programmes include flagship programmes such as the LEADER and the Social Inclusion and Community Activation (SICAP) Programmes, the Community Services Programme, RAPID, the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, the Outdoor Recreation Infrastructure Scheme, the CL&Aacute;R Programme, the Local Improvement Scheme (LIS), the Dormant Accounts Fund,  Seniors Alert Scheme and the Communities Facilities Scheme.</p><p>I am proud of the role my Department is playing in the rollout of the National Broadband Plan which aims to provide high-speed broadband access to all areas of the country. </p><p>There has been real progress since 2017 right across Government in implementing the Action Plan for Rural Development.  In 2018, I will continue to place a strong emphasis on delivery of actions across Government and developing strong policy frameworks to support rural development. My interests are not only in the work and investment of my own Department but the work and investments of Departments right across Government.  Every Department of the State must be involved if we are going to deliver balanced growth, equal opportunities and modern services no matter where you live in Ireland.</p><p>All schemes are open to applications from relevant parties during the application timeframes set for each scheme or programme. </p><p>My Department will continue to work with key stakeholders including local authorities, community and voluntary groups, and dedicated agencies to support job creation, attract tourism investment and to contribute to sustainable economic development in all communities throughout Ireland.  The Department will ensure that maximum use is obtained from the resources allocated and that value for money is delivered in respect of the 2018 schemes. </p><p>A key priority is to ensure better alignment, consolidation and integration of programmes across the Department, while we will also focus on cross-Departmental and whole-of Government approaches with a view to achieving greater impact and effectiveness in the delivery of our supports to communities.</p><p>Further information on schemes and programmes, including the Action Plan for Rural Development, can be found on my Department's website <i>www.drcd.gov.ie.</i></p></reply>

It also highlights the continued potential of the traditional pillars of the rural economy to support job creation in areas such as tourism and agriculture, as well as the opportunities that will arise through new technologies and investment.  </p>  <p>  Under the National Development Plan, the Government has committed to establishing a new Rural Regeneration and Development Fund which will provide an additional &euro;1 billion over the next ten years to support rural renewal.  Other funding streams in the National Development Plan, across sectors such as transport, tourism, energy and communications, will also support rural areas.</p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Rural Development will also continue to support the economic and social development of rural areas through short-to-medium term actions across Government.  The Action Plan contains over 270 measures to build sustainable communities, support enterprise and employment, maximise our rural tourism and recreation potential, foster culture and creativity, and improve rural infrastructure and connectivity. </p>  <p>  A second six-monthly Progress Report on the implementation of the Action Plan will be published in the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

The Plan contains 276 actions for delivery across a range of Government Departments, State agencies and other organisations to support the economic and social progress of rural Ireland.

The allocation for each sub-regional area is provided for the duration of the programme rather than on an annual basis.  This provides greater flexibility to the LAGs in managing their resources.</p>  <p>  Each LAG is responsible for deciding how their allocation is distributed to Leader projects over the duration of the programme, based on the objectives in their Local Development Strategies.  The allocation also includes a provision to cover the running costs of the LAGs.</p>  <p>  The balance of &euro;30 million in funding which has not yet been allocated under Leader is available for schemes which will be selected at a national level based on submissions from the Local Action Groups.  This includes a specific scheme to fund food projects which will be launched in the coming months, and funding to support LAGs that come together to jointly deliver a Leader project.  </p>  <p>  As of 16 February 2018, 738 projects with a value of &euro;20.8 million had been approved for Leader funding by the LAGs and &euro;996,656 in project payments had been made.  A further 318 projects requesting over &euro;16 million in funding are at various stages in the approval process.  This funding will be drawn down as projects start to incur expenditure and submit payment claims.  </p>  <p>  I anticipate that there will be a significant increase in project expenditure over the course of 2018 based on the progress which has been made by the LAGs in approving projects in recent months.  My Department has also introduced a number of administrative improvements to the Leader programme which will also assist LAGs and project promoters in their delivery of the programme. </p></reply>

My Department is represented on this group, as are the unions, Pobal and other relevant Government Departments.  </p>  <p>  The Forum last met on 23 November 2017 and I understand that a paper outlining the costs involved was presented.  Following on from this, I understand a meeting is being arranged in the coming weeks between the unions and my colleague, Paschal Donoghue T.D., Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  If circumstances arise where a CE supervisor is made redundant by their employer (the sponsoring organisation), and qualifies for a payment under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007, the supervisor would be entitled to statutory redundancy at a rate of two weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service, plus a further week&rsquo;s pay (subject to an earnings limit of &euro;600.00 per week).</p>  <p>  My Department (and previously F&Aacute;S) have consistently maintained that the only circumstances in which it will fund enhanced redundancy packages to CE supervisors is where the redundancy arises because of the actions of the Department due to restructuring of the CE programme e.g. mainstreaming schools-based CE schemes to the Department of Education in 2001 or the reduction in the overall numbers on CE, such as happened in the late 1990s/early 2000s due to reduced numbers of long-term unemployed on the Live Register.  Enhanced redundancy packages under the above circumstances were only funded by F&Aacute;S/DEASP where the sponsor/employer did not have the ability to fund the enhanced package. </p>  <p>  This does not apply where the employer is the instigator of the redundancy e.g. no longer wanting to run the CE scheme, closure due to Company Registration Office strike-off, or where the sponsor organisation does not comply with the terms of their contract (maintain participant numbers etc.) and it is necessary for the Department to discontinue funding for the scheme/supervisor/assistant supervisor positions.  </p>  <p>  My Department has not made a decision to reduce the overall number of CE places or to mainstream CE places in the case of any CE scheme closures in recent times.  Therefore, in these circumstances, there is no liability on my Department to pay enhanced redundancy. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

The level of contribution and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, including any exemptions from charging in specific circumstances if that is deemed appropriate, are therefore determined at local authority level, in accordance with the powers vested in elected members in this regard.</p>  <p>  For the purpose of supporting and incentivising economic development, including the roll-out of broadband infrastructure, my Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act on the implementation of development contribution schemes to which planning authorities are required to have regard in the performance of their planning functions.  For the purpose of ensuring consistency in the adoption and implementation of development contribution schemes by local authorities, the guidelines recommended that all local authorities should include a specific waiver for broadband infrastructure (e.g. masts and antennae) in their schemes. </p>  <p>  Most development contribution schemes adopted by planning authorities currently provide for such waivers.  In this regard, 23 local authorities have adopted schemes which include a full exemption for broadband infrastructure.  Six local authorities do not specify a waiver for such infrastructure in their current schemes; however, as there is no provision included in their current schemes to charge for telecommunications infrastructure generally, the practice adopted is not to do so.</p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with the remaining two local authorities regarding the incorporation of explicit waivers in their schemes.  Both local authorities have since prepared draft schemes that incorporate waivers for broadband infrastructure, which are currently out for public consultation.  Notwithstanding the fact that the adoption of these schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members, I anticipate that these schemes as finally adopted will comply with the 2013 guidelines in this regard.</p></reply>
