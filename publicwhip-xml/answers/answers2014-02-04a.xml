    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-04a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014020400052#WRA00700"><p>There was no decision made to cut my Department&rsquo;s allocation to Dublin City Council in respect of the housing programme for this year. Work is well advanced on preparing the capital allocations under the various housing measures which comprise the Social Housing Investment Programme for 2014. As part of this process, my Department liaised closely with the City Council to ascertain the level of commitments on on-going projects and in relation to demand-led schemes such as the private housing grants scheme.</p><p>  The overall level of funding available to me for the housing programme this year is broadly on a par with last year. While the Abridged Estimates 2014 show some variation in the capital provisions under the various measures compared to last year this reflects changing priorities in my approach for 2014. I expect the capital allocations to individual authorities will reflect this re-focussing also. For example, the &euro;50 million announced in Budget 2014 to fund investment in new social housing construction will allow me to announce a new local authority social housing construction programme this year. I will also announce details very shortly of a new measure, with funding of &euro;15 million, for the retrofitting of vacant and boarded-up local authority houses. I confidently expect that we can return as many as 450 of these houses to productive use this year and make them available to households on the waiting list. Given the high level of housing need in the city, I expect the City Council will benefit greatly under both of these measures. </p><p>  I am making additional funding available to local authorities this year under the suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability. All local authorities will benefit and the Dublin City Council allocation is up around 6% compared to last year. </p><p>  In 2014, national funding for homeless services from my Department is being maintained at the 2013 level of &euro;45 million. In 2013, Dublin City Council on behalf of the Dublin Region received &euro;31.3 million, or 69.9%, of the national total.  While the precise 2014 &lsquo;Section 10&rsquo; Exchequer allocation to the Dublin Region is yet to be determined I expect it to be broadly in line with last year&rsquo;s allocation.  The 2014 allocations will also facilitate the continuation of Dublin City Council&rsquo;s regeneration programme, including substantial progress in regenerating Dolphin House and St Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens. </p><p>  I intend to announce details of the local authority and voluntary housing construction programmes and the allocations under the new measure for boarded-up houses very shortly. Until then, I am not in a position to say what the overall allocation to Dublin City Council will be.</p></reply>

All interested parties are welcome to make written submissions during the consultation period, the closing date of which is 21 February  2014. Once the consultation period is closed, the submissions received on the draft guidelines will be considered and taken into account in the final form of the revised guidelines which I would expect to issue by the end of June.  The final revised guidelines will issue under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, which will require both planning authorities and An Bord Plean&aacute;la to have regard to them in the assessment of planning applications.</p></reply>

Irish Water is implementing the national domestic water metering programme for households connected to public water supplies.  As the metering programme will still be under way when charges are introduced, an appropriate approach to charging customers who are not metered at that stage will be put in place.  This will be structured in such a way as to ensure that it represents a reasonable proxy for usage and is fair.</p><p>  The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan submitted to the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in line with the provisions of the Water Services (No.2 ) Act, 2013. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plans and will engage in public consultation on the approach to charges.  Their initial consultation will relate to the principles and criteria underlying the structure of domestic tariffs including matters such as the breakdown between fixed and variable elements and the treatment of metered and non-metered customers. A subsequent round of public consultation will relate to the level of proposed charges.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-04a.22.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014020400052#WRA01600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 113 together.</p><p>  This time last year I signalled my intention to review the Suite of Grants for Older People and People with a Disability in order to target the grants at those in greatest need, spread the available resources as widely as possible and ensure greater fairness in their operation. The changes were made on foot of the recommendations of a review group, established last year by my Department, to examine the terms and conditions governing the schemes. Membership of the group included members of both the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association (CCMA), the Housing Practitioner Network, Local Authority housing personnel and officials from my Department. Consultations were held with organisations working with older people and people with a disability, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, ALONE, HSE, Ataxia Ireland, the Irish Society for Autism and the National Disability Authority.</p><p>  There has been no change to the maximum grant available under the Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability which remains at &euro;30,000 or the Mobility Aids Grant which remains at &euro;6,000. In the case of the Housing Aid for Older People, the maximum grant has been reduced from &euro;10,500 to &euro;8,000. It should be noted that the average grant paid under this scheme in 2011, 2012 and 2013 was &euro;4,162, &euro;4,106 and &euro;3,995 respectively, well below the maximum available. The age limit for eligibility has been increased from 60 to 66 years. However, a lower age limit may apply at the discretion of the local authority in certain cases.</p><p>  Changes have also been made with regard to the assessment of means of applicants. To bring it into line with the means assessment for applicants for social housing, all household members&rsquo; income, with certain exceptions, will be included in the assessment of means. The level of income beyond which no grant is payable has been reduced from &euro;65,000 to &euro;60,000. In the case of an applicant where a household member is aged under 65, there is no impact on grant eligibility. However, where appropriate their income will be taken into account in accessing household income.</p><p>  I have increased the level of funding available for the grant schemes by 12% in 2014 to &euro;38.4 million. Every local authority has increased funding compared to 2013. I expect an additional 800 households will benefit under the schemes in 2014.</p></reply>

Since 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has profiled public water supplies to determine whether the supply needs to be replaced or upgraded, or operational practices improved to ensure that there are no risks to the supply of drinking water. Supplies which require such improvement are included in a list known as the Remedial Action List (RAL).  Many of these supplies are small and where infrastructure improvements are required, my Department has made funding available to local authorities through a special contingency fund under the Rural Water Programme (RWP). Over &euro;30m has been provided by my Department since 2008 under the RWP for this purpose.</p><p>  The 2008 RAL included over 30 schemes in Donegal requiring remedial action. This number has been reduced to 10 in the 2013 RAL. During this period my Department has funded over &euro;2.4m worth of RAL works in County Donegal under the Rural Water Programme.  Since 1 January 2014, Irish Water is responsible for the delivery of water services capital infrastructure. It is currently preparing a Capital Investment Plan for 2014 &ndash; 2016 that will provide for the transition of projects that were included in my Department&rsquo;s <i>Water Services Investment Programme 2010 - 2013</i>.</p></reply>

The number of staff provided for Water Services under the Service Level Agreements with Irish Water for 2014 is 4319.6 full time equivalents subject to alignment with the budgets notified by Irish Water to each local authority. While this number will reduce over time, the actual head count requirement is intrinsically linked to the levels of investment within the sector in automation, rationalisation and infrastructure and operational upgrades.  The establishment of Irish Water will lead to improved efficiency and effectiveness of water services delivery, and progress in these regards, leading to staffing reductions, will be closely monitored in the context of annual service plans.</p><p>  While I have no plans at present to introduce a further voluntary redundancy scheme for staff in local authorities working in the water sector, I will be keeping this matter under review in consultation with Irish Water and the local government sector, having regard to natural attrition, redeployment and on-going workforce planning.  In addition, any future voluntary redundancy scheme would need the prior approval of my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-04a.31.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1061" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014020400052#WRA02200"><p>The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established in September 2004 under the Residential Tenancies Act. For the first six years the PRTB received Exchequer funding but has operated on a self-financing basis since 2010.  The PRTB&rsquo;s funding is derived primarily from a proportion of the fee income accruing from tenancy registrations, as set down by Ministerial Order. The Board is currently entitled to retain 80% of the registration fee income to fund its activities, with 20% going to fund Local Authority inspections of private rented residential accommodation. It also retains the fees it charges for its dispute resolution services. The Board&rsquo;s published annual report and accounts are available on its website at </p><p>  Demand for the PRTB&rsquo;s services has grown significantly in recent years, reflecting the very sizable growth in the private rented sector. At the same time, the moratorium on recruitment and promotion introduced in March 2009 has presented challenges for the delivery of services across the public sector, including at the PRTB. The Board has responded to these challenges by pursuing a programme of outsourcing, shared services and improved ICT systems.  An online registration system was launched in November 2010 and by the end of 2012, 41% of registrations were transacted online. Online dispute management services were introduced in 2012 and a programme of shared services has involved electronic tracking of legal documentation and, most recently, the launch in 2013 of a quarterly rent index in association with the Central Statistics Office.</p><p>  In addition to these efficiency measures, legislative changes are in train in support of the work of the PRTB. In November 2012 I introduced the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, currently in the Seanad. It will, <i>inter alia</i>, streamline and simplify aspects of the Act to assist the Board in meeting its service obligations. The Government recently approved the drafting of amendments to the Bill which include measures to address long-standing issues such as deposit retention and the non-payment of rent in dispute cases, which are the most common dispute types brought before the Board. In 2012 they accounted for close to 37% of all dispute types. The Bill will also provide for the separation of the governance and quasi-judicial functions of the Board and will simplify the mediation process.</p><p>  I am confident that the Board will continue to discharge its statutory obligations in an independent, fair and efficient manner.  My Department continues to keep the resources available to the PRTB under close review and engages regularly with the Board on this and other matters.</p></reply>

The role of the Transition Officer is to support the delivery of the water sector reform programme on behalf of the local government sector, by co-ordinating the involvement of the 34 County and City Councils on a range of matters including standardised data gathering, financial analysis, HR negotiations, negotiation of SLAs and transition planning, all of which were required while daily water services operations were maintained.  The WSTO prepared a detailed business case setting out its proposed role, functions and funding requirements.  A Memorandum of Understanding was agreed between my Department and the WSTO setting out the common understanding between the parties in relation to the role and functions of the WSTO during 2013 and 2014 and the agreed funding mechanism. </p><p>  &euro;5.7m funding was provided to the WSTO in 2013.  Some &euro;1.7m was paid in respect of the staff from local authorities seconded to work in the dedicated transition office in two locations - Dublin and Waterford.  Some &euro;3.5m was paid in 2013 for the recoupment of costs for an average of 2-3 staff in individual local authorities who liaised with the transition office in collating and analysing the information necessary to support the transfer of functions, assets and liabilities to Irish Water.  The balance of approximately &euro;0.5m was incurred by the WSTO on non-pay related costs.  Of this &euro;278,285 was paid to a variety of companies who provided specialist advice on legal, financial, health and safety and IT aspects of the transition as it impacted on local authorities.  The balance of &euro;213,252 was incurred on general office running costs for services including rent, utilities and security.  The 2014 budget for WSTO is &euro;1.6m. </p><p>  During 2013, the average monthly WSTO staff complement across both locations was 17.7 staff, ranging from 21.1 staff at its highest (August 2013) and 5 staff at its lowest (January 2013).  At year end there were 13.6 staff assigned to the WSTO. In addition, an average of 2-3 staff in individual local authorities liaised with the transition office.  The WSTO managed the overall budget during 2013 and submitted claims for recoupment of costs on behalf of the 2 office locations and the 34 local authorities to the Department.  Funds were paid to Fingal County Council who in turn recouped the individual local authorities.   </p></reply>

Sean Healy, in September 2013 to make recommendations on more extensive and diverse input by citizens into the decision-making process and to allow for facilitation of input by citizens into decision making at the local government level.  The members of the group were chosen for their extensive experience and expertise in community engagement over many years; indeed a number of the group engage with my Department on an on-going basis through the community and voluntary and environmental pillars.  I am satisfied that the Group used that experience and expertise wisely in their deliberations over the months during which they met.  I received the working group's report to wards the end of December 2013 I am currently considering it in the context of the Local Government reform programme.  I intend that it will be published on my Department's website at an early date.   </p><p>  In this connection, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 has been a major undertaking involving input from a range of sources, including the community and voluntary sector.  Section 46 of the 2014 Act replaces section 127 of the Local Government Act 2001 with a new section which enables local authorities to take all appropriate steps to consult with and promote effective participation of local communities in local government.  One of the principal implementing provisions will be the adoption by each local authority , in accordance with Regulations to be made under the Act, of a framework for public participation in local government, which will set out the mechanism by which citizens and communities will be encouraged and supported to participate in the decision-making processes of the local authority. </p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  It is clear to me that the participation of citizens and communities in local </font>government, whether as individuals or as members of local sectoral, community or other groups in public life and their right to influence the decisions that affect their lives and communities is at the centre of democracy.  Open and inclusive policy-making, enhances transparency and accountability, and builds civic capacity.  I am satisfied that the new Local Government Reform Act 2014 facilitates local authorities in building more effective and inclusive relationships with all sections of society and that consultation and participation will, as part of the overall reform, be at the heart of our local government system.</p></reply>

The organisation needs to be appropriately resourced to fulfil this task but will not be over-staffed.  Irish Water is currently recruiting to build up the required internal capabilities and the number of staff employed is an operational matter for the organisation.  I understand that the numbers and competencies were determined through a detailed planning process.  It was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform programme that, to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in asset management, capital delivery and operations would be restricted to staff in the partner organisations i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, local authorities and my Department in the first instance.  Open competitions are held for all other positions and details of these are available on Irish Water's website. </p><p>  Irish Water has entered into service level agreements (SLA) with each of the 34 authorities for the provision of water services.  Staff in local authorities conducting work under these arrangements will remain local authority employees.  The SLA reflects the transformation agenda required for the sector, with provision for annual service plans which will set out required performance, budgets and headcount.  The length of the service level agreement and the fact that the agreement will include a programme of change are reflected in a Framework document, agreed with the Trade Unions under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, and which is available on my Department's website.  This agreement, and the Water Services No.2 Act 2013 provides that, in the event of an SLA coming to an end, the staff covered by that agreement will become Irish Water employees and their terms and conditions and superannuation arrangements will be protected by legislation.    </p><p>  The headcount provided for water services under the SLAs for 2014 is 4319.6 full time equivalents subject to alignment with the budgets notified by Irish Water to each local authority.  This headcount will be reviewed each year as part of the preparation and approval of the following year's annual service plan. </p><p>  While this number will reduce over time, the actual headcount requirement is intrinsically linked to the levels of investment within the sector in automation, rationalisation and infrastructure and operational upgrades.  The SLA provides for the development of joint approach to long-term staff and workforce planning which will facilitate the implementation of the transformation programme.  The establishment of Irish Water will lead to improved efficiency and effectiveness of water services delivery, and progress in these regards, leading to staffing reductions, will be closely monitored in the context of annual service plans.</p></reply>

The lease on these units can vary from 1 year to over 10 years. Accommodation provided under the Scheme is governed by the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, as amended. The grounds upon which a tenancy in the private rented residential sector may be legally terminated are clearly set out in the 2004 Act. <font color="#FF0000"> </font> The Act provides the main regulatory framework for the private rented residential sector and provides for security of tenure. It also specifies minimum obligations for landlords and tenants under a tenancy. </p><p>  My Department understands that some local authorities are currently experiencing a number of landlords leaving the scheme through not renewing their RAS contracts. Various reasons have been cited by landlords including their selling the property, financial difficulties they have encountered, that they themselves are seeking to move back to the property, or they need to accommodate other family members. The reasons given, while understandable, are presenting significant difficulties for both the sitting tenant and the authority. As the Rental Accommodation Scheme is now deemed to be a social housing support, local authorities retain the responsibility to source further accommodation for a RAS household, should the dwelling that the household is living in become unavailable through no fault of their own. </p><p>  Local authorities, with the cooperation of the tenants, will make every effort to source alternative accommodation as quickly as possible. In seeking replacement accommodation a local authority will attempt to source a suitable alternative within or close to the area in which the tenant is residing. However that may not always be possible because of the scarcity of suitable properties available to let in the areas affected. In all cases, not just where a tenancy is under threat, there is no bar on RAS households from sourcing alternative accommodation themselves, if they so desire, independent of the council. Such accommodation must meet the household&rsquo;s needs and be of an acceptable standard to the authority. </p></reply>

By its nature low frequency noise can be transmitted over long distances, and at low level it can be difficult to distinguish from other sources.  Reported 'hums' have been extensively investigated in both the UK and the USA, where studies found that generally less than 10%, or even as low as 2%, of the population will experience any noise.  Generally, specific noise sources have not been identified as the origin of any particular 'hum' and in the absence of a known noise source, no noise abatement solution or remedy can be applied.   </p><p>  Any complaints concerning environmental noise, including low-frequency noise, should be directed to the relevant local authority.

The Memorandum and Articles of Association, which were adopted by Irish Water on its incorporation in July 2013, provide that the appointment of directors to the Board of Irish Water is the responsibility of the Board of BG&Eacute; with the approval of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Twelve directors have been appointed to the Board of Irish Water by BG&Eacute; and these appointments were approved in advance by me, as Minister, and by my colleague, Minister Pat Rabbitte. </p><p>  The fee payable to the Chairman of Irish Water is &euro;30,000 per annum and the fee payable to the non-executive Board Members is &euro;15,000 per annum as approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and in line with Board remuneration in the semi-state sector.  The company management Board Members are not in receipt of any fee. </p><p>  The 2013 Act also provides that Irish Water must maintain all accounts necessary to comply with the provisions of the Companies Acts. Irish Water, as a commercial State body within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group, is subject to all the normal governance and accountability rules which apply to such a public utility including external audit.  The Act provides that Irish Water will be required to keep accounts of all moneys received or expended by it and must submit an annual report on the performance of its functions each year to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The Act also requires that the annual report is to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</p><p>  As Irish Water is a commercial utility, neither I, nor my Department will necessarily have access to details of, or direct accountability for, expenditure and other organisational matters in relation to the company.  In this context, and to support and assist public representatives in their role, my Department has requested Irish Water to take early action to ensure that public representatives are regularly briefed on matters pertaining to the organisation and operation of Irish Water.  Irish Water is currently considering how best to support and respond to the Parliamentary and public representation needs of elected representatives at national and local level.</p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  The Act requires the CER to perform its functions in a manner that best serves the interests of the customers of Irish Water.  It also requires that the CER should have regard to the need for Irish Water to provide water services in an economical and efficient manner.</p></reply>

Section 12 of the Act provides that the Minister can transfer water services infrastructure from a water services authority to Irish Water by order.  Irish Water is not responsible for infrastructure which has not been taken in charge.  However, it does have the authority, under the powers and functions transferred to it from the water services authorities, to take actions to prevent the misuse of a water supply or to ensure the conservation of water.  There is no question of homeowners in estates not taken in charge being liable for leakage outside of their property.   </p><p>  Section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out the process by which a planning authority can take a development in charge and determine whether or not the development is in compliance with the conditions of the relevant planning permission.  In advance of taking an estate in charge, it may be necessary for a planning authority to utilise its enforcement powers to require a developer to comply with planning conditions.  When an estate has been taken in charge by the planning authority, the water services infrastructure will subsequently be transferred to Irish Water.  In this regard, the planning authorities will consult with Irish Water on the takeover of water services infrastructure. </p></reply>

I understand from Irish Water that the staffing requirements of the company were defined based on the requirements of a high performance utility model.  The roles required were identified, job descriptions were developed and positions then advertised.   </p><p>  Due to the scale, volume and deadlines involved in establishing Irish Water, recruitment agencies were selected under the normal procurement rules to assist with the recruitment process.  In June 2013 it was agreed by the Steering Group for the Water Sector Reform Programme that, in order to ensure skills within the sector were fully availed of in building up the new organisation, competitions for positions in Asset Management, Capital Delivery and Operations and Maintenance would be restricted to staff in the three partner organisations (i.e. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, Local Authorities and DECLG), in the first instance.  If these particular roles are not filled by this process they then proceed to open competition. </p><p>  The candidates for positions in the company were screened and shortlisted to proceed to interview.  The interview is a competency based interview conducted by Irish Water.  Competency interviews are a well established structured interview technique designed to allow the candidate to draw on their past experience to illustrate their suitability for the role.   </p><p>  346 staff have been recruited to up to 30 January 2014 - 125 from Local Authorities, 61 from Bord G&aacute;is, 6 from my Department and 154 others.  In the case of the local authority and Departmental staff who were successful in this competitive recruitment process, their initial period with Irish Water is on a secondment basis pending the establishment of the superannuation arrangements provided for under the Water Services No.2 Act, 2013.  No other secondment arrangements are in place for the Irish Water organisation, but a number of staff have been seconded to the Irish Water Programme to assist in the metering programme and the establishment of Irish Water.</p><p>  All 9 Executive roles were filled through open competition and were prominently advertised in 6 national newspapers.  Relevant people across the UK and Northern Ireland water utility sector were identified, and exploratory discussions took place with approximately 90 people.  In almost all cases, those approached in the UK/NI water utility sector were not interested in pursuing the opportunity primarily because they were not interested in a career move, or in relocating, or because the salary on offer was not attractive vis-&agrave;-vis their existing salary and terms of employment.  Each member of the 9 person Executive Team was appointed after competing against candidates from the open market.</p></reply>

Bord G&aacute;is has in place a competitive market based pay model.  The model offers market based pay ranges for all employees which includes a pay at risk element called Performance Related Award (PRA).  A pay freeze will remain in place until 2016 as this is a key element of reducing overall payroll costs within the Group.  As such, Irish Water does not pay increments or any form of automatic pay award; the pay model applied allows for part of salaries to be placed at risk and this element of pay is only earned subject to performance. </p><p>  In this model, where an employee does not meet expectations they will not be eligible for a performance award and underperformance will be dealt with under the Irish Water Disciplinary Procedure and will lead to sanctions up to and including dismissal.  Performance pay will be based on a structured performance review and requires company performance, business unit performance and individual performance metrics to have been met. </p><p>  I also understand that no bonuses have been paid to Irish Water staff, but I have asked the company to set out the basis and content of the model as applied to Irish Water contracts of employment, including the criteria against which high performance will be evaluated and the kinds of targets (at company and division or grade levels) against which such performance may be bench-marked.  The amount of the performance pay will be a function of corporate performance, business unit performance and individual performance. </p></reply>

The PwC independent assessment on establishing a public water utility stated that the public utility model represented an opportunity to build a fit for purpose operating model, a more efficient cost base and lower unit of delivery. It also stated that with Irish Water controlling all assets, revenues and costs, it will be better positioned to leverage economies of scale, drive operational excellence, reduce operating costs and optimise the lending capacity of the company.   </p><p>  I expect significant savings to operational and capital expenditure through the delivery of water services by Irish Water. In capital project delivery, standardising asset design specifications to drive tender price reductions, centralising procurement spend and implementing best practice project management to reduce the risk of cost overruns are ways in which savings can accrue. In operational terms, procurement, volume and billing efficiencies are expected to be achieved. The Commmission for Energy Regulation, which will be responsible for the economic regulation of Irish Water, will seek efficiencies through its reviews of revenue controls.</p><p>  These savings will accrue during the life of the service level agreements (SLA) which Irish Water has entered into with each of the 34 local authorities for the provision of specified services. The SLA reflects the transformation agenda required for the sector, with provision for annual service plans which will set out required performance, budgets and headcount. A particular focus is placed on the collaboration necessary to complete the transformation to a public utility model by the end of 2017.</p></reply>

In respect of Section 35 relating to Local Community Development Committees, lines 12-30 in section 128F were deleted as they related to the making of Regulations and General Policy Guidelines for Local and Community Plans to be developed by Local Community Development Committees. These provisions have been effectively replaced by new provisions at Section 44 of the 2014 Act under which local authorities and Local Community Development Committees are tasked with preparing integrated Local Economic and Community Plans for their areas. This integrated economic and community plan will provide for a more co-ordinated approach at a local level. Section 44, which inserts new sections 66A to 66H in the Local Government Act 2001, now provides for the making of regulations in relation to the new integrated plan and accordingly, the provisions of Section 128F(2)(c) &ndash; covering the making of regulations for the standalone community plan &ndash; are not now required.</p><p>  In respect of amendment no. 34, which was discussed at D&aacute;il and Seanad Committee Stages, on both occasions I committed to bringing forward an amendment on this issue.

In co-ordination with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Fire Service has been managing the incident since that time. The Fire Service has worked since Saturday morning to bring the fire under control and at one point as many as 75 of their personnel were on the site. There was significant traffic disruption in the area as a result of the incident. A large plume of smoke remained over the area on Saturday and Sunday, although high winds over the weekend helped somewhat to disperse the plume.</p><p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was also on site since early on 25 January. The Agency has been liaising closely with the Fire Service and monitoring air quality in the area, and has advised anyone in the path of the plume to keep their windows and doors closed. The EPA has also provided general health advice to adults and children with lung problems, adults with heart problems and older people to reduce activity, particularly outdoors.</p><p>  The fire was brought under full control by Wednesday 29 January. The EPA has taken steps to commence a full investigation in the normal way.  It is too early at this stage to say what exactly caused the fire.  The Garda&iacute; and Fire Service are also moving now to commence their own separate investigations into the incident and what caused it.</p><p>  I am very concerned about the fire and its possible impact on residents in the area. I am also relieved that there have been no injuries reported and that all staff at the plant are safe and fully accounted for.  I commend the Fire Service, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the EPA on their work so far in responding to this significant incident.  The particular facility is located in an industrial estate and is licensed by the EPA to accept household and commercial dry recyclables, construction and demolition waste and hazardous waste. It is not yet known whether any hazardous waste was caught up in the fire but I expect this issue to be addressed in the various investigations.</p></reply>

The water sector reform programme implementation strategy aims to implement these commitments. The role of my Department is to drive the overall water sector reform process which includes developing the policy and legislation and ensuring delivery of the implementation strategy which was published in December 2012. Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann (BGE) had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector reform implementation strategy. </p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water in 2013 was an integral component of this strategy. The reform programme underway is of huge scale and complexity and involves major organisational change, an entirely new funding structure governed by economic regulation, the introduction of domestic water charges based on usage and the roll-out of a national domestic metering programme. </p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water seeks to reform the current funding model for water services, a model in which less than 20% of costs are borne directly by the users. The funding model is being reformed to ensure a sustainable level of funding so the current level of infrastructural investment increases significantly. The PwC independent assessment on establishing a public water utility found that the dependence on the Exchequer for capital funding has in the past constrained investment in the sector. The assessment assumed annual investment levels of &euro;600 million per annum. In 2014, Irish Water will invest some &euro;310 million in core water services infrastructure, in addition to the metering programme.  Implementation of the water sector reform programme should also lead to Irish Water being able to deliver services with greater economies of scale, manage operations and plan infrastructure with a more national approach, and to access third party funding.</p><p>  The establishment of Irish Water, and related reforms, will help ensure security of quality water supply, thus helping to sustain public health, and to increase economic competitiveness by making the economy more attractive for water intensive industries such as ICT, pharma-chem and agri-food. Reform will also help improve protection of our water bodies through increased infrastructural investment in water and wastewater treatment, and lower water abstraction from water bodies as a result of reduced consumption.</p></reply>

Within that framework, local returning officers are responsible for all matters in connection with the actual conduct of elections and referendums, including the selection, appointment and training of polling station and count staff in accordance with the relevant provisions of electoral law.</p><p>  Where two or more elections have the same polling day, as is the case for the forthcoming European Parliament and local elections to take place on 23 May 2014, regulations governing the taking of the polls may be made under section 165 of the Electoral Act 1992 to modify, as required, electoral legislation to enable the polls to be taken together. As in the case of the European Parliament and local elections held in 2009, regulations to be made under section 165 of the Electoral Act 1992 in advance of the 2014 elections will provide that arrangements in relation to polling stations, including the selection of polling staff, will be a matter for the local returning officer responsible for the European Parliament elections.</p><p>  My Department routinely issues guidance to Returning Officers in advance of each election and referendum. The guidance to be issued in advance of the European Parliament and local elections being held on 23 May 2014 will emphasise that the smooth conduct of polls is dependent on maintaining a cadre of sufficiently skilled and experienced people. Having regard to that overall objective, returning officers will be advised to employ competent and efficient persons as polling staff and asked to give consideration, where possible, to employing suitable persons who are unemployed, particularly for the position of polling clerk where the responsibilities of the post can be fulfilled under the guidance of the Presiding Officer.</p></reply>

The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan also attended the Forum.  The theme of this year's meeting was &ldquo;The reshaping of the World; consequences for society, politics and business&rdquo;.</p><p>  In a busy schedule of meetings, panel discussions and workshops, my main focus was on the continued promotion of Ireland as a top class destination for international business and investment.  I participated in a number of formal events on the WEF programme including a Plenary Session on European competitiveness.  I also participated in a high-level discussion group on the prevailing global themes for 2014, which included the political situation in the Middle East, global financial issues and climate change. </p><p>  During my time in Davos I had several bilateral meetings. I along with Minister Noonan, met US Treasury Secretary, Jacob Lew.  I briefed Secretary Lew on recent positive economic developments in Ireland and related issues. We also discussed the current economic situation in the US.  I met individually with leaders of several major multinational firms from a variety of fields, principally in the high-tech and financial services areas. I emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s pro-business and world-class R&amp;amp;D environment as well as our young and well educated flexible workforce.  On Thursday evening, 23 January, I attended an IDA event for senior executives of major international companies, to promote Ireland as a key location for international business, investment and expansion.</p></reply>

The two phases of D&aacute;il reform already introduced since the Government took office in March 2011 have significantly improved the working of the House.  The first phase of Oireachtas reforms introduced in 2011 restructured the Oireachtas Committee system, introduced an additional Leaders' Questions on Thursdays, established Topical Issue Debates, allowed TDs introduce their own Bills and have them debated in the D&aacute;il and started to develop a pre-legislative stage before Committees.</p><p>  The second phase of Oireachtas reform expanded the Friday sittings, allowing more Private Members Bills and Oireachtas Committee Reports to be debated in the D&aacute;il, further developed the Pre-Legislative stage at Committee and takes steps to reduce the use of the guillotine.  It now provides for new structures for interaction between the Government and the D&aacute;il and Committees, including an annual outline to the D&aacute;il by the Taoiseach and T&aacute;naiste of Government Priorities, an economic update and projections for the next three years, a National Risk Assessment which will set out the risks (both financial and non-financial) which the country faces and a National Progress Report produced independently by the CSO.</p><p>  The D&aacute;il continues to extend the number of days it sits and the length of those sitting days.  But this is by no means the end of the reform process.  The roll-out of reforms announced in autumn 2013 will continue over the next few months as will the development of an Oireachtas Inquiry system. Work has already started on the next phase of reform.  Reforms being considered for inclusion in the next phase include the establishment of an Oireachtas Inquiry system, the restructuring of Oireachtas Committees and expanding the powers and functions of those Committees, along with a number of Programme of Government commitments.  The T&aacute;naiste, the Government Chief Whip and I have met the Opposition Leaders and Whips to discuss what should be included in this phase.  </p><p>  The Constitutional Convention met last weekend to discuss the issue of D&aacute;il Reform and I look forward to seeing the Convention's Report on this in the coming weeks.  The outstanding Programme for Government commitments, items considered by the D&aacute;il Reform Sub-Committee, discussions with Opposition Party Leaders and Whips, consultation with all TDs, the report of the Constitutional Convention on the subject and debate time scheduled to discuss the issue in the D&aacute;il will all provide suggestions for reform that will form part of developing the next set of proposals.  </p><p>  As regards the Seanad, the T&aacute;naiste and I met the leaders of the other parties and groupings in the D&aacute;il and Seanad on 18 December last to discuss reform of the House. The outcome of the meeting was as follows.</p><p>  Work on operational/procedural reform could proceed immediately. All the parties and groupings in both Houses would present their proposals to the Seanad CPP early in 2014.  The Government will do so through the Leader of the Seanad.</p><p>  As regards electoral reform, a task force, representative of the different parties and groupings within the Oireachtas, could look at this matter. The parties/groupings could present their proposals to the task force, which would be in a better position to propose a timeline for the enactment of legislation once it had scoped out the nature and extent of the legislation proposed, and examined any possible constitutional implications.  There was also broad consensus at the meeting that the question of constitutional reform, which would require a referendum or referendums, could be considered at a later date. </p><p>  The Government has, of course, already announced that draft legislation will be prepared to give effect to the 1979 referendum decision, which allowed the State to extend the provisions for the election of members of the Seanad by certain universities to other institutions of higher education in the State.  The General Scheme of the Bill, when ready, will be referred to the Seanad, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht and other stakeholders, including the institutions of higher education in the State, for their consideration.</p></reply>

In addition, the Government has referred to the relevant Oireachtas Committee the question of a constitutional amendment to give citizens a say in the nomination process for Presidential candidates. The Government has also undertaken to look at making Article 41.2 of the Constitution (on the role of women) gender-neutral, and at including other carers both in and beyond the home.

This is not generally the case for adults of any age and it is the norm internationally to provide standard validity passports to all adults.  Introducing an arrangement whereby adults of any age would be eligible to apply for a passport for a period of less than 10 years would increase the total demand for passports on an ongoing basis and would require the recruitment of additional staff in the Passport Offices to cope with increased demand.</p><p>  For these reasons, there are no plans to introduce a passport of less than 10 year validity for adult applicants, regardless of age. I would emphasise that the annualised fee for a standard Irish passport compares favourably with many other jurisdictions.  The annualised cost of an Irish passport for an adult is &euro;8.  This fee has remained unchanged since 2009.  The fee compares with approximately &euro;8.60 in the UK, &euro;8.15 (USA), &euro;8.55 (New Zealand), &euro;11.50 (Canada), &euro;8.80 (France) and &euro;8 (Germany).</p></reply>

As mentioned by the Deputy, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has called for a full and prompt investigation into these incidents to ensure that victims and their families receive justice.  This follows from a comprehensive country resolution on Myanmar/Burma, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 November 2013, in which negotiation Ireland played an active role. This resolution encouraged the government of Myanmar/Burma to facilitate full, transparent and independent investigations into all reports of human rights violations to ensure accountability and bring about reconciliation.</p><p>  Last week, a delegation of EU Ambassadors to Myanmar/Burma visited Rakhine in response to the ongoing difficulties in the region, including a visit to the village in question. During this visit, the delegation was accompanied by Myanmar/Burma&rsquo;s Minister for Border Security of the Union. Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to Myanmar/Burma visited Yangon from 20 -22 January 2014, and attended the monthly EU Heads of Mission meeting there. During this latest visit, the Ambassador also received updates on the situation in Rakhine from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and from Non-Governmental Organizations actively working in Rakhine.  </p><p>  Myanmar/Burma continues to undergo a process of long-awaited transition towards full democracy.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, recognises that significant progress has been made, but that difficult and complex challenges remain.  Ireland will continue to utilize the relevant bilateral and multilateral channels to urge the Government of Myanmar/Burma to address these challenges, particularly issues in regard to the Rohingya minority.</p></reply>

Through Irish Aid, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has taken a leading role in encouraging and supporting initiatives to mark Africa Day in Ireland.  The objectives are to increase awareness of the Government's aid programme, which is strongly focused on sub-Saharan Africa;  to build greater public understanding of Africa and African issues, by highlighting the diversity and potential of the continent and its people;  and to enhance awareness of the potential for bilateral trade and investment links between Ireland and African countries.</p><p>  The Department encourages, and provides funding for, the organisation of community events throughout the country in cooperation with local authorities in Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford.  Community and civil society groups also receive support to participate in the National Flagship Event.  In 2013, this event was held in the Farmleigh Estate in Dublin.  Some 46 community groups and NGOs took-part, and 34,000 people attended the event, making it the most successful Africa Day in Ireland to date.</p><p>  While the Department, through Irish Aid, has always taken the lead on Africa Day, in cooperation with community groups, local authorities and African community and diplomatic representatives, it is clear that the coordination, promotion and implementation of a programme of events on this scale requires some professional expertise.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of observers for such missions.  The aim is to ensure that, when requested, Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international observation missions for both elections and constitutional referendums.  The Department carried out a comprehensive review of the election observation roster in 2013.  Following a call for applications which was issued by the Department in January 2013, a new roster comprising 200 individuals with a strong mix of skills and experience came into effect on 15 May 2013, for a five year period.</p><p>  Applications to join the new election observation roster were invited from members of the existing roster and members of the public not on the roster.  All applicants were requested to submit an application form setting out their relevant qualifications, knowledge and experience.  263 eligible applications were received and included a combination of existing roster members and new applicants.</p><p>  In the interests or fairness and transparency, all 263 applications were scored independently by two assessors external to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade against four criteria.  These criteria were clearly set out in the Information Note for applicants.  They were: Language Skills; Experience of election observation; Knowledge of human rights and/or governance issues; and experience of living in challenging environments.  Applicants were asked to demonstrate their proficiency or experience as appropriate and to provide concrete written examples under each of the four criteria to support their application.</p><p>  In order to ensure fairness and consistency in the scoring of applications, the external assessors were provided with a scoring guideline, which set out how marks were to be awarded under each criterion.  All four criteria carried equal weighting.  This methodology applied equally to all applicants.  Given the high quality of applications received, successful candidates had to score highly against more than one of the criteria in order to ensure selection for the new roster.</p><p>  I am satisfied that all applicants were treated fairly and impartially.  I would note that unsuccessful applicants were invited to request feedback on their applications.  In addition, in my reply to a previous Question, I outlined the offer of a review process.  On foot of feedback received, two unsuccessful applicants requested a final review of their applications. In both cases, the reviewer was of the view that the scoring of the applications was fair and impartial across all four published criteria.  As indicated previously, it was recommended in one case that the applicant&rsquo;s score be adjusted marginally upwards.  This adjustment did not affect the final outcome in relation to placement on the roster, however.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that both my Department and I have expressed this view to the lenders and are keeping in regular contact with them on this important issue.</p><p>  The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) places an onus on the banks, in respect of a co-operating borrower, to explore all the options for an alternative repayment arrangement offered by the lender to address a mortgage difficulty before any legal action is considered.  Furthermore, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, the Central Bank is requiring the main lenders to work through their mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days and, where possible, to propose and conclude sustainable restructures with their borrowers in arrears.</p><p>  Of course, the CCMA and MART can only work in circumstances where the borrower cooperates with the lender and engages with the process.  Where this does not happen, the lender may have no other option but to go down the legal route to deal with an arrears case.  However, if that course of action leads the borrower to commence a constructive engagement, this can lead to a more favourable outcome for the respective parties.</p><p>  The Central Bank has advised that under the MARP, if a lender does not offer a borrower an alternative repayment arrangement, for example, where it is concluded that the mortgage is not sustainable and an alternative repayment arrangement is unlikely to be appropriate, the lender must provide reasons on paper or in another durable medium, to the borrower.  In these circumstances, the lender must inform the borrower that s/he is now outside the MARP and that the specific protections and provisions of the MARP no longer apply.</p><p>  The lender must also inform the borrower of the following:</p><p>  a) other options available to the borrower, such as voluntary surrender, trading down, mortgage to rent or voluntary sale and the implications of each option for the borrower and his/her mortgage loan account including:</p><p>  (i) an estimate of associated costs or charges where known and, where not known, a list of the associated costs or charges;</p><p>  (ii) the requirement to repay outstanding arrears, if that is the case,</p><p>  (iii) the anticipated impact on the borrower's credit rating, and </p><p>  (iv) the importance of seeking independent advice in relation to these options;</p><p>  b) the borrower's right to appeal the decision of the lender not to offer an alternative repayment arrangement to the lender's Appeals Board;</p><p>  c) that legal proceedings may commence three months from the date the letter is issued or eight months from the date the arrears arose, whichever date is later, and that, irrespective of how the property is repossessed and disposed of, the borrower will remain liable for the outstanding debt, including any accrued interest, charges, legal, selling and other related costs, if this is the case;</p><p>  d) that the borrower should notify the lender if his/her circumstances improve;</p><p>  e) the importance of seeking independent legal and/or financial advice;</p><p>  f) the borrower's right to consult with a Personal Insolvency Practitioner;</p><p>  g) the address of any website operated by the Insolvency Service of Ireland which provides information to borrowers on the processes under the Personal Insolvency Act 2012; and</p><p>  h) that a copy of the most recent standard financial statement completed by the borrower is available on request.</p><p>  However, it should be noted that even if the MARP process has concluded and a repossession case has commenced in the legal system, the recent Land and Conveyancing (Law Reform) Act 2013 now provides a power to the Court to adjourn a repossession proceeding in relation to a principal private residence to enable the borrower to consult a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) and, where appropriate, to instruct the PIP to make a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) proposal.  In formulating a proposal for a PIA, the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 places an onus on a PIP to do so on terms that, shall not insofar as reasonably practicable, require the borrower to dispose of an interest or cease to occupy a principal private residence.</p><p>  The latest available Central Bank mortgage arrears and repossession data shows that during the third quarter of 2013, legal proceedings were issued to enforce the debt/security on a principal dwelling house mortgage in 1,830 cases.  However it is accepted that the legal repossession route is not the preferred option and that engagement by the borrower, even at a late stage, can indeed provide a better alternative.  However, if there is no engagement about a mortgage problem, there may be no alternative available option.  Overall therefore early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department has requested the six main banks operating in Ireland, and who fall within the Central Bank Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to provide data on the restructuring situation in relation to all primary dwelling mortgages, both in arrears and not in arrears, on a monthly basis.  This process is separate from the Central Bank quarterly data collection and publication process and is intended to provide certain data on the level of mortgage restructures on a more timely basis.  It should be noted that these are voluntary and unaudited returns by the relevant banks, and given the short timeframe in which the lenders provide this information to my Department and more frequent reporting requirements, they have not gone through the lenders quality control process for regulatory return purposes.  However, it is considered to be a desirable development to place more timely and frequent mortgage restructuring data into the public domain.</p><p>  It is accepted that the issue of mortgage arrears is a major problem that needs to be resolved, not only for an individual borrower and lender, but also for the long term economic and social health of the country and the Government will ensure that the comprehensive strategy is has put in place to tackle the problem is now fully implemented by all the parties involved in the process.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that, while An Post is not part of the clearing system operated by the retail banks, it does provide a range of banking services to those who do not have a bank account including facilities for paying bills and operating savings accounts.

To date, a number of initiatives have been undertaken to make information available to SMEs on the part of Government Departments and State agencies, including</p><p>  - Engagement with industry and representative bodies through the SME Funding Consultation Committee;</p><p>  - The Department of Finance's quarterly SME newsletter;</p><p>  - Publication on my Department's website of a 'SME funding matrix';</p><p>  - Targeted communication strategies by individual agencies directly to their clients;</p><p>  - Various guidance documents and support material. </p><p>  In spite of the work done by relevant Government Departments and agencies, all parties accept that a challenge remains around SMEs' awareness and understanding of Government supports. The most recent SME credit demand survey found that there was a low level of awareness of certain initiatives. It was against this background that the SME State Bodies Group was tasked with drafting a communication strategy. The strategy was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Mortgage Arrears &amp;amp; Credit Availability and will be fully implemented as part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2014.</p><p>  There has been no cost to the Exchequer to date.</p><p>  Since the launch of the Microfinance Loan Fund Scheme, by my colleague Mr Richard Bruton T.D., the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in October 2012, Microfinance Ireland (MFI) has been actively promoting the Loan Fund across a wide variety of communication, promotional and advertising channels both at local and national level.  As MFI is a private company with a Board of Directors, the budget for promotional activity is a matter for the Board of MFI to approve and is reviewed on a continuous basis in terms of value for money, appropriateness of audiences and allocated on a seasonal basis in line with business cyclical trends. MFI has been operational for just over a year and like any new business with a national reach, advertising and promotional spends are necessary in terms of creating public awareness of the service. Ongoing review and assessment of communication spend across various media and promotional channels, together with resultant application activity, will assist in determining the future and ongoing level of spend and optimal communication strategy to relevant audiences.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware the network of new Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) will be formally established in 2014, thereby providing a first-stop shop service to micro and small businesses  across the country. One of the key roles of these new bodies is to facilitate micro and small businesses access to finance, through the LEO s package of financial and other supports (such as those that improve the financial capabilities and awareness of micro and small businesses).  The LEOs will continue the work of the City and County Enterprise Boards as the primary source of access to the Microenterprise Loan Fund. The LEOs will provide both links to  other finance providers and also advice on a range of Government services such as Revenue, the Credit Review Office and the Companies Registration Office.</p></reply>

This increase will facilitate requests from a broader range of SMEs, as well as assisting those borrowers currently banked with non-trading banks and banks which are strategically exiting the Irish SME lending market, whose refinancing requests are larger than &euro;500,000.</p><p>  I am informed by the CRO that there has not yet been a significant increase in applications since the upper limit increased to &euro;3m in October 2013. However, this may be due to seasonality - the level of applications in November and December tends to be lower than the rest of the year.  The total number of eligible applications received by the CRO for formal review in 2013 was 107.  The CRO is currently overturning 55% of the refusal decisions referred to them and I would encourage SMEs that have been refused credit by the banks to avail of the services of the Office.</p></reply>

Donations from all individual donors under the scheme are treated in the same manner, with the tax relief in all cases being repaid to the charity.</p><p>2. A blended rate of relief of 31% applies to all taxpayers regardless of their marginal tax rate. All donations are grossed up as was previously done for donations from individuals within the PAYE collection system.</p><p>3. The charitable donations scheme has been removed from the scope of the high earners' restriction in recognition of the fact that donors will no longer benefit from the tax relief associated with their donations.</p><p>4. An annual donation limit of &euro;1 million per individual, for which a refund of income tax can be claimed by approved bodies, has been applied.</p><p>  These changes were made following a process of engagement between officials at the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners with representatives of the charities sector from the Irish Charities Tax Reform Group (ICTR).</p><p>  The objectives of that process were threefold: (i) to simplify the operation of the regime, (ii) to reduce the administrative overheads on charities and on the Revenue Commissioners incurred in the operation of the scheme, and (iii) to ensure that any change would be Revenue neutral from the Exchequer perspective. The proposals for the changes were also recommended in the Report of the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.  It is worth noting that PAYE-only taxpayers were never able to claim tax relief for donations made. I have no plans to reverse any of the changes made in the recent Finance Act in relation to the donations scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-04a.232.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014020400055#WRD05700"><p>The legislation governing the administration of Local Property Tax (LPT) provides for a number of exemptions from LPT, two of which are particularly relevant to those who purchased a residential property during 2013.  Firstly, under section 9 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 (as amended) any new and previously unused residential property that was purchased from a builder or property developer between 1 January 2013 and 31 October 2016 will be exempt from LPT up to the end of 2016.  The second relates to the exemption under section 8 of the 2012 Act (as amended), which is the exemption to which the deputy refers. It was originally intended that this exemption would only apply to first-time buyers, which is clear from the heading to the section: "Exemption for first-time buyers". The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill (prior to enactment) also states that the exemption applies to first-time buyers. The Deputy may recall that mortgage interest relief was phased out on mortgages taken out after 31 December 2012 and this measure was a transitional provision to help first-time buyers in the first year after the abolition of mortgage interest relief.</p><p>  However, as written, the exemption benefits any buyer, not just a first-time buyer. The result is that a person who purchased a second hand house in 2013 and occupies it as a sole or main residence is entitled to the exemption under section 8 regardless of whether she or he is a first-time buyer. The exemption will apply up to the end of 2016, provided the purchaser does not sell or otherwise transfer ownership of the property and continues to live in it as his or her sole or main residence. Accordingly, there will be some occasions where a purchaser of a second hand property in 2013 will not qualify for the exemption, for example, where the property is being let by the purchaser.  The Deputy's assertion that all buyers of residential properties in 2013 will now receive an exemption from LPT is therefore not correct.</p><p>  Revenue has advised me that the section 8 exemption applies to a clearly defined group of property owners, who are being identified using Stamp Duty records. These fall into three broad groups:</p><p>  - those who purchased a residential property between 1 January 2013 and 1 May 2013 and paid the 2013 LPT liability. These purchasers may be entitled to a refund of the 2013 payment and, subject to certain conditions, may be exempt for 2014 to 2016 LPT,</p><p>  - those who purchased a residential property between 2 May 2013 and 1 November where the purchaser paid the 2014 LPT liability. These purchasers may be entitled to a refund of the LPT for 2014 and, subject to certain conditions, may be entitled to an exemption for 2015 and 2016 LPT, and</p><p>  - those who purchased a residential property between 2 November 2013 and 31 December 2013. These purchasers, subject to certain conditions, may be entitled to an exemption for 2015 and 2016 LPT.</p><p>  There is a significant amount of work involved in identifying individuals who bought in 2013 and who may be entitled to claim the exemption. When this work is completed Revenue will write to these individuals and will provide advice on what action should be taken where the individual confirms that she or he qualifies for the exemption and wishes to claim it. Good progress is being made on identifying those who may be eligible and the letter from Revenue will clearly indicate what the purchaser will need to do to claim the exemption.</p><p>  Regarding the potential impact on the Exchequer, as a result of the increased number of purchasers who will qualify for the section 8 exemption, the potential loss is not likely to be significant as part of the overall LPT yield. Revenue has advised that an accurate figure will only be available when those who receive the letter from Revenue respond by claiming the section 8 exemption for 2013 and/or 2014, as appropriate. Revenue expects to be in a position to provide indicative figures during April 2014.</p><p>  In relation to the potential impact on the LPT yield for 2015 and 2016, Revenue advises that reliable figure for these years will only become available after 2014 as qualification for the exemption will be conditional on the individual continuing to satisfy the exemption conditions. In this respect, Revenue has advised that where an owner lets or sells his or her property the exemption will cease to apply from the next liability date.</p></reply>

Under this rolling process, quarterly performance targets have now been set to the end of June 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgage accounts in arrears of more than 90 days.</p><p>  The Central Bank has indicated that all six mortgage lenders covered by the MART process have reported that they met the 20% proposed sustainable solutions target for the second quarter of 2013 and also the 30% target for the third quarter in 2013.  In particular, with respect to the third quarter 2013 target, which is the latest available data, the lenders have reported to the Central Bank they had issued proposals to 43% of mortgage accounts in arrears against the 30% target.</p><p>  The new monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the number of permanent restructures of primary dwelling houses (PDH) more than 90 days in arrears has risen from around 41,200 in August to around 49,300 in November 2013, an increase of almost 20%.  The data also indicates that, in respect of the MART institutions, at end November 2013, 5,814 split mortgages were put in place in respect of primary home mortgages and a further 276 in respect of buy to let mortgages (this data includes those split mortgages which are initially proposed for a short-term trial period).  Mortgage restructures data in respect of the end of December 2013 will be published on 13 February next.</p><p>  Early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures is being put in place.</p></reply>

The following arrangements currently apply to retirement lump sums paid under pension arrangements approved by the Revenue Commissioners, and also to retirement lump sums paid from public service occupational pension schemes.</p><p>  - Lump sum amounts up to &euro;200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of USC.</p><p>  - The portion of a lump sum between &euro;200,001 and 25% of the Standard Fund Threshold (currently &euro;500,000) is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at the standard rate (currently 20%). This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum. No USC is chargeable.</p><p>  - Any amount of a lump sum in excess of &euro;500,000 is taxed at the individual's marginal rate of tax (credits and other tax reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.</p><p>  I would also point out that the &euro;200,000 tax-free amount is a lifetime limit and applies to a single lump sum or, where an individual is in receipt of lump sums from more than one pension product, to the aggregate of those lump sums.  In addition, retirement lump sums taken on or after 7 December 2005 and before 1 January 2011 (the date the current regime was introduced) must be taken into account in determining the tax-free amount (if any) appropriate to a retirement lump sum paid on or after 1 January 2011.</p></reply>

I know that Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their tax and duty responsibilities by paying the right amount and on time. Revenue expects businesses to continue, notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances in which they are now operating, to maintain a clear focus and organise their financial affairs to ensure that tax debts are paid as they fall due. I know that Revenue is conscious of the difficult economic and financial climate and how it impacts on business in being timely compliant. For example, Revenue has actively encouraged businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to work proactively with them when such difficulties start to arise to find an agreed way through the difficulties and quickly restore voluntary timely compliance.</p><p>  As I have advised the Deputy in reply to previous questions on this issue, I am informed by Revenue that Sheriffs are officers of the Court, holding office under Section 12 of the Court Officers Act, 1945. Their debt collection activities are generally covered by the Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1926, as amended and the execution of Revenue certificates is specifically provided for in Section 960L of the Taxes Consolidated Act 1997, as amended. When acting in execution of tax certificates, sheriffs are governed by the general law, which applies to the collection of civil debts of all kinds, and not by the provisions of the Tax Acts. They are not accountable to Revenue as regards the methods and techniques of enforcement but are answerable before the courts for any breach of the civil debt collection law. I am further advised that the Sheriffs have in place a Code of Practice, available from any sheriff or on Revenue s website, which sets out how Sheriffs will engage with taxpayers.  The Code also sets out the process whereby a taxpayer may make a complaint and how it will be handled. Therefore, data is not available to Revenue to respond to the Deputy s query in relation to the number of queries that were made against the Sheriffs in the last ten years.</p><p>  I am advised that the Sheriffs Code of Practice was introduced on 1 November 2005. Data is not maintained by Revenue in a manner that would enable the provision of a response to the Deputy s query in relation to the number of complaints that were referred to Revenue over that entire period, however over the last three years eight such complaints were received and responded to by Revenue. Following receipt of the responses from Revenue to their complaints, none of the eight taxpayer requested that his/her complaint be referred for review by the Joint Standing Committee of the Revenue Commissioners and the Sheriffs  Association (JSC).</p><p>  It is important to note that the JSC is not, and does not purport to be, a judicial body. The Sheriffs  Code of Practice is designed to provide an opportunity to taxpayers to resolve disputes without the necessity for the complainant to initiate Court proceedings. However, referral of any matter to the JSC should not in any way be taken as a diminution or a substitution for a taxpayer s common law rights, which are not impacted upon by availing of the process. The JSC undertakes a review of a complaint by means of an examination of all relevant documentation and correspondence relating to the taxpayer s complaint and the sheriff s response. A total of four complaints have been reviewed by the JSC since the introduction of the Sheriffs  Code of Practice in 2005. There were a range of issues involved in these four complaints and the each taxpayer was notified of the findings of the JSC.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-04a.254.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014020400056#WRE00700"><p>At the outset, it should be noted that the issue of flood cover and its unavailability in some instances is one which I am familiar with. I am also very conscious of the difficulties that the absence of such cover can cause to householders and businesses. While the lack of availability of flood insurance affects a relatively small number of people, the consequences for these people are very serious should their house or commercial premises be damaged by flooding.  However, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies to provide flood cover to specific individuals. The issue of provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover is a commercial matter for insurance companies, which is based on a proper assessment of the risks they are accepting.</p><p>  The idea of making flood insurance compulsory has been considered. However if this was the case, it would mean that in areas where there was likely to be regular flooding, the cost of insurance would almost certainly be prohibitive and could make premiums unaffordable not just for affected policyholders but for policyholders in general.  </p><p>  What the Government can do to try and help those who have been affected by flooding, is try to address the underlying problem through appropriate remedial works where this is economically feasible. The Office of Public Works is committed to alleviating the impact of flooding through the provision of defences as well as a comprehensive assessment of flood risk throughout the country and development of flood risk management plans for the areas most at risk under the National Catchment Flood Risk Assessment &amp;amp; Management (CFRAM) Programme. This commitment is underpinned by a very significant capital works investment programme which will see up to &euro;225 million being spent on flood relief measures over a five year period from 2012 to 2016.</p><p>  In addition, the OPW and the Insurance Ireland have been engaged in discussions to agree on a sustainable system of information sharing in relation to completed flood alleviation schemes and works undertaken by the OPW or, in certain instances, by local authorities with OPW funding, and where the standard of protection afforded by these works could be verified.  There is agreement in principle but with some operational details to be finally sorted by the insurance companies. The outcome of these discussions means that the insurance industry will have a much greater understanding of the extent of the protection provided by flood defence works and will therefore be in a position to provide the necessary flood cover to householders in areas where works have been completed. </p><p>  The Deputy refers to the use of a reinsurance scheme whereby insurance companies could pool their flood insurance liabilities, similar to the temporary scheme in the UK known as Flood RE. However, the introduction of such a scheme would likely lead to a significant increase in household insurance premiums as those in low risk areas would be required   to subsidise those in high risk areas.  Furthermore , the Exchequer would also be required to provide financial assistance to such a scheme in circumstances where the claims were above the level of funds in the pool. I am continuing to monitor how the difficulties around the Flood Re scheme are being addressed in the UK. </p><p>  The Government has also examined the introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain household insurance in respect of flooding from regular insurance bodies. However, this approach has not been considered financially viable because it is believed that over time it would incentivise industry to discontinue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.</p><p>  In cases where individuals who are experiencing difficulty in obtaining flood insurance believe that they are being treated unfairly they can contact Insurance Ireland which operates a free Insurance Information Service for those who have queries, complaints or difficulties in relation to insurance. Their service can be contacted at (01) 676 1914 or by email at<i></i>.</p></reply>

Unlike trading activity, in the case of rental activity, taxable income is the gross rent as reduced by a limited number of specified deductions as set out in section 97 (2) TCA 1997. These are:  </p><p>  - any rent payable by the landlord in the case of a sub-lease;</p><p>  - the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant;</p><p>  - the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property;</p><p>  - the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair the property (which, in the case of residential property, is restricted to 75% of the interest and is subject to compliance with PRTB registration requirements for all tenancies that existed in relation to the property in the relevant year); and </p><p>  - payment of local authority rates. </p><p>  In addition, wear and tear capital allowances are available in respect of the capital expenditure incurred on fixtures and fittings provided by a landlord for the purposes of furnishing rented residential accommodation. These allowances are granted at the rate of 12.5% per annum of the actual cost of the fixtures and fittings over a period of 8 years.</p><p>  As I have indicated on many previous occasions, the Government has in principle accepted the recommendation of the Thornhill Group (that the Local Property Tax paid in respect of a rented property should be deductible for income tax or corporation tax purposes, in a similar manner to commercial rates)  but has not considered the manner or the timing in which this will happen.</p></reply>

The IBRC Act provided for the winding up of IBRC in an orderly and efficient manner in the public interest.  On 7 February 2013, I as the Minister for Finance, made an Order pursuant to Section 4 of the IBRC Act providing for the winding-up of IBRC under the provisions of the IBRC Act. Pursuant to the same Order, Mr. Kieran Wallace and Mr. Eamonn Richardson (the "Special Liquidators") of KPMG were appointed joint special liquidators of Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited (in Special Liquidation) with all of the duties and powers conferred upon them by the IBRC Act. I am advised that the contractual terms and conditions of customer mortgages and other borrowings of IBRC will not change as a result of the appointment of the Special Liquidators or the ultimate sale of the obligations to a third party. </p><p>  The Special Liquidators have also confirmed that the residential mortgage customers of IBRC Limited (in Special Liquidation) continue to enjoy the protection of the Central Bank Code of Conduct on mortgage arrears and other protections in Irish consumer law. I have been advised by the Special Liquidators continue to engage with customers who are in difficulty through the implementation of CCMA and are entering into appropriate MARS strategies with them. </p><p>  The Special Liquidators are in the process of conducting a sales process in respect of the IBRC residential mortgage portfolio. The continued applicability of the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and Mortgage Arrears Targets Programme will depend on the regulatory status of the ultimate acquirer of the portfolio which we will not know until the sales process has concluded. In the event that NAMA ultimately acquires this portfolio, the NAMA Board will determine its strategy at that stage and will, in doing so, be mindful of its legal obligations. I am advised that, should they acquire the portfolio, NAMA is likely to apply best practice in this regard and no borrower will in any worse position.</p></reply>

NAMA cannot continue to fund unsustainable losses in what is a private medical business.</p></reply>

Where such a surcharge arises, it amounts to 10% of the IT/CGT liability and is in addition to the actual LPT liability.  A surcharge may also be applied where the Household Charge (HC) in respect of 2012 remained unpaid at 1 July 2013. This &euro;200 arrear is collectible by Revenue in the same way as any other unpaid LPT amount and is taken into account for surcharge purposes when the liable person files his or her IT/CGT Return. </p><p>  Revenue has further advised me that if payments and returns have been filed by liable persons, but are for some reason not reflected on the person's LPT records, then contact should be made with the LPT Helpline to clarify the matter. Also, if a person considers that a surcharge has been charged in error, possibly due to a problem with the LPT Register, then the person should check their LPT record online at <i></i>  and contact Revenue to correct the record. </p><p>  Revenue has confirmed to me that it has published detailed guidelines on the application of LPT-generated surcharges at <i>.</i>  Revenue has also confirmed to me that non-compliant property owners, who are within the PAYE system, are subject to mandatory deduction at source. Mandatory deduction at source involves the enforced collection of LPT from an owner's wages or occupational pension. This occurs where an LPT return and/or payments are outstanding, or where the payment method chosen is not honoured.</p><p>  Finally, in regard to the Deputy's question on Direct Debit payments, any phased payment arrangement in place for 2013 was automatically carried forward to 2014 unless the liable person requested an alternative payment arrangement.

However it appears that additional deductions have been made in error by the pension provider.</p><p>  In regard to the multiple property records in this case, an incorrect property record was set up at the time that the LPT Register was compiled. During the registration process the property record, which was linked to another person, was imported from a non-Revenue source, and added to the Register. A key aspect of the work undertaken in regard to LPT was the development of a comprehensive register of residential properties in the State. During the building of the Property Register some matching difficulties were encountered when consolidating the various Government and non-Government data sources used, and in a small number of cases properties were incorrectly associated with persons on the basis of information imported from other sources.</p><p>  The individual in question contacted Revenue, during April 2013, to request that a LPT Return be issued to him. At this point a property record was set up for him by a Revenue official. He filed his LPT Return and payment for the property correctly linked to him but unfortunately he was subsequently linked to the duplicate property and this resulted in the issue of a payment reminder and the issue of a deduction instruction from his occupational pension during August 2013. Revenue received a number of contacts from the property owner but failed to fully rectify the issues raised until mid-October 2013 when an instruction was issued to the pension provider to cease deductions. He was then asked to confirm the amount deducted from his pension and a refund of the deductions made in error was initiated in mid-December and issued in early January. </p><p>  It now appears that the pension provider did not act on the instruction, issued by Revenue in October, to cease deductions from his pension. Revenue has confirmed to me that an official has already made direct contact with his daughter to explain why the deductions have continued and to offer an apology for the errors made. Revenue will issue a refund for the additional deductions made by the pension provider in the coming days.</p><p>  Finally, Revenue experienced unprecedented demand for service by letter, email and telephone during the past year and errors were inevitable in such an environment. Nevertheless the errors made in the handling of this case and the delay in resolving the issues arising is very much regretted. </p></reply>

Provisional political agreement on this file was achieved on 15 January 2014 but it remains subject to further technical work and will need to be ratified by both the European Parliament and the Council.  MiFID aims to make financial markets more efficient, resilient and transparent, and to strengthen the protection of investors. This is part of the G20 commitments to enhance transparency, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. </p><p>  In relation to impacts here, I consider that MiFID will provide for better regulated capital markets where investor protection will be improved. My officials will commence with the transposition work following the entry into force of MiFID.</p><p>  The provisional agreement reached contains some important provisions on the following areas:</p><p> - Investor protection</p><p>- Commodities Derivatives</p><p>- Trading </p><p>- Transparency</p><p>- Access to market infrastructure</p><p>  Investor Protection.  MiFID will enhance investor protection through the introduction of rules relating to product governance, product intervention and third-party inducements, and limiting the range of products that can be sold without an appropriateness test. Under the proposals and in order to ensure that retail clients receive unbiased clear information, independent financial advisors will be banned from receiving inducements. </p><p>  Commodity Derivatives.  MiFID contains important provisions which set out new rules for commodity derivative markets. The level of exemptions available has been reduced and more products will be defined as derivative financial instruments when compared with the current MiFID, and will therefore fall within the scope of MiFID and other financial legislation such as Market Abuse. MiFID also contains important provisions relating to position management, position limits and product intervention. These provisions are in respect of all financial instruments, most particularly commodity derivatives, and have the purpose of providing regulators with tools to avoid excessive speculation these financial instruments. </p><p>  The MiFID proposals complement initiatives taken in other financial services files such as Market Abuse Regulation and Benchmarks, and together they are expected to result in a tighter regime for all commodity derivative markets, including food securities, whether traded Over-the-Counter (OTC) or through exchanges. This new legislative environment will be much more prescriptive than the current situation and will serve to prevent market abuse and to support orderly pricing in commodity derivatives and related commodity markets.</p><p>  Trading. As part of the EU's G-20 commitment to enhance transparency on the Financial Markets, the MiFID proposals will likely see   a significant proportion of trading on the OTC derivatives market move to a regulated venue. This will be achieved through the introduction of a new trading venue category called the Organised Trading Facility (OTF). This will have the effect of making European markets more transparent, subject to greater regulatory oversight, and of levelling the playing field between various venues offering trading services.</p><p>  Transparency.   The financial crisis exposed weaknesses in the transparency of financial markets; therefore strengthening transparency was an important aim of MiFID. It seeks to do this by introducing a new framework establishing requirements for the transparency of transactions in markets for financial instruments. The proposals will also cover non-equity instruments which will bring the EU in line with the approach undertaken in the US.</p><p>  Access to market infrastructure.  The proposals introduce non-discriminatory access to key market infrastructure such as trading venues, central clearing houses and benchmarks. This will increase competition and enhance investor protection.</p></reply>

I have asked the State Claims Agency and my Department to review these cases and any other relevant cases.  Following this review I will be reporting back to Government.</p></reply>

Officials in the Special Education Section of my Department also met with the Directors of the facility at the end of November 2013, to discuss the issues raised in the correspondence referred to. I am advised that this meeting addressed the issues raised in the correspondence.  In addition, my Department has advised the Directors by letter that they are welcome to revert should any issue remain outstanding.  I understand that the Directors have reverted very recently with a number of issues which will be addressed as soon as possible.  I can also confirm that the Directors have not raised any individual cases with my officials or indeed identified any parents who may be anxious about the Home Tuition grant.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware from the circular in question that the purpose of my Department's Home Tuition scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school or for children with a special educational need who are awaiting an educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for preschool children with autism.  Children with autism between the ages of 2.5 and 3 are eligible for home tuition. The home tuition continues from their 3rd birthday if no placement in a school based autism early intervention class is available for them. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has a national network of Special Educational Needs Advisors who can assist parents in identifying school placements for their children, if required.</p><p>  As home tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that home tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme. It is appropriate therefore that the qualification standard in the Home Tuition Scheme generally reflects that required in a school environment.  The qualification requirements for tutors providing home tuition to children have not changed. It remains the case that home tutors should be fully qualified teachers. When it is not possible to recruit a fully qualified teacher then alternative appropriate third level qualifications may be acceptable. </p><p>  However, from this year my Department has also required that, in addition to being qualified teachers, tutors must be registered or have applied for registration with the Teaching Council of Ireland. Tutors with acceptable third level qualifications will be eligible to apply for registration.  Accordingly, those whose qualifications were acceptable in the past remain eligible, provided they have applied for registration with the Teaching Council.</p></reply>

I consider this to be a sufficient number of training days.  The CPD for English is part of a much wider and comprehensive system of support for the implementation of A Framework for Junior Cycle in schools and English teachers will also have opportunities to attend further events in generic areas and/or particular areas of interest.</p><p>  Junior Cycle for Teachers (JCT) is the team charged with providing CPD. JCT began the provision of in-service training for English teachers earlier in this school year, with the provision of one full day workshop. I have also allocated time for English teachers to engage further with the new subject specification back at school, for which resource materials have been provided.  Similar provision will be made for English teachers' CPD in both 2014/15 and 2015/16. In addition, JCT advisors will become available for school visits in order to focus on specific areas that the school in question wishes to address.</p><p>  In relation to specifics about syllabus content and assessment, as is to be expected, teachers currently attending in-service are raising a number of queries and issues. These are being addressed by the JCT advisors on the ground, and where necessary, further issues for clarification are collated and forwarded on to my Department and/or the NCCA. It is to be welcomed that teachers are anxious for more in-depth information, but we must also recognise that we are just at the start of a long-term programme of implementation. In line with the new specification, the first in-school assessment event is not scheduled to take place until late in 2015/16 school year. CPD for English teachers will deal in detail with assessment well in advance of that date.</p></reply>

Under Directive 2005/36, which governs the recognition of professional qualifications in the EU, where the migrant is an EU citizen and has been established in the same profession in another Member State, then they would be entitled to make up the shortfall by way of a compensation measure, which can take the form of an aptitude test or a period of adaptation. Therefore there would be no requirement for the migrant to undertake a conversion course. More generally, providers of education and training have flexibility in recognising the prior learning of individuals who wish to upgrade their skills. This allows providers to take into account the experience and prior studies of applicants and give relevant exemptions where possible, without having to put in place specific conversion courses.</p><p>  In addition, since 2011 the Department has introduced a number of targeted initiatives aimed at addressing the skills needs of employers and supporting jobseekers into employment. The Springboard programme, for example, provides part time higher education places for unemployed people in areas of identified skills needs. Reskilling and conversion courses are also available through the Momentum and ICT skills conversion programmes. It is open to all jobseekers who fulfil the eligibility criteria to apply for a place under these programmes. New rounds of Springboard, ICT skills conversion and Momentum programmes are due to be launched in 2014. Information on the courses and number of places to be provided will be available following completion of the competitive tendering processes.</p></reply>

A core element of the SPHE Curriculum at primary level is the fostering and development of the positive attitudes towards diversity and celebrating difference through the strand unit "Myself and the Wider World".  Support is provided on request for teachers through facilitated staff inputs, in class modelling of lessons, local workshops and arrange of support materials available on www.pdst.ie (primary) and also on www.sphe.ie (post primary).  Through the support given at school level these issues are addressed both through the formal and informal curriculum specifically with regard to promoting a positive school culture and climate that respects individual difference.  PDST also provides guidance to schools in the development of a whole school policy for Interculturalism. PDST promotes the use of the NCCA Intercultural Guidelines in schools with regard to policy formation and classroom practice.</p><p>  Forthcoming supports re Anti-Bullying will address the issue of identity based bullying as part of the wider definition of bullying.  The School Self Evaluation process will allow schools to choose a third subject area outside of Literacy and Numeracy to review and evaluate. Those schools choosing SPHE will have an opportunity to review their practice with regard to this issue and to apply for support from PDST if the evaluation indicates a need for same.</p><p>  The National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) provides an interactive workshop that focusses on the classroom environment and classroom planning to support inclusion. Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) are given an opportunity to reflect on their own individual values, behaviours and attitudes which will determine inclusive practice in their classrooms. Emphasis is placed on how to develop strategies to ensure that all pupils/students are included.</p><p>  The Special Education Support Service (SESS) delivers a wide range of professional development supports for school personnel working with students with special educational needs and these focus on helping schools to meet the diverse and unique learning needs of students. Strong emphasis is placed on individual learning styles, the assessment of students' unique learning needs, and on the individualised planning of instruction to meet those needs.</p></reply>

It should not be confined to one module and therefore the introduction of such a module would not be considered advisable.  The primary SPHE programme teaches children to recognise and appreciate ethnic, social and cultural diversity, fostering genuine inclusiveness.</p><p>  At post-primary, aspects of subjects like History and Geography focus on understanding cultural diversity and the dangers of racism, while CSPE specifically fosters taking action on racism and xenophobia, supporting interculturalism and development.  The new Junior Cycle will extend an integrated approach, requiring that every student 'values what it means to be an active citizen, with rights and responsibilities in local and wider contexts.' The key skill, 'Working with Others', stresses 'respecting difference', while the new CSPE short course, currently being developed, reinforces these themes throughout.  The Intercultural Education Strategy (2010) in its aims emphasises the importance of &quot;ensuring that inclusion and integration within an intercultural learning environment become the norm &quot;</p></reply>

In order to be eligible for secondment teachers must be registered with the Teaching Council and be in a recognised post in a recognised school.If there is not sufficient capacity in the full time seconded personnel to meet the demand for CPD part time personnel are engaged for a limited amount of days per annum to provide training for teachers in priority areas. Again these personnel must be registered teachers and must have been in a teaching position within the last two years.  As the Deputy can no doubt appreciate, in an evolving school environment and with the reform agenda continuing apace it is vital that teachers who are engaged in the provision of CPD have recent and relevant experience.</p><p>  The School Completion Programme (SCP) aims to retain young people in the formal education system to completion of senior cycle and to generally improve the school attendance, participation and retention of its target cohort. The SCP is one of three service strands, which also includes the Home School Community Liaison and the Education Welfare Service, being integrated under the remit of the Educational Welfare Services of the Child and Family Agency. The SCP is a key programme under my Department's DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) action plan.</p><p>  In 2014, funding of over &euro;24 million is being made available through grant aid arrangements to support 124 school based projects and a number of related initiatives throughout the country. Each project is managed by a Local Management Committee (LMC) which assesses the needs of local students to devise an integrated, costed and targeted proposal of interventions to support these young people. Within the administrative structures the employment of project staff is within the remit of the LMCs. In the development and implementation of local programmes each project considers the competencies it requires in respect of the personnel who are key in delivering each element of its programme. Many SCP projects utilise the services of teaching professionals to deliver those elements of the programme which involve a direct focus on teaching and learning.</p></reply>

My Department recognises that specialised training and continued professional development (CPD) is important for all teachers, including EAL teachers.  The Professional Development Service for teachers, funded by Teacher Education Section in my Department offers support to schools in EAL at in-school and workshop level.  Schools are invited to apply for in-school support through an online application, in a number of areas, including EAL. Advisors, with experience in this area, are allocated to work with the school. Support is based on the needs of the school.</p><p>  Workshops on EAL are offered to schools nationally. In the past PDST have offered, at primary level, workshops on:</p><p>  - EAL for mainstream teachers,</p><p>  - Workshop for teachers new to EAL</p><p>  - Assessment workshop</p><p>  At post-primary level, workshops were offered on Supporting EAL students in the school and were aimed at Guidance Counsellors, Home School Liaison personnel and EAL Co-ordinators.  These workshops are currently being revised and it is planned to roll out workshops in Term 3 of this academic year 2013/14.  PDST also provides training in differentiation, in terms of differentiating for all pupils. Issues around differentiation and EAL are addressed as part of the school planning process.</p></reply>

Full details of the nationality categories that qualify for free fees are set out in the scheme which has been advised to each higher education institution and which can also be viewed on the website 'studentfinance.ie' and this should address any lack of awareness.</p><p>With effect from the current academic year a 'Change of Nationality' clause is included in the scheme which provides that, subject to meeting the criteria of the scheme, students who acquire EEA citizenship during their course of third level studies may be eligible for free fees for the remainder of their studies subject to certain conditions.</p><p>  Where students do not qualify for free fees they must pay the appropriate fee as determined by their third level institution. The institutions are autonomous institutions and the level of fee payable by students who do not meet the requirements of the free fees schemes, and the payment arrangements for such fees, are matters for each institution to determine. However I recently requested that the Higher Education Authority establish and report on the practices currently operated by individual institutions in determining the fees criteria of students who do not qualify for free fees. It is hoped that a common approach across the sector can be agreed and that all prospective students have clarity about the level of tuition fees they may be required to pay.</p><p>  Under the terms of the student grant scheme, grant assistance is awarded to students who meet the prescribed conditions of funding including those which relate to nationality, residency, previous academic attainment and means and any individual student must meet all of these conditions and not one alone. The nationality requirements for the student grant scheme are set out in section 14 of the Student Support Act 2011 and regulation 5 of the Student Support Regulations 2013.</p><p>  Article 32 of the Student Grant Scheme 2013 provides for the review of eligibility for the award of a grant in the event of changes of circumstances in the academic year, including a change in relation to a student's nationality or immigration status. This means that where a student acquires Irish citizenship by naturalisation during the course of their studies he/she may apply to SUSI to have his/her application re-assessed.</p><p>  In all cases, to qualify for either free fees and/or a student grant , it is the student, and not his/her parents, that must meet the nationality or prescribed immigration status requirements in their own right. The onus is on the student to provide the necessary documentary evidence as proof of their nationality or immigration status to the relevant higher education institution and/or grant awarding authority.</p></reply>

In the primary sector the identification of primary schools, for participation in DEIS, was based on analysis of a survey, carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC), of all primary schools. In the case of second-level schools, analysis of centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils Database and the State Examinations Commission databases determined the identification of post-primary schools for participation in DEIS.</p><p>  The identification process for DEIS was in line with international best practice and had regard to, and employed, the existing and most appropriate data sources available. It was managed by the ERC on behalf of the Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's Regional Offices and the Inspectorate. The choice of variables included in the assessment of disadvantage was guided by the definition of disadvantage in the Education Act, (1998) which refers both to learning outcomes and to social and economic factors.</p><p>  Arising from the identification process schools were rank ordered according to their assessed levels of disadvantage into the following categories:</p><p>- Urban Band 1 - Urban/town primary schools with the highest relative level of disadvantage</p><p>- Urban Band 2 - remaining urban/town primary schools with the next highest levels of disadvantage</p><p>- Rural Strand of DEIS - Primary schools serving rural communities, including towns with populations below 1,500</p><p>- Post-Primary DEIS &ndash; Post-Primary Schools with the highest levels of disadvantage.</p><p>  A key priority for my Department is to prioritise and target resources in schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage.  That challenge is significant, given the current economic climate and the target to reduce public expenditure which limits the capacity for any additionality to the DEIS programme.  The current focus of my Department in relation to the DEIS programme is on its ongoing evaluation and on distilling the learning from this research in order to inform future policy on educational disadvantage.</p></reply>

Since September 2012 guidance provision is organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. In this way principals have discretion to balance guidance needs with the pressures to provide subject choice. I acknowledge that bringing guidance within quota is challenging for schools but the alternative was an increase in the 19:1 PTR. My Department helped shelter the impact of the budgetary measure for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their PTR to 18.25:1.</p><p>  It is important to note that guidance is a whole school activity and it does not just involve the guidance counsellor. The representative organisations for School Principals and school management developed a framework that assists schools on how best to manage the provision of guidance from within their staffing allocation. Wherever possible, group work and class based activity should be used to maximise the amount of time available for those pupils that are in most need of one to one support.</p><p>  My Department published Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention, which I launched jointly with Minister Kathleen Lynch. The guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to post-primary schools on how they can promote mental health and well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk of suicidal behaviour.</p></reply>

The Home Tuition Scheme provides a grant to parents to facilitate the provision of education at home for children who, for specified reasons, are unable to attend school or for whom a school placement is not available.  It is generally the case that home tuition is provided at the child's home. However, some parents of young children with autism who are eligible for home tuition requested that my Department accommodate the tuition being provided in a group setting offered by a private provider. My Department has facilitated arrangements with a small number of private preschool providers, subject to specific terms and conditions. </p><p>  As home tuition takes place outside the usual school structure it is important that tutors are qualified to provide an educational programme.  Accordingly it is a condition of the scheme that tutors are fully qualified teachers registered with the Teaching Council.  My Department's inspectorate previously reviewed the education being provided by one of the private preschool providers in question which involved engagement with the primary teachers they employed. Further inspections are currently being arranged for the private pre-schools with whom arrangements have been recently agreed.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that my Department's preferred approach is that, where possible, children are educated in school settings where they may have access to individualised education programmes, fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports and establishing special classes, including early intervention classes for children with autism, as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is not possible to give a specific indication at application stage as to course approval. A similar position pertains in relation to applying for a place on a course via the CAO system.</p><p>  As part of its communications strategy SUSI draws attention to the requirement that a student needs to be entering an approved full-time course in an approved institution.  In addition, the SUSI website provides details in relation to approved colleges.  I understand that for 2014, SUSI, in consultation with stakeholders, including the CAO, will continue to enhance communication and promote awareness among grants applicants regarding approved institutions and courses.</p><p>  For the 2013/14 academic year, SUSI, introduced a number of initiatives to improve the application and processing system. These included direct information sharing with Government bodies and other agencies including the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the CAO. A Service Level Agreement between SUSI and the CAO currently provides for the direct transfer of data from the CAO to SUSI in relation to final course acceptance details for applicants who opt to have their data transferred.  SUSI is continuing to engage with relevant Government Departments and agencies to explore further options for co-operation as part of the on-going focus on work to continually improve the student grant system.</p></reply>

During this engagement, the organisation raised the matter of acquiring a parcel of land adjacent to the school.  My Department advised that the main focus of its capital budget for the coming years is the delivery of the projects outlined in the 5 Year Construction Plan which prioritises new school buildings and extensions in areas where a significant demographic need has been established. The school in question is not included in the Plan. My officials have indicated to the organisation concerned that it is open to it to write to my Department regarding the matter.</p></reply>

Contracts are awarded following a competitive process conducted in compliance with the established procurement rules and procedures.</p><p>  Under EU Directives on public procurement public works, supplies and service contracts above certain thresholds must be advertised on the Official Journal of the EU and awarded on the basis of objective and non-restrictive criteria. For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5.186 million; for supplies and service contracts awarded by Government Departments the threshold is &euro;134,000 and for the remainder of public bodies the threshold is &euro;207,000. The threshold for supplies and service contracts of entities operating in utility sectors (water, energy, transport and postal) is &euro;414,000.  For contracts below these thresholds, the general requirement is that they be advertised on the national public procurement website    or, depending on value, awarded on the basis of a competitive process of direct invitation to an adequate number of suitable suppliers.</p><p>  The aim of these European rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. </p><p>  The Office of Government Procurement (OGP) is responsible for producing annual statistical information in relation to above-EU threshold procurement activity by the Irish public sector and for providing these statistics to the European Commission. The below information is based on data available on above EU threshold awards. </p><p>  - In 2011, 10.55% (valued at &euro;240M) of the total known awarded contracts above threshold by the State went to non-domestic companies. This represents less than 5% of the overall annual public procurement spend (approximately &euro;13.1 billion). I am advised by the OGP that more up to date data on above EU threshold contracts for 2012 and 2013 will be available later this year. </p><p>  I should point out that the Public Service Reform Plan published by my Department includes a recommendation to improve performance measurement and procurement expenditure analysis. In this regard, a key focus of the Office of Government Procurement will be a move towards centralisation of data collection in the area of procurement activity. The centralisation of data collection will not only enable the Office to procure in a more cost efficient manner but will also capture more informative data on SME participation.</p><p>  It is important to remember that open tendering is a two way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. The public procurement market in the EU is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;2.4 trillion. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the open market regime also offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

The aim of these rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of these rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on the basis of grounds that could be considered discriminatory and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules. In this regard, it is worth pointing out that the open market regime also offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad and reliable EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard. </p><p>  The consideration of clauses that allow for the inclusion of social and environmental clauses in public contracts is something that I have been examining. Social clauses can be used in public procurement in cases where they are targeted at factoring into the procurement process consideration of social issues such as employment opportunities, equal opportunities and social inclusion.  In order to be compatible with EU law, they must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States.</p><p>  The European Commission issued guidance on this issue in 2010. This guidance stressed that when incorporating social considerations into the procurement process one of the key challenges is ensuring compliance with the EU Treaty Principles and the Procurement Directives. The EU procurement Directive primarily envisages that social considerations may be included as contract performance conditions, provided they are not discriminatory and are included in the contract notice or in the contract documents and relate to the performance of the contract. For example, the EU Directive states that contract performance conditions may be intended to favour on-site vocational training, the employment of people experiencing particular difficulty in achieving integration, or the protection of the environment. </p><p>  Challenges arise from the need to ensure that: value for money is not adversely affected; additional costs are not placed on domestic suppliers relative to other potential suppliers; and the targeted benefit is capable of being measured and monitored during execution of the contract. </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that a revised set of EU Directives governing public procurement have recently been agreed. The revised directive, when implemented, should provide greater scope and legal clarity in relation to the use of social criteria in the context of an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p></reply>

The development and progression of the scheme is being overseen by a Steering Committee with representatives of the Council, the OPW and RPS, the engineering consultants for the scheme.</p><p>  A Public Exhibition of the preferred scheme proposals took place in April/May 2013 and lasted for four weeks. The main proposals of the scheme include the construction of new walls and embankments along the River Ilen and some of its tributaries in the Town, new pumping stations, localised channel re-grading and improvements to the local drainage system.</p><p>  Approximately sixty submissions were received from members of the public on the proposed scheme during the Exhibition. Some of these submissions dealt with the levels of protection to be provided in certain areas, based on past experiences of local people.  The consultants carried out further surveys and analyses to address the matters raised at the Exhibition. </p><p>  These surveys have now been completed and some changes have been made to the proposed scheme.  An Exhibition Report, which will deal in depth with all the issues raised by each submission is currently being finalised and responses to all parties who made submissions will be issued shortly.  The recent flood events, although very unfortunate for the town, have provided data which should bring some additional certainty regarding the robustness of the proposed scheme.</p><p>  The detailed design work is currently underway and it is hoped to complete it and the process of procuring a civil works contractor around mid-2014.  This would allow construction to commence towards the end of 2014 subject to the scheme receiving the necessary statutory approval.  The OPW has made provision for the scheme works in its multi annual expenditure profiles but such funding will be subject to review depending on actual budget allocations.</p></reply>

It facilitates the movement of staff both within and across sectors as a result of the rationalisation, reconfiguration or restructuring of public service bodies or where activities have assumed lesser priority arising from changing business needs.  A &quot;&quot; setting out the background and the detailed processes involved has been agreed with the staff unions and is available at  <i>. </i> The agreed arrangements for the redeployment of staff within the Health, Education, and Local Government sectors are managed directly by those sectors. </p><p>  Redeployment for the Civil Service and Non Commercial Semi State Bodies operates through a system of Resource Panels, operated by the Public Appointments Service, which also arranges for cross-sectoral assignments to be made, where necessary.  This is facilitated by the recently enacted , which removes the legislative barriers to mobility and redeployment across the various sectors in the Public Service and addresses other issues that arise on changing employer.  </p><p>  Individual Departments vary in the approach they adopt in relation to the transfer of their staff and there are no centralised arrangements in place within the civil service to facilitate requests for transfers to other locations or civil service employments, except in the case of grades represented by the Civil &amp;amp; Public Services Union. Transfers for these (mostly Clerical and Staff Officers) are arranged in accordance with formal procedures agreed with the Staff Side at General Council under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Civil Service.  </p><p>  Transfers between all grades in the civil service can be arranged on an informal, head-to-head, basis.  Such transfers are arranged between the officers seeking to move and the relevant Personnel Units and require the agreement of both Personnel Officers.  The transfer of staff within the Health, Education, and Local Government sectors is  a matter for the Minister with responsibility for the sector involved.  </p><p>  My Department is currently working to strengthen resourcing policy to ensure the right people are in the right place at the right time through effective workforce planning across the Civil Service.  In that context it is proposed to roll-out an integrated resourcing policy in the Civil Service to address a number of areas, including staff mobility.  The possibility of developing a centralised system to facilitate transfers between sectors will be examined in that context during 2014.</p></reply>

Under the Agreement, a number of options are open to Member States in terms of participation in the court, including conferring jurisdiction on the central division alone, setting up a local division of the Court or, participating in a regional division of the Court with one or more Member States.  </p><p>  My Department is currently examining the options for Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the Unified Patent Court (UPC), and the implications of each policy option, including cost considerations arising.  Key to this process is engagement with key stakeholders who are being consulted in order to better inform the policy choices to maximise Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the patent court.  This includes the enterprise agencies under my Department&rsquo;s own remit, representative business organisations and interest groups, including those organisations representative of issues of interest to the legal community.  This will ensure that the views of a very broad client base will inform Government&rsquo;s consideration of this issue.  </p><p>  In addition, given that responsibility overall for the administration of the Courts in Ireland comes within the remit of the Minister for Justice and Equality, contact and active engagement between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality and the Courts Service in relation to the policy options, including cost implications, for Irish participation in the patent court is ongoing.  </p><p>  The outcome of this process will ultimately inform a recommendation to Government in terms of the policy option to adopt in relation to the Court and I expect to be in a position to bring this issue to Government within the next few months.  This process is running in parallel with intergovernmental level negotiations among the States that signed the Agreement in February 2013.  </p><p>  Under this intergovernmental framework, a number of working groups have been set up to establish the working methods and modalities of the Court including issues such as the legal Rules of Procedure of the Court, budget and financing of the Court, IT systems as well as the training and remuneration of Judges to be appointed to the Court.  This involves a very significant agenda of work which will very likely extend into this year and possibly into the early part of 2015.  </p><p>  It is important to note that, when established, the Unified Patent Court will be an international court whose judgements will have application in the case of patent litigation on European patents brought before the Court.  Thus, all instances of the Court i.e. the central Division, regional instances or local instances regardless of location, will be applying the provisions of the UPC Agreement, in a harmonised manner, in line with the Rules of Procedure to be adopted by the Court.  This is quite at variance with the operation of Courts of law in Member States applying domestic law provisions within their own jurisdictional boundaries.  I think it is useful to convey this important difference given the references in the questions to the possibility that a court situated in London would have jurisdiction over Ireland.  The closest example of a cross-jurisdictional Court of this nature would be the Court of Justice of the EU.  </p><p>  As the international agreement on the Unified Patent Court entails a transfer of jurisdiction from the Irish courts to an international court, an amendment to the Constitution, requiring the carrying of a referendum, is necessary before Ireland can  ratify the Agreement.  The timing of this referendum will be a matter for Government to decide.</p></reply>

Since the proposal to amalgamate the two agencies was announced, both of the agencies have being working together to plan for the merger.  In that regard a number of working groups drawn from staff of both agencies have been looking at potential synergies between the two agencies and looking at the practical issues that will need to be addressed in preparation for the amalgamation.  A project group from within the staff of the agencies has been appointed to manage the amalgamation.  Apart from costs associated with staff time in relation to those working groups, the only expenditure to date by the two agencies on this work is &euro;8,668.28 in respect of a consultative process that sought to determine how to deliver the mandate for the new organisation in an efficient and effective manner.  The expenditure, which was borne equally between the two agencies, includes the costs of an external facilitator selected following a competitive tendering process and the hire of meeting room facilities.</p><p>  Following publication of the draft legislation, the agencies will commence work on a Corporate Structure for the new organisation that will include an assessment of the initial level of staffing required to enable it to carry out the functions assigned to it in the legislation.  It is anticipated that all the existing functions of each agency will be incorporated into the work of the new body as well as additional functions to be assigned under the legislation.  Both the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency have Employment Control Frameworks in place agreed by my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and it is expected that the new body will have to plan its workforce within the limits of their authorised staff numbers.</p></reply>

They must also notify the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation of the proposed redundancies at least 30 days before any employee receives notice of redundancy.  The consultation with the employee representatives and the notification period for the Minister can run concurrently.</p><p>  In addition, companies who find themselves in this position are obliged to provide certain information to employee representatives regarding the proposed collective redundancy.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the Redundancy Payments Acts is now within the remit of my colleague the Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton TD who has supplied the following details in respect of redundancy entitlements.  The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers, under the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2013, for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy.  In order to qualify for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must have at least two years continuous service; be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts; be over the age of 16 and; have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation meaning that the job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.</p><p>   Statutory redundancy pay is calculated at 2 weeks&rsquo; pay per year of service plus a bonus week, subject to a cap of &euro;600 per week.</p><p>   It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department of Social Protection that it is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to its eligible employees that Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees.  That will raise a debt against the employer which the Department will seek to recover.</p><p>  Any arrangement outside the Statutory Redundancy is a matter for negotiation and agreement between the parties; oftentimes assisted by the industrial relations institutions of the State, viz, the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court.</p><p>  I would encourage parties who are in dispute with regard to redundancy terms, and   where it is not possible to resolve the matter locally, to avail fully of the services of these institutions.</p></reply>

NERA has encountered individuals, described by their employers as au pairs, who have been found to be domestic employees.  My policy is to ensure that those people found to be domestic employees, regardless of what title is given to them, can enforce their rights as provided for in employment rights legislation.</p><p>  In 2007, my Department published a &ldquo;Code of Practice for Protecting Persons employed in Other People&rsquo;s Homes&rdquo;, which is useful as it outlines the duties and responsibilities of such employers.</p></reply>

I am conscious of the calls by some researchers for Ireland to apply for CERN membership. The last time a review of the benefits of Ireland joining CERN was undertaken, the conclusion was that it was not the best use of resources.  Since then, resources have become even scarcer, but it is timely to have a fresh look at the opportunities and the costs associated with membership.  Any decision about joining CERN must take into consideration the opportunity costs involved, as payment of any fees would have to come from existing funding, meaning that less funding would be available for our existing research priorities.  I have an open mind on the matter and it will come down to what represents best value for taxpayers&rsquo; money.  I have asked my Department to consult with CERN, the relevant research and enterprise agencies and with the academic/research community and to bring forward an assessment within the coming months.</p></reply>

Therefore, in order to ensure that the granting of an Employment Permit would be in the public interest and in line with the current economic policy of the Government, new Employment Permit applications are normally only considered where it is established that a minimum salary of &euro;30,000 per annum is on offer based on a 39 hour week.

The benefit is decided by the employer in advance of the public holiday and can be one of the following: a paid day off on the day; a paid day off within a month; an additional day of annual leave; an additional days pay.</p><p>  Under the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001, part-time workers have entitlement to benefit for public holidays once they have worked forty hours in the previous five weeks ending on the day before the public holiday.  Casual workers are defined in the same Act as part-time workers who have worked for the employer for less than 13 weeks and where any pervious employment with that employer to date could not reasonably be regarded as regular or seasonal.</p><p>  While not specifically defined in legislation, &lsquo;paid annual leave&rsquo; is commonly held to be a period of rest and relaxation during which a worker is paid his or her normal wages.  In this regard an employee is entitled to one of the following:</p><p>- Four working weeks in a year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours (unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment;</p><p>- One-third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works at least 117 hours;</p><p>- Eight per-cent of the hours he or she works in a leave year (subject to a maximum of four working weeks).</p><p>  If more than one method applies then the most favourable calculation is the one that pertains but subject to the statutory maximum of four working weeks.  Annual leave is accrued on all hours worked and is earned from day one of the employment for all employees which includes part-time or casual employees.  </p><p>  Employees have entitlement to pay in respect of their annual leave.   Pay for a week of annual leave where the salary is based on a time rate or fixed rate is equal to the amount paid to him or her in respect of the last normal week worked before the leave starts.  This amount is to include any regular payment or allowance that does not vary in relation to the work done but does not include overtime.</p><p>  Where pay has a productivity or commission based element the pay for a week of annual leave is calculated as an average of the weekly pay over the last 13 weeks worked.</p></reply>

These measures are being delivered by various bodies, including Enterprise Ireland, InterTradeIreland, the newly-formed Office of Government Procurement (OGP) and my own Department.  Enterprise Ireland and the OPG work on an on-going basis to encourage SMEs to register on the Government&rsquo;s eTenders website, to enable forthcoming procurement opportunities to be brought to their attention.  </p><p>  The OGP, in collaboration with InterTrade Ireland, hosted a number of &ldquo;Meet the Buyer&rdquo; events in 2013.  These events provide SMEs with an overview of the all-island public procurement market and the opportunities that are available.<font color="#2F2F2F">  </font>They also facilitate businesses networking, and opportunities for companies to form joint ventures and identify sub-contracting opportunities.

Details of these site visits made to Waterford in each of the years from 2010 to 2013 are set out in the following tabular statement. </p><p>  There are currently 28 IDA client companies employing over 5,000 people in Waterford city and county.  I should also like to say that during 2013 there were two significant IDA investment announcements for Waterford.  In February, Sanofi announced plans to invest &euro;44m in Genzyme&rsquo;s biotechnology campus in Waterford.  This investment will increase the site&rsquo;s diversity of products and comes on top of a &euro;150m investment a little more than a year previously.  The investment ensures that the Waterford facility, which currently employs approximately 500 people, can produce the company&rsquo;s latest products and provides an indication of the Waterford site&rsquo;s value to the company.  In March, Nypro Healthcare announced plans to establish an additional state of the art medical devices facility in Waterford.  This will result in the creation of over 200 new high quality jobs in the coming years.  Furthermore, IDA Ireland has announced plans to build a new advanced manufacturing facility in Waterford to enhance the offering in the region to win new business.</p><p>  There are many complex factors influencing investor location decision-making such as the increasing preference of investors globally for cities of scale with 1 million plus population, significant challenges from lower cost locations in the UK and Eastern Europe and attractive regional aid.  To support IDA Ireland&rsquo;s marketing efforts for the Region and Waterford, IDA Ireland has rolled out a dedicated digital marketing initiative for inward investment focusing on the South East Region and Waterford (Connect and Invest Waterford).  Initiatives such as this can enhance the marketability of the location for investment at a very early stage in a perspective client&rsquo;s decision-making process. </p><p>  IDA remains a key supporter of the South East Employment Action Plan which brings together a number of stakeholders in addressing the persistent employment challenges faced in the South East Region.  I have requested IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to work with my Department so that we can explore what further initiatives we can take to ensure we have a better approach to enterprise development in regional locations.  This exercise will complement the in-depth analysis of our FDI strategy which is currently being undertaken by Forf&aacute;s and which will take account of factors such as key trends emerging in FDI best practice internationally, Ireland&rsquo;s strengths in attracting FDI and any changes to the EU&rsquo;s State Aid Rules, which will come into effect on 1 July 2014.  The results of these two exercises will form the basis of IDA&rsquo;s strategy from 2015 onwards.</p><p>  It is important to note that the employment strategy for Waterford and the South East has not just focused on foreign investors.  Companies such as Eistech, Dawn Meats, FeedHenry and Danone have been supported by my Department to create almost 900 jobs over the coming year.</p><p><b>Table showing the number of IDA Ireland sponsored site visits by potential investors to County Waterford in each of the years 2010 to 2013 inclusive</b><table><tr><th>County Waterford</th><th><div>2010</div></th><th><div>2011</div></th><th><div>2012</div></th><th><div>2013</div></th></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>11</div></td><td><div>26</div></td><td><div>14</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s rating in that study is very favourable.  This can be attributed to the level of high quality foreign direct investment that we have successfully attracted to locate here.  In the study, Ireland was rated first in terms of GDP share in all IPR-intensive industries in the EU, first for GDP share of copyright-intensive industries and, first for GDP share of trade mark-intensive industries.  Ireland performs well also in relation to other rankings, positioned third in the EU for GDP share of patent-intensive industries and above average employment share in copyright-intensive industries.  Ireland has the highest percentage of IP-intensive employment from industries based outside the European Union.</p><p>  Corresponding to this study, it is encouraging and provides positive affirmation of our capabilities in this area that Ireland was ranked 10th in the context of the Global Innovation Index 2013 published in June 2013.  This is the 6th edition of the Global Innovation Index and it evaluated 142 economies worldwide, using 84 indicators. Ireland had relative strengths in Knowledge &amp;amp; technology outputs, including knowledge creation, impact and diffusion, Business sophistication including knowledge workers, innovation linkages and knowledge absorption, Human capital &amp;amp; research, including education and research &amp;amp; development and the capacity of our Institutions, in particular the favourable regulatory and business environment.</p><p>  In general, Intellectual property rights are an increasingly important aspect of how many companies are trading and doing business worldwide, adding value, branding recognition and ensuring certainty for creators and innovators.  Through the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs, we have targeted key sectors to encourage job creation and growth in our economy with intellectual property rights forming an integral part of operations in many of these sectors.</p><p>  This Government is conscious of the central role that IP protection plays in further economic development and has therefore focussed on ensuring that Ireland&rsquo;s Intellectual Property regime compares favourably with best international practice.  Late last year, an independent review Committee published a Report entitled &ldquo;Modernising Copyright&rdquo; and my Department is currently examining the 60 plus recommendations in this Report with a view to bringing forward proposals for legislative reform in this area later this year.</p></reply>

Following consideration of the matter and engagement with the Board of Forf&aacute;s, I decided, in May 2012, to proceed with the proposed integration. </p><p>  This move forms part of a broader reform programme which I have been progressing across the Department and its Agencies, which includes:</p><p>- the merger of the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority;</p><p>- the reform of the 5 workplace relations bodies into two organisations;</p><p>- restructuring the enterprise support model for micro and small businesses, including the dissolution of the 35 CEBs and the creation of the new Local Enterprise Offices;</p><p>- restructuring transport and enterprise development bodies in the Shannon region.</p><p>  The rationale for integrating Forf&aacute;s into the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is to strengthen my Department&rsquo;s capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy.  The integration will, facilitate improvements in the use of existing resources against the backdrop of the moratorium on Public Sector recruitment.  Some savings may arise when the integration process is complete, especially in the Corporate Services area.  However, it is not possible to quantify these potential savings at this stage of the project. </p><p>  I did not consider it necessary to engage external consultants to assist in the assessment of plans to integrate Forf&aacute;s into the Department, or in the integration project itself, and accordingly no such related costs arose.  The project has been managed by an Implementation Team chaired by my Department&rsquo;s Secretary General and comprising representatives from Forf&aacute;s, my own Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></reply>

The overarching objective of integrating Forf&aacute;s into my Department is to strengthen our capacity to develop and implement enterprise policy.  Integrating Forf&aacute;s in to the Department will streamline the process between policy development and its implementation, serving to strengthen my Department's role in driving economic recovery.</p><p>  Forf&aacute;s's policy and research functions will form the core of a new Strategic Policy Division in my Department.  My objective is to maintain, within the Strategic Policy Division, the independent research and analysis that is associated with Forf&aacute;s.  There are precedents in the Civil Service for this type of independent analysis being conducted within a Department.  Examples include the Structural Funds Evaluation Units which, in the 1990s, were established in the lead Departments responsible for the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the European Agricultural funds.  Although primarily staffed by civil servants, these units independently evaluated programmes and published their reports. </p><p>  More recently, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Central Expenditure Evaluation Unit has produced a number of policy analysis papers, published on the stated understanding that they &ldquo;do not necessarily represent the views of either the Minister or the Department of Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform.&rdquo;  I am confident, therefore, that the independent nature of Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s analysis and reports will be maintained within my Department.</p><p>  The capacity of Forf&aacute;s to support independent advice and analysis will also be maintained through its support for the National Competitiveness Council (NCC), and the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN).  The role of the NCC in the context of the Forf&aacute;s integration has been carefully considered.  Revised terms of reference have been approved for the NCC, which will give it greater flexibility to prepare and publish reports on issues it considers important, thereby copper-fastening its independence.</p><p>  The EGFSN, which reports jointly to me and the Minister for Education and Skills, will continue to prepare independent policy papers on skills needs and labour market issues that impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth.  As with the NCC, the EGFSN will be serviced by the Strategic Policy Division.</p></reply>

Forf&aacute;s has responsibility for managing pension arrangements of these staff and for paying the pensions of retired staff of those agencies.  Forf&aacute;s is also responsible for a number of legacy pension schemes for staff of agencies that have now been dissolved, including An Bord Tr&aacute;cht&aacute;la, the former Industrial Development Authority, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, the National Board for Science and Technology, and Eolas. </p><p>  Forf&aacute;s administers pensions for 1,248 existing pensioners as well as some 430 former employees with deferred pension benefits.  Due to the large numbers involved, and for reasons of confidentiality, it is not possible to provide the Deputy with a breakdown of payments made to each person.  In 2012, Forf&aacute;s received total Exchequer funding of &euro;51.4 million, of which &euro;40.2 million was to cover Forf&aacute;s pension commitments broken.  This included provision of &euro;10.4 million for Lump Sum gratuities.</p><p>  In 2013, Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s Exchequer allocation was &euro;40.076 million, of which &euro;34.023 million was to fund their pension obligations for the year, including &euro;3.669 million for gratuities.  The figure for gratuities in 2012 was significantly higher than normal due to the retirement of a large number of staff across the enterprise agencies before the cuts to pension entitlements, as provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts, took effect.</p><p>  It is important to point out that the allocation to Forf&aacute;s to fund the pension entitlements of former agency staff is completely separate to funding made available to meet the agency&rsquo;s policy and research activities.  Forf&aacute;s&rsquo;s allocation for these activities in 2013 was just over &euro;6 million.</p></reply>

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  When these papers have been received from the Department, the case in question will be referred to an Appeals Officer who will make a summary decision on the appeal based on the documentary evidence presented or, if required, hold an oral appeal hearing.</p><p>  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions in relation to social welfare entitlements.</p></reply>

The independent evaluation of JobBridge found that 61.4% of all interns moved into employment after 5 months or more of finishing their internship.  The Department does not disclose the names of host organisations participating in the scheme.</p><p>  In common with other training programmes, a potential JobBridge intern must complete their Youthreach programme in order for time spent on the course to count towards eligibility for JobBridge and they must have a live qualifying claim in order to commence a JobBridge internship.  This means that they must register a claim for, and be approved to receive, a jobseeker payment.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-04a.619.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014020400061#WRK04100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 305 and 306 together.</p><p>  A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service (CWS) from the Health Service Executive to the Department on 1 October 2011 was to provide a streamlined and consistent service to the customer.  As part of this process and to support the Department&rsquo;s activation commitments under the Pathways to Work Programme and the development of Intreo services nationally, it has been necessary to review the administration of all its services across its remit including the CWS.  The Pathways to Work Programme represents a significant reform in the social welfare system and highlighted the need for the Department to focus its resources on the provision of opportunities, supports and assistance to unemployed people.  The Department is intensifying its level of engagement with the unemployed, in particular, those who are, or become, long-term unemployed.  The new Intreo service offers practical, tailored employment services and supports for jobseekers, a model which is currently being rolled out across the country.</p><p>  Overall, this is resulting in a rebalancing of resources across the Department&rsquo;s range of activities including the relocation of some staff to main centres, primarily Intreo offices, which will provide a full range of services, including the CWS and these will, in general, be available in one location.  Since October 2011 to date, some 370 clinics have been closed.  A tabular statement follows, showing the number of CWS clinics that were closed in 2013 and in January 2014 on a county basis.  Approximately 750 clinics existed in January 2013, a county breakdown of these is not available. </p><p>  Where the community welfare service has been re-structured, alternative arrangements have been put in place to ensure that customers are provided with on-going access to the supports provided by the service.  In general, this means that the frequency of available public clinics has increased.  Improved phone services have been put in place, allowing in many cases, for customer queries to be processed without having to attend a clinic on a face to face basis.  If a person is unable to travel to a clinic, for example due to illness, alternative arrangements are in place including arranging a visit to the client&rsquo;s home if necessary.</p><p>  People claiming supports under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme generally only interact with the Department on an occasional basis, for example, when seeking an exceptional needs payment or in claiming additional supports such as rent supplement, which are usually reviewed once to twice yearly.</p><p>  The staffing needs for all areas within the Department are continuously reviewed and will continue to be examined during 2014, to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department and that the services provided are reconstituted, where necessary, to meet the changing needs of Irish society.</p><p><b>Tabular Statement - CWS Clinics 2013 and 2014</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Clinics Closed 2013</th><th>Clinics Closed 2014*</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td>35</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>15</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>25</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>33</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>18</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>6</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>4</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>0</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>7</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>5</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo</td><td>10</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary </td><td>24</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>6</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>13</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>224</td><td>25</td></tr></table></p><p><i>(*as of 30/01/2014)</i></p></reply>

Under Social Welfare legislation a person in receipt of weekly supplementary welfare allowance is required to make a minimum contribution towards their rent. In his case the minimum contribution was &euro;35.00 and his mortgage interest was &euro;31.84; he was therefore considered to have the means to pay his weekly mortgage interest, and had no entitlement to a rent supplement. This decision was upheld on appeal by the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 13 January 2014.</p><p>  There is a discrepancy on the application form which his lender completed on his behalf on 30 August 2013. The gross monthly mortgage interest payment is given as &euro;138.00 and this is the amount relevant to the assessment; the gross interest paid for 2013 is stated by his lender to be &euro;2198.47, which was provided in August 2013.

The Government has re-affirmed its commitment to reducing poverty by revising and enhancing the national social target for poverty reduction. This aims to reduce consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 and to 2% or less by 2020.  The Department published the inaugural Social Inclusion Monitor last year, to track progress on the national social target in an open and transparent manner, using data from the CSO Survey on Income and living Conditions (SILC). The latest published data for 2011 show the consistent poverty rate was 6.9 per cent, which according to the CSO &lsquo;is not a statistically significant change on the 2010 figure of 6.3 per cent&rsquo;. The Department is awaiting publication of the results of the 2012 SILC from the CSO, to update the Monitor. </p><p>  The Social Inclusion Report for 2011-2012 reports on implementation of the Government&rsquo;s policy framework for achieving the national social target, the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion. It shows that across diverse policy areas government departments and state agencies reported progress on many targets/actions associated with the National Action Plan&rsquo;s high level goals. However, evidence of the adverse impact of the economic downturn during this period continues. </p><p>  A key component in the fight against poverty is the provision of a minimum standard of living through the social protection system. In 2013, my department spend over &euro;20 billion in providing income support to 1.5 million recipients with a further 750,000 beneficiaries. Recently published ESRI research shows that welfare payments and other social transfers lifted almost 40% of the population out of at-risk-of-poverty in 2011, which equates to a reduction of 71% in the pre-social transfer poverty rate. Over time, the effectiveness of social transfers in lifting people of poverty has increased from 53 per cent in 2004 to 71 per cent by 2011. As a result, Ireland is among the best performing countries in the EU in reducing poverty through social transfers. This reflects the continuation of substantial State investment in the social protection system, despite the constraints of the economic and fiscal crisis. </p><p>  Another key intervention in tackling poverty is to reduce unemployment, especially among jobless households. The latest unemployment figures show a decrease in the unemployment rate from 13.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2013 to 12.8 per cent in the third quarter &ndash; the sixth consecutive fall and a sign of the steady progress being made. I particularly note the fact that long-term unemployment has reduced from 8.9 to 7.6 per cent over this period. </p><p>  There remains a great challenge to meet the national social target for poverty reduction. The Government is committed to growing the economy and to creating new employment opportunities. At the same time, we have to ensure that the most vulnerable in society, notably jobless households and children, are enabled to benefit from economic recovery through activation programmes and services. I am confident that the delivery of targeted policies across Government departments will lead to future progress on the national social target.</p></reply>

In this way local organizations help to develop their areas by sponsoring projects and   at the same time enabling unemployed people to re-enter the open labour market, by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine while enhancing both their technical and personal skills.</p><p>  Some CE schemes provide participants to various suitable community sub groups.  These sub groups are required to be of charitable status and to be non-profit making organisations.  Furthermore, confirmation is required that there has been no displacement of previously employed persons who were previously engaged in the proposed work.</p><p>  All participants are the employees of the Project Sponsors who are directly responsible and accountable to this Department for the participants&rsquo; work experience, placement and training.  The Department are contracted to the Sponsor Group only and engage with the Sponsor Group on a regular basis, regarding monitoring the programme. </p><p>  It is not within the remit of the Department to engage directly with sub groups who have local arrangements with the Sponsor and do not have a contract with the Department; the only engagement by the Department on this basis is to ensure that the sub groups are not commercial entities and that there is no displacement of paid employment due to the placement of CE participants with a particular sub group. </p><p>  Any organisation that meets these requirements can approach any CE scheme to request facilitation of CE places for its service. However, it would not be appropriate for the Department to make representations on behalf of any group or organisation; it would be the responsibility of the organisation to contact relevant schemes directly.</p><p>  Carecall is one of the community groups that avail of CE participant places from the Network 15 CE Scheme, at the discretion and by agreement with Network 15 Sponsoring Group.  However Carecall do not have a dedicated CE scheme and are therefore a subgroup of the main sponsors.  At present there are three participants allocated to Carecall.  Participants can if desired apply for a transfer to any other scheme for any advertised CE vacancy.  Movement across schemes is often relevant to provide the participants with varied work experience opportunities. However, on examining records, the three participants currently based in Carecall have not applied for any CE transfers.</p><p>  Furthermore, I can confirm that no existing CE schemes have received applications from the persons referred to in the question requesting the allocation of CE participants to this new service.

As part of the 2011 Jobs Initiative, the Minister for Finance announced the halving of the 8.5% rate of employer PRSI to 4.25%, as a means of helping job creation and improving labour cost competitiveness, particularly in the tourism and other employment-rich areas of the economy.  The measure was implemented on a 2&frac12; year time limited basis to apply from 1 July 2011 until 31 December 2013.  The 4.25% employer PRSI rate reverted to the original 8.5% rate from 1 January 2014. </p><p>  The reversion of the employer rate to 8.5% is provided for in legislation; it has already been built into the PRSI income base for 2014 and subsequent years.  Retaining the 4.25% rate of employer PRSI in 2014 would reduce the expected PRSI yield to the Social Insurance Fund by &euro;195 million in a full year.  It is not possible to verify the impact of this measure in isolation on employers who have staff on low pay or work less than 39 hours per week, as employment is affected by a number of factors including the economic environment.  In this context the Forfas report on &ldquo;Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2012&rdquo;, highlights the fact that Irish employer social insurance contributions are low when compared with other OECD countries.</p></reply>

Every effort is made to ensure that personal customer data is used solely for business purposes and that it is not compromised in any way.  My Department has data protection and information security policies, standards, procedures and guidelines in place governing the use of its computer systems and customer data.  These are communicated on an ongoing basis to the staff of the Department and high standards are expected in relation to the handling and processing of personal client information. </p><p>  The policies, procedures and guidelines are kept under constant review and are updated as appropriate.  Staff members are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and information security policies and of the penalties that are applicable in respect of any breach of these policies.  Data protection obligations are also covered on induction programmes for new staff members and on management development programmes and in presentations given by the Department&rsquo;s Business Information and Internal Control Support Units.   </p><p>  I cannot accept the point made by the Data Protection Commissioner that the cases that are under investigation by his office, and which appear to have informed the view expressed by him, can be used to make a sweeping generalisation that the Department&rsquo;s staff as a whole are lax in dealing with client data.  Using such a very small number of cases to make a sweeping generalisation implying that my Department&rsquo;s staff are, or may be lax, is grossly unfair on all of our staff and management in all of the Department&rsquo;s offices.  I agree however that even one data breach by staff in the Department is one too many.</p><p>  Records of data accesses by staff are kept and are subject to audit.  All cases of suspected data breaches are investigated by my Department.  Breaches that are discovered by my Department&rsquo;s own auditing and monitoring systems, or brought to the Department&rsquo;s attention by third parties, are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is taken.  Where a data protection breach has been substantiated by an internal investigation, appropriate sanctions are applied in all cases in accordance with the Civil Service Disciplinary Code.  Sanctions applied reflect the severity of the breach and have included dismissal, financial penalties such as the loss of increments, removal of access to the Department&rsquo;s systems and loss of entitlement to enter promotional competitions. </p><p>  When issues arise requiring investigation a cross disciplinary team consisting of staff from the Department&rsquo;s Business Information and Security Unit, the Internal Control Support Unit, Internal Audit and Information System Division work together to establish facts and report on matters.  This substantial resource allocation is part of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to ensuring that high levels of data protection governance are in place.  My Department is constantly reviewing and updating its procedures in relation to data protection and will continue to do so.  It will continue to cooperate fully, as it has done to date, with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner on all matters relating to data protection.</p></reply>

From time to time the Department assists non-EU/EEA countries with filling vacancies (normally Canada, Australia and the USA) if requested by the Government or Public Employment Service of that country.  The rationale for providing such assistance is threefold. First we work with these authorities on a reciprocal basis which is important not just in the area of employment services (we have used their services on occasion in the past for recruitment purposes) but also in maintaining and building links that are useful in foreign trade and foreign direct investment. Second the work opportunities available in those countries may be of interest to Irish jobseekers and we have a responsibility to jobseekers to make them aware of such opportunities particularly where the opportunities are also being offered to jobseekers in other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland and Great Britain. Third, to the extent that any Irish jobseeker is considering working overseas, the involvement of State/national Governments and public employment services in those countries, including the supports they provide, offers some reassurance to the jobseeker as to the nature of the employment on offer.</p><p>  Finally it is important to note that any overseas employment opportunities brought to the attention of jobseekers by the Department are offered on a voluntary basis; it is entirely a matter for the jobseeker as to whether or not they wish to express an interest in, apply for or take up an offer of any such employment. The social welfare entitlement of a jobseeker who does not wish to avail of any such overseas opportunities will not be affected. This position is made clear in the communication issued to jobseekers.</p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property (including capital) owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means testing purposes. Such property includes all monies held in financial institutions or otherwise, the market value of shares as well as houses and premises owned by a claimant which may or may not be put to commercial use. However, it does not include property such as the family home a person is personally using or enjoying i.e. residing in or, for example, a premises used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>  The current market value of the relevant property is established (having regard to local property prices) as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a notional formula. </p><p>  The current assessment method, involving a disregard of an initial amount of capital and an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, came into effect in October 2000 for most welfare schemes. The assessment formula is not designed to mirror potential interest or annuity rates available to investors or potential rental income from a property and no account is taken of any such income in the overall means assessment. The formula introduced in 2000 continued and enhanced the policy of ensuring that those with property and capital of modest amounts of capital receive the greater share of available support while those with larger amounts of are in a position to avail of it to contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. </p><p>  This property/capital formula also applies where a person has other types of property (including capital such as monies held in financial institutions or otherwise or the market value of shares). The assessment formula for most schemes, including jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and one-parent family payment, was last updated in 2005 &ndash; see table below - and included an increase in the initial amount disregarded from &euro;12,697 to &euro;20,000.</p><p><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>  For the purposes of the State pension non-contributory and carer&rsquo;s allowance the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple.   From 2007, the amount disregarded in the case of disability allowance is &euro;50,000, up from &euro;20,000, and in the case of supplementary welfare allowance is &euro;5,000, up from &euro;520. </p><p>  Where a person has moved out of a property and is no longer personally using or enjoying that property i.e. not residing in same on a full time or part-time basis, the value of the property is assessed as described above.  Where a property is under construction, account is taken of the value, if any, of the particular. building. In such cases, the value may be negligible and would need to be examined on a case by case basis.  Any changes to the current assessment arrangements would have to be considered in a Budgetary context.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to all eligible employees.  I understand that approximately 320 people will be made redundant as a result of the closure of Mount Carmel hospital. It is likely that the vast majority of these staff will qualify for a statutory redundancy payment.</p><p>  In order to qualify for a statutory redundancy payment, an employee must: have at least two years continuous service; be in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts; be over the age of 16; and have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation.  As no applications for statutory redundancy payments have yet been received from the provisional liquidators it is not possible to estimate the cost that will be incurred by the Social Insurance Fund with respect to these payments.   </p><p>  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of my Department that he/she is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to his/her eligible employees the Department will make lump sum payments directly to those employees.  That will raise a debt against the employer which the Department will seek to recover.  Where an employer is in liquidation the Minister for Social Protection is a preferential creditor in respect of any payments made under the redundancy payments scheme.</p></reply>

Responsibility for delivery of this initiative rests with individual county and city councils. Gateway has a target to provide for 3,000 placements focusing on those who have been unemployed for 24 months or more. Participants are currently being selected by a random process conducted by the Department of Social Protection for recruitment by county and city councils. </p><p>  Progress on the roll-out has been slower than anticipated.  Delays in the main relate to the on-going staff restructuring processes of county and city councils, the ongoing engagement with stakeholders, particularly Trade Unions, and operational matters relating to securing resources, identifying work and supervisory cover as well as Garda vetting.  So far some 1,600 work placements have been identified in councils in the initial phase of the rollout.  While small numbers have started work, progress is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks.  Despite the obstacles identified above, the initial placement of participants on Gateway commenced in Louth county council in early December with the first placements beginning in Limerick council on 20th January. County and city councils have given assurances of accelerating the recruitment process to fill all places identified and to meet the target of 3,000 placements at an early date.</p></reply>

Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities and are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  They refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work the social welfare expenditure would over time increase by this amount.</p><p>  The vast majority of people on social welfare are claiming the correct entitlement due to them. However, a small minority is not and a range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.  In this regard, fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced in recent years and are subject to continuing review.  Overall, this is resulting in less opportunity to commit fraud and less chance of claims being in payment at an incorrect rate through fraud or error.</p><p>  Approximately 1.1 million reviews were carried out in both 2012 and 2013.  The control savings achieved in 2012 were &euro;669m and in 2013 were &euro;632m.  This outcome demonstrates that the Department&rsquo;s more intense control focus in recent years is having a positive impact on the level of fraud and error in the social welfare system.</p></reply>

The supplement assists with the interest portion of the mortgage repayments only. There are currently approximately 10,000 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement for which the Government has provided &euro;17.9 million for the scheme in 2014. </p><p>  The Government wants to provide an environment where mortgage holders can pay for and stay in their home but, where people have a genuine difficulty in meeting their financial commitments, they will have a framework to address and resolve that difficulty in an appropriate and fair way having regard to the particular circumstances of the case. The Government&rsquo;s strategy to assist those in mortgage difficulty is built around the following measures, as recommended in the 2011 Interdepartmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group (Keane Group), in four main distinct areas: lenders providing sustainable and durable resolution options to their borrowers; a social housing response (Mortgage to Rent); comprehensive advice to borrowers; personal insolvency reform.</p><p>  In the context of the overall strategy, the continued payment of mortgage interest supplement does little to assist recipients in improving the long term difficulty in addressing their mortgage problem and provides little incentive for the lender to provide sustainable solutions. The Keane Group&rsquo;s over-arching theme was that the mortgage interest supplement scheme is not an appropriate long term support and should become a time bound payment with an appropriate exit strategy to be formulated for the recipient. </p><p>   Under the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, lenders are obliged to put in place Arrears Support Units to deal with borrowers under the MARP. The most appropriate way in which customers experiencing short term mortgage difficulties can be supported is through engagement with their lender under this process. Lenders must explore all options for repayment arrangements in order to determine which options are viable for each particular case. These options include interest only arrangements and deferring payment of all or part of the instalment repayment for a period. </p><p>  As part of the fiscal adjustment required for Budget 2014, provision was made for the discontinuation of entitlement to mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants from 1 January 2014. Existing customers are not affected by this measure and may retain entitlement to the scheme over the next four year period. However, it would be expected that during this four year period, existing customers would no longer require this support through sustainable solutions being put in place, securing employment or exit strategies sponsored by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, namely the Mortgage to Rent scheme. </p><p>  I have no plans to reverse this decision as I am satisfied that the range of supports implemented by this Government, including the range of information and guidance resources available, are appropriate in assisting those facing mortgage difficulties.</p></reply>

Management is based on the advice of the Independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for Salmon. Available surpluses (if any) in each river are calculated annually for each individual river based on the scientific analysis and managerial advice.</p><p>  The SSC has advised that stock of salmon in the Owenmore river, Bangor fishery district has failed to reach its conservation limit in the last two years of the normal five year average calculation used in all such assessments. For this reason and in line with the conservation imperative, activity resulting in salmon mortality, regardless of method, is not permitted in this river or the common embayment during the 2014 season. Angling, however is permitted on a catch-and-release basis only in the waters of the Owenmore river. This reflects the relative status of the stocks of this river.</p><p>  I am advised by IFI that they will continue to monitor the stocks annually. IFI will also continue to develop the management strategy for the relevant rivers with a view to identifying the extent of any recovery arising from the cessation of the harvesting of salmon and any stock rehabilitation works undertaken.</p><p>  The Salmon Hardship Scheme was introduced by the State following a decision to cease the commercial mixed stock salmon fishery in the sea. This scheme was targeted at commercial salmon fishermen who were active in the fishery at the time and funding was provided to fishermen for them to leave the fishery and diversify into some new activity.  The scheme closed for applications on 31st December 2007. In the current financial circumstances there is no prospect of revisiting such a scheme.  I have asked senior management at IFI to meet with the local fisherman as soon as possible.</p></reply>

The plan outlined the following main management actions aimed at reducing eel mortality and increasing silver eel escapement to the sea: a cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market, mitigation of the impact of hydropower installations, ensure upstream migration of juvenile eel at barriers, improvement of water quality.  The overall requirement and objective is to provide, with high probability, a long-term 40% escapement to the sea of the biomass of silver eel, relative to pristine conditions (i.e. if the stock had been completely free of man-made influences including commercial fishing).</p><p>  Based on comprehensive scientific assessment of eel stocks nationally and a review of Ireland&rsquo;s EMP in 2012 it was recommended that the closure of both the commercial and recreational eel fisheries be continued in line with the conservation imperative. The 2012 review included a robust public consultation during which many issues were raised and considered. Full details of the outputs of the public consultation are available on the Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) web site. Similar reviews were carried out across the EU as the eel stock is endangered throughout Europe.</p><p>  The International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advised in 2011, that glass eel recruitment had fallen to 5% of their 1960-1979 level in the Atlantic region and precariously less than 1% in the North Sea area. The very latest ICES advice (2013) indicates that the annual recruitment of glass eel to European waters has increased marginally over the last two years to 1.5% of 1960-79 levels in the North Sea area, and to 10% in the Atlantic area. The overall ICES advice is that the indices remain at very low levels compared with historical catches. </p><p>  In Ireland, scientific studies also show that recruitment has been declining since the mid-1980s, for example in the 2000-2011 period, the glass eel catch in the Shannon was at 2% of the pre-1980 level.  The scientific advice both internationally and from Ireland's scientists on the independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for Eels does not support any assertion that stocks &quot;are above conservation limits&rdquo; and the status of the European Eel in Ireland has been defined by the United Nations as critically endangered. </p><p>  While I recognize fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, the review of scientific and management advice and inputs from the public consultation informed a decision to continue with the cessation of the commercial eel fishery and closure of the market for the period from 2012 to 2015. Ireland&rsquo;s EMP will be reviewed again next year and an opportunity for further consultation with stakeholders will be advanced at that time. I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to catch eel so as to contribute to &quot;Trap and Transport&quot; operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the EMP.</p></reply>

The SEAI wind atlas was developed as an information tool for Local Authorities to identify areas suitable for renewable energy in their County Development Plans and for developing their wind energy strategies. The wind atlas provides information on wind speeds in various areas around Ireland. It does not provide analysis of speeds at specific sites, for which specialist wind farm modelling capability, and site specific data, would be required. However, the wind atlas database is available to any private or public entity wishing to carry out an initial analysis of the wind energy potential of a site in Ireland. </p><p>  As regards access to information on specific sites, I have many times stated the importance of early and transparent engagement between project developers and local communities as the most constructive way of ensuring all parties are fully informed.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg&rsquo;s website at    as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Waterford. This will be achieved by providing:</p><p> - a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and </p><p> - a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m properties with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively. Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.</p><p>  I am aware of at least one service provider announcing that it will be providing advanced broadband services in 21 locations throughout County Waterford before July 2016 and my Department will be happy to discuss this further with the Deputy.  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband. The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society. </p></reply>

Informed by the findings of a Strategic Environmental Assessment, the OREDP will set out how best to coordinate action across the environmental, energy and economic development policy areas in order to realise Ireland's abundant offshore renewable energy potential, including that of wave energy.</p><p>  It is clear from the work that my Department has been undertaking to develop the OREDP, that cross cutting action is required to maintain support for the ocean energy sector, which includes both wave and tidal technologies, if it is to reach commercial viability. Full coordination across government departments and agencies on areas such as environmental monitoring, research and development, consenting procedures, infrastructure requirements and enterprise development, will all be critical to realising the potential of this sector as a source of sustainable employment and economic growth, especially in those coastal communities where job creation initiatives would be particularly welcomed. </p><p>  My Department already supports ocean energy through the funding for the Ocean Energy Development Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), which administers the Prototype Development Fund, designed to support the development and deployment of both wave and tidal energy devices. The SEAI has also been allocated &euro;5 million for the development of the Atlantic Marine Energy Test Site (AMETS), which will be a site of international importance for open sea testing of wave energy devices. In conjunction with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, my Department also provides funding for the Integrated Maritime Energy Research Centre (IMERC) in Cork. A partnership between UCC, Cork Institute of Technology and the Irish Naval Service, IMERC is developing an integrated maritime research and enterprise centre at its campus at Ringaskiddy in Cork, which includes internationally recognised expertise in ocean energy. In total, my Department has allocated &euro;26.3 million in funding for ocean energy for the period 2013 to 2016.</p><p>  I understand ESB International has provided engineering expertise to the SEAI in the development of the AMETS project. The ESB is also developing the Westwave Project, which aims to deploy a demonstration wave energy installation off the west coast by 2018. For this project, the ESB has successfully completed a year of monitoring of the wave characteristics off the Mayo coast. They also collaborated with the INFOMAR Programme, a joint programme of the Geological Survey of Ireland and the Marine Institute, to survey the seabed in the area.

Not only is the renewable energy sector of key importance in the context of how we reach overall climate change objectives, it also provides a real, and sustainable, economic opportunity for Ireland, both in terms of providing a secure, indigenous source of energy, and potentially as a clean export. </p><p>  The Commission's proposals are an important milestone in a complex policy development process that spans two major EU policy areas. Considerable analysis is now required to ensure that the framework allows for action that is cost effective and does not place a disproportionate burden on EU energy consumers.</p><p>  My Department will, over the coming months, work closely with other government departments in Ireland and with our European partners to establish the scale of the contribution Ireland should make to the achievement of the EU-wide binding target for renewable energy of at least 27% in 2030. The development of a new governance system as proposed by the Commission will also be part of this work and the Commission's forthcoming guidance on this will also need to be examined in due course. </p><p>  In the meantime, the Government is fully committed to the delivery of the existing target of 16% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2020. In 2012, 19.6% of electricity demand was met by renewable generation, with 5.2% of heat and 2.4% of transport energy requirements coming from renewable sources. Overall, at the end of 2012, 7.1% of our energy was provided from renewable sources. It is critical that every effort is maintained if we are to reach the 16% target for 2020, as it will provide the basis for reaching our 2030 objectives. </p><p>  The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, has oversight of the process for connecting generators, both renewable and non-renewable, to the Grid. I understand that the CER is currently reviewing the situation regarding the most recent Gate process, Gate 3, and expects to publish a public consultation paper regarding connections later this year. This process will take account of Government energy policy. </p></reply>

The Government has confidence that the forward planning process from the national planning framework of the National Spatial Strategy, to Regional Planning Guidelines and local development planning and the Strategic Infrastructure Act provides the necessary framework for ensuring that all necessary standards are met and that extensive statutory and non-statutory consultation are key to creating public confidence to this effect.With regard to the North-South transmission line, the Government does not determine the scale of submissions on any given project.

IFI owns and operates a fish hatchery located in the centre of Cong, and is currently carrying out a review of hatchery operations generally with a view to rationalising and improving efficiency and cost effectiveness in this operational issue. The primary focus of the proposal is business efficiency, centred on examining the feasibility of using existing capacity at Cong to yield efficiencies and cost savings in line with the Government's reform agenda. </p><p>  In developing rationalisation plans for its core business, IFI is keenly aware of the existing educational value of the Cong operation in facilitating requests for school visits to a working hatchery. I am advised that as a modest element of the strategic operational review, IFI is examining possibilities to improve the visitor experience within the Cong facilities. IFI is anxious, that in the context of business improvements, they should not lose sight of the educational and community benefits of the existing Cong facilities which are consistent with the organisation&rsquo;s statutory role to promote all species in the inland fisheries resource. </p><p>  In particular consideration has been given to increasing understanding and awareness of the rare ferox trout which is unique to Cong. The area is a vital link in the life cycle of this rare, separate and ancient species that originates in Cong, and has existed in Lough Corrib since the ice age. </p><p>  IFI is also cognisant and supportive of the existing proposal in Ballina for the development of a Salmon Life Centre, which is being led by the local Town Council. The feasibility study in relation to this proposed development was undertaken by Tourism Development International and was completed in November 2008. I understand that the Local Authority led proposals could entail a very significant investment should the estimated &euro;6m to build the facility be secured for this stand-alone development proposal. </p><p>  IFI's commitment to Ballina and the importance of the River Moy to the salmon species and to inland fisheries is well recognised as demonstrated by the investment of over &euro;1m by IFI in the restoration and development of the iconic salmon weir in the centre of the town.</p><p>  I have undertaken to meet with the Deputy and the Chief Executive Officer of IFI to discuss the issues she has raised.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg's website at  as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<blockquote>- a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<br /><br />- a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</blockquote>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  In the fixed line segment of the market, eircom has announced plans to pass 1.4m properties with its next generation broadband service, with speeds of up to 100Mbps, while UPC has increased its entry level and maximum speeds to 120Mbps and 200Mbps respectively.  Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.</p><p>  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles.  Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators.  The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband.  The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market.</p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work continues in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained.  My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  In designing the procurement process for the intervention, my Department will be required to comply with the EU State aid rules which set out conditionality in relation to, among other things, technology neutrality.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-02-04a.866.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/947" speakername="Pat Rabbitte" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014020400066#WRP01000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 407 and 411 together. </p><p>  Ireland's telecommunications market has been fully liberalised since 1999 in accordance with the requirements of binding EU Directives.  The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County can be found on a number of websites, including ComReg's website at  as well as the websites of individual commercial operators.</p><p>  The State only becomes involved in investing in the provision of broadband services in instances of clear market failure, such as the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  The broadband service contracted under NBS is a basic, affordable, scalable product in keeping with EU State Aid clearance for the Scheme in September 2007.  With basic broadband widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services. </p><p>  The Government's National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses.  This will be achieved by providing:<blockquote>-  a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and<br /><br />-  a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</blockquote>Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.  These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles.  Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators.  The ESB Electronic Communications Bill, which I introduced last month, is a further step in promoting investment in competitively priced high speed broadband.  The Bill will, when enacted, enable the ESB to utilise its electricity distribution network to provide telecommunications services in the Irish market.</p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work, including a comprehensive mapping exercise, continues in my Department in relation to the State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU State Aids approval must be obtained. </p><p>  Under the national mapping exercise, information has been sought from all undertakings authorised by ComReg in relation to current and planned broadband services, both basic and next generation access (NGA).  Mapping data have been submitted to my Department by a total of 23 operators and the process of analysing the data and supporting information is continuing.  In many cases, this includes follow-up queries and requests for further information.  The mapping data are being assessed on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the EU State Aid Guidelines.  When all of the information has been analysed, a clear picture should emerge of coverage throughout all of the country.  When this process is complete, it is my intention to publish a map showing existing and planned NGA broadband coverage, along with the Government's proposals for a State-led intervention to roll out high speed broadband across the country. </p><p>  My Department has commenced initial engagements with the EU Commission in relation to State Aid Guidelines and the Government's plans to intervene in the market.  A formal State Aid notification process will commence when the mapping has been completed and the level of intervention required has been identified.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing.  The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

This means that, under the co-operation mechanisms outlined in Directive 2009/28/EC, there is potential for projects of scale both onshore and offshore that are aimed at export markets.  It is in this context that the United Kingdom Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Mr Edward Davey MP, and I signed a Memorandum of Understanding on energy cooperation. </p><p>  Projects of a significant scale specifically for export will have to await the signing of an Inter-Governmental Agreement, the Renewable Energy Export Policy and Development Framework which is being developed by my Department over the coming year or so, and the obtaining of planning permission, informed by this policy, from An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Both onshore and offshore developers are free to bring forward export proposals and any such projects, if they take place in the future, would not connect to the Irish grid but would involve separate direct connection to the UK. </p><p>  Separately, in relation to meeting our domestic renewable energy requirements Gate 3 was designed to ensure the 40% target for renewable electricity (RES-E) by 2020 could be achieved.  The latest figures show that the Gate 3 phase of group processing by EirGrid and ESB Networks has resulted in offers being accepted by wind generators to connect approximately 3,000 megawatts so far.  When taken with the current installed renewable generation and existing contracts for connection, this is in line with Ireland's requirements to meet 2020 renewable energy targets.</p></reply>

The Panel will be asked to ensure that the underground studies are complete and objective, and are comparable to similar studies of overhead options for the two projects.  Studies of the overhead and underground options will then be published side-by-side, in objective and comparable terms, before proceeding to the next stage of public consultation on those two projects.  The two studies will take account of environmental (including visual amenity) impacts, technical efficacy and cost factors.  The Independent Panel will have power to commission its own work if there is any perceived deficiency in the studies presented. </p><p>  On 29 January, I confirmed that the matter of electro-magnetic fields (EMF) issue will not fall under the remit of the Expert Panel.  In light of the fact that responsibility for this rests with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Minister Phil Hogan has agreed to engage expert assistance to review and report on international developments in the scientific literature on potential health effects of EMF emanating from transmission grid infrastructure.  The study will serve as an update on a report, &quot;Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, which was produced by my Department in 2007.</p><p>  The Expert Panel has not yet met but is scheduled to do so at an early date, and it will proceed to settle on terms of reference to oversee the integrity of the process now put in place.</p></reply>

This scheme was extended nationally in June 2012, targeting those low income families whose mortgage situation is unsustainable and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  The Scheme ensures that the family remains in their home, while ownership is transferred to an approved housing body who in turn rents it to the original owners.  Eligibility requirements are in line with other forms of social housing support.  </p><p>  To date, circa 1,975 cases have been put forward by the lenders for application of the Mortgage to Rent scheme.  A total of 779 have thus far been approved for referral to the local authority.  33 cases are completed with households paying a differential rent to an approved housing body, a further 61 are sale agreed and 22 are under offer.  An additional 61 are at the valuation stage in the process.  A total of 278 cases were terminated during the process for various reasons including: the borrower declining the scheme; the lender withdrawing the offer of the scheme due to a change in circumstances of the borrower; and issues on the local authority assessment, having regard to the accommodation needs of the household concerned.  An additional 22 cases failed to agree a sale price or the condition of the property did not allow for the sale to proceed.  </p><p>  It is currently estimated that in the region of 350 transactions will be completed in 2014.  A Mortgage to Rent scheme for local authority borrowers in arrears has also been piloted in two local authority areas, namely Westmeath County Council and Dublin City Council.  This Scheme will be extended nationally shortly.</p><p><b>Mortgage to Rent Scheme</b><table><tr><th>Cases put forward by lenders</th><th>1,975</th></tr><tr><td>Cases approved, to date, for referral to local authority</td><td>779</td></tr><tr><td>Cases at valuation stage</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Completed </td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>Sale Agreed</td><td>61</td></tr><tr><td>Under offer</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>Terminated</td><td>278</td></tr><tr><td>Failure to agree sale</td><td>22</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Forum initially comprised the Departments of An Taoiseach (in the Chair), Finance and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, as well as five private philanthropic organisations, including Philanthropy Ireland, the independent representative body for all philanthropic organisations and interests engaged with the development of philanthropy and giving in Ireland.  On 1 May 2011, responsibility for the Forum was transferred to my Department. I broadened its focus to support the development of both philanthropy and fund-raising.  During 2012, the Forum set out ambitious plans to increase philanthropic giving from its current estimated level of approximately &euro;500 million per annum to &euro;800 million by 2016. The drivers for this increase in giving fall under four overarching themes: a national giving campaign, fiscal and infrastructure recommendations, fund-raising capacity improvements and a social innovation fund.</p><p>  In order to make progress on implementing the proposals recommended under each of these four themes responsibility has been assigned to existing organisations, including Philanthropy Ireland, with the necessary expertise and capacity to take the lead in delivering on the recommendations of the Forum to grow and develop the philanthropy and fund-raising sectors.  Very significant progress has been made on the implementation of the Forum&rsquo;s plans.  A National Giving Campaign, the one percent difference, has been launched &ndash; details of the campaign are on the website .  The tax treatment of donations to charities has been simplified and decoupled from business tax incentives, a road map has been set out for the implementation of the Charities Act, including the setting up of a Charities Regulator, and the Social Innovation Fund, which is in the early stages of development.</p><p>  My Department continues to support the Forum.  In this respect, funding of approximately &euro;1.9 million over a three-year period, beginning in 2012, is being allocated to Philanthropy Ireland on the basis that it is matched with funding from philanthropic sources.  My Department oversees the contractual arrangements in relation to the funding to Philanthropy Ireland in respect of their work on behalf of the Forum.  Details in respect of 2012 are set out in the table.  Details in respect of 2013 are not yet to hand in my Department.  As Philanthropy Ireland is a private company, my Department has no role in relation to its operations or its board membership.</p><p>  I share the Forum&rsquo;s view that, even in these difficult times, we have the opportunity to increase substantially the level of private investment in the philanthropic and fund-raising sectors.  It is not intended to substitute for Government investment, but to supplement it.  As well as unlocking significant private funding to address fundamental social and economic challenges, increased private giving to good causes will also support the Government&rsquo;s strategy to increase employment.   </p><p>Table   </p><p>Philanthropy Ireland Limited, National Giving Campaign for the year ended 31 December 2012   <table><tr><th>National Giving Campaign</th><th>Expenditure</th></tr><tr><td>General Events</td><td>&euro;6,942</td></tr><tr><td>Research</td><td>&euro;57,562</td></tr><tr><td>Public Relations</td><td>&euro;77,332</td></tr><tr><td>Advertising</td><td>&euro;19,355</td></tr><tr><td>Travel and Subsistence</td><td>&euro;1,635</td></tr><tr><td>Printing, stationery and postage</td><td>&euro;5,156</td></tr><tr><td>Sundry expenses</td><td>&euro;96</td></tr><tr><td>Legal and professional (including procurement process)</td><td>&euro;25,458</td></tr><tr><td>Legal and professional (Soc Inn Fund)</td><td>&euro;5,063</td></tr><tr><td>Project management fees</td><td>&euro;30,996</td></tr><tr><td>Books and Subscriptions (Tax and Regulation)</td><td>&euro;232</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;229,827</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Research undertaken by the Local Government Management Agency on similar initiatives in other countries has informed the development of this initiative.  Significant additional costs are not involved in this initiative.  A range of developments already underway in libraries &ndash; such as the introduction of self&ndash;service technology - support the implementation of open libraries.  I very much support this initiative which has had positive outcomes in other countries.

In cases where Occupational Therapist (OT) assessment is needed, the applicant may engage a private sector OT and costs of up to &euro;200 may be recouped to the applicant.  Alternatively, local authorities may obtain the services of an OT on a fee per case basis or the authority may enter into a service level agreement with the HSE to avail of OT services.

The new regulations are necessary following the widespread instances of failure by owners, designers and builders to comply with their statutory obligations under the Building Control Act 1990 to design and construct buildings in accordance with the building regulations.  These obligations apply to all sectors of the housing market, including the self-build sector.</p><p>  Neither the Building Control Act or any regulations thereunder, including the new Building Control Regulations, place any restrictions on whom an owner may assign as a builder once the owner is satisfied that the builder is competent to undertake the works involved. An owner who intends to self-build, and who contracts out elements of the work to various parties, must assume legal responsibility for ensuring that the building or works concerned will comply with the requirements of the second schedule to the building regulations.  The owner must also undertake to do everything necessary to achieve this and to ensure they are in a position to certify the building or works on completion thereby taking legal responsibility as builder.  The new regulations also require an owner to assign a competent, registered professional to certify the design prior to commencement and to inspect the works during construction so that the assigned certifier is in a position, in conjunction with the owner-builder, to sign a certificate of compliance on completion.  A building project cannot proceed until such assignments (which may be one and the same person) have been made.  Confidence in the builder will be a key factor influencing a professional&rsquo;s decision on accepting a role as assigned certifier, in particular, and owners who intend to self-build will need to be aware of this.</p><p>  In regard to the references to direct labour and the use multiple contractors, it is my Department&rsquo;s understanding that the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013, which do not come within my remit, require project supervisors in circumstances where a construction project involves more than one contractor, or a particular risk, or more than 30 days/500 person days.  Owners should therefore be advised to have regard to all statutory obligations and to seek advice from competent builders and competent, registered professionals where necessary and appropriate.</p></reply>

Both of these programmes provide funding to support the work of the New Communities Partnership.  The LCDP is one of my Department&rsquo;s main social inclusion programmes. Its objective is to tackle poverty and social exclusion through partnership and constructive engagement between Government, and its agencies, and people in disadvantaged communities.  The Programme is administered and managed by Pobal on behalf of my Department and delivered at a local level by the nationwide network of Local Development Companies and a small number of alternative delivery structures.</p><p>  Following the closure, in 2010, of the Local Development Company for the Dublin Inner City area (Dublin Inner City Partnership), New Communities Partnership is one of a number of groups contracted directly by Pobal to deliver LCDP services in the Dublin Inner City Area.  The following table provides details of the funding provided to New Communities Partnership under the LCDP.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Funding provided</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;47,000</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;54,183</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;50,388</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;49,585</td></tr><tr><td>2014 Allocation</td><td>&euro;50,163</td></tr></table></p><p>While the Board has ultimate responsibility for running the Company, Pobal carries out audits of LCDP funded groups in line with arrangements agreed with my Department.  Although the Group in question has not been selected for audit under the LCDP to date, it has been required to comply with the financial guidelines which underpin the programme.</p><p>  The SSNO in the Community and Voluntary sector provides multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs associated with the provision of services.  Priority is given under the Scheme to supporting national organisations which provide coalface services to disadvantaged target groups.  Core funding refers typically to operating costs that will always need to be met, and are fundamental to the organisation's survival.  The funding normally covers basic organisational and administrative costs of an organisation, and may include items such as salaries, facilities, equipment, communications, and the direct expenses of day-to-day work.  The organisation in question was first funded under the SSNO which ran from 2008-2011, and is now funded under the current Scheme which commenced in 2011 and will finish on 30 June 2014.  My Department conducts inspections on nationally funded schemes and programmes operated and implemented by the Department.  A minimum selection of 5% of expenditure is examined each year across the Community &amp;amp; Voluntary Sector support programmes.  To date, the Partnership has not been selected for inspection, although a system of checks is carried out prior to each payment.</p><p>  The following table provides details of the funding to New Communities Partnership over the period 2008-2013.   <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Funding provided</th></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>&euro;113,000</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;108,500</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;97,600</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;83,600</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;90,000</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;84,800</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In the case of the local authority and Departmental staff who were successful in this competitive recruitment process, their initial period with Irish Water is on a secondment basis pending the establishment of the superannuation arrangements provided for under the Water Services No.2 Act, 2013.  No other secondment arrangements are in place for the Irish Water organisation, but a number of staff have been seconded to the Irish Water Programme to assist in the metering programme and the establishment of Irish Water.  Such staff remain employees of their parent authority or the Department at their existing salary levels and Irish Water recoups the relevant employer for the costs of secondment.</p><p>  The Water Services Transition Office (WSTO) was established by the County and City Managers&rsquo; Association to assist with the implementation of the water sector reform process.  The role of the WSTO is to support the delivery of the water sector reform programme on behalf of the local government sector, by co-ordinating the involvement of the 34 County and City Councils on a range of matters including standardised data gathering, financial analysis, HR negotiations, negotiation of SLAs and transition planning, all of which were required while daily water services operations were maintained.  The WSTO was established in two locations - Dublin and Waterford - and is staffed by seconded local authority staff.  During 2013, the average monthly WSTO staff complement across both locations was 17.7 staff, ranging from 21.1 staff at its highest (August 2013) to 5 staff at its lowest (January 2013).  At year end there were 13.6 staff assigned to the WSTO. Arrangements are in place for the continuation of the WSTO into 2014 with proposals for staff numbers to be reduced to 10 people.  WSTO staff costs will continue to be paid in the first instance by the parent local authority and are recouped by the Department in line with the approved budget for 2014.</p></reply>

EPA officials were quickly on site and continued to attend the site each day, working in co-ordination with the Garda&iacute; and Dublin Fire Brigade in managing the incident.  While the smell of smoke from the fire was reported across Dublin immediately following the outbreak, the results from the EPA&rsquo;s national ambient air quality monitoring network show that there was no breach of air quality standards at any of the monitoring stations in the network for the duration of the fire.  This includes stations at Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Rathmines and in the city centre.  It is thought that the strong winds assisted in the dispersion of the plume.  Elevated pollution levels were recorded by the closest monitor, located at Ballyfermot Library, but these were still within prescribed pollutant limit values for the protection of human health set out in national and EU air quality legislation.</p><p>  The EPA issued the following health related advice to local residents:<blockquote>- Anyone in the path of the plume was advised to keep windows and doors closed.<br /><br />- Adults and children with heart or lung problems should reduce strenuous physical activity, particularly outdoors, and particularly if they experience symptoms.  People with asthma may find they need to use their reliever inhaler more often.<br /><br />- Anyone experiencing discomfort such as sore eyes, cough or sore throat should consider reducing activity, particularly outdoors.</blockquote>The EPA&rsquo;s air quality health index was used to give advice to the public and was updated regularly via the twitter account @EPAAirQuality. The incident notification on the EPA&rsquo;s website was also regularly updated -   EPA inspectors undertook additional air monitoring over the duration of the fire.  While it is too early at this stage to provide a fully detailed air quality report, these results are being compiled and a report on the monitoring undertaken will be prepared by the EPA.</p></reply>

The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.  The Water Services Act (No. 2) 2013 provides for the transfer of water services functions from the local authorities to Irish Water.  The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  The CER has been given statutory responsibility for protecting the interests of customers.  The water charges levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER.</p><p>  An inter-departmental working group has been established to advise the Government on the appropriate method for addressing affordability issues which may arise with the introduction of domestic water charges.  The group is examining the issues arising for those with specific medical conditions, which require high water usage, in the course of its work.  The group comprises my Department and the Departments of the Taoiseach, Social Protection, Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance.  A final report will be submitted for consideration by Government when the group has completed its examination of the issues involved, and the Government will decide on the proposed approaches to be taken in relation to affordability, medical needs and the free allowance.  The CER will be carrying out a public consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs in the coming months.  Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. It will be possible for a customer to access the meter to verify readings.</p><p>  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas library, suppliers of drinking water are required to ensure that the water supplied is wholesome and clean.  Water which is wholesome and clean is defined as water which is free from any micro-organisms and parasites and from any substances which in numbers or concentrations constitute a potential danger to human health, and which meets the quality standards specified in the Schedule to the Regulations.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s compliance with these regulations.</p><p>  The Water Services (No.2) Act 2013 also requires that Irish Water will prepare codes of practice, on a range of matters, including standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions and billing by Irish Water of persons in respect of water services provided.  Irish Water will also be required to prepare a code of practice on any matter considered necessary by the CER.  I expect that the CER will consider compliance with statutory standards by Irish Water in fulfilling its functions.</p></reply>

The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, including the method of valuation. </p><p>  The annual rate on valuation (ARV), which is applied to the valuation for each property determined by the Valuation Office to obtain the amount payable in rates, is decided by the elected members of each local authority in the annual budget and its determination is a reserved function.   </p><p>  I am acutely aware of the pressures on small and medium-sized businesses at the present time. Local authorities have been asked by my Department to exercise restraint or, where possible, to reduce commercial rates and local charges for 2014. Local authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years and in 2013, 87 out of the 88 rating authorities have either reduced their ARV or kept it the same as in 2012. I expect the same positive response from the sector this year and the information obtained by my Department to date in respect of 2014 suggests this trend is continuing.   </p><p>  The Commissioner of Valuation, who has sole responsibility for all valuation matters, is conducting a programme of revaluation of all commercial and industrial properties throughout the State on a county by county basis. In a revaluation, the entire commercial valuation list for a local authority area is brought up-to-date by reference to values at a specific valuation date and the entire list is published on one date (usually 31 December) and comes into effect for rating purposes on 1 January the following year. The more recent revaluations of commercial properties completed by the Valuation Office were in respect of the areas of Dublin City Council, Waterford County Council, Waterford City Council and Dungarvan Town Council, and these have taken effect for rating purposes from 1 January 2014. </p><p>  The essential purpose of a revaluation is to redistribute the burden of rates more equitably in line with relative changes in valuations across different classes of properties or individual properties within particular classes or uses. Revaluation results in more consistent and up-to-date valuations for rating purposes and provides a more equitable distribution of valuations across those liable to pay rates. This may inevitably result in an increase in the valuation of some commercial properties and a decrease in the valuation of others. </p><p>  It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities. Section 8 of the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006 provides that I, as Minister, can make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, adjusted for inflation. Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities that have undergone a revaluation to date, including most recently for Dublin City Council, Waterford County Council, Waterford City Council and Dungarvan Town Council. </p></reply>

The owner, rather than the occupier, may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate.  Currently, where a person&rsquo;s occupancy commences after the date of the making of the rate, that person as a subsequent occupier could be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they could not be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies. However, the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for a change to rating law which will remove this subsequent occupier liability .      </p><p>  It is not the intention in removing subsequent occupier liability to undermine local authorities&rsquo; collection powers and put at risk the collection of rates income.  Therefore, section 32 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 provides for all unpaid and outstanding rates liabilities to be discharged prior to the transfer of ownership or other interest in a property (including tenancy) and that this transfer of interest must be notified to the local authority within two weeks of its effect. This measure is intended to strengthen local authority collection powers in this area without causing any additional burden for subsequent occupiers.  Furthermore, the amendment provides that any rates due by an owner of relevant property and not discharged shall remain a charge on the property.   </p><p>  Under these new provisions, should the owner fail to notify the local authority of a change of occupancy, the Act provides that the owner or landlord will become liable for an amount which is equivalent to two years of outstanding liabilities that may have accrued in respect of any previous occupier of the property. Any amount of that charge that remains unpaid by an owner will become a charge on the property for up to 12 years. The imposition of such a charge on the landlord or owner does not transfer any liability that may rest with any previous occupier.   </p><p>  The Local Government Reform Act 2014 was signed by the President on 27 January 2014. The timing of the commencement of the provisions outlined above is being considered in the context of the timetable for commencement of the Act generally. My Department will be consulting with local authorities in that regard, in order to ensure that appropriate procedures are in place, and likewise that ratepayers and property owners are properly notified of the new obligations. </p></reply>

The statement emphasises a housing-led approach which is about accessing permanent housing as the primary response to all forms of homelessness. The availability and supply of secure, affordable and adequate housing is essential in ensuring sustainable tenancies and ending long-term homelessness.  When the statement was published, I announced a set of indicators to be used to demonstrate the dynamics of homelessness as it is addressed. These indicators will give a clearer picture of homelessness in Ireland and, in quantifying its on-going extent, will support the bringing forward of realistic and practical solutions. The Pathway Accommodation &amp;amp; Support System (PASS) was extended nationally in 2013 and is now operational nationwide. It will assist housing authorities to report on these indicators and 2014 will be the first year for which PASS will produce composite national data on homelessness. These reports will be published on my Department's website as soon as they are available.   </p><p>  The Homelessness Oversight Group, which I established in 2013 for the purposes of reviewing the progress of the approach being advocated in the statement, identifying obstacles and proposing solutions has submitted its first report to me. The report considered information on the homeless population, emergency and other accommodation as well as housing supply issues. I am considering this report and its recommendations and I will consult with my Government colleagues on the implementation of these recommendations, as appropriate. A copy of this report is available on my Department's website, . </p><p>  The specific information sought on emergency accommodation beds and on persons reporting as homeless for the first time is not available in my Department.  Traditionally it has been difficult to quantify the number of homeless persons on an on-going basis; this is in part a consequence of the volatility within this cohort of housing need.</p><p>  In advance of the composite national data on homelessness to be available through PASS, the most complete set of data available in relation to homelessness nationally is the Central Statistics Office&rsquo;s special Census report, <i>Homeless Persons in Ireland</i>, which was published on 6 September 2012. This report indicated that a total of 64 individuals were sleeping rough on Census night, 10 April 2011, while identifying a further 3,744 people as housed in accommodation defined as emergency, transitional or long-term. Of the total of 3,808 individuals included in the report almost 60% were in long-term or transitional housing arrangements. This report is available on CSO's website, . </p></reply>

The Act provided for a three month transition period on commencement to allow vehicle owners to bring their motor tax status up to date by making both a retrospective and prospective off-road declaration. The new arrangements, only allowing for a future declaration, have been fully in force since 1 October 2013.</p><p>  Monthly income comparisons for July to December 2012 and 2013 are set out below. However, it should be noted that for 2013 income, the impact of the 2013 Act in relation to off-road declarations is only one of a number of factors involved. In particular, the 2013 figures reflect the impact of the increase in rates announced in the December 2012 Budget. In addition, a further issue that has to be factored into the income comparison between 2012 and 2013 is the year-on-year reduction in income arising from the private vehicle fleet due to the switchover from motor tax based on engine capacity to that based on CO<sub>2 </sub> emissions, given that vehicles taxed under the latter regime carry a lower average annual tax. The impact of payment of once-off arrears would also need to be considered.</p><p>  Income in January 2014 was the first month in respect of which the December 2012 Budget increases do not affect a comparison with the corresponding month the previous year. In that regard, income in January 2014 was &euro;114,921,257, an increase of just under 12% on January 2013 income. <table><tr><th>Month </th><th>Motor tax income 2012 (&euro;) </th><th>Motor tax income 2013 (&euro;) </th><th>Difference (&euro;) </th><th>Percentage increase </th></tr><tr><td>July <br /><br /></td><td>92,339,722 </td><td>102,150,278 </td><td>9,810,556 </td><td>10.62 </td></tr><tr><td>August <br /><br /></td><td>84,961,804 </td><td>89,363,654 </td><td>4,401,850 </td><td>5.1 8 </td></tr><tr><td>September <br /><br /></td><td>74,728,486 </td><td>97,517,447 </td><td>22,788,961 </td><td>30.49 </td></tr><tr><td>October <br /><br /></td><td>86,482,093 </td><td>101,287,487 </td><td>14,805,394 </td><td>17. 11 </td></tr><tr><td>November <br /><br /></td><td>75,491,855 </td><td>83,228,548 </td><td>7,736,693 </td><td>10.24 </td></tr><tr><td>December <br /><br /></td><td>77,109,851 </td><td>79,768,667 </td><td>2,658,816 </td><td>3.4 4 </td></tr></table></p><p>  I will be considering, in conjunction with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, measures to evaluate the effectiveness of the new provisions for off road declarations.</p></reply>

By the end of December 2013, of the 4,374 units identified by NAMA as being potentially suitable, some 2,055 units have been confirmed by local authorities as being suitable for social housing.  Completed housing unit transfers stand at 492, with a further 104 units contracted and w ith completion work on-going. This brings the overall total deliv ery of social housing from NAMA- sourced units to 596 units (completed or contracted) since the process began.</p><p>  Units acquired from NAMA are brought into s ocial h ousing using a number of existing delivery mechanisms including the Social Housing Investment Programme, the Capital Acquisition Scheme and the Social Housing Leasing Initiative. These are existing funding mechanisms and my Department does not distinguish the financing of NAMA-s ourced units from other sources of social housing supply.  To the end of December 2013 the Social Housing Leasing Initiative, including NAMA-sourced units, has delivered 4,600 units for social housing use and expended some &euro;66.4m in leasing costs since its introduction in 2009. The current average per-unit cost of Social Housing Leasing Initiative units is just over &euro;502 per month.</p></reply>

In February, 2013, I directed all housing authorities to provide a summary report of their social housing assessments as at 7 May 2013.  This exercise involved each authority reviewing the continuing qualification for social housing support of all households entered on its waiting list and summarising the details of households on the updated waiting list. I published the overall results of the summary in December 2013 and these are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and that of the Housing Agency .     </p><p>  Traditionally, the number of households on local authority waiting lists is collected nationally every 3 years.

Approval was also given for the provision of funding to the local authorities to cover the cost of accommodating HAP recipients, and it was agreed that the Department of Social Protection (DSP) would provide for the implementation of the mandatory direct deduction of rental contributions from the welfare payments of HAP recipients and local authority tenants. My Department and DSP continue to work closely on the legal, policy and operational issues involved in developing and introducing HAP. The completion of the business process design exercise for HAP in 2013 allowed for the General Scheme of a Housing Bill providing for HAP and associated items to be developed. On 17 December 2013, the General Scheme was approved by Government and the Bill is in preparation, as a priority for enactment to facilitate the test phase and implementation of HAP in 2014. </p><p>  HAP is being designed so as to bring all of the social housing services provided by the State together under the local authority system, with local authorities being responsible for all households with an established housing need and ensuring significant efficiencies in the provision of rental assistance. HAP will provide a new framework for the provision of rental assistance, and will, in as much as it can, facilitate the removal of existing barriers to employment by allowing HAP recipients to remain in the scheme if they gain full-time employment.   </p><p>  Under the new scheme applicants will source their own accommodation within the private rented market (as currently happens with rent supplement) and the tenancy agreement will be between the HAP recipient and the private landlord. The local authority will pay the new assistance payment on the tenant&rsquo;s behalf directly to the landlord. The tenant will pay a rental contribution to the local authority based on the differential rent scheme for the relevant local authority. </p><p>  My Department is working closely with all the key stakeholders in overseeing plans for the implementation of HAP, but more specifically at this stage in relation to an early pilot phase and phased roll out of the scheme later in 2014, subject to the enactment of the relevant legislation. Consideration, where possible, will be given to what aspects of the scheme can be progressed under existing mechanisms prior to enactment of the required legislation. Limerick City and County Councils have been identified as lead authority to drive implementation in the local government sector including the delivery of the HAP pilot in Quarter 1 2014.   </p><p>  During implementation, it is envisaged that authorities will initially focus on taking across new applicants, before moving on a progressive basis to dealing with those already in receipt of rent supplement. It is also intended that the test phase will prioritise, as much as possible, the transfer of long-term unemployed rent supplement recipients to HAP. This is a reasonable approach to implementation, which will allow any issues that arise to be dealt with in a graduated way and give local authorities sufficient time to scale up the operation of HAP within their housing sections.</p></reply>

A recent Threshold study suggests that there is particular pressure on rents in the lower segment of the market.   </p><p>  Almost 1 in 5 households in the country are now renting their accommodation in the private sector, the biggest share of the housing market since the 1950s. In recent years improvements have been made in the sector in relation, for example, to security of tenure and resolution of disputes. The Government has also recently approved the drafting of amendments to the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill to establish a deposit protection scheme.   </p><p>  However, it is clearly a cause for concern if affordability issues are emerging in the private rented sector, given its importance in terms of the overall housing mix. I have sought to stimulate a debate on how to bring greater stability to the sector, as it is in the interest of landlords, tenants and society as a whole that we have a stable private rental sector that is sustainable into the long term.  The regulation of rents is a complex area and I am mindful of the need to avoid introducing measures that might have unintended consequences, on supply and affordability.  Nevertheless, I believe there is scope to explore measures that would alleviate short-term difficulties pending a return to equilibrium in the market, and my Department is exploring the possibilities for commissioning policy research in this regard.</p></reply>

Over the 17 years since its inception, BRL has overseen the procurement and implementation of up to 250 individual services and works contracts which have seen the delivery of over 3,000 new homes and key infrastructural development as well as substantial investment in social and economic interventions. As could be expected in a project of this size and complexity, outside consultants were engaged for the various planning, design and research activities. </p><p>  The Masterplan set out an ambition to provide a variety of design responses to address legacy issues resulting from the failed uniform design responses achieved in the Ballymun of the 1960&rsquo;s. In order to sustain this long-established community it was necessary to undertake demolition and rebuilding on a phased basis over an extended timeframe. This required specific design, operational and implementation responses according as the overall project progressed. As part of the original budget approval and in recognition of the scope and extent of the research and design element of the project, involving a range of disciplines including statutory planning, urban design, architecture, engineering, demolition, environmental, social and economic professionals and practitioners, my Department allowed for expenditure of up to 10% of overall project cost in this regard.</p><p>  The detailed information sought in relation to the amounts spent on consultants&rsquo; fees across the full range of disciplines and a breakdown of the amounts recouped by my Department to BRL in respect of each of the contracts procured and implemented is not readily available in my Department and its compilation would involve an inordinate amount of staff time and resources.  A significant element of these data is held by BRL. As the project has now reached substantial completion, I intend to request Dublin City Council to initiate a comprehensive Post Project Review of the overall regeneration project undertaken by BRL, detailing the outputs and costs in respect of the projects delivered, the impact of investment in social and economic regeneration, the lessons learned, how past investment can be protected and the overall sustainability of the regeneration project into the future. I will be happy to make this report available in due course.</p></reply>

The Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) was established under the Act to operate a national tenancy registration system and to resolve disputes between landlords and tenants in this sector.<b></b> Following a review of the Act in 2009, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No 2) Bill 2012 was published in July 2012. The Bill passed Report and Final stages in the D&aacute;il in July 2013 and is currently before the Seanad.</p><p>  Section 134 of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 provides that landlords must register each tenancy of a dwelling. The current registration fee for each tenancy is &euro;90 and each tenancy must be registered within 1 month from the date of commencement of that tenancy.  Where a landlord does not register the tenancy within that 1 month period, section 136(7) of the 2004 Act provides that the fee for a late application is double the registration fee.</p><p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill 2012 seeks to amend section 137 of the 2004 Act to provide for penalties for late registration on an ascending scale. The purpose of this amendment is both to incentivise early registration and to make the system fairer since under the current provision a landlord who registers a tenancy a year late is subject to the same penalty as a landlord who registers a tenancy a day late. The proposed amendment provides that the late fee will be an additional &euro;20 for each month that the landlord is late registering the tenancy. I intend to propose for a cap on the total late fee that may be charged at Committee stage in the Seanad.</p></reply>

For the most part, this represents a cashless system with the State assuming responsibility for providing suitable accommodation for asylum seekers on a full board basis. RIA currently provides full board accommodation and ancillary services to 4,376 persons in 34 centres across the State.</p><p>  In relation to queries such as these, it is important to state that RIA is keen to provide as much detail as is practicable on the system which it is charged with operating.  Extensive statistical information is on its website - www.ria.gov.ie - including, on a monthly basis, details of the number of persons residing in each direct provision centre. The December 2013 monthly report has just been published on the website. </p><p>  RIA also publishes its Annual Reports on the website, covering the years from 2007 to 2012 inclusive. They provide a variety of additional information, including a breakdown of the adults and children in each direct provision centre and the length of time persons, overall, have been residing in the direct provision system.  The 2013 Annual Report is currently being compiled and will be published before the end of March, 2014. </p><p>  In advance of the 2013 Report being published, RIA has published on its website preliminary statistics showing, inter alia, the length of time spent overall in the Direct Provision system by residents as at 31 December, 2013.  This, along with the published monthly statistics, provides most of the information sought in these questions. As things stand, RIA does not publish statistics on the length of time spent by persons in individual centres or in three monthly increments. That level of detail would be considered unnecessary as residents are not allocated to or between centres based on time spent in the system. Therefore, it is statistically likely that the overall breakdown shown in the annual and monthly reports would apply broadly to residents in each centre.  Nonetheless, the provision of the additional statistics sought in these questions will be considered in the context of the 2013 Report currently being compiled.</p><p>  RIA itself has no function in determining whether someone should stay or not in its accommodation. Its function is to provide accommodation and ancillary services to those who have sought international protection and who otherwise have no means of supporting themselves.</p><p>  I have no desire to have applicants remain in the system any longer than the minimum period it takes to process their case.  However, ultimately a balance has to be struck between maintaining the integrity of the State&rsquo;s protection and immigration systems and the case put forward by the individual applicant all of which must be considered within the legal requirements and obligations. In the first instance requirements are set-down in primary and secondary legislation and these requirements are constantly evolving taking into account interpretation of the law by the Courts at both national and EU level.   </p><p>  I acknowledge that the length of time that residents spend in Direct Provision is an issue to be addressed. An amended Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I will introduce should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements for asylum, subsidiary protection and leave to remain applications.  It will do this by making provision for the establishment of a single application procedure, so that applicants can be provided with a final decision on all aspects of their protection application in a more straight forward and timely fashion. </p><p>  Pending the enactment and commencement of the new legislation and with a view to improving processing,  I recently signed into law a Statutory Instrument to introduce new procedures for the processing of subsidiary protection applications by the Offices of the Refugee Applications Commissioner at first instance and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p></reply>

The Firearms Range Inspector must first certify that the range complies with the relevant legislation.  Statutory Instrument No. 622 of 2011 Firearms (Authorisation of Rifle or Pistol Shooting Ranges) Regulations 2011 was introduced in 2011 following a study of best international practice for target shooting range construction.  The instrument specifies the minimum standards for the design, construction and maintenance of target shooting ranges.

While there was a 10% drop in demand at the general law centres in 2012 compared to 2011, nevertheless the demand for general legal services (excluding asylum) in 2011 was 93% greater than it was in 2006. Demand in 2013 was similar to what it was in 2012. The Board has not been subject to the sort of cuts to its grant-in-aid that other public service bodies have had to experience and I have been able to maintain the Board&rsquo;s grant-in-aid at the same level for 2014 as it was in the previous three years.</p><p>  Nevertheless it is a challenging environment that has resulted in lengthened waiting times for those seeking legal services for matters that are not prioritised. I know that waiting times are a matter of constant concern to the Board and that it keeps them under very active review. I am also aware that the Board is constantly keeping the delivery of its services under review with a view to getting legal services to those most in need of them as quickly as possible.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the pressures on resources, the Government has further supported the Board by approving exemptions from the moratorium to enable the organisation to recruit front-line staff for direct service delivery. The Public Appointments Service concluded a solicitor recruitment competition for the Board last year from which a number of permanent appointments have been made and a number of temporary positions have also been filled.</p><p>  In September 2013 I signed into law by way of Regulations, a package of proposals from the Board for the revision of the financial eligibility and contributions provisions governing the granting of civil legal aid. The Regulations include a reduction in the capital eligibility threshold for legal services and they also include increases in the contributions payable by most persons seeking legal services. These provisions should have some impact, albeit relatively marginal, on the resources available to the Board.</p><p>  In response to the changed environment the Board has taken steps to try and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of its legal services. Those steps include the following:</p><p> - The Board has been piloting a &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach to service delivery and this approach is operative in most of its centres at this stage. The pilot is in response to lengthening waiting times. The aim of the &lsquo;triage&rsquo; approach is that every applicant gets to see a solicitor within a period of one month for the purpose of getting legal advice (consultations are broadly limited to 45 minutes). If the applicant requires further services they remain on the 'waiting list'. There is or has been a 'backlog' of applicants to be seen for triage purposes hence it is taking time to reduce the waiting time for such an appointment to one month. You will find as an appendix to this response, the waiting times in the various law centres for matters that are not prioritised. Where the triage approach is operative there is a waiting time for the triage appointment and a waiting time for the second consultation. A first review of the operation of the pilot indicated that clients were satisfied with this particular service initiative. This was because they got early access to a solicitor for advice on their legal disputes that provided clarity about the options open to them and the process through which their disputes might be resolved.</p><p> - In August 2012 the Board introduced a new case management system in its law centres. This is a &lsquo;start to end&rsquo; system which will in the medium term deliver efficiencies in terms of the administration aspect as well as in relation to the delivery of the legal services. It will take time for the full benefits of this system to materialise;</p><p> - In November 2011 I transferred responsibility for the management and administration of the State funded family mediation service to the Board. A key reason for this transferring was to improve the synergies between the State funded family mediation services and the State funded civil legal aid services (most of the demand for legal services is in the area of family law). Improving the synergies will be for the benefit of the customer and will help move away from a &lsquo;litigation first&rsquo; approach that may on occasion be too common. Already there are very positive signs from a pilot initiative operating in Dolphin House (where the Dublin District Family Court sits) involving the co-location of the courts and a mediation service with a legal service located there also. Similar initiatives have now been introduced in Cork and Naas and are being evaluated.

This new legislation will update and strengthen the system of granting legal aid including transferring responsibility for the administration of the Scheme to the Legal Aid Board.  Consideration is being given to including in the Bill provisions to, inter alia, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  Provision to give power to the Legal Aid Board to recover the costs of criminal legal aid or to make application to a court to revoke a criminal legal aid certificate are also under consideration.  These provisions must have regard to a person's rights to the presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to be given legal aid where appropriate.</p><p>  The present legislation, the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962, provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that his/her means are insufficient to enable him/her to pay for legal representation him/herself.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the &quot;gravity of the charge&quot; or &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;, it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary. </p><p>  Under the Constitution, the State is obliged to provide an accused person with the means to obtain appropriate legal representation.  Moreover, the European Convention on Human Rights provides that every person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to defend him/herself in person or through legal assistance of his/her own choosing or, if he/she has insufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require.  The Deputy will also appreciate that the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme must operate with due regard to these rights and that any unreasonable block on legal aid could give a convicted defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p></reply>

I have received a further report from the Garda authorities on this matter and the Garda  approach and that being adopted under the UK initiative referred to by the Deputy include many common features. These include high visibility patrols, surveillance, intelligence led operations and bicycle registration initiatives.</p><p>  The Garda approach includes identifying areas of high volume theft of bicycles so that a targeted operational approach is taken to prevent and detect such crimes. Garda&iacute; in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) engage in high visibility patrols and conduct surveillance in identified hotspots.  Mountain Bike patrols are utilised in the vicinity of schools and other vulnerable areas.  I am advised that one such targeted operation, Operation Spoke, has led to the arrest of seven suspects and the recovery of over forty bicycles.  Garda&iacute; are also involved in initiatives to divert individuals involved in this type of crime including an initiative between Garda&iacute; at the Bridewell Garda Station and the M.O.S.T project, a Youth Diversion Programme aimed at individuals who had come to the attention of Garda&iacute; for their involvement in bicycle theft. This project is set to continue through 2014 and will now be run as a joint project between Garda&iacute;, the M.O.S.T project and a local bicycle retailer.</p><p>  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na also provide crime prevention advice to members of the public and focused presentations are made to Neighbourhood Watch Schemes, policing fora, primary and secondary schools and local office complexes, and consultation also takes place with apartment management companies.  Further analysis is being conducted in relation to areas particularly affected by bicycle theft to help enhance crime prevention measures and the tracking of stolen bicycles. </p><p>  Specially designed information leaflets with crime prevention information have been distributed through bicycle advisory checkpoints and the use of a bicycle sticker campaign in areas where bicycles are locked. In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are engaging with bicycle retailers to encourage and promote Bicycle Registration Schemes.</p></reply>

Payments made to the court poor box are accounted for by the court office concerned and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

its meeting today, the Government approved the drafting of the Criminal Justice (Community Sanctions) Bill, which will replace the Probation of Offenders Act 1907 with modern provisions dealing with community sanctions and the role of the Probation Service in the criminal justice system.  It is intended that the legislation will provide for a statutory Reparation Fund to replace the Court Poor Box, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission in its 2005 report <i>The Court Poor Box: Probation of Offenders</i>. The details of the proposed Bill will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

The detention of a person cannot exceed eight weeks in aggregate in accordance with the provisions of Section 5(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 2003 which states &ldquo;<i>A person arrested and detained under this section may, subject to subsection (4), be detained only until such time (being as soon as practicable) as he or she is removed from the State in accordance with this section but, in any event, may not be detained for a period exceeding 8 weeks in aggregate&rdquo;.</i></p><p><i></i>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to nationality and all of the locations to which a person refused leave to land was returned is not readily available. In that respect it should be noted that persons arriving into the State from a certain destination may not necessarily be returned to that destination but sent back directly to their country of origin or returned via a hub airport to their point of embarkation.</p><p>  I can however inform the Deputy that in respect of persons refused leave to land arriving from the locations mentioned the position is the following. In 2012, 117 non-EEA nationals who had arrived from Istanbul, Turkey were refused leave to land 25 of whom were subsequently permitted to enter the State having made an asylum application pursuant to the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended)), 58 non-EEA nationals who had arrived from Dubai, United Arab Emirates were refused leave to land (9 of whom were subsequently permitted to enter the State having made an asylum application), and 123 non-EEA nationals, who had arrived from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, were refused leave to land (21 of whom were subsequently permitted to enter the State having made an asylum application). In 2013, the equivalent figures for persons refused leave to land arriving from Ankara, Dubai and Abu Dhabi were 142, 52 and 167 respectively, of which 37, 5 and 46 persons were subsequently permitted to enter the State having made an application for asylum.</p></reply>

These procedures relate to record-keeping, staff training and the maintenance of appropriate procedures and controls pertaining to the obligations imposed by the Directive.</p><p>  Section 42 of the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 2013 provides that &quot;a designated person who knows, suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect, on the basis of information obtained in the course of carrying on business as a designated person, that another person has been or is engaged in an offence of money laundering or terrorist financing shall report to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Revenue Commissioners that knowledge or suspicion or those reasonable grounds&quot;.  Furthermore, Section 42(7) of the CJA 2010 specifically provides that a Payment Institution may not execute a suspicious transaction prior to sending a report to the Garda unless it is not  practicable to delay or stop the transaction or the Payment Institution is of the reasonable opinion that failure to proceed with the transaction may result in the other person suspecting that a report will or has been made or that an investigation may be commenced or that it is in the course of being conducted.   </p><p>  While Section 25 of the Act provides that any person or business trading that accepts cash payments for goods in the normal course of business of at least &euro;15,000 (whether in one transaction or in a series of transactions that are or appear to be linked to each other) may be considered to be a &quot;designated person&quot;  and subject to the requirements of the Act, there are no specific provisions in relation to the value of banking transactions. </p><p>  My Department has published Guidelines on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing on the application of the 2010 Act.  The guidelines are designed to guide designated persons on the application of the relevant provisions of the Act.  The Guidelines are available on my Department's website at .</p></reply>

As no response was received to letters issued in 2003, 2004 and 2005 the application was deemed inactive and the case was closed.

The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law. Section 15A provides that the Minister may waive certain conditions for naturalisation if satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.</p><p>  Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons. </p><p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

As part of this Plan, each Friday and Saturday a dedicated Public Order Van is deployed from 11am to 4am.  In addition to routine plain clothes patrols, dedicated plain clothes foot patrols are assigned to the Temple Bar area and adjoining streets each Friday and Saturday night under Operation Aughrim.  Ongoing consultation is maintained with the Temple Bar Traders association and Dublin Business Improvement District (BID).</p><p>  More generally, local Garda management engage on an ongoing basis with a wide range of local businesses, community groups and other organisations with a view to addressing the many issues associated with policing a busy city centre with a vibrant night time economy.  In particular, the Garda authorities participated in the multi-stakeholder Strategic Response Group (SRG) which published the report &lsquo;A Better City for all&rsquo; in June 2012.  This Group set out a partnership approach to manage the provision of drug related services, and to address public substance misuse and associated anti-social behaviour in Dublin&rsquo;s city centre, including through the use of 'Good Neighbour' policies on the part of the clinics in question.  The Deputy will appreciate, of course that the development of drug treatment services in the Dublin area would primarily be a matter for my colleague, Alex White TD, Minister for State at the Department of Health, and for the Health Service Executive.</p></reply>

This Government has consistently taken the line that repossession of a home should only be considered as a last resort when all other sustainable options have been fully considered but are not considered viable having regard to all circumstances of the case.  To that end, the Government has introduced a comprehensive framework to tackle the mortgage arrears problem.  </p><p>  Lending institutions are working with borrowers in arrears to meet targets set by the Central Bank which will see the majority of them being offered sustainable solutions by the end of this year.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) contains a structured framework which lenders must follow when dealing with mortgage arrears. </p><p>  The reform of the personal insolvency legislation, which I piloted through the Oireachtas will see a range of alternative solutions being availed of by borrowers where their debt situation is not sustainable. The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 has modernised the State&rsquo;s insolvency laws and has put in place new mechanisms to resolve personal debt problems. It has also established the Insolvency Service of Ireland.</p><p>  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 provides that  applications for the repossession of private residences, irrespective of whether the mortgage was created before or after 1 December 2009, may be adjourned to allow the parties to explore the possibility of applying for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the 2012 Act as an alternative to repossession.   </p><p>  The Personal Insolvency Act 2012 required the Insolvency Service of Ireland (ISI) to prepare and publish guidelines as to what constitutes a reasonable standard of living and reasonable living expenses.  Initial guidelines were published as part of the launch of the ISI&rsquo;s information campaign in April 2013 and in June 2013 the ISI published an updated guide to reflect adjustments for inflation and so ensure that practitioners would be using the most up-to-date information available.</p><p>  Under the model developed by the ISI, reasonable living expenses are the expenses a person necessarily incurs in achieving a reasonable standard of living, this being one which meets a person&rsquo;s physical, psychological and social needs.  Reasonable living expenses vary depending on a number of factors such as the particular composition of a household and the need for a car.  Beyond that, when determining reasonable living expenses, provision is made for reasonable housing costs in terms of rent or mortgage payments as well as for reasonable payments in respect of childcare where this expense arises.  </p><p>  In addition, the guidelines make allowance for a debtor to specify reasonable costs which arise as a consequence of ill-health or disability or other special circumstances. (In this regard, third level education fees for children are not specifically excluded when determining reasonable living expenses). Page 13 of the June 2013 ISI guidelines makes explicit that this category of special circumstances may also be used where a debtor has persons other than his or her minor children financially dependent on him or her such as where the debtor is contributing financially to the care of an adult dependent such as, for example, a college-going child.  Those guidelines are available to view on the ISI&rsquo;s website www.isi.gov.ie.</p><p>  On the matter of legal aid, the Legal Aid Board provides advice and representation in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  Persons who have mortgage problems are entitled to apply at any of the Board's law centres to get legal advice.  In relation to the provision of representation before the Court, the Board applies the &quot;merits&quot; criteria that are set out in the legislation to any application for representation.  If the Board takes the view that there is no legal defence to the lending institution's application for repossession it must refuse the application for representation.  The Board may however grant representation if it considers that there is a defence to the lending institution's claim.</p><p>  Finally, I should emphasise that co-operating borrowers have nothing to fear from engaging with the lending institutions to find solutions to their difficulties, with some 79,000 mortgage holders having had their mortgages restructured as of November 2013.  Advice on dealing with mortgage arrears is available independently of the lending institutions, through the Citizens Information Board help line and website (www.keepingyourhome.ie).</p></reply>

This inspection recorded breaches under the Nitrates Regulations relating to the failure to minimise the creation of soiled water, the inadequate collection of manure and structural defects in storage facilities for livestock manure. This resulted in a penalty of 20% being determined. However, as similar breaches had been identified at a previous inspection on this holding in 2011 the rules governing repetition applied resulting in a final penalty of 60% being applied against the 2013 Direct Payments.  The person named was recently notified of this decision. The person named was also informed of the right to seek a review of this decision. In the event that the person named is dissatisfied with the outcome of any such review, the decision can be appealed to the independent Agriculture Appeals Office within 3 months.</p></reply>

My Department is constrained by European law from issuing or renewing aquaculture licences for sites located within Natura 2000 areas (areas protected under the EU Birds/Habitats Directives) until such time as an &lsquo;Appropriate Assessment&rsquo; has been conducted to assess the potential of the proposed aquaculture activities on the conservation objectives for that Natura site.  The licensing process must take full account of the outcome of that assessment in reaching a determination on any particular licence application.  Aquaculture operations that are covered by section 19A (4) of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 may continue to operate. This allows aquaculturists who have submitted valid renewal applications to continue aquaculture activities, subject to the terms and conditions of the old licence, pending a decision on the renewal application.</p><p>  My Department has been working closely with the Marine Institute, BIM, and NPWS to achieve full compliance with the Birds and Habitats Directives through a multi-annual work programme.</p><p>  This work programme entails the collection of necessary benthic, ornithological and other data in relevant marine Natura sites, the development of conservation objectives in those sites, the completion of Appropriate Assessments and the establishment of fisheries Natura plans and other arrangements so as to enable a progressive role out of consent determinations in line with the Natura obligations once all the requested pre-conditions are met.  This process has begun to achieve meaningful results. Conservation Objectives have been set in respect of a significant number of bays, including Kenmare Bay. Appropriate Assessments have been completed in respect of a number of bays and it is anticipated that the Appropriate Assessment for Kenmare Bay will be completed this year.  The completion of the Appropriate Assessment will enable my Department to move immediately on the licensing aspects.</p><p>  To date sea fishing activities in Kenmare Bay have not been subject to restrictions by my Department as a result of the EU Habitats Directive.  However, the Directive also contains obligations to take steps to avoid significant deterioration of habitats and disturbance of species.  In that context, the multi-annual work programme also includes an assessment project which is currently underway to profile the risks which may be posed by sea-fishing to protected species and habitats.  I understand that the risk assessment report from this work will be available in the spring.  Where risks require mitigation, my Department will be obliged to develop measures which respond to the risk posed.  On this aspect, efforts will be made to involve representatives of the fishing industry in this process.</p></reply>

The &lsquo;Partial Convergence&rsquo; model, while initially retaining the link with current payments under the Single Payment Scheme, gradually moves all farmers towards a national average value over the five years of the new scheme. The purpose of this model is to achieve a phased redistribution of payments between those who currently hold high value entitlements and those who hold low value entitlements. </p><p>  All farmers are guaranteed that by 2019 the value of their entitlements will at a minimum reach 60% of the national average entitlement value.  In addition, while the present Grassland Sheep Scheme will come to an end, I have decided to incorporate the value of those payments into the calculation of entitlement value in 2015 for those farmers who received that payment. As with convergence, this provision will be to the advantage of mountain farmers many of whom specialise in sheep farming. They will in effect continue to benefit from the value of those payments. </p><p>  Under the proposed new rural development programme for the period 2014 &ndash; 20120 [RDP] there are a range of support measures being considered. As part of this process my Department has published a consultation document outlining proposed measures for inclusion in the new RDP. </p><p>  Under the new RDP the main areas proposed for support are:</p><p>  - a substantial new agri-environment/climate scheme (GLAS), which will build on the progress made under REPS and AEOS. This will provide for a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 for up to 50,000 farmers, and a further payment of up to &euro;2,000 for a limited number of farmers who take on particularly challenging actions, </p><p>  - continued strong support for disadvantaged areas (now Areas of Natural Constraint), to the tune of about &euro;195 million per year, </p><p>  - incentives for on-farm capital investment, </p><p>  - knowledge transfer and innovation measures, aimed at underpinning farm viability, sustainability and growth through the adoption of best practice and innovative solutions,  </p><p>  - a new beef data and genomics measure worth up to &euro;52 million per year aimed at improving the genetic quality of the beef herd, </p><p>  - a separate strand of the support for on-farm capital investment will be ring-fenced for young farmers at a higher rate of aid intensity of 60% and</p><p>  - other supports aimed at collaborative farming, artisan producers, organic farming etc.</p><p>  The proposed measure outlines are available on my Department&rsquo;s website and will form the basis for a public consultation. Written submissions are being sought by the deadline of the 19 February 2014. This consultation process will be a key step in designing a draft RDP for submission to the EU Commission for their approval. </p></reply>

New entitlements will be allocated in 2015 using the &lsquo;2014 value&rsquo; as the point of reference for the calculation.  As the Company named received the direct payment under the 2013 scheme year, the Company holds the &lsquo;allocation right&rsquo; whereby it will be allocated entitlements under the new Basic Payment Scheme in 2015. The Company also holds the &lsquo;land reference&rsquo; in that it declared land in 2013 and will presumably also declare the land in 2015. </p><p>  The issue relates to whether the persons named or the Company named controls the &lsquo;2014 value&rsquo; of the leased entitlements. The status of leased entitlements and the issue of whether the lessor or the lessee controls the value of such entitlements remains the subject of negotiation at EU level. If it transpires that the company controls the value, then no further action will be required and the entitlements will be established in the name of the Company. If however the persons named control the value of the leased entitlements, then they will need to transfer that value to the company. It may be necessary for the leased entitlements to be transferred to the Company by way of a permanent transfer under the 2014 scheme year. However, depending on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations, there may an option for the persons named to continue the existing lease by way of a private contract clause.

The Company also holds the &lsquo;land reference&rsquo; in that it declared land in 2013 and will presumably also declare the land in 2015.</p><p>  The issue therefore relates to whether the person named or the Company named controls the &lsquo;value&rsquo; of the leased entitlements. The status of leased entitlements and the issue of whether the lessor or the lessee controls the value of such entitlements remains the subject of negotiation at EU level. If it transpires that the &lsquo;lessee&rsquo; controls the value, then no further action will be required and the entitlements will be established in the name of the Company. If however the person named controls the value, then he will need to transfer that value to the company. This will be accomplished either by a permanent transfer under the 2014 scheme or, depending on the outcome of the negotiations, by a private contract clause in 2015. Whatever the mechanism used, it is important that the value of the leased entitlements be available to the Company for the calculation of new entitlements in 2015.</p><p>  The person concerned may wish to contact the newly established 2015 Direct Payments Information Centre at 0761 064438 or  to discuss his circumstances in more detail. </p></reply>

I understand that in the Direct Provision system, children are protected in a number of ways - primarily through RIA's child protection policy; its house rules; its requirements that all centre staff are Garda vetted.</p><p>  There is a specific unit within RIA - the Child and Family Services Unit- whose role is to manage, deliver, co-ordinate, monitor and plan matters relating to child and family services for all asylum seekers residing in the direct provision system.  This Unit also links, where necessary, directly with an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am advised that Direct Provision Centres are monitored three times a year, twice by the Department of Justice staff and once by an external company.</p><p>  My Department is taking a lead role in the cross-sectoral implementation of Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children [2011]. A Children First Implementation Inter-Departmental Group has been established involving all of the key Government Departments, including the Department of Justice and Equality, the Child and Family Agency, the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure a consistent approach is adopted. The Group is also a forum where members can raise child protection issues of general concern, or with a cross departmental or cross sectoral dimension.  </p><p>  In July 2013 the Government approved the publication of Departmental Children First Sectoral Implementation Plans on the DCYA website. These Implementation Plans are high level documents setting out implementation requirements for each parent Department and for agencies under its aegis which have contact with children and young people.  The Plans set out the mechanisms in place, or to be put in place, to support the continued implementation of Children First Guidance at sectoral level. They are for a period of one year, at which time they will be reviewed.</p><p>  The next phase of the Interdepartmental Group&rsquo;s work will focus on quality assurance mechanisms in relation to implementation and compliance, and the necessary preparations required for the forthcoming legislation putting elements of Children First on a statutory basis.</p><p>  As regards the legislation, in July 2013, the Government approved the revised Heads and General Scheme of the Children First Bill, which will put elements of the Children First National Guidance on a statutory footing. Officials from my Department are continuing to liaise with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in relation to the drafting of the Bill, which is now at an advanced stage. It is anticipated that the draft Bill will be published in this D&aacute;il session.</p><p>  There has been correspondence between my Department and the CEO of the Child and Family Agency on direct provision, and this issue will be kept under review in the context of my overarching responsibility for child protection generally. </p></reply>

It comprises &euro;250,000 for play and recreation initiatives and &euro;500,000 for staff-led youth projects under the various schemes funded by Youth Affairs Unit of my Department. Details of the youth projects capital scheme, including the application process, are being finalised at present. Pobal will assist my Department with the application and appraisal process. Detailed information and guidelines for applying for the funding will be available in the second quarter of 2014. </p><p>  With regard to youth service provision in Co. Meath, an amount of &euro;89,625 was provided to the Meath Youth Together Project in 2013 under the Special Projects for Youth Scheme. Some &euro;46,200 was provided to the Co. Meath area under my Department&rsquo;s 2013 Local Youth Club Grants Scheme. Details of the 2014 allocations under these schemes are being finalised at present and youth services will be advised of their 2014 allocations in the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 all recognised schools are obliged to submit an Annual Attendance Report on the levels of school attendance each year. The latest available national data was published in a report entitled  &quot;Analysis of School Attendance Data in Primary and Post-primary Schools, 2010/2011&quot;. This report is available on the website of the Child and Family Agency at and will provide the Deputy with information on the numbers of children in full-time education in the recognised school sector.</p><p>  The Agency has a statutory remit to maintain a register of children in receipt of education in places other than recognised schools. In 2012, a total of 810 children were registered as home-educated, in addition to the 8,290 children registered as attending schools which are not recognised under the Education Act, 1998. </p><p>  A report on &ldquo;Retention Rates for Pupils in Second Level Schools - 2007 Entry Cohort&rdquo; was published last week by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills. This report provides a detailed analysis of the records held by the Department of Education and Skills for the cohort of entrants to the first year of the Junior Cycle in 2007. The report showed that of the 2007 entry cohort, 96.93% sat the Junior Certificate Exams in 2010 or 2011 and 90.13% sat the Leaving Certificate Exams in 2012 or 2013. This report is available in full on the website of the Department of Education and Skills www.education.ie.</p><p>  The Minister for Education and Skills has responsibility for the Home Tuition Scheme.  Officials within his Department have advised that the information on home tuition is not readily available in the format sought but will be compiled and forwarded directly to the Deputy as soon as it is available.</p></reply>

I am advised by the CFA that a decision to place a child in private residential care is taken having undergone a rigorous protocol.  This protocol is chaired by the regional specialist for children and family services and a panel assists that consists of colleagues from an area other than the one requesting the placement.  Recommendations are made that are submitted for approval by the Regional Director for Children and Family Services. </p><p>  While the average cost in March 2013 was &euro;5,000, this varied from &euro;3,585 to &euro;8,000 per week.  The CFA has liaised with the various private providers and put measures in place to ensure that the cost of a private residential placement does not exceed &euro;5,000 per week.  However, this upper limit may be exceeded in a small number of cases in order to provide the intensive supports and therapeutic interventions needed for some children with highly complex needs.  The duration of placement varies depending on the needs of the individual child.  All placements are supervised and reviewed regularly by the placing social worker and local area management.</p><p>  All the private residential centres are registered and inspected by the Registration and Inspection Service of the CFA.  In addition the CFA monitoring officers monitor the placements on an ongoing basis by visiting the centres, reviewing records, talking to the children, staff and social workers and through observation.</p></reply>

A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of childcare tax relief.  For example, this approach would not support parents working in the home and could therefore, as opposed to the targeted approach, be seen by some as discriminatory.  Also these reliefs would favour the better paid and those on the minimum wage or in part time work or student parents would not be in a position to benefit to the same extent as higher income families.  Many parents use childminders or relatives to meet their childcare needs and might not be in a position to obtain receipts making it impossible for them to establish their entitlement to such benefit.</p><p>  I am very much aware of the relatively high cost of childcare in this country and of the difficulties that this presents, particularly where both parents are in employment outside of the home. To help address the issue, funding of &euro;260 million is provided annually by my Department to support a number of targeted childcare support programmes that assist parents in accessing quality and affordable childcare.</p><p>  For example, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community-based childcare services to enable them to provide childcare at reduced rates to parents in receipt of social welfare payments or parents in employment who are on low or relatively modest incomes. My Department also implements the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme which provides one free pre-school year to all eligible children before they commence primary school. </p><p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that a review of the childcare support programmes will be undertaken by my Department in the coming year with a view to identifying areas where they could be enhanced and improved to ensure the best use of the investment which is currently being made in this area.  All proposals relating to childcare supports will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

The complement was determined following a detailed census and re-classification process undertaken in 2013, through which social workers were formally assigned to particular care groups, including children and families. This work was necessary in order to prepare for the establishment of the new Agency and to allow for the transfer of designated staff.</p><p>  Staffing vacancies arise for various reasons including retirements, resignations, career breaks and unpaid leave.  In addition, gaps in service cover arise where staff are on paid leave.  Social work staffing levels across the whole country are at 93% according to the CFA. This reduces to 84.3% when maternity leave is included.  Vacancies are covered by temporary staff as required to ensure staffing levels do not fall to an unsafe level.  This is risk assessed by Area Managers. </p><p>  Over the past 18 months a total of 138 social work posts have been filled. In addition to this, there are a further 196 posts in the process of being recruited.</p><p>  - 23 of these have been offered and accepted positions and starting dates are being agreed;</p><p>  - 6 offers have been made and are awaiting a response; and</p><p>  - the remaining 167 posts have been approved to be filled.  A recruitment campaign is already underway for 32 of these posts and a further campaign for the remaining 135 is expected to start shortly.</p><p>  Budget 2014 included the provision of &euro;6.7m (&euro;12m in a full year) to support the continuing implementation of the reform programme across children and family services.  This additional funding will assist the CFA in meeting identified service pressures.  This will include the filling of social work vacancies taking account of identified need, with a particular focus this year on the filling of vacancies arising from maternity leave. The Agency is also finalising proposals, arising from the provision of this additional funding, for the introduction of a guaranteed and protected one year induction programme for newly qualified social workers.  The scheme will include protected workload and weekly tutorial/mentoring provision. </p><p>  The initiatives described above will assist the CFA in responding to particular service pressures arising over the course of the year and allow for a targeted response to such pressures taking account of identified need and service priorities.  The additional information requested by the Deputy on a county by county basis in respect of social workers (numbers employed, number of vacant posts, those on long term sick leave and those replaced by a temporary worker) has been requested from the Child and Family Agency and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p></reply>

Overall policy responsibility for domestic, sexual and gender based violence rests with my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  Due to the complex nature of the issues involved in this area, and the need for a co-ordinated and effective response to the issues involved, Cosc<b></b>(the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence) was established as an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality in 2007. Cosc formulated a comprehensive cross-Government strategy, which combines the efforts of a very broad range of organisations and individuals, to combat all forms of domestic, sexual and gender based violence.  This strategy runs to 2014.  Cosc are currently in the process of preparing a new cross-sectoral Strategy. </p><p>  An analysis of expenditure indicates that in 2013 the HSE spent approximately &euro;17.360m on the provision of domestic and sexual violence services. This included the funding of 60 services throughout the country:</p><p>  - 20 Crisis Refuges &ndash; almost &euro;10m</p><p>  - 16 Rape Crisis Centres &ndash; over &euro;4m</p><p>  - 24 Support Services &ndash; almost &euro;3.5m</p><p>  Funding is ring fenced for the provision of frontline services in this area.</p><p>  The Rape Crisis Network of Ireland (RCNI) had a two year contract with the HSE which was due to finish on 31st December, 2013. This contract was extended to 31st March, 2014 to allow for the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the appointment of a Programme Manager for Domestic, Sexual and Gender based Violence and to enable the Agency to tender for future support services.  The Programme Manager is due to take up the position this week and will work with the Head of procurement in the Agency to develop the tender process.  It will be open to all qualified providers, including the RCNI, to tender to the Child and Family Agency for this new contract.</p></reply>

However, as the Deputy will also be aware, Government approval was received on 19 November 2013 for the publication of the General Scheme of the Bill and to proceed with the drafting of the legislation based on this General Scheme. </p><p>  There is a wealth of evidence on the effects of tobacco packaging in general and on perceptions and reactions to standardised packaging which supports the introduction of the measure.

Under the Health Act 2008, automatic entitlement to a medical card for persons aged 70 and over ended on 31 December 2008.  Under the arrangements effected by the Act, a revised system of assessment for eligibility was introduced for those 70 years of age and over, based on the significantly higher gross income limits rather than the standard net income thresholds. This advantageous arrangement for persons aged over 70 years has facilitated a much greater share of this cohort qualifying for a medical card compared to the general population as a whole.</p><p>  In the main, persons in the over-70s age cohort do not have the same outlays and expenses as those under 70 years of age who are assessed on a means basis. Under the standard  means tested medical card scheme, allowance may be made for rent/mortgage, travel to work and child care costs.  Generally, for the over 70s, mortgages have been cleared, children have been catered for and they would not have travel to work related costs. </p><p>  However, persons aged 70 or older who are assessed as ineligible under the gross income thresholds may also have their eligibility assessed under the means tested medical card scheme where they face particularly high expenses, e.g., nursing home or medication costs.

As e-cigarettes do not contain tobacco they are currently not regulated under our tobacco legislation.</p><p>  In order to harmonise the way EU Member States regulate e-cigarettes, the new Tobacco Products Directive being developed by the European Commission will, inter alia, provide for the regulation of e-cigarettes.  It is anticipated that the Directive will be adopted formally by Council later this year following a vote in the European Parliament.  Member States will have two years to transpose the Directive.</p><p>  The Tobacco Directive will set mandatory safety and quality requirements e.g. nicotine content, ingredients and devices, as well as refill mechanisms etc. for e-cigarettes that do not fall under the definition of medicinal products of Directive 2001/83/EC.  The new Directive will make health warnings and information leaflets obligatory, introduce notification requirements for manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes, impose stricter rules on advertising and monitoring of market developments.  The Directive will also enable Member States and the European Commission to react in the case of any identified  health concerns related to these products.</p><p><b><i>  Tobacco Free Ireland</i></b><i>,</i> Ireland&rsquo;s tobacco control policy, states that the general consensus at European level is that there is a lack of research in relation to the long term health effects of e-cigarettes and a lack of sufficient evidence that they aid with smoking cessation.  In light of the above and in view of the emerging evidence base around e-cigarettes, I have asked my Department to review the evidence on the potential harm and the potential benefits of e-cigarettes before deciding the best approach to their wider regulation.</p></reply>

However, it was clear from the outset that the purchase of Mount Carmel as a stand-alone maternity hospital, or as a maternity unit in a non-acute setting, would not be in line with current Government policy.  Government policy on maternity services is based on the premise that for optimal clinical outcomes, maternity services should be co-located with adult acute services, or in the case of neonatology and foetal medicine, tri-located with adult and paediatric services.  The low volume of births in the hospital was also an issue, as best practise and the development of excellence in patient care and safety is predicated on high volume of patient throughput, in accordance with international norms.</p><p>  In addition, as my Department is currently developing a new National Maternity Strategy, I believe that it would be premature at this stage, in advance of considerations regarding the future models of maternity service provision, to make any decisions in relation to securing additional maternity service capacity in any part of the country.</p><p>  In terms of the capacity of the HSE to deal with the additional service demands on the closure of the hospital, the Deputy may wish to note that birth rates have fallen significantly in recent years and the CSO projects that birth rates will continue to fall at least until the early 2020s.  In the longer term, the move of the National Maternity Hospital from Holles Street to the St Vincent&rsquo;s campus together with the development of the new maternity hospital tri-located on the St James&rsquo;s campus, will afford us the opportunity to provide additional maternity services capacity, if required.</p></reply>

The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.  However, the HSE can make staff appointments to critical front line posts where it is necessary to do so to support essential service delivery.  Frontline vacancies that could be suitable for many of the Mount Carmel staff, including consultant, nursing and midwifery posts continue to be filled by the HSE.  I would hope that it will be possible for many of the staff who provided care in Mount Carmel to obtain posts within the public system in the coming months.</p></reply>

In compliance with the HSE's guidance on patient confidentiality and data protection, the release of statistical information is based on a volume of cases of five or greater.  On this basis, we cannot provide the information requested by the Deputy.</p><p>  The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland under EU Regulation 1408/71, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulations 574/72, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines.  Within these governing EU Regulations and the Department of Health Guidelines, the TAS provides for the cost of approved treatments in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland through the issue of Form E112 (IE).  A decision is made on each application in accordance with this legislation and guidelines and on the basis of a review by clinical experts.  The cost of the treatment is not a deciding factor when approving an application.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.</p><p>  The TAS allows for an Irish based medical consultant to refer a patient that is normally resident in Ireland for treatment, in a public hospital, in another EU/EEA member state or Switzerland, where the treatment in question meets the following criteria:</p><p><i>(a) The application to refer a patient abroad has been assessed and a determination given before that patient goes abroad.</i></p><p><i>(b) Following clinical assessment, the referring Consultant certifies the following:</i></p><p><i>- They recommend the patient be treated in another EU/EEA country or Switzerland;</i></p><p><i> - The treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs;</i></p><p><i> - The treatment is a proven form of medical treatment and is not experimental or test treatment;</i></p><p><i>- The treatment is in a recognised hospital or other institution and is under the control of a registered medical practitioner;</i></p><p><i> - The hospital outside the state will accept EU/EEA form E112 (IE).</i></p><p> and wish to confirm that applications for the Treatment Abroad Scheme are assessed on a case by case basis.</p><p>  As stated above, the HSE TAS processes applications on the basis of the treatment that the patient is being referred outside the state to receive, which is not available in Ireland.  The presence of a rare illness, such as Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, is not of itself criteria for availing of treatment abroad: most rare diseases are treated without the need for recourse to services in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  Patients, in conjunction with their Irish based public referring hospital consultant, have the ability to apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the state through model form E112.  Applications to TAS are processed and a determination given in accordance with the statutory framework prior to a patient travelling to avail of treatment.  Approved applicants/patients' hospital treatment costs are covered through the issue of form E112 (IE) for the specific identified episode of care.  Once a patient is discharged from a specific episode of care abroad, their care immediately reverts to their Irish based consultant.</p><p>  Each application to the HSE TAS is reviewed individually on its own merits and there are no restrictions, regarding age or otherwise, on a person making an application to the HSE TAS for review and decision.  Previous approvals or declines are not used as an influencing factor on subsequent applications.  Each application is for an individual episode of care unless otherwise specified by the consultant on the application form.  Each application to TAS is processed and given a formal written decision.  If that decision is one of decline, the reason for that decision is clearly outlined and the option of an appeal is afforded.  Furthermore, as above the decision on an application does not restrict future applications for an individual patient or indeed other patients seeking treatment abroad that is not available in Ireland.</p><p>  It is not possible to give a &quot;blanket&quot; statement on application s to TAS for patients with a particular condition, not least in relation to EDS where its presentation differs from patient to patient.  As outlined above, applications are made in respect of a specified treatment not available in Ireland.</p></reply>

The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive (HSE) will pursue the issue of individualised budgeting in the context of the implementation of the recommendations contained in the VFM Review.</p><p>  Individualised budgeting is an umbrella term that may take many forms, ranging from a method of determining resource allocation to agencies based on assessed client need and actual costs, to a &lsquo;money follows the client&rsquo; model, a brokerage system or a personal budget model administered by the individual service user.  The essence of individualised budgeting is that the individual is given more choice and control over how the money allocated to meet their needs is utilised.  This might or might not involve the transfer of actual funds to the individual.  This approach must be underpinned by a standardised needs assessment to ensure fairness and transparency in the way in which funding is allocated.  The move towards an individualised budgeting framework raises legal and practical issues, and will require careful consideration and possibly legislation.</p><p>  The priority is to further improve current services, while expediting the analysis of the benefits to be gained from newer models of individualised supports through demonstration projects which will be evaluated for wider applicability.  The balance and emphasis will shift firmly and comprehensively towards these new models of individualised supports once sufficient analysis of the benefits is carried out in the Irish context and adequate financial management, resource allocation and governance structures are in place to ensure their long-term viability.</p><p>  Demonstration projects are already underway to examine the practical aspects of introducing this major change and to establish the costs and benefits.  An analysis of the projects will commence towards the end of 2014 to determine their wider applicability, clarify the issues which must be resolved before the projects can be scaled up, and identify the best way forward.  Work is also underway to identify a standardised national assessment tool and resource allocation model which will form the basis of the individualised budgeting framework.  Other essential elements of the new model of service delivery and funding, such as a commissioning strategy and an outcome measurement framework, are also in development.</p></reply>

This Regulation is binding on all Member States and must be implemented as directed.  It does not allow for any discretionary element in establishing entitlement.  It is the link with the social security system of a Member State which makes any particular Member State liable for a persons's healthcare costs in the country where he/she is residing.  Frontier workers, i.e. persons who live in one Member State but pay social security contributions in another, are also entitled to receive their healthcare both in their State of residence and in the State where they are employed and paying social insurance contributions.  In this regard, a person resident in Ireland who is working in Northern Ireland and paying their contributions there, would normally be entitled to receive healthcare services in Ireland at the cost of the UK, provided they are not subject to Irish social security legislation.  Persons in this category are entitled to full eligibility and receive a medical card on the basis of EU Regulations as evidence of their entitlement.</p><p>  The EU Regulations allow for two or more States to agree alternative arrangements for reimbursement other than those laid down in the Regulations, or to mutually waive reimbursement altogether.  The reimbursement arrangements under the Ireland/UK bilateral agreement cover such persons as temporary visitors between the two countries, pensioners of one country and their dependants residing in the other country, and the dependant family members, residing in one country, of persons employed and residing in the other country.  Costs in relation to frontier workers, and their dependent family members residing in the same country as the worker, are mutually waived.  Under the terms of the agreement net liability between the two countries is calculated on a lump sum basis rather than an individual basis.  By far the biggest part of the payment received from the UK on an annual basis relates to the provision of healthcare to UK pensioners residing in Ireland.  An amount of &euro;220 million was received from the United Kingdom in 2013.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding these increases it has become evident in recent months that there are, typically less applicants for consultants posts that are vacant and that it is becoming more difficult to recruit successfully when posts are advertised. The Interim Report of the MacCraith Group, submitted to me in early December 2013, observed strong concerns raised by stakeholders in relation to the negative impact on recruitment associated with the 30% reduction in consultant salary for new entrants. The Interim Report is available on my Department's website. The consultants report referred to by the Deputy was a submission to the MacCraith Group by the HSE at the end of November concerning the emerging trend in vacancies and the ability to recruit successfully.</p><p>  It is appreciated that the 30% reduction decided in September 2012 for future &lsquo;new entrant&rsquo; appointments represented a substantial reduction in the rate of pay for consultants. However, it was a necessary measure, given the challenging economic circumstances. If the health services are to continue to provide consultant-level opportunities for doctors this can only happen on the basis of a lower-cost model. The HSE advised my Department last week that 104 posts had been advertised at the reduced rates and that 36 posts had been filled under these rates, with other posts at various stages of the recruitment process. It had not been possible to recruit candidates for 15 posts. </p><p>  Under the Haddington Road agreement the pay of most consultants was cut in accordance with the provisions applying to all staff earning over &euro;65,000. The only exceptions are those recruited at the 30% reduced salary level. The Agreement specified that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform would have regard the 30% reduction in salary applied to new entrant consultants from October 2012, and the substantial inequity that would thereby arise were these consultants subject to the Haddington Road reductions in remuneration. Following enactment of the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest Act 2013, such consultants were exempted from the July 2013 reductions.</p><p>  It should also be noted that there are some specialties in which there is an international shortage of consultants and which have traditionally been difficult to fill, regardless of the salary scale. There are also some hospitals to which it has been difficult to attract applicants &ndash; in particular smaller hospitals that have onerous rosters due to the limited number of consultants. The establishment of the Hospital Groups will assist in addressing this difficulty.</p><p>  I have already stated that consultants who move posts and consultants coming from abroad should have their experience and specialist training recognised. While the number of consultants who move posts is relatively small, I believe flexibility is required, particularly in the context of the establishment of the Hospital Groups. On 23rd January the HSE submitted initial views to my Department in relation to recognising such experience and training following on from the meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health held on 16th January.</p></reply>

These figures show:</p><p>  - 95% reduction in the numbers waiting over 12 months for an outpatient appointment;</p><p>  - 99.99% of adult elective patients waiting less than 8 months;</p><p>  - 95% of child elective patients waiting under 20 weeks; and </p><p>  - 99% of patients waiting for routine endoscopy procedures less than 13 weeks.</p><p>  These are significant indications of the progress that is being achieved through the work of the Special Delivery Unit, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) and the acute hospitals.  I have emphasised continually that priority must be given to taking care of those patients waiting the longest and hospitals have proven and continue to prove, that they can do this, even in an environment of constrained resources. The dedication and commitment of staff in achieving these targets, whilst ensuring that those in greatest clinical need are prioritised, deserves to be acknowledged.</p><p>  The CEO of the NTPF has confirmed that the complete NTPF December 2013 performance reports will be available on 20 February 2014 in line with the publication of the HSE Performance Report for December 2013.</p></reply>

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of GP consultations.</p></reply>

The project is currently in the design procurement stage. A Procurement Open Day was held on 25 November last, the short-listing of design teams is now being completed and this will be followed by the invitation to tender for those short-listed. Decant planning, updating of the St James&rsquo;s site masterplan and pre-application planning discussions have been ongoing in relation to the site. The aim is to have the site cleared by the end of this year, to have a planning decision and commence construction in Spring 2015, and to begin transition of services to the new children's hospital at the end of 2018.</p><p>  In parallel with the construction of the new children's hospital, the operational integration of the three existing children's hospitals is of critical importance in ensuring that the new hospital functions effectively from the outset. A Children's Hospital Group involving the three hospitals has been established, the core function of which is to integrate the three children's hospitals staff and service provision, well in advance of the new hospital being built.</p><p>  In October 2013, the Minister for Public Expenditure &amp;amp; Reform announced that up to &euro;200m would be made available for the new Children&rsquo;s Hospital from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the existing &euro;450m Exchequer funding.  The level of funding now in place underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this priority project.  Also, philanthropic/non-Exchequer funding will be sought to the maximum and most appropriate degree. Estimated costs will be reviewed and refined at each stage as the project progresses.</p></reply>

The RSA acknowledged that there were teething problems when the service opened for business on 29 October 2013.  Some were technical and systems issues, while others related to new staff becoming familiar with rules and processes around driving licences and permits. </p><p>  The RSA has responded by increasing resources in NDLS centres experiencing delays, as well as in the licence processing centre, and providing further training to staff.  There are no major technical difficulties now affecting the service.  A booking system to allow for customers to make appointments has been operating in a Pilot Phase which was successful.  This system will now be provided in all NDLS offices.</p><p>  While I understand that there are still some backlogs in relation to applications, the situation has improved.  I have been informed that licence applications that are fully and correctly completed are being issued within 8 days. The RSA has assured me that the remaining backlog will be cleared by mid-February.  The NDLS can also respond to urgent situations where a licence is needed for travel abroad or for work purposes.</p><p>  The requirement to return the old licence when applying for a new one may raise concerns regarding the legal requirement to produce a licence when requested by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If the person cannot produce the licence at the time, the law allows ten days in which to produce it at a Garda station.  In most cases, if a licence is in process, this is sufficient time for the new licence to arrive.  Where it is not, the Garda&iacute; may choose to exercise discretion.  I understand that the NDLS has advised the Garda&iacute; of the delays with issuing some licences.</p></reply>

I have established a cross-Departmental working group, in conjunction with the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, to examine the feasibility of introducing such a regime for HGVs in Ireland in the medium term.  The group began its work in January and is due to report by the middle of this year.</p><p>  The introduction of a road charging scheme for HGVs raises a number of issues and would require input from a wide variety of Government departments and agencies.  The working group will need to take account of issues regarding the Exchequer impact of a road charging scheme, how it would work, the impact it would have on imports and exports, the technology involved in such a system, compliance with European legislation and how it would be enforced amongst other matters.</p><p>  The new UK HGV levy will have an impact, albeit relatively small, on cross border trade costs between our two jurisdictions. However, it should be noted that 97% of goods vehicles taxed in Ireland are below 12 tonnes and will therefore be exempt from the levy. I will meet my UK counterpart later this month and will reiterate my earlier request that certain roads in Northern Ireland be excluded from the levy.</p></reply>

The operation of air services between Ireland and non-EU states is governed either by bilateral air transport agreements or by EU-level air transport agreements.  Governments have no direct role in arranging the provision of international air services but can facilitate the market by having bilateral air transport agreements in place. Ireland has a bilateral agreement with India which provides the basis on which direct services could be provided by operators in the market. It is a matter for designated airlines to apply for particular routes under the Ireland-India Bilateral Agreement. Should Air India under the Agreement apply for the type of route proposed, the granting of such traffic rights would be subject to the agreement of the Irish and Indian authorities.</p><p>  As Minister for Transport and for Tourism, I actively encourage airlines to either provide or increase services to Ireland. I regularly meet with executives from airlines to highlight the advantages of providing services to Ireland and the supports that are available to them here. Tourism Ireland constantly engage with airlines in the same vein. They identify routes that are of importance to the Irish tourism market and then seek to secure these services.  This is done through highlighting to airlines the attractions of Ireland, providing details on the tourism markets between the two countries, and if airlines choose to serve Ireland, Tourism Ireland support important tourism routes with co-operative marketing. The State Airport companies offer attractive incentive packages for new long haul routes including the waiving of landing fees. However ultimately it is a matter for the airlines themselves to decide what routes they will serve based on their own commercial judgements, taking account of the demand for services and the facilities available at those airports.</p></reply>

Due to financial constraints the Government's current capital plan to 2016 did not provide for the DART Underground which was planned as a PPP but with a very  significant  level of Exchequer support.</p><p>  DART Underground remains a key element of the overall public transport integration strategy as it would deliver benefits for  each of the four rail corridors radiating from the city centre. It will be reviewed again in preparation for the next capital plan from 2017.   Though I do favour bringing consideration of the next plan forward in light of the improving public finances and increased growth forecasts by the Central Bank. I am concerned that without forward planning we could see a return to congestion in Dublin quite quickly and I do not want us to be caught off guard.</p></reply>

The Irish Maritime Administration is the collective name for all the maritime functions in my Department i.e. those undertaken by the Marine Survey Office, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Safety Policy Division, the Maritime Transport Division and the Maritime Services Division.</p><p>  With regards to Malin Head, as the Deputy will be aware from a series of replies to his earlier representations and Parliamentary Questions, consideration was given to the resource requirements of the three Coast Guard Centres (Dublin, Malin, Valentia) following the publication of the Value for Money report into the operation of the Irish Coast Guard in 2012 and in the context of the prevailing economic climate.</p><p>  In reviewing the overall situation, all relevant factors were identified including known retirements. As I advised previously, two additional radio officers (RO) will be recruited to bring the staffing complement for all three centres  to a minimum of 40, up from the present 38, and it is intended to seek approval from the Minister for Public Expenditure Reform for the filling of any vacancies that arise in the future within that overall number. As also indicated, in order to support the staffing complement figure of 40 ROs, advanced technologies and integrated working processes are required across the three centres. Work is advanced in procuring the necessary technologies aimed at delivering that objective.</p></reply>
