The competition will involve an upfront payment by the operator of the next licence to the State, a portion of which will be used to help build the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>  The National Lottery Bill was published in December 2012.  The Bill was debated at Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 29th January, 5th February and 6th February 2013.  It passed Committee Stage on 27th March 2013 and Report and Final Stages on 17th April 2013.  It is expected that the Bill will be enacted in May of this year, subject to its successful passage through the Seanad.  </p><p>  The preliminary phase of the competitive process is expected to commence in the next few days.  However, the full and formal process will not commence until after the Bill is enacted.  The process is likely to run until August or September 2013, at which stage a preferred bidder will be chosen.  It is anticipated that receipt of the upfront payment will materialise in the fourth quarter of this year.  It is expected that the new 20 year licence will commence in 2014, subject to transitional arrangements. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-18a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041800040#WRA01000"><p>On 8 February 2013 the European Council reached agreement on the EU&#8217;s budget for 2014-2020.  The budget has to be agreed with the European Parliament and discussions are now taking place with the Parliament under the aegis of the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  In line with reductions to the overall EU budget, Cohesion funding across Europe is expected to be reduced from &#8364;347 billion to around &#8364;325 billion.  Nevertheless, while the precise details remain to be worked out, Ireland&#8217;s overall Structural Funds allocation is expected to increase from the &#8364;901 million we receive under the current round to &#8364;979 million in the 2014 - 2020 round.  This represents a considerable achievement, and is due to the consistent efforts of the Government to maximize support from Europe for our Structural Funds programmes and take particular account of our serious unemployment problems.</p><p>  In the case of the Border, Midland and Western Region however, the allocation it receives was reduced.  This is because the region no longer qualified as a transition region since its GDP per capita exceeded 90% of the EU average in 2007-2009 - the period used to determine the status of regions across the EU for the purposes of the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014-2020 and the new cohesion spending round.  This meant that the BMW Region is now considered a more developed region relative to other regions throughout the EU 27 Member States.  </p><p>The Government was concerned that the EU budgetary assumptions, which use older GDP economic datasets from 2007-2009 to determine the funding categorisation of EU regions, were likely to lead to a reduction in the BMW Region&#8217;s allocation from Brussels.  Indeed, the Deputy will be aware that the latest Central Statistics Office figures reveal that the <b>Gross Value Added (GVA) per capita</b> - a similar measure to GDP per capita - in the BMW Region in 2010 was 84.1% of the EU average, less than the 90% threshold used to categorise regions as more developed.</p><p>  However, in recognition of the new position of the BMW Region since the 2007-2009 period was used to categorise the Region as more developed, the Government, in the recent MFF negotiations in February, was successful in securing a special allocation of &#8364;100 million for the BMW Region to mitigate the effects of its change in status and in recognition of the significant economic downturn that the region has experienced.  </p><p>  The Government also negotiated a special allocation of up to &#8364;150 million for a PEACE IV Programme from which the BMW Region is expected to benefit.  The European Council also agreed a special Youth Employment Initiative using &#8364;6 billion of Structural Funds for regions with levels of youth unemployment above 25%, from which it is expected the BMW Region will also benefit.  The focus on youth unemployment is something the Irish Government had been pressing for.</p><p>  In the light of this, it is my opinion that an intervention direct to the EU Commission is not appropriate at this stage.</p><p>  Work in my Department, in conjunction with the Regional Assemblies, has already commenced on the preparation of a new Operational Programme 2014-2020 for the BMW region, which will be submitted to the European Commission for approval later this year.</p></reply>

It was envisaged that this reform would facilitate D&aacute;il Committees in engaging in constructive dialogue with Ministers and Departments and input their views on which areas of spending should be prioritised in advance of the Budget each year.  These viewpoints can then inform the Government in bringing forward its detailed Estimates for the year in question.  </p><p>  The Expenditure Report 2013, published 5 December 2012, included Departmental level current expenditure ceilings for 2014 which the Oireachtas Committees can consider.  While it is a matter for the Ceann Comhairle and the Oireachtas to determine the timing, in the first instance, I would be hopeful that Committees can begin their <i>ex ante</i>  look at the future spending of Departments, in the context of the expenditure ceilings already set out, before the summer.</p><p>  The full Estimates for 2014 will be set out, as usual, at the time of the Budget later this year after detailed discussions have been taken by Government. </p></reply>

The General Scheme was also published at that time and was submitted to the Oireachtas Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee for a pre-legislative scrutiny process.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware the purpose of the Bill is to address the main substantive restrictions in access to official information introduced in 2003, to extend Freedom of Information to all public bodies, to provide a framework for the extension of FOI to non-public bodies in receipt of significant funding from the Exchequer as well as to consolidate, modernise and update the legislation, including in light of detailed recommendations made by the Information Commissioner.</p></reply>

It is my intention to present these proposals to Government shortly and to submit them to the Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform Committee thereafter for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p><p>  The aim of regulating lobbying activity through registration and reporting requirements is to strengthen public confidence in politics and in the business of government to increase the accountability of decision makers and to subject public policy making, and those who seek to influence it, to greater openness and transparency.  It would facilitate the appropriate independent scrutiny of lobbying activity.</p><p>  The development of policy on lobbying regulation has been informed by several very valuable sources of information, analysis and experience.  </p><p>  The OECD has developed a set of principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying which have been adopted as a recommendation by all OECD Member States.  The OECD principles formed the basis of the consultation exercise carried out by the Department earlier this year.</p><p>  The project has also drawn on information on regulatory regimes operating for example in Canada, the US, Australia, New Zealand and several European countries.  The voluntary register in place in the European Union institutions was also analysed along with proposals for a self-regulatory regime in the UK.</p><p>  There have been five Private Members Bills published on the regulation of lobbying since 1999.  These have proved very useful in illustrating the key detailed features of the possible shape of lobbying regulation.</p><p>  My Department&rsquo;s assessment has also derived significant benefit from the work of Irish researchers in TCD, DCU and DIT who have provided guidance and insights drawn from the authoritative work that they have published comparing global approaches to lobbying regulation.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-18a.27.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041800040#WRA01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together. </p><p>  I reiterate some of the points I have already made in response to Deputy Wallace&rsquo;s priority question on a similar topic today.</p><p>  As I have already said, following Congress&rsquo;s decision not to accept the Labour Relations Commission&rsquo;s (LRC) proposals, the Government is reflecting on the outcome of the ballot and the manner in which the required savings can be achieved this year.  However, it is still worth clarifying some of the issues which were raised recently, including those made following the publication of the Equality Audit Report which was commissioned by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO). </p><p>  Flexible working arrangements, including flexible starting and finishing times, generous leave entitlements, the capacity to take career breaks and avail of the shorter working year scheme and so on, are available across the public service.  Had the LRC&rsquo;s proposals been accepted this would have continued to be the case. </p><p>  When you look at the range of work-life balance arrangements that is available to public servants it is clear that they are among the best available options provided by Irish employers, particularly when considered in tandem with annual leave and other provisions.  </p><p>  If the unions had accepted the LRC&rsquo;s proposals the most popular and widely availed of worksharing arrangements would not have been affected.  Those in receipt of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance were exempt from the worksharing proposals and were not being asked to increase their hours above the 15 hour a week limit for payment of their allowance.  Employees with disabilities who had reached a reasonable accommodation with their employer to work less than 50% of the full time hours were also exempt from these proposals.</p><p>  Flexi-time would still have been available which facilitates employees in varying their starting and finishing times and the length and timing of their lunch breaks.  In addition, most employees would have been able to use additional hours worked to avail of, potentially, an additional 13 days&rsquo; leave a year. </p><p>  Some of the LRC proposals in respect of flexi-time and worksharing simply reiterated management prerogatives that are currently in place in line with previously agreed arrangements.</p><p>  The Equality Audit makes reference to the proposals in respect of longer working hours and their potential impact on sections of the public service.  In implementing the arrangements management would have facilitated staff members who wished to opt to remain on their current hours with the appropriate pro-rata pay reduction for a period of time. This would have given these individuals an opportunity to make necessary arrangements to balance their responsibilities at work and at home.  They would then have moved to one of the standard worksharing patterns after a set period of time.</p><p>  An appropriate level of staff must be available during the span of the working day to meet the business needs of the organisation and to provide services to the public.  In the context of falling numbers and changing demands for public services, flexitime and work sharing should better reflect the current needs of public service organisations.  The operation of these arrangements must support the business of the organisation and the provision of services to the public.  The proposed changes were an attempt to balance the requirements of the business while enabling staff to balance work and personal life requirements.</p></reply>

The guidance does not distinguish between micro-enterprises and other SMEs, and the approach set out is intended to be applicable to them all.  These guidelines set out positive measures that contracting authorities are to take to promote the involvement of smaller enterprises in a manner that is consistent with the principles and rules of the existing public procurement regulatory regime.  The guidance also highlights practices that are to be avoided because they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The key provisions of the guidance include:</p><p>- supplies and general services contracts with an estimated value of &#8364;25,000 or more to be advertised on the <i><font color="#0000FF">www.etenders.gov.ie</font></i>  website;</p><p>- less use of &#8220;restrictive&#8221; tendering procedures and greater use of &#8220;open&#8221; tendering;</p><p>- ensuring that the levels set by contracting authorities for suitability criteria are justified and proportionate to the needs of the contract;</p><p>- sub-dividing larger requirements into lots where this is practical.</p><p>  In order to promote and improve such practices the National Procurement Service (NPS) established its 'Working Group to assist Small and Medium Enterprises' in February 2012 to facilitate open discussion on the issue of public service  procurement.  The Working Group consists of representatives from the NPS, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Business and Employers Federation, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, Chambers Ireland, and the Small Firms Association.  The Group has met on a number of occasions and has raised many issues relating to procurement and particularly how these issues impact on SMEs.  Resulting from these discussions the NPS has issued two circulars to all buyers in, and suppliers to, the public service with the aim of improving practice in the procurement arena.  </p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide.  Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  Circular 10/10 has been in place for just over two years.  It is clear that there is a need to ensure greater consistency in relation to the implementation of this circular.  In this regard, I have arranged for my Department to remind public bodies about this aspect of the public procurement guidance and the importance of contracting authorities ensuring they implement it appropriately.</p></reply>

The aim is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p><p>  The National Procurement Service (NPS) has put in place a number of national arrangements designed to secure better value for money from leveraging the public service&rsquo;s buying power in relation to a range of goods and services that are commonly purchased across the public service. These national arrangements have benefits that include:</p><p>- cash savings;</p><p>- administrative savings from reduced duplication of tendering;</p><p>- greater purchasing expertise;</p><p>- improved consistency; and,</p><p>- enhanced service levels.</p><p>  In some instances the take up of the NPS arrangements has been low. In order to increase the usage of the NPS arrangements and thereby secure best value for money, the Government decided that it should be mandatory for public service bodies to use specified national procurement arrangements. Last year my Department issued Circular 06/12 which implements the Government decision by making it a mandatory requirement that public service bodies avail of specified national arrangements put in place by the NPS. These national arrangements will secure best value for money and facilitate contracting authorities to deliver services within their budgetary constraints.</p><p>  Where a mandatory framework arrangement exists, any public service body intending to make a purchase other than through the framework arrangement will need to ensure that it can explain the rationale for not using the NPS arrangement and provide a value for money justification that takes account of the full costs including those incurred in managing its own procurement process.</p><p>  While the key purpose of Circular 6/12 is to enable the State to do more with less by aggregating procurement to secure better value for money, it is worth noting that such aggregation arrangements can be implemented in a manner that achieves value for money with a minimal negative impact, or indeed a positive impact, on SMEs. While a number of the categories of goods and services mandated under the Circular are suited to single supplier national arrangements, these need not be accepted as the norm. The greater use, where appropriate, of multi-supplier frameworks can address local supplier issues while also ensuring on-going cost competitiveness of the framework itself. Such multi-supplier frameworks may also offer SMEs the opportunity to participate in national level contracts, thereby offering valuable reference work when competing for public procurement contracts in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  In order to encourage greater SME participation the NPS, over the past three years, has conducted a targeted programme of education for suppliers who wish to learn more about doing business with the Irish Public Service.  This programme consists of seminars, workshops and large scale 'meet the buyer' events hosted nationwide.  To date the NPS has facilitated workshops and presented at seminars to over 3,000 SMEs nationwide. Parallel with these events the NPS also works closely with business representative bodies such as ISME and IBEC to provide briefings for their members.</p><p>  To summarise: we in government want better value for money for our substantial procurement spend and we want Irish SMEs, where necessary, to form alliances and networks to ensure they can tender on a competitive basis for this work.</p></reply>

The Public Appointments Service (PAS) took over the mantle of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners in 2004, and continue to ensure that all public service posts (filled by PAS) are filled in an open and transparent manner, using an independent merit based system.  To ensure that this is the case, it is important to use a mixture of public and private sector board members to ensure as wide a range of expertise as possible on each selection board.  A typical selection board appointed by PAS comprises an Independent Chairperson, external expert(s) and nominee(s) of the employing body.</p><p>  A very stringent shortlisting exercise is conducted so that only the highest calibre candidates are called to interview, greatly reducing the number of interview days for each campaign.  PAS processed 38,814 applications for competitions under their control in 2012, and only 4,207 were interviewed.</p><p>  PAS, in the course of running recruitment competitions for the public service, seeks to ensure that a person sitting on an interview board has the required skills, competence and expertise to assess the suitability of candidates for appointment to that particular post.</p><p>  PAS uses trained and experienced individuals from both the private and public sectors on such selection boards.  The Chairpersons and external experts come from both public and private sector backgrounds.   Those assisting in this task who are in receipt of a public or private sector salary receive no payment whatsoever.  A large percentage of selection boards consist of unpaid members.  Fee paid board member days accounts for only 38% of board days.  A fee per day is paid to retired individuals and to those from the private sector (e.g. self-employed) who forego earnings in order to facilitate PAS by sitting on an interview board.   The list of individuals who assist PAS in interviewing is constantly changing but is currently approximately 630, of whom approximately 160 are retired public servants.  For this work, retired individuals are paid on a fee-per-day basis and are subject to tax and other relevant deductions. The fees are linked to pre-retirement grades and take account of the principal of pension abatement.</p><p>  The figures of the amounts paid to selection board members for the last 5 years indicate an even balance between amounts paid to those retired from the public sector and those from private sector background.</p><p>  PAS has actively tried to reduce the amount paid on selection boards in the past five years; and my Department has reduced fees paid to retired civil servants acting on selection board members in May 2009, January 2010 and in January 2012. On average, fees paid to retired civil servants for acting on interview boards have decreased by 50% since 2008.</p></reply>

Good progress in this regard has been made in the various sectors.</p><p>  In the Local Authority sector, a performance management and development system (PMDS) has been operating since 2005 and periodic reviews of the system have been undertaken. In line with recommendations of the most recent national PMDS Review of 2011, a local authority competency framework was implemented and PMDS has been linked to other HR policies.  In December 2012, further improvements were agreed for implementation in 2013, namely, a 5 point scale for the evaluation of performance; a protocol for dealing with underperformance, including performance improvement plans; and linkage of the system to incremental progression, grievance and disciplinary procedures.</p><p>  In the Education sector, a key proposal in the latest action plan for the sector is to link performance management systems in Universities, Institutes of Technology and VECs to the awarding of increments and incremental progression.  To this end, it is envisaged that systems will be put in place, or existing systems adapted, in advance of the commencement of the 2013/2014 academic year, with links to incremental progression to be in place before commencement of the 2014/2015 academic year.</p><p>  Turning to the Justice sector, a new performance management system&ndash; the Performance Accountability Learning Framework (PALF) &ndash; has been introduced on a pilot basis for the sworn members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Irish Prison Service implements the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) in operation in the Civil Service. </p><p>  The HSE performance management system was developed in 2011 and implemented for management grades in 2012.  It is anticipated that the system will be extended to professional and administrative grades during 2013.</p><p>  Finally, in relation to the Civil Service, my Department has been working with management and unions to strengthen performance management.  Over the past three years, significant changes to the Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) in operation in the Civil Service have been agreed.  These are being introduced on a phased basis.</p><p>  The Phase 1 changes introduced for 2012 were aimed at streamlining the practical operation of PMDS.  Management accountability was also strengthened, and a manager who fails to manage the performance of their staff effectively over the course of the year must themselves receive a rating of &lsquo;Needs to Improve&rsquo;( a rating of 2 on a 5 point scale, 5 being the highest).</p><p>  The changes under Phase 2 for 2013 are designed to strengthen fairness and consistency in how performance is evaluated.  Calibration of performance evaluations will be introduced on a phased basis, commencing with calibration by Assistant Secretaries and Principals in respect of their direct reports.  Under Calibration, managers at the same grade who are responsible for conducting performance evaluations meet to discuss staff performance with the aim of making sure that managers apply similar standards for all staff members. The fairness of the system will also be underpinned by strengthening the process through which individual members of staff can seek a review of their evaluation, and introducing a process for external review. </p><p>  The system of ratings has also been revised, with improved descriptions of performance levels which make explicit reference to the requirement for a Performance Improvement Action Plan in cases where performance is not satisfactory and for subsequent disciplinary action to be taken where performance has still not improved.  An evaluation of &lsquo;Fully Achieved Expectations&rsquo; (a rating of 3) will now be required for the award of an increment.</p><p>  There has been substantial progress on strengthening performance management in the public service.  However, we must continue to foster a culture of effective management of performance and to deal effectively with underperformance where it occurs.</p></reply>

The project will transition the 40 in-scope bodies on a phased basis over the next 18 months.</p><p>  The project will:</p><p>- Create a HR Shared Service Centre with multi-channel access for managers and staff via portal, phone, email or post</p><p>- Improve customer service by providing consistent, effective and reliable HR Services to all staff across the Civil Service</p><p>- Develop a &ldquo;customer service&rdquo; culture within the shared service centre</p><p>- Optimise HR processes to transition administration to the shared services centre</p><p>- Improve technology, where necessary, to enhance processes</p><p>- Create a service management capability to drive on time service delivery and ongoing continuous improvement</p><p>- Enhance HR&rsquo;s capability</p><p>- Improve governance of HR processes</p><p>  PeoplePoint commenced its HR services operation at the end of March, 2013. It is estimated that with the establishment of PeoplePoint and post 2014, when all 40 Civil Service Departments and Offices in-scope have transitioned, and the shared service is stabilised, that the annual cost of HR services for the civil service will be reduced significantly by &euro;12.5m per annum and by 149 staff.</p><p>  PeoplePoint is staffed and managed by Civil Servants and currently does not provide services to the broader public service., It will change the way Human Resources will function in the Civil Service in a number of ways including:</p><p>- Improved administrative efficiency and by reducing costs </p><p>- A shift in HR focus in Departments/Offices away from compliance and administrative personnel activity to work that is of higher value to the business of the organisation.</p><p>- Transforming HR service delivery across the entire Civil Service which in turn will enable and drive continuing organisational change and on-going delivery of front-line services to the citizen</p><p>- Freeing up the capacity of the resources who process those HR transactions within the individual organisations to more front-line core activities </p><p>  The introduction of PeoplePoint at the end of March represents a very significant step in making Shared Services a reality across the Civil Service.</p></reply>

Over the course of recent years, several Government measures have been taken which serve to substantially reduce pension awards and pensions in payment to former senior public servants, Taoisigh, Government Ministers and other office holders.</p><p>  A key measure in this context has been the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR), which applies to all public servants who retired on pensions of over &euro;12,000 up to the end of February 2012.  This progressively structured measure was introduced on 1 January 2011, based on a set of income bands and percentage reductions bearing most heavily on higher-pensioned retirees. Acting on foot of my concern in relation to high public service pensions, I subsequently acted to make the PSPR even more progressive in application, by legislating for an increase in the rate on pension amounts in excess of &euro;100,000, from 12% to 20%, effective from 1 January 2012.</p><p>  In the case of former public servants who retire or have retired from March 2012 onward, pensions have also been subject to a significant effective reduction, insofar as they have been impacted by the pay reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) legislation.  These reductions have again been progressively structured, so that higher paid public servants and public service retirees, including the  groups referred to by the Deputies, have proportionately been harder hit.  In this context some of the most significant pay cuts have been imposed on ministerial pay, and these cuts will be fully reflected in the pension awards to current and future Ministers.</p><p>  Future pension awards will also be moderated by the general pay ceiling of &euro;200,000 for appointments to higher posts across the public service which I introduced in 2011. Revised salary rates in line with that ceiling are now in place for future Secretaries General in the civil service, who, in addition, can no longer get notional added years or immediate pensions before preserved pension age. These retrenchments in respect of salary and exit terms will ultimately reduce Exchequer pension costs in respect of senior civil servants.</p><p>  Looking further ahead, the recently commenced Single Public Service Pension Scheme which applies to all new-joiner public servants, including civil servants, office holders and Ministers, will in time deliver significant savings to the public purse through reduced public service pensions.  These long-term savings will derive from key features of the Single Scheme, principally an increase in pension age, inflation linkage of benefits and career-average accrual.</p><p>  The various FEMPI and other measures which I have outlined indicate the significant action already taken in terms of reducing the pensions payable currently or in the future to former senior public servants, Taoisigh, Ministers and other office holders.  In this general context it is important to point out that legal advice from the Attorney General states that it is possible to apply proportionate reductions to existing pensions, as has been done to date in the FEMPI legislation. However, due account must be taken of the fact that pension benefits are generally regarded as vested property rights, which must be considered in the public interest when taking action.</p><p>  Finally, as Deputies will be aware, some of the institutions referred to in Deputy Griffin's question are the responsibility of my colleague Mr Michael Noonan, TD, Minister for Finance.</p></reply>

No decision has been made to change how debt management is carried out &ndash; my Department is considering all options, including improving existing debt management processes in their current organisations; centralising all or part of the workload into a single body; creating a dedicated shared service (such as the new PeoplePoint HR Shared Service for the Civil Service); and the external service delivery of all or part of the workload.</p><p>  A Project Board has been established made up of Assistant Secretaries or equivalents from the five organisations (the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Environment, Community and Local Government; and Social Protection; the HSE; and the Courts Service) in scope for this project. A Senior Responsible Officer from the Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine and a Project Manager from the Revenue Commissioners have been appointed.

However, in some circumstances it is considered more appropriate and efficient to undertake the works directly using OPW's own staff - permanent and temporary.   In deciding which approach would be the most appropriate use of resources in any instance, the OPW has  regard to a number of factors such as the scale and complexity of works involved, their geographic location relative to OPW's regional depots and the extent of other work commitments.</p><p>Using a direct labour approach to undertaking capital works offers advantages in some respects over using private contractors.  It is generally a faster way to get the works commenced as the onerous and time consuming process of procuring a private contractor is avoided.  It also allows more flexibility in managing risks on a project through targeted deployment of resources to deal with delays caused by unforeseen events and conditions which frequently arise in these type of works.   It is the case that, in certain circumstances, using direct labour is a more cost effective way of undertaking works compared to engagement of a private contractor.  However, each case must be looked at and decided on its own merits as there are a  muliplicity of factors that must be taken into account in considering the most appropriate approach to use</p><p>In terms of the employment generating potential of using a direct labour approach over a private contractor approach, it is considered that there is not a significant difference in either model as, in broad terms, both would employ the same number of staff.  It has to be borne in mind that the OPW, like all Government Departments and Agencies, is required to manage it staff resources within the Employment Control Framework total allocated to it by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Therefore, the OPW is constrained in the scope it has to recruit additional staff to allow it to undertake any significant expansion in its direct works programme.</p><p>The number of staff involved in the construction of a scheme varies over the course of the project as the elements of the works being carried out changes.  As indicated, the numbers employed would be broadly similar irrespective of whether the scheme is being carried out by contractors or through staff employed by OPW. Where OPW is carrying out a project directly, in addition to recruiting temporary staff on contract for that scheme, the Office generally also uses members of its permanent workforce. While the primary and core function of this workforce is the maintenance of completed arterial drainage and flood relief schemes, staff members are also deployed to construction of capital schemes where appropriate.  It is important to mention also that , even where a scheme is being carried out &quot;in-house&quot; or directly by the OPW, it is often the case that private contractors are employed to carry out discrete specialist elements of the works such as stone works, cladding or sheet piling.</p><p>Details of  the main large flood relief schemes carried out in the relevant period are given below.  Because OPW staff, including supervisory staff, are deployed between projects, the full overhead cost in relation to these staff would not be reflected in the cost figures shown for each scheme. In addition to these schemes, a number of smaller-scale projects were carried out, generally as agents of the relevant Local Authorities for schemes approved under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works scheme.</p><p><table><tr><th>Scheme</th><th>Average number of staff*<br />(permanent and temporary)</th><th>Total cost</th></tr><tr><td>Mornington Flood Relief Scheme, Co. Meath</td><td>11</td><td>&#8364;4.2m</td></tr><tr><td>Dodder Flood Relief Scheme, Dublin </td><td>15</td><td>&#8364;10.9m</td></tr><tr><td>Johnstown, Co. Kildare</td><td>9</td><td>&#8364;3.0m</td></tr><tr><td>Tullamore, Co. Offaly</td><td>9</td><td>&#8364;1.0m</td></tr><tr><td>Claregalway</td><td>13</td><td>&#8364;1.0m</td></tr></table></p><p>(* These numbers would not include staff employed by any contractor engaged for specialist elements of the project.)</p><p>The number of temporary staff recruited by the OPW in any given year is decided on the basis of the work programme for that year and the financial and supervisory resources available.</p><p>It should be noted also that since its introduction in 2009, the OPW Minor Works programme has to date funded  around 400 flood mitigation projects throughout the country, through the Local Authorities with a total allocation of  &euro;28m.</p></reply>

This is an in-depth examination of the flood risk in the Shannon catchment and a detailed plan with specific recommendations on measures to manage that risk will be produced by consultants, Jacobs Engineering.</p><p>  In advance of the detailed analysis which is being carried out under the Shannon CFRAM Study the consultants were requested by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to prioritise a formal review of the operating regulations and procedures of the control structures along the river Shannon with the purpose of identifying potential improvements with respect to flood risk management that could be introduced in the short term.  </p><p>  That report and a non-technical summary of the Report - &lsquo;Understanding Water levels on the River Shannon&rsquo; was circulated to all public representatives in the region, last Autumn.  In addition, a direct briefing on the report was made by Jacobs Engineering in late 2012 to the Irish Farmers&rsquo; Association  and the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, operational control of water flows and levels on the Shannon is a matter for both the ESB and Waterways Ireland, in the first instance.  </p><p>  The OPW meets regularly with both organisations to review matters relating to the River Shannon.  As part of these consultations and in the context of the ongoing work under the Shannon CFRAM study being undertaken for the OPW by Jacobs Engineering, it was agreed to explore the possibility of carrying out a water level monitoring exercise, involving controlled raising and lowering of weir boards at selected locations, subject to favourable hydrological conditions.  </p><p>  For the monitoring exercise to go ahead three criteria have to be satisfied.  The first is that the level downstream of Athlone must be sufficiently low not to cause flooding in the callows.  The second is that the level on Lough Ree is not below the recently agreed ESB lower target operating level in early summer and the third is that a significant rainfall event is forecast. </p><p>  At the moment only the first of the above criteria is clearly satisfied.  The situation is being monitored closely so that when suitable conditions prevail the exercise can proceed.</p><p>  In addition to the water level monitoring exercise and following consultations between the OPW, the ESB and Waterways Ireland, the ESB has indicated agreement to a change in the existing control regime, which will remain in place until the publication of the Flood Risk Management Plan for The Shannon Catchment.  The change will provide for a trial lowering of the Spring/early Summer target levels in Lough Ree.  By increasing the storage capacity in Lough Ree this change will reduce somewhat the risk of summer flooding in the callows.</p></reply>

The end March Exchequer returns showed that &euro;387 million was drawn down by Departments and Offices during the first quarter of the year. This is just &euro;50m below the level they had profiled to end-March. I fully expect that Departments and Offices will utilise their full capital allocations over the course of the year.</p><p>  In line with the five year capital envelopes, the total allocation in recent years has been progressively reduced because of the need to find savings from all areas of Government spend as part of our bringing the overall public finances back onto a sustainable footing. Therefore, the 2013 capital spending will not be profiled to eventually reach the 2012 level, as the allocation this year is lower than for 2012.</p><p>  Capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern. Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. This will, of course, affect the phasing and profiling of capital expenditure from year to year. Given the one-off nature of much capital expenditure, year-on-year comparisons may not accurately reflect progress on capital expenditure, particularly during the early part of the year. A more appropriate measure of how capital expenditure is progressing is the comparison with published profiles.	</p></reply>

The stated objective of the SMI was to present Public Service management with an opportunity to make a substantial contribution to national development, through the provision of quality and effectively delivered services.  It should be noted that while the focus of the SMI was primarily on the Civil Service, parallel initiatives took place in the other sectors of the Public Service.</p><p>  In 1996, the Delivering Better Government report expanded on the framework set out in the SMI and presented a vision for the Civil Service built around six key organisational themes.  These were greater openness and accountability, quality customer service, the efficient and fair operation of simplified regulations, improvements in human resource management, better financial management and enhanced information systems management.</p><p>  Under the SMI, progress was made across the six organisational themes in areas such as the introduction of more rigorous strategic planning and reporting; the introduction of a legislative programme including the Freedom of Information Act, the Public Service Management Act, the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Immunities, Privileges and Compellability of Witnesses) Act, and the Prompt Payments Act; the introduction of Customer Charters and Customer Service Action Plans; the introduction of the Performance Management and Development System for the Civil Service; the development of Regulatory Impact Assessment; the introduction of the Management Information Framework; and a greater focus on cross-organisational ICT provision.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the progress made under the SMI and other reform programmes since, when this Government came to office it was clear that we needed a new, radical and far reaching reform programme, to contribute to economic recovery as part of the Government&rsquo;s strategic response to the crisis.  This was reflected in the commitments to reform made in the Programme for Government, which set the basis for the Government&rsquo;s Public Service Reform Plan, published in November, 2011.</p><p>  The Reform and Delivery Office in my Department was established to lead and coordinate delivery of the reform agenda.  Under the Reform Plan, we are implementing a series of reforms under the following five key commitments to change: placing customer service at the core of everything we do; maximising new and innovative service delivery channels; radically reducing our costs to drive better value for money; leading, organising and working in new ways; and strong focus on implementation and delivery.</p><p>  The Reform Plan has a particular emphasis on strong governance and programme management structures, in order to drive and monitor the implementation of reform across the system.  The Public Service Reform Plan is complemented by Integrated Reform Delivery Plans produced by all Government Departments and major Offices.  These plans outline the reform programmes at organisational and sectoral levels, as well as central initiatives.</p><p>  A more effective and sustainable Public Service is in the interests of all stakeholders, including public servants.  We are working hard to build a Public Service of which we can all be proud and a Public Service that values its most important asset &ndash; its people.  Increased flexibility, mobility, development and up-skilling are key aspects of reform that will provide public servants with greater opportunities for more fulfilling, rewarding careers in the years ahead.</p></reply>

The budget has to be agreed with the European Parliament and discussions are now taking place with the Parliament under the aegis of the Irish Presidency.</p><p>  In line with reductions to the overall EU budget, Cohesion funding across Europe is expected to be reduced from &euro;347 billion to around &euro;325 billion.  Despite this, Ireland&rsquo;s overall Structural Funds allocation is expected to increase from the &euro;901 million we receive under the current round to &euro;979 million in the 2014 -2020 round.  This represents a considerable achievement, and is due to the consistent efforts of the Government to maximize support from Europe for our Structural Funds programmes and take particular account of our serious unemployment problems.</p><p>  In the case of the Border, Midland and Western Region however, the allocation it receives was reduced.  This is because the region no longer qualified as a transition region since its GDP per capita exceeded 90% of the EU average in 2007 - 2009 - the period used to determine the status of regions across the EU for the purposes of the Multi-annual Financial Framework 2014 - 2020.  This meant that the status of the BMW Region has changed from that of a "transition region" to that of a "more developed region" relative to other regions throughout the EU 27 Member States.  </p><p>  However, in recognition of the special position of the region, the Government, in the recent MFF negotiations in February, was successful in securing for the region an additional &euro;100 million and additional special allocations under PEACE IV and the Youth Employment Initiative.  The focus on youth unemployment is something the Irish Government had been pressing for.</p></reply>

These services have made a substantive difference to the lives of these communities overseas through reducing homelessness, tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local statutory entitlements.  In addition, the ESP has facilitated Government support for a range of community and heritage projects, strategic capital projects and other initiatives aimed at creating practical results-orientated links between Ireland and the global Irish, including those that emerged from the Global Irish Economic Forums.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-18a.122.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041800041#WRD02100"><p>There are now over 4 million people in need of life saving humanitarian assistance within Syria and over 1.3 million refugees in neighbouring countries.  As the conflict enters its third year, the coping mechanisms of the internally displaced and the refugee populations are severely depleted and the numbers in acute need are increasing every day. The T&aacute;naiste saw first-hand the terrible suffering being endured by people who are forced to flee the violence when he visited refugee camps in Turkey last week. Ireland has responded generously to the humanitarian crisis in Syria and its neighbouring countries, and to date has provided over &euro;8.15 million in assistance through long standing and reputable partners such as WFP, UNHCR, UNICEF and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).    The Government recognises the significant challenges involved in reaching those most in need within Syria, and the T&aacute;naiste has consistently raised concerns about humanitarian access at the EU Foreign Affairs Council. The constraints are many. Excessive controls on aid agencies working in the country, the fragmentation of the armed opposition and the intensity of military confrontations have made the operating environment extremely volatile and insecure, particularly in opposition controlled areas. Restrictions imposed by the Assad regime, combined with logistical constraints and increasing insecurity, make it very difficult to access the most vulnerable populations. </p><p>  Despite these challenges, it is a fact that our humanitarian partners on the ground are succeeding in reaching increasing numbers of vulnerable people. During consultations this week in Dublin I was informed by Ertharin Cousin, Executive Director of World Food Programme that her organisation is reaching 2 million Syrians, including about 500,000 in opposition held areas. This represents a scale-up of 300,000 people from the February distribution. Other partners such as the ICRC, working with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, have been reaching areas inaccessible to the United Nations. These are partners that have a demonstrated track record of effective humanitarian response in Syria, with strong strategies for targeting and delivery and robust systems for monitoring and accountability. </p><p>  Despite these considerable achievements, it is acknowledged that many people still remain beyond the reach, particularly in the most insecure areas in the north of the country.  The United Nations and other humanitarian actors on the ground are committed to urgently scaling up the scope and reach of the humanitarian response.  The approval of additional NGO implementing partners and the decision to establish inter-agency operational field hubs is assisting the UN and other actors to reach the most vulnerable populations.  UN hubs are already in place in Homs and Tartous, where the strengthened presence is enhancing outreach, and further hubs are planned for other areas. </p><p>  Ensuring that our humanitarian contribution reaches people most in need, wherever they are, is a top priority for Ireland and we continue to closely monitor the humanitarian response in Syria and the region.  As part of Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union the Government has consistently raised the issue of humanitarian access and respect for humanitarian principles in Syria. This has also been a key issue for Ireland when represented at the &lsquo;Friends of Syria&rsquo; conferences and the &lsquo;Syria Humanitarian Forum&rsquo;. Ensuring that humanitarian assistance reaches those most in need will be part of any future assessment of how we can further respond to humanitarian needs in Syria and the wider region.</p></reply>

These discussions focussed on how the EU can best promote a peaceful resolution to the crisis and alleviate the sufferings of the Syrian people, 70,000 of whom have been killed since March 2011.  We will continue this discussion at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April which I will attend and where Syria will figure prominently on the agenda.  Special Envoy Brahimi was honest in his assessment and expressed the clear view that only a negotiated settlement can salvage what is left of Syria and offer the hope of an end to the conflict. Special Envoy Brahimi is expected to brief the UN Security Council on 19 April where he will update the SECCO members on the situation on the ground and share his views on the prospects for a political settlement.   At the informal &ldquo;Gymnich&rdquo; meeting at the end of March in Dublin, EU partners reaffirmed their full support for Special Envoy Brahimi and his efforts. We also made clear that the priority for the EU is to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis.</p><p>  Considerable attention has also been devoted at EU level recently to reviewing the current EU sanctions which apply against Syria.   We want to ensure through these measures that pressure remains on the Assad regime to stop its repression and to engage in a process of political dialogue with the opposition.  At the 18 February Foreign Affairs Council, we agreed to renew the full range of existing sanctions for a further period of three months, until 1 June.  At the request of the European Council on 14-15 March, we again discussed this subject at the informal Gymnich meeting held in Dublin. We agreed to continue our discussion at the next Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Luxembourg on 22 April with a view to reaching a common position ahead of the 1 June renewal date.</p><p>  There is also a need to ensure full accountability in relation to the gross human rights violations and war crimes which have been committed by all sides to this conflict.  Ireland has been to the fore within the EU in supporting calls for the situation in Syria to be referred by the UN Security Council to the International Criminal Court.  As a new member of the UN Human Rights Council, we have been active during the Council&rsquo;s most recent session in building support for a strong resolution on the current human rights situation in Syria.   This resolution, which calls for referral to the appropriate international criminal justice mechanism in the case of gross human rights violations, was overwhelmingly adopted by the Council on 22 March. </p><p>  Discussions are currently underway at the UN in New York about a possible adoption by the UN General Assembly of a Resolution on the situation in Syria. Together with our EU and Arab partners, we are working towards ensuring that the Resolution contains strong accountability messages. We are also encouraging the sponsors to seek as wide a measure of support for the Resolution as possible within the General Assembly so as to demonstrate the extent of international concern over the current situation. </p><p>  The plight of millions of ordinary Syrians remains a major concern for Ireland and its EU partners as the humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, in and outside Syria.  I was able to witness first-hand the dreadful cost of the conflict paid by thousands of ordinary civilians including children when I visited the refugee camp of Nizip in southern Turkey on 8 April. Ireland and its EU partners are making a major contribution to the UN-led humanitarian relief operations.   The EU is collectively the largest donor to such efforts, having contributed some &euro;600 million in aid to date.  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian assistance to Syria over the past year now amounts to &euro;8.15 million which include the additional &euro;1 million pledge I announced when visiting the Nizip camp. </p><p>  The conflict in Syria has been a major priority for Ireland and the EU over the last two years and will remain at the top of our foreign policy agenda during the remainder of Ireland&rsquo;s EU Presidency. We will continue to use whatever influence we have in our Presidency role and at all levels of our international engagement to support and promote European and UN efforts towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p></reply>

This has included direct discussion of the issue at the highest level with President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker of the House Boehner, Secretaries of State Kerry and Clinton and the main Congressional leaders on the issue from both the Republican and Democratic Parties. The most recent round of political level engagements with these leaders occurred during the St Patrick&rsquo;s Day visit to Washington by the Taoiseach and me.  Prior to this, I had also discussed the issue with Senator John McCain, Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.    The Embassy in Washington, led by our Ambassador, continue to implement the Government&rsquo;s lobbying strategy on a daily basis, including regular meetings with Senators, Congressmen and their key staffers from both parties. This strategy is executed in very close consultation with the key Irish immigration reform organisations in the United States, including the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, the Chicago Celts, the Ancient Order of Hibernians and the Coalition of Irish Emigration Centres. We have also provided significant financial support through the Emigrant Support Programme to assist several of these organisations.</p><p>  I am therefore fully satisfied that the Government&rsquo;s campaign is targeted, strategic and is successfully connected at the highest level within the Administration and in Congress.      </p><p>  The advice of Ireland&rsquo;s friends and contacts within the US Administration and Congress has long been that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which such a resolution can be achieved.</p><p>  While immigration remains a very challenging issue in the United States, I am encouraged by the progress achieved since President Obama&rsquo;s re-election and by the legislative work already significantly advanced by the bipartisan group of 8 Senators.  In particular, I very much welcome the publication this week of a draft Senate Immigration Bill.  I can assure the Deputy the Government will continue to prioritise this issue and will maintain its ongoing close contact with all of the key players.</p></reply>

I have chaired each of these meetings. Members of the Council include Minister Bruton, Minister Varadkar, Minister Coveney and Minister of State Costello. Other relevant Departments are represented at senior official level, while the Chief Executive Officers of Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, SFI, Forf&aacute;s and Tourism Ireland are also members..   The ETC&#8217;s role is to strengthen cooperation and coordination across all Government Departments and State Agencies involved in the promotion and development of trade, tourism and investment, and to oversee the progressive implementation of the recommendations set out in the Government Trade Strategy, <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy</i>  .    </p><p>Matters discussed at meetings reflect these goals. For example, at our most recent meeting, the Council considered progress made in 2012 in achieving the targets for export, tourism, FDI and jobs growth set out in <i>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy</i>   and discussed opportunities for Ireland presented by the ongoing negotiation of a number of Free Trade Agreements between the EU and third countries. The schedule of EI trade missions for 2013, which Minister Bruton and I approved, was also reviewed. Examples of other areas which have been considered in previous meetings are my Department&#8217;s Africa Strategy; visa issues and their impact of trade, tourism and investment in Ireland; and the issue of education and skills, which Minister Quinn briefed the Council on at its meeting of 20 September 2012. </p><p>I believe that the role of the Export Trade Council is key in ensuring a coherent and joined up approach to meeting our growth and jobs targets in the areas of trade, tourism and investment and in identifying areas in which Departments and agencies can work effectively together in promoting Ireland in overseas markets.

These frameworks are published on the Department of Finance website. I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as per the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.</p><p>  However, AIB has informed me of the following:</p><p>  While AIB&rsquo;s standard notes lodged fee is one of the most competitive in the market, we are aware that the above changes will impact on c. 5% of our business customers.  </p><p>  Changes to European Regulations in 2011 have meant that AIB is now obliged to check cash lodgements for fitness and authenticity before lodgement to the Central Bank.  Historically, AIB has been one of the only Banks to offer a discount to some of its business customers who prepared lodgements to an agreed standard.  This removed the requirement to check the cash in such lodgements and thus allowed for reduced cash handling/notes lodged rates (&euro;0.25 and &euro;0.17) off the standard &euro;0.45c per &euro;100 fee. </p><p>  As a result of the manual nature now involved in checking/counting cash, a review has taken place of AIB&rsquo;s historical cash handling fees.</p><p>  In this regard, we have written to all impacted customers offering them the opportunity to approach the Bank to discuss their transaction fee arrangements in advance of the next fee charging period. These discussions and any potential revised fee negotiation and transaction fee arrangements can be put in place up to 30th August next and back dated to the start of that fee quarter. AIB&rsquo;s business customers often negotiate individual fee arrangements based on their specific circumstances and needs, and the bank is offering them the opportunity to do so in the coming months in order to minimise the impact of the above changes.</p><p>  More broadly, there may be opportunities for business customers to reduce their overall cash handling and fees through some electronic banking services such as:</p><p> - AIB&rsquo;s Point of Sale systems</p><p> - AIB has also launched its &lsquo;contactless payment&rsquo; service for transactions up to &euro;15 which involves customers holding their card up to a secure reader which records the transaction in seconds</p><p> - For business customers with larger cash lodgement requirements, the use of AIB&rsquo;s centralised Lodgement Processing may reduce costs. </p><p>  - In-store ATM&rsquo;s offers the ability to recycle cash and which may reduce cash lodgement costs.&rdquo;</p></reply>

The chargeable value is defined in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, as amended, and means the price that the unencumbered fee simple of a residential property might be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market, were that property to be sold on the valuation date of 1 May 2013, in a manner that would secure the best possible price for the property.  In assessing the market value of a residential property no account may be taken of any encumbrance on the property.  Therefore, any restrictions on the sale of the units in the complex referred to are not relevant when establishing the chargeable value for Local Property Tax purposes.  The individual units should be valued as if there was no restriction on their sale.  However, the state of the completion of the complex, including the common areas, is clearly a relevant factor in assessing the valuation band for the individual units.</p></reply>

Revenue&#8217;s strategy in this regard is to ensure taxpayers have a choice of payment options available to them from which they can choose the method which is most suited to their individual circumstances.  If the person in question is concerned about his/her ability to pay LPT in a single payment then he/she may wish to consider one of the phased payment options that spreads payment in instalments across the year.  The various payment options are detailed in &#8216;Chapter 11&#8217; of the Revenue booklet &#8216;Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217;.  For example, LPT can be deducted at source on a phased basis from salaries or occupational pensions or from certain payments from the Department of Social Protection.  The Revenue Commissioners advise that, where deduction at source is chosen, there is no additional administration or interest charge.</p><p>  Payments can also be made by direct debit from current accounts in banks and other financial institutions including credit unions.  In addition, liable persons can avail of phased payment facilities through Revenue-approved third party payment service providers, which are An Post TaxPay, Payzone and Omnivend.  These service providers, each of which has extensive nationwide outlets, will accept either full or phased payments in cash or by debit/credit cards.  Charges are however imposed by the payment service providers on a per transaction basis.  I am advised that An Post levies a charge of &#8364;1 per transaction, while Omnivend charges a fee of 4% per transaction.  I understand that Payzone will be introducing the following charges this week: 75 cent per transaction for payments up to &#8364;50, &#8364;1 per transaction for payments between &#8364;50.01 and &#8364;100 and &#8364;2 per transaction for payments over &#8364;100.</p><p>  The person in question may qualify for either a full or partial deferral of LPT as provided for by the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012.  Chapter 12 of the Revenue booklet &#8216; Your guide to Local Property Tax&#8217; sets out in detail the various types of deferral that are available and Revenue has also published extensive guidelines on the various types of deferrals, including examples, on its website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.  To qualify for a deferral, the person&#8217;s residential property must be occupied by him/her as a sole or main residence. The income thresholds for a full deferral are &#8364;15,000 for a single person or widow/er and &#8364;25,000 for a couple, whether married persons, civil partners or cohabitants. An increased income threshold of 80% of mortgage interest payments may also apply if the person&#8217;s property is subject to a mortgage.</p><p>  The Deputy should note that deferral is not an exemption.  Payment of the tax is deferred, meaning that it becomes payable later and carries an interest charge at a rate of 4% per annum on all amounts of LPT that are deferred. Any deferred amount, including interest, will be a charge on the property and will have to be paid to Revenue on any future sale/transfer of the property.</p></reply>

However, by way of general information the following may be of relevance in this case.  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the liable person in relation to a residential property is generally the owner of the property for the purposes of the charge to LPT.  This is on the basis that he or she has the right to immediate possession of the property or is entitled to receive the rent if the property is rented rather than occupied by the owner.  However, in a situation where an owner has given a substantial interest in his or her property to another person, that other person may become the liable person instead of the owner.  This would happen, for example, where the owner has leased the property to a lessee/tenant for a period of at least 20 years.</p><p>  In this case, the Deputy has indicated that the company is the owner of the properties so, assuming that it has not created at least a 20-year leasehold interest in these properties, it would appear to be the liable person.  On the other hand, if the landlord is the owner of the properties and has merely engaged his or her company to manage the properties without conveying an interest of at least 20 years in the properties to the company, the landlord would be the liable person.</p></reply>

This is essential if they are to return to profitability, be in a position to support the economy and repay the State&rsquo;s investment through a return to private ownership.  On behalf of the Government, I have now directed the banks to come up with plans as to how they intend to address this issue in a manner that can help meet the State&rsquo;s objectives.  I expect the value of those plans to mean a saving of 6% - 10% of total remuneration costs, through reductions in payroll and pension benefits, new working arrangements and structures that deliver efficiency gains.  Tackling the cost base is of course only one of many goals that need to be achieved but combined with other measures will deliver the required results.</p><p>  I, and the Government, acknowledge that the sacrifices and changes made by bank employees to date at all levels and recognise that this has been achieved without major industrial unrest in what is a critically important sector.  However, it can never be forgotten by management and employees of these banks &ndash; both past and present &ndash; that without enormous cost to Irish taxpayers these institutions would not have survived and that this needs to be borne in mind during future discussions.  If remuneration costs are to be reduced with the aim of a return to profitability then sacrifices at all employee levels will be required.</p></reply>

It is a matter for an owner of a residential property to determine liability and pay the charge.  The Local Government Management Agency is administering the Household Charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils.  The agency has been working with the Revenue Commissioners to support the introduction of the Local Property Tax (LPT), including in relation to arrangements under section 156 of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012, which concerns the treatment of Household Charge arrears.  The arrears of the Household Charge for 2012 will be capped at &euro;130 if paid to the Local Government Management Agency by 30 April 2013. </p><p>  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they will receive the final register of those who have paid the Household Charge by 1 July later in the year.

Revenue will pursue this additional liability when the LPT system is fully operational.  Interest and penalties under the LPT system will apply to the additional &euro;200.  It is in the interest of all those who have not yet paid the Household Charge to do so as promptly as possible, or they will end up with an additional LPT liability.</p></reply>

The Register was developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue&rsquo;s own databases (which includes details from the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge database), the Local Government Management Agency database, and data from utility companies.  This register has been used to issue correspondence to property owners and, by 16 April 2013, Revenue had issued 1.29 million letters to owners of 1.6 million properties. </p><p>  It is expected that letters will issue this week to owners of approximately 35,000 properties.  Given the scale of the task involved and the multiple sources that have been used to create the register, I understand the Revenue Commissioners are continuing to update it with new cases as they come to light and letters will continue to issue to newly identified property owners as a result.  This may include a certain number of non-resident liable persons.  I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, according to the LPT Register, there are about 154,000 owners of multiple properties who are liable to pay the tax on approximately 470,000 properties.</p><p>  The Commissioners can confirm that 4,381 letters have issued to individuals who are described on Revenue&rsquo;s records as non-residents.  According to the LPT Register, these individuals own 7,736 residential properties in the State.  Revenue also advises that included in the 1.29 million letters that have issued to date are letters to two further categories of property owner that are potentially non-resident.  A number of letters have issued to foreign addresses and Revenue is aware that letters will have issued to an Irish address where the person who owns the property is residing outside the State, because Revenue would not be aware in the normal course of a change of residence.  It is not possible to provide any definitive numbers in respect of these categories of property owners until LPT Returns have been filed and the necessary analysis has been completed.  The Commissioners advise that a number of non-residents have already engaged with the process and fully met their obligations.</p><p>  The Commissioners also advise that where an owner is not on Revenue&rsquo;s register a Return will not issue.  However, such owners are still obliged to complete and file an LPT Return by the relevant deadline &ndash; 7 May for paper filers and 28 May for electronic filers.  As part of its media campaign this week Revenue is advising property owners that, if they have not yet received an LPT Return from Revenue, they should request a paper form by contacting Revenue&rsquo;s LPT Helpline or accessing the on-line system on Revenue&rsquo;s website to file their LPT Return on-line.  I am also advised that even where a property owner has not received a Property ID and PIN code from Revenue, they will still be able to file their Return online.</p><p>  Every effort is being made to ensure that non-resident owners of residential properties in the State are aware of their obligations with regard to LPT.  Revenue is engaging in a public communications campaign and a substantial amount of information on the tax has been published on the Revenue website.  This information is being updated regularly and is accessible from abroad.  Non-resident owners have full access to the online filing system for LPT and can contact the LPT Helpline through a dedicated line for callers outside the State at +353 1 7023049, if they have any queries or require assistance with filing their Returns on-line.  I understand that, to date, 6,131 phone calls have come through this telephone number.</p><p>  As part of the general issue of LPT Returns, property owners also receive a Notice of Estimate of LPT.  This is the amount of LPT that will be pursued by Revenue, in accordance with the LPT legislation, if the resident or non-resident owner does not complete and submit their LPT Return.  </p><p>  The compliance strategies for non-resident property owners will vary depending on whether the property is let and whether there is a letting agent, etc.  The legislation provides that Revenue may require anybody acting as an agent in relation to a letting or who receives rent provide details on request in relation to the property.  A tenant may also be required to give the relevant details.  I am further advised that the normal compliance and debt recovery provisions apply to LPT as apply to the collection and recovery of other taxes and duties under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners.  This includes the attachment of rent payable.  An additional mechanism that Revenue can invoke in the case of residents of countries with which Ireland has a double taxation convention is the exchange of information provisions which would assist with profiling, and corresponding with, the individual involved.</p><p>  Finally, as the Deputy will be aware, any unpaid LPT will attach to the residential property, and the resident or non-resident owner will not be able to sell or transfer the property without paying the LPT, along with interest and penalties due.  I am advised by Revenue that their initial focus is on the completion of the Register, that it is clear that there is already a significant level of engagement with the tax, and that it is too early in the process to be specific on the strategies they will deploy to address compliance issues on the part of non-residents.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-18a.178.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041800041#WRF02000"><p>Income tax relief in respect of health expenses is allowable in accordance with section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  This legislation provides for tax relief for health expenses incurred in the provision of health care.  Health care is defined for the purposes of that legislation as the prevention, diagnosis, alleviation or treatment of an ailment, injury, infirmity, defect or disability and includes care received by a woman in respect of pregnancy.  Health care does not include routine ophthalmic or dental treatment.   The section provides that tax relief must be either for the costs of the services of a practitioner, defined as a person registered on the register established under the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, or diagnostic procedures carried out on the advice of a practitioner, which includes &ldquo;physiotherapy or similar treatment prescribed by a practitioner&rdquo;.  Eligibility for tax relief is limited to expenses relating to treatment considered necessary and appropriate by a qualified practitioner.</p><p>  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 consolidated all previous legislation pertaining to relief for health expenses, in particular section 12 of Finance Act 1967 which introduced the relief in the first instance.  This section also required that physiotherapy or similar treatment be prescribed by a practitioner before qualifying for relief.  This requirement has, therefore, been part of the qualifying criteria since the introduction of relief for health expenses and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that guidance and instructions to staff have remained unchanged in this regard.  For 2010 the cost of tax relief for health expenses was &euro;127 million and was availed of by 36,000 individuals who had sufficient income to benefit from a claim.  There is no specific breakdown in these figures of the costs related to physiotherapy.</p><p>  If self-referral for physiotherapy were allowed, an estimate of the additional cost would be unquantifiable, but, undoubtedly, it would increase the overall cost of health expenses relief to the Exchequer.  While the Government supports measures to lower the cost of medical treatment which should in turn lower the costs of health care provision by the State, an extension of the relief along the lines proposed would inevitably lead to calls for other treatments to similarly qualify for relief, which would greatly increase the overall cost of the scheme.  I would point out that this issue was raised during the debates in the Seanad on Finance Bill 2013 during which I agreed to re-examine the matter during the course of this year.</p></reply>

The 2012 Act provides that the State or other public bodies, including local authorities, will be liable for LPT on their properties in the same way as any other residential property owner, unless the properties in question are used to accommodate people with special housing needs such as the elderly or people with disabilities.   As LPT is a self-assessed tax it will be a matter for the property owner to calculate the tax due based on his or her assessment of the market value of the property.  In this regard it will be a matter for the relevant State/public body to establish a market value for each property and submit a completed LPT Return in respect of the properties in their ownership.  The 2012 Act provides that where local authority owned properties are not exempt from LPT, the market value of any such property will be deemed to fall into the lowest valuation band of zero to &euro;100,000 for the period up to and including 2016.  This will result in an LPT charge of &euro;45 per property for 2013 and &euro;90 per year for 2014 to 2016.  In addition, section 119 of the 2012 Act also gives local authorities until 1 January 2014 to pay the 2013 tax.

The LPT legislation provides that owners of multiple properties must file their LPT returns and pay their LPT online so cheque payment is not an option for this category of liable persons.   In circumstances where a single property owner chooses to pay by cheque, he/she should ensure to complete the LPT Return, attach a cheque for the full amount and send it to LPT Branch, P.O. Box 1, Limerick.    I draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Single Debt Authority (SDA) option, which Revenue has developed as part of its suite of flexible payment methods designed to make payment of LPT as easy and user friendly as possible.  The SDA, which operates like an &lsquo;electronic cheque&rsquo;, will not be deducted by Revenue from the person&rsquo;s bank account before 21 July 2013.  Any owner of a single property wishing to avail of the SDA option should simply complete the payslip at the bottom of the LPT 1 Return and send it to LPT Branch, P.O. Box 1, Limerick. </p></reply>

While this estimate is technically correct it does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence. In terms of an increase in the 12.5% rate, estimating the size of the behavioural effects is difficult but they are likely to be relatively significant. An OECD multi-country study found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduces inward investment by 3.7% on average. On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate (to 15%) to decrease Ireland&rsquo;s inward investment by nearly 10%. This assumes the average applies across the board but in fact the effect is likely to be more extreme for Ireland. </p><p>  The very major importance of maintaining the standard 12.5% rate of corporation tax to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitive position in the current climate must also be borne in mind. Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries. Ireland&rsquo;s low corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here. Recent research by the OECD also points to the importance of low corporate tax rates to encourage growth. </p><p>  Further, it would be difficult to justify such a move in the context of Ireland&rsquo;s stated position that we will not change our corporation tax strategy. Even a marginal change would undermine both our long held stance on this issue and the certainty of business, domestic and international, in our resolve to maintain that position.</p></reply>

In this regard  the administrator of Icarom obtained the approval of the High Court on 27 November 2012 for a portfolio transfer of all of Icarom&rsquo;s insurance liabilities to another regulated entity, EIFlow, in return for a payment of circa &euro;17 million. EIFlow is an EU-regulated company incorporated in Gibraltar and licensed by the Financial Services Commission in Gibraltar, and is  controlled by the shareholders of Quest Group Holdings Limited, a company which specialises in the servicing of the run off of insurance and reinsurance portfolios. </p><p>  Icarom has therefore disposed of its entire insurance business, and there  are no remaining outstanding liabilities of the State in respect of claims on the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. As a consequence the administration has been terminated and the company dissolved. </p><p>  It should also be noted that in completing this transaction the administrator was able to repay to the Insurance Compensation Fund a total of &euro;88,530,782.55. </p><p>  The Icarom administration was financed by loans from the State, one for IR&pound;100 million in 1985 which was repaid on schedule in 2000, and one for IR&pound;32 (&euro;40.6) million in 1993, which was repaid in 2002, ten years ahead of schedule. Icarom has also benefitted  from, inter alia, profits on the sale of the general insurance and life assurance  businesses (&euro;135 million), proceeds from a settlement with the Company&rsquo;s former auditors (&euro;49 million), the settlement of claims for less than their estimated cost (&euro;46 million) and contributions from AIB under a 1992 agreement with the State (&euro;224 million).</p><p>  Finally, the Deputy should be aware that at the time Icarom was placed in Administration in March 1985, there was great concern about what the ultimate cost to the taxpayer would be. The actual outturn is significantly better than was originally envisaged with both the life assurance and the general insurance businesses continuing to operate under new ownership and approximately &euro;88.5 million now being returned to the State.  The only cost to the State is the interest foregone of &euro;20.9m on the 1993 interest free loan of &euro;40.6m.</p></reply>

The Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of the Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) system following the introduction of a dedicated online facility on 1 January 2012, which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper free system. This has streamlined the process for the submission of information and payments to Revenue and has had the effect of significantly reducing the administrative burden associated with RCT. A feature of the new system is the online notification to principal contractors of the rate of tax to be applied to payments to subcontractors.   The system provides for three rates of deduction  - zero, 20% and 35%.  All subcontractors are issued with a Notification of Determination showing the deduction rate determined by the Revenue Commissioners for the subcontractor. This has removed the need for C2 certificates as the new online notification carries out the same function in a more efficient and streamlined way. </p><p>  The zero rate is only applied where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied, among other things, that the subcontractor has complied with all of his income tax, capital gains tax and VAT obligations throughout the previous three years.</p><p>  A newly registered subcontractor, who has no previous tax history or a subcontractor who has not complied with all of his income tax, capital gains tax and VAT obligations throughout the previous three years but who has complied substantially with those obligations is allocated a deduction rate of 20%, compared to 35% under the old RCT system. The rate of deduction is reviewed periodically and if the subcontractor meets the necessary conditions the deduction rate is adjusted to zero.</p><p>  In tandem with the introduction of the new system, the Department of Finance has revised the procedures for tax clearance in respect of public service contracts. In the case of all public sector contracts of a value of &euro;10,000 or more, the contractor will be required either to produce a current tax clearance certificate or demonstrate a satisfactory level of tax compliance. A subcontractor who is subject to the 20% rate is regarded as having a satisfactory level of tax compliance and can use the Notification of Determination to demonstrate this.</p><p>  Accordingly there is no intention or need to introduce a temporary C2 certificate. </p></reply>

The Landscape document published in February 2012 lays out a clear four stage process and criteria for institutes of technology who wish to apply for designation as a technological university. The process for designation is designed to ensure educational quality, objectivity, international expertise, fairness and transparency. The process will consist of four stages overseen by HEA, with an independent international panel of experts to advise the Authority in the final stages.</p><p>  The first stage requires institutes of technology to submit a formal expression of interest in merging and seeking designation. I understand from HEA that three such expressions of interest have been received including one from Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee.  The Higher Education Authority are considering all proposals and their advice on system configuration will include their advice on the progress of institutes of technology interested in seeking designation to the second stage of the designation process.  I am expecting to receive their advice for my consideration shortly.</p><p>  Having regard to the process that has been put in place to assess proposals for designation as technological universities I do not propose to comment specifically on any potential applications for designation by any group of Institutes of Technology.</p></reply>

The Board will oversee the use of the cash contributions of up to &euro;110 million pledged by the religious congregations to support the needs of some 15,000 survivors of residential institutional child abuse.</p><p>  The Board held its inaugural meeting on 27 March and has commenced work on the arrangements to be put in place for the operation of the Fund.  I am pleased to report that the Chief Executive Officer, Ms Mary Higgins, has recently taken up her post.  Following the dissolution of the Education Finance Board on the commencement of Part 4 of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act, 2012, with effect from 29 March 2013, the three staff of the Education Finance Board have transferred to and become staff of the new Fund Board. </p><p>  It is now a matter for the RISF Board to determine the range of approved services within the four classes of service stipulated in the Act, i.e. mental health services (including counselling and psychological support) health and personal social services, education services and housing services.  The Board is also required to determine the criteria by reference to which it will make decisions in respect of applications to it.</p><p>  The 15,000 former residents who will be eligible to receive support from the Fund are those persons who have received awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board or equivalent Court awards.  Further publicity will be undertaken as the work of the Board progresses and a website with detailed information on the Fund's services will be developed.</p></reply>

The first measure took effect on 1 September 2010.  It requires that, in order to be eligible to receive the qualified rate of pay and allowances, a person on their first appointment to teaching must be registered with the Teaching Council and appropriately qualified for that position or sector.  This was introduced for the purpose of ensuring quality and promoting professional standards in teaching and this goal has been strongly supported by the teacher unions.</p><p>  The second measure was taken as part of Budget 2011.  The last Government applied a reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service.  In the case of new teachers, a reduction of 10% was applied to pay and certain allowances and all new teachers were required to start on the first point of the scale rather than the third point as had previously been the case for most teachers.  The new pay rates applied to all teachers who were new appointees appointed on or after 1 January 2011.  Where a person gave any service - qualified or unqualified - in an analogous teaching position before 1 January 2011, he or she was not regarded as a new appointee to teaching and so was not affected by this measure.</p><p>  The third measure formed part of Budget 2012 and related to qualification allowances.  The Government announced that additional qualification allowances would not be payable to existing teachers and new teachers would be paid qualification allowances up to a maximum of the allowance applicable to an honours primary degree level.</p><p>  Furthermore, in 2012 a public service-wide review of allowances was also carried out by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and, pending its outcome, the payment of qualification allowances was suspended with effect from 1 February 2012.  As a result of the review, the Government abolished qualification allowances with effect from that date and a new salary scale was created with a starting point equivalent to the fourth point of the previous scale.  This reduced the impact of the ending of the qualification allowances and ensured a broad consistency across the public service.</p><p>  The introduction of this new salary scale has been a complex task which has required a detailed implementation process.  My Department, in consultation with VECs, is working through the operational aspects of these changes as they affect existing teachers and their pay.</p></reply>

The Irish Research Council has been established as a sub-board of the HEA and is not subject to a sunset clause.  Under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012, the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Higher Education Training Awards Council and the Further Education Training Awards Council were amalgamated into a new agency, Quality and Qualifications Ireland, on 6 November 2012 and is not subject to a sunset clause.  In June 2011, I announced that the Government had approved a revised reconfiguration of the Vocational Education Committees system.

Once established, the Education and Training Board will continue to provide a wide range of educational and training programmes into the future.</p><p>  In section 8.1.iv of the Public Service Reform plan contains a commitment to legislate for the establishment of SOLAS in addition to the rationalisation of the VECs.  My Department is in the process of establishing a further education and training authority, to be called SOLAS, which will result in the dissolution of F&Aacute;S.  The Further Education and Training Bill was published in January 2012 and is expected to be enacted before the summer recess.  In addition, the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board was established in March 2013 under the provisions of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 and is not subject to a sunset clause.  As a result of the establishment of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board, the Education Finance Board has been dissolved and its remaining functions have been transferred to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.</p></reply>

We are bringing public expenditure back to a sustainable level and driving forward the public service reform agenda to ensure that efficiencies and reformed work practices play a full part in contributing to the overall budgetary consolidation effort.</p><p>  As regards discussions with the Troika regarding the achievements made to date, there has been a series of meetings held with the Troika to appraise all the elements of the Programme covering fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments regarding restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform.  A substantial number of actions &ndash; over 200 taking into account Q1 2013 - have now been completed. Ireland&rsquo;s continued strong implementation record has been recognised by our European Partners, by the IMF and by the financial markets despite the continuing deterioration of the international economy and the recent return to uncertainty. The Programme remains well financed and we have already started to regain market access as envisaged with a number of successful initiatives this year. As we have said repeatedly, the Government remains focused on achieving our commitments as set under the EU/IMF programme, including the fiscal targets.</p><p>With regard to cost cutting measures, the Government began its process of medium-term expenditure management with the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE) exercise in 2011, which was carried out by all Departments to identify ways of reducing expenditure, in line with commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  Ministerial expenditure ceilings for 2012 - 2014 were introduced in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report, published in December 2011, which were set in line with consolidation targets over the medium term.  The arrangements for these three-year ceilings will be put onto a statutory footing following the enactment of the Ministers &amp; Secretaries (Amendment) Act 2012   later this year. </p><p>  While good progress has been made on delivering savings and implementing change, it remains a matter for each Minister and their Departments to ensure that the Vote-level allocations are adhered to and at the same time ensure that they continue to provide essential services and respond to increasing demands.	</p><p>The annual detail Revised Estimates Volume (REV) 2013   sets out details of the financial allocations for each Department and, as part of our expenditure reform initiative, it also contains performance information on the key outputs and outcomes being delivered by Departments through the use of public funds.  This information has been built into the heart of the budgetary documentation.  Through performance budgeting, Dail Committees will in future know what public service outputs and outcomes are being delivered with public funds and this can inform their work and discussion.</p><p>The REV 2013   (published yesterday) shows, for each key area of Government spend, output and performance information for 2012 and targets for 2013.</p></reply>

As part of this annual review process, savings returns are completed and returned to the Body in respect of every sector, Department and Office.  </p><p>  The Body has carried out two annual reviews of the Agreement to date. The two Annual Progress Reports published on foot of these reviews show that the Agreement has delivered on the objectives of facilitating significant savings and reform in a climate of industrial peace. For example, approximately &euro;1.5bn in savings has been facilitated by the Agreement during its first two years, comprising of &euro;810m and &euro;678m in sustainable pay bill and non-pay (efficiency) savings respectively.</p><p>  The reports of the Body also show that significant reforms have been delivered across the sectors of the public service, including for example: </p><p>1. Extensive redeployment and reassignment of staff, for example in the health and education sectors</p><p>2. Progress on rationalising structures and office requirements, for example Department of Agriculture and Revenue local offices, court venues and Teagasc offices</p><p>3. Introduction of revised rosters, for example in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and health service locations to better match resources with demands</p><p>4. Local authorities have changed structures, the way in which services are delivered and the way staff are organized and deployed in order to manage the significant reduction in staff in the sector, as approximately 8,500 have left the sector since 2008.</p><p>  The Implementation Body is currently undertaking the third annual review of the Agreement which will assess the level of savings achieved and progress on implementing the reform commitments under the framework of that Agreement during the relevant period. I expect that the Body&rsquo;s review will be completed in the coming weeks and its third annual report will be published soon after.</p></reply>

My Department has already had contact with the Deputy's correspondent.  My Department has provided the Deputy's correspondent in this matter with the contact details of the relevant Development Adviser in Enterprise Ireland who is available to discuss his proposal with him and who can provide him with details of the supports available from Enterprise Ireland to entrepreneurs and early stage companies that have an innovative product, service or technology, and have the potential to achieve exports sales and create employment.  These supports include: </p><p><b><i>Pre Investment Supports for High Potential Start-Ups (HPSUs)</i></b></p><p><b><i>New Frontiers Entrepreneur Development Programme</i></b>  This national incubation programme offers successful applicants a package of supports to help accelerate their business development and to equip them with the skills to successfully start and grow a company. </p><p><b><i>HPSU Feasibility Grant</i></b>  Used to investigate the viability and potential of an innovative/high potential start-up and the development of an Investor Ready Business Plan. </p><p><b><i>Innovative HPSU Fund (Equity)</i></b>  The Innovative HPSU Fund allows Enterprise Ireland to offer equity investment to HPSU clients, on a co-funded basis to support the implementation of company business plans.  First time and follow-on equity investments in HPSUs are supported under this offer.</p><p><b><i>Mentor Grant</i></b>  Used to support the cost of a Mentor Assignment.  Enterprise Ireland can match an entrepreneur with an experienced business mentor to assist the start-up phase or advise on specific areas of a company development plan.</p><p><b><i>Innovation Voucher  </i></b>Innovation Vouchers, worth &#8364;5,000, are available to assist a company to work with a registered college or knowledge provider to explore a business opportunity or technical problem. </p><p><b><i>Internet Growth Acceleration Programme (iGAP)</i></b>  A 6 month intensive management development programme aimed exclusively at high potential internet/games companies.</p><p>As I outlined previously, funding from the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) would be suitable for small start-up enterprises, such as those linked with the SIABH hub proposal.  Eligible clients may qualify for a Priming Grant, which is a business start-up grant that is available to micro enterprises within the first 18 months of start-up.  The grants are subject to certain criteria, such as commercial viability, avoidance of displacement of jobs elsewhere in the economy, creation of sustainable employment, etc.  The typical Priming Grant payable is 50% of the investment or &#8364;80,000, whichever is the lesser, although funding of up to &#8364;150,000 may be provided in exceptional circumstances.  Students wishing to engage with the local enterprise board following graduation may wish to note that the contact person for Dublin CEB is Greg Swift, CEO, 5th Floor, O'Connell Bridge House, Dublin 2, tel: 01-635 1144, email: gswift@dceb.ie, website: www.dceb.ie, although contact details for all CEBs are available on .&quot;</p><p>  It is a requirement of all approved applications that matching funding is available from the applicant for investment in the venture.  This requirement for matching funding is a proven technique in stimulating change, in that the commitment of entrepreneurs to development projects is significantly increased by virtue of the promoter having a financial interest in the success of the business. In this regard, the availability of the Microenterprise Loan Fund might be of benefit to Mr Bell&#8217;s students in overcoming this condition.</p><p>  The Microenterprise Loan Fund was launched on the 27 September 2012 to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks.</p><p>  The Fund provides support in the form of loans of up to &#8364;25,000, available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.</p><p>  Generally loans will be provided for business start-up costs, expansions costs and working capital.  Due to its focus on job creation and the benefits this creates, the new Microenterprise Loan Fund will have a greater risk appetite than Banks could possibly have and therefore will be able to fund and help create and sustain additional micro-enterprises which cannot satisfy conventional Bank credit criteria.</p><p>  Further information on the Scheme is available at  and by telephone on 01-2601007.</p></reply>

The system of industrial relations in Ireland is designed to help and support parties in their efforts to resolve their differences, rather than imposing a solution on the parties to an industrial dispute.</p><p>  The Labour Relations Commission provides a free conciliation service, in which a trained facilitator assists employers and workers to resolve disputes when their own unassisted efforts have not succeeded.  The Labour Court acts as an industrial relations tribunal to provide a free, comprehensive service for the resolution of industrial relations disputes, where the parties to a dispute have been unable to reach agreement.  Since the Labour Court is a court of last resort in the industrial relations process, it is expected that the parties come to the process in good faith and, consequently, are prepared to accept the outcome of the process, namely, the Labour Court recommendation.</p><p>  Responsibility for the settlement of this dispute rests, ultimately, with the parties themselves.  The obligation lies with the parties to seek to resolve their differences and to carry their efforts through to completion.  Continued engagement with the State's industrial relations machinery offers, in my view, the best way whereby the parties involved in this dispute can hope to resolve their differences.</p><p>  In addition to the industrial relations process, there exists a body of legislation to protect workers in redundancy situations such as the Protection of Employment Act, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, the Payment of Wages Act and the Redundancy Payments Acts.  In particular, the Protection of Employment Act 1977 provides for a mandatory consultation process between the employer and the employee representatives and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 guarantees minimum notice of redundancy, or compensation in lieu of notice, to employees.</p><p>  Information on employment rights is available from the National Employment Rights Authority:  either from its website www.employmentrights.ie or by contacting an Information Officer directly at 1890 80 80 90.</p><p>  Policy matters relating to F&aacute;ilte Ireland are a matter for my colleague Mr Leo Varadakar, Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, while issues regarding the day-to-day operations of a public body should be directed to the Chief Executive of the relevant body.</p></reply>

Even an improvement of a few percent represents major cost savings.</p><p>  A PSC is currently issued following a &ldquo;face-to-face&rdquo; registration process which involves the capture of an individual&rsquo;s photograph and signature, the verification of identity and current address as well as the capture of additional data such as answers to security questions to be used in ensuring the future integrity of customers&rsquo; data.</p><p>  Letters which are issuing from the Department to a number of customers in relation to registration for their PSC ask them to bring proof of identity and evidence of current address with them.</p><p>  The legislative basis for the SAFE registration process is contained in the 2005 Social Welfare Consolidation Act as amended. Section 15 of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2012 amended the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005 to provide that:</p><p>i) for any new claim for social welfare payment, the claimant must satisfy the Minister for Social Protection as to his or her identity and</p><p>ii) the Minister for Social Protection must be satisfied as to the identity of a person to whom a Public Services Card (as provided for in Section 263 of the 2005 Act) is issued.</p><p>  Section 15 further provides that, in order satisfy himself or herself as to the identity of a person, the Minister may request him or her to personally attend at a location designated by the Minister, to present documentation supporting authentication of his or her identity and to allow for capture of a photograph and a signature.</p></reply>

The first two elements involve the enhancement of the website www.keepingyourhome.ie and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.</p><p>  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders.  This advice is provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.  This panel is available on a county by county basis on the website www.keepingyourhome.ie.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender advises the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &euro;250 to an accountant of the borrower&rsquo;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  </p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.</p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as required by borrowers.  While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a full review of the service before the due date of June 2013.  The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.</p></reply>

These are all habitats that are afforded protection under the EU Habitats Directive. To conserve this site, it will be necessary to restrict turf-cutting and associated drainage activities that would have a detrimental effect on these habitats.  However, the bog in question is unusual as a raised bog SAC, in that there are areas of cutover bog which do not contain protected habitats and are not hydrologically linked to the parts of the site that contain such habitats. In most raised bog SACs, turf-cutting may no longer take place because such cutting and conservation of the site are incompatible.  The particular circumstances of the bog referred to in the Deputy's Questions may allow for a continuation of turf-cutting in some parts of the site in full compliance with the requirements of the Habitats Directive, and may also facilitate the conservation of the protected habitat through the relocation of turf-cutters away from sensitive areas of the site.</p><p>  My officials have been engaging constructively with the turf-cutting community in the area, who have refrained from turf-cutting while such a solution is being put in place.  Turf-cutters are availing of financial payments or the delivery of turf while this issue is being resolved, which I hope will be fully addressed through the National Raised Bog Management Plan and in time for the turf-cutting season of 2014.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-04-18a.441.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1069" speakername="Fergus O'Dowd" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013041800041#WRS00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 167 and 168 together.</p><p>  There have been four commercial natural gas discoveries since exploration began offshore Ireland in the early 1970s, namely the Kinsale, Ballycotton and Seven Heads (Kinsale area) producing gas fields off the coast of Cork and the Corrib gas field off the coast of Mayo.  There have been no commercial discoveries of oil to date.</p><p>  The Kinsale area gas fields are now nearing depletion and currently provide approximately 5% of Ireland&rsquo;s annual gas requirements.  The Corrib gas field is under development and first gas is not anticipated before late 2014.  All four gas fields are held under petroleum leases issued by my Department.</p><p>  In terms of the direct financial contribution to the State, profits from the three Kinsale area gas fields are taxed at a rate of 25%.  In addition, royalties from the Kinsale and Ballycotton gas fields are payable to the State at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head.  The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields.</p><p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field or from future production from the Corrib gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987.  Profits from the Corrib gas field will be taxed at 25% when the field goes into production.</p><p>  A comprehensive review of Ireland&rsquo;s licensing terms was carried out in 2007 following which both the fiscal and non-fiscal licensing terms were revised.  The revised terms seek to strike a balance between attracting those willing to invest in high-risk exploration while at the same time ensuring the State receives a fair share of profits where a commercial discovery is made.  The revised licensing terms provide for a new profit resource rent tax of up to 15% in addition to the 25% corporate tax rate previously applying.  The revised terms ensure that the return to the State will increase to a maximum of 40% in the case of the most profitable fields.  The revised terms apply to all exploration licences issued since the beginning of 2007.</p><p>  Countries that have petroleum production use a range of models to obtain a financial return from their natural resources.  These models vary both in terms of the instruments used and in terms of the level of take which the State seeks to obtain.  Some countries use a combination of instruments, such as: State participation in licences; production royalties; along with taxation, while other countries, including Ireland, take an approach that is principally based on taxing profits.  Each country&rsquo;s fiscal system tends to have its own individual characteristics.</p><p>  In determining the appropriate approach at a national level a range of factors must be considered, with the principal factor being the relative prospectivity of the area.  Directly replicating the fiscal regime of another country is unlikely to provide the optimum outcome.  Regard must also be had to the approach adopted by countries with whom we are directly competing for a share of international exploration investment.</p><p>  While there has been a modest but welcome upturn in the level of interest in exploration off our coast in recent years, the reality is that the only commercial discoveries of hydrocarbons made in the Irish offshore to date are the three producing gas fields in the Kinsale area and the Corrib gas field.  Despite the low level of commercial discoveries to date, working petroleum systems are known to exist in many of Ireland&rsquo;s offshore basins, as demonstrated by a number of non-commercial discoveries as well as other oil and gas indicators such as hydrocarbon shows in wells.  Nevertheless, the oil and gas potential of the Irish offshore is largely unproven and is likely to remain so until there is a significant and sustained increase in the number of exploration wells being drilled from the current levels of 1 to 2 wells per year.</p><p>  To this end my Department encourages exploration investment through an active and targeted promotion campaign, regular licensing rounds and by supporting petroleum research projects that deepen knowledge of the petroleum potential of the Irish offshore.  Maintaining an appropriate fiscal regime is also critical to attracting this much need exploration investment to Ireland.  Ireland does not have proven resources equivalent to those of major oil producing countries such as Norway, and as a consequence Ireland&rsquo;s tax terms for oil and gas production are deliberately aimed at attracting new investment and are set at a level comparable to countries such as France, Portugal and Spain, who, like Ireland, have limited petroleum production and proven resources and with whom we compete for exploration investment.</p></reply>

The market has since developed into a well-regulated market, supporting a multiplicity of commercial operators, providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms.  Details of broadband services available in each County, including County Kerry, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at www.callcosts.ie.</p><p>The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market has failed to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Rural Broadband Scheme.  NBS services are available within 85 of the 166 Electoral Divisions in County Kerry, including the general area of Waterville.  I have attached a list of these Electoral Divisions.</p><p>With basic broadband services widely available across Ireland, the focus is now on accelerating the roll out of high speed services.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August last, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed services of at least 30Mbps are available to all of our citizens and businesses, well in advance of the EU&rsquo;s target date of 2020, and that significantly higher speeds are available to as many homes and businesses as possible.</p><p>During the preparation of Ireland&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, the commercial market operators indicated that they expect to provide 70Mbps to 100Mbps services to 50% of the population by 2015.  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and mobile high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.</p><p>The Government is also committed in the Plan to investing in areas where high speed services are not commercially viable and will not be provided by the market.  In an important milestone towards delivery of this commitment in the Plan, my Department has identified, following the evaluation of tender responses to a request for experts, the preferred bidder to assist in the design, planning and procurement of the State-led investment. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations including stakeholder engagement will be ongoing throughout 2013 with a view to the launch of a procurement process in 2014.  High-speed broadband services can be delivered by a diverse range of technology platforms and it is intended to adopt a technology-neutral approach in this procurement process.</p><p>Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, we are committed to increasing the availability of next generation speeds significantly, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in a digitally enabled society.  I would reiterate that the Government remains committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland, including all of County Kerry, will have at least 30Mbps connectivity, through public or private sector investment, as outlined in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p><b>Electoral Divisions (ED) Covered by the NBS in County Kerry</b></p><p><table><tr><th><b>ED Name </b></th><th><b>ED Reference No.</b></th></tr><tr><td>  AGHADOE</td><td>ED 77002</td></tr><tr><td>  ARDEA</td><td>ED 77006</td></tr><tr><td>  BAHAGHS</td><td>ED 77009</td></tr><tr><td>  BALLINSKELLIGS </td><td>ED 77011</td></tr><tr><td>  BALLYBRACK</td><td>ED 77013</td></tr><tr><td>  BALLYDUFF </td><td>ED 77016</td></tr><tr><td>  BANAWN </td><td>ED 77026</td></tr><tr><td>  BOOLTEENS</td><td>ED 77031</td></tr><tr><td>  BRANDON </td><td>ED 77032</td></tr><tr><td>  BREWSTERFIELD </td><td>ED 77033</td></tr><tr><td>  BROSNA </td><td>ED 77034</td></tr><tr><td>  CANUIG </td><td>ED 77037</td></tr><tr><td>  CAPPAGH</td><td>ED 77038</td></tr><tr><td>  CARKER </td><td>ED 77039</td></tr><tr><td>  CARRAGH </td><td>ED 77040</td></tr><tr><td>  CASTLEGREGORY</td><td>ED 77043</td></tr><tr><td>  CHURCHTOWN </td><td>ED 77047</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOGHANE</td><td>ED 77048</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOON </td><td>ED 77050</td></tr><tr><td>  CLOONTUBBRID </td><td>ED 77051</td></tr><tr><td>  CLYDAGH </td><td>ED 77052</td></tr><tr><td>  COOLIES</td><td>ED 77053</td></tr><tr><td>  COOM </td><td>ED 77054</td></tr><tr><td>  CORDAL</td><td>ED 77055</td></tr><tr><td>  CRINNY</td><td>ED 77056</td></tr><tr><td>  CURRAGHBEG</td><td>ED 77057</td></tr><tr><td>  CURRAGHMORE </td><td>ED 77058</td></tr><tr><td>  DARRYNANE </td><td>ED 77060</td></tr><tr><td>  DAWROS </td><td>ED 77061</td></tr><tr><td>  DEELIS </td><td>ED 77062</td></tr><tr><td>  DERREEN </td><td>ED 77063</td></tr><tr><td>  DERRIANA </td><td>ED 77064</td></tr><tr><td>  DOOCARRIG </td><td>ED 77066</td></tr><tr><td>  DROMMARTIN</td><td>ED 77069</td></tr><tr><td>  DROMORE </td><td>ED 77070</td></tr><tr><td>  DUAGH </td><td>ED 77071</td></tr><tr><td>  DUNQUIN </td><td>ED 77073</td></tr><tr><td>  DUNURLIN</td><td>ED 77074</td></tr><tr><td>  EMLAGH</td><td>ED 77075</td></tr><tr><td>  FLESK </td><td>ED 77077</td></tr><tr><td>  GLANBEHY </td><td>ED 77078</td></tr><tr><td>  GLANLEE </td><td>ED 77079</td></tr><tr><td>  GLANLOUGH </td><td>ED 77080</td></tr><tr><td>  GLANMORE </td><td>ED 77081</td></tr><tr><td>  GLIN </td><td>ED 77082</td></tr><tr><td>  GNEEVES </td><td>ED 77083</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th><b>ED Name </b></th><th><b>ED Reference No.</b></th></tr><tr><td>  GREENANE </td><td>ED 77084</td></tr><tr><td>  HEADFORT </td><td>ED 77087</td></tr><tr><td>  INCH </td><td>ED 77088</td></tr><tr><td>  KERRYHEAD </td><td>ED 77090</td></tr><tr><td>  KILCUMMIN </td><td>ED 77092</td></tr><tr><td>  KILFEIGHNY </td><td>ED 77093</td></tr><tr><td>  KILFLYN </td><td>ED 77095</td></tr><tr><td>  KILGARRYLANDER </td><td>ED 77096</td></tr><tr><td>  KILGARVAN </td><td>ED 77097</td></tr><tr><td>  KILGOBBAN</td><td>ED 77098</td></tr><tr><td>  KILLINANE </td><td>ED 77105</td></tr><tr><td>  KILMALKEDAR </td><td>ED 77108</td></tr><tr><td>  KILMEANY </td><td>ED 77109</td></tr><tr><td>  KILMURRY </td><td>ED 77110</td></tr><tr><td>  KILNANARE</td><td>ED 77111</td></tr><tr><td>  KILQUANE </td><td>ED 77112</td></tr><tr><td>  KILSHENANE </td><td>ED 77113</td></tr><tr><td>  KNOCKNAGASHEL </td><td>ED 77118</td></tr><tr><td>  KNOCKNAHOE</td><td>ED 77119</td></tr><tr><td>  LACK </td><td>ED 77120</td></tr><tr><td>  LACKABAUN </td><td>ED 77121</td></tr><tr><td>  LICKEEN </td><td>ED 77124</td></tr><tr><td>  LOUGHBRIN </td><td>ED 77130</td></tr><tr><td>  LOUGHCURRANE </td><td>ED 77131</td></tr><tr><td>  MARHIN </td><td>ED 77132</td></tr><tr><td>  MASTERGEEHY </td><td>ED 77133</td></tr><tr><td>  MAUM </td><td>ED 77134</td></tr><tr><td>  MILLBROOK </td><td>ED 77135</td></tr><tr><td>  MOUNT EAGLE </td><td>ED 77139</td></tr><tr><td>  NEWTOWNSANDES</td><td>ED 77142</td></tr><tr><td>  NOHAVAL </td><td>ED 77143</td></tr><tr><td>  RATHEA </td><td>ED 77147</td></tr><tr><td>  RATHMORE </td><td>ED 77148</td></tr><tr><td>  ROCKFIELD </td><td>ED 77150</td></tr><tr><td>  ST FINAN'S </td><td>ED 77154</td></tr><tr><td>  TAHILLA </td><td>ED 77156</td></tr><tr><td>  TEERANEARAGH </td><td>ED 77159</td></tr><tr><td>  TRIENEARAGH </td><td>ED 77162</td></tr><tr><td>  VENTRY </td><td>ED 77166</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In accordance with the Guidelines, the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) carries out a value for money assessment of the proposed Public Private Partnership agreement.  It compares the PPP approach to a Public Sector Benchmark, which is presented as a single monetary value that represents the full estimated cost, taking income and risks into account, of delivering the project using &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; public sector procurement.</p><p>  In the case of the Dublin Waste to Energy project, in 2005, the NDFA advised that it was of the opinion that the preferred bidders&rsquo; financial model provided value for money.  Following corporate restructuring in 2007, the NDFA advised that the updated financial model provided value for money relative to public sector benchmark and there was no material change in the financial gain to the State from the position as registered in its previous assessment.</p><p>  The Waste to Energy facility proposed for Poolbeg is being developed by Dublin City Council on behalf of the four Dublin local authorities as part of the implementation of the region&rsquo;s waste management plan, which is a statutory responsibility of local authorities under section 22 of the Waste Management Act 1996.  Therefore, the progression of the project is a matter for parties to the contract, Dublin City Council and its private partner and discussions have been ongoing between the parties.  Upon conclusion of discussions between the parties, any revisions to the PPP agreement will be submitted to the NDFA for assessment and this will inform any further action which may be required.</p></reply>

At the time of that report there was no change to the number of members to be elected in Ireland. However, with the accession of Croatia to the European Union this year, there is a need to adjust the distribution of seats in the European Parliament.

Prior to this the LEADER elements were co-funded at a rate of 55% by the EU, with the remaining 45% coming from national exchequer sources.  The 2011 agreement reduced the national exchequer input to 15% on a net basis for 2012 and 2013 without a concomitant increase in the amount of funding to be provided by the EU.  This resulted in a reduction in the overall Programme complement from &euro;427m to approximately &euro;314m on the basis of the Programme achieving full spend by the end of 2013.</p><p>  However, given the levels of spending by the Local Development Companies (LDCs) from 2009 to date, it is very unlikely that full spend will be achieved by the end of 2013, at which time the co-funding rate will revert to 55% for all expenditure beyond that date.  As a consequence of this the overall Programme requirement will change.  In the context of these changes to the co-funding rate the original project allocations given to each LDC contracted to deliver the LEADER elements of the RDP require readjustment.</p><p>  An exercise is currently being carried out to determine the level of project commitments across all LDCs and all RDP measures in order to rebalance the programme in as equitable a way as possible.  This exercise is close to completion and the Department will be in touch with the LDCs shortly.</p></reply>

Since 2005 the level of recoupment of approved costs by my Department to water services authorities (local authorities) in respect of water mains rehabilitation or mains replacement projects was increased from 75% to 90% which reflects this high priority.

The Local Government Sector has used Service Indicators to monitor sick leave for a number of years.  Based on figures reported by local authorities, the total number of days lost in the sector to absenteeism rose slightly from 346,750 in 2010 to 350,224 in 2011.  A significant quantum of the sick leave reported also includes unpaid sick leave where individuals are on long-term sick leave.</p><p>  The nature of work carried out by front-line local authority staff also has an impact on absenteeism levels.  Front-line services include fire and ambulance services, roads, environment, water and drainage services, parks and recreation and leisure services, housing services including homeless and welfare services.  By their nature, these services can lead to occupational injury.  The front-line nature of local authority service delivery differentiates it from office based activities of certain other areas of the public service.  There is no specific Occupational Injury Scheme in place in the sector compared to other sectors (e.g. Garda&iacute;, Health, Prison Service) and any occupational injuries arising are reckoned and reported as general sick leave.</p><p>  Local authority managers are taking a proactive role in attendance management.  Despite very challenging pressures in recent years, where the sector has reduced staffing levels by 8,900 WTE (24%), there has been an increased emphasis on improved reporting and better systems.  An Attendance Management Policy and Procedure was issued to the sector in 2006 and revised and updated in 2011, including a resource pack for managers aimed at assisting local authorities in maintaining and / or improving attendance levels and ensuring consistency of practice throughout the sector.</p></reply>

In tandem with this commitment, Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings requires EU Member States, <i>inter alia</i>, to ensure that all new buildings will be nearly zero-energy by 31 December 2020 (or by 31 December 2018 in the case of new buildings owned and occupied by public authorities). The Directive broadly defines a &#8216;nearly zero-energy building&#8217; as a building with a high energy performance where the very low amount of energy required should, to a very significant extent, be met by energy from renewable sources, including renewable energy produced onsite or nearby.</p><p>  Against this background, Ireland has been making significant progress in terms of both improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon dioxide emissions within the built environment.  The statutory minimum energy performance standards (including insulation requirements) for dwellings are addressed under Part L of the building Regulations and the accompanying Technical Guidance Document (TGD L Dwellings).  Taking the energy efficiency requirements established in 2005 as the benchmark, the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2007 set the requirements necessary to achieve a 40% improvement (over the 2005 standards) in the energy and carbon performance of new dwellings.  These regulations came into effect on 1 July 2008 subject to certain transitional arrangements.</p><p>Energy performance requirements were further upgraded under the Building Regulations (Part L Amendment) Regulations 2011, and the accompanying TGD L Dwellings 2011 sets out the current minimum energy performance and insulation requirements.  These regulations came into effect on 1 December 2011 and build on the substantial improvements already introduced under the 2007 regulations by delivering a 60% aggregate improvement (relative to 2005 standards) in both the energy and carbon performance of new buildings.  Part L 2011 marks an important step on the road to carbon neutrality and puts Ireland at the forefront of EU Member States in terms of energy efficiency standards for new dwellings.  All the signs indicate that Irish builders and manufacturers continue to innovate and adapt their approaches and products to meet new standards as they continue to evolve progressively over time.  This is important in terms of continuing the development of the market for energy efficient buildings and products domestically while also increasing the considerable potential that exists for high energy efficiency products in export markets.  The on-going review of regulations is important in maintaining the momentum that has already been created in this regard.</p><p>  My Department is also working on the development of a framework for achieving a nearly zero energy framework for dwellings in order to meet our obligations under Directive 2010/31/EU within the prescribed timeframe.  It is anticipated that the nearly zero energy framework for dwellings will require further amendments to the building regulations over and above the recent Part L 2011 requirements.</p></reply>

There are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department&rsquo;s behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.</p><p>Projects that request funding of &euro;150,000 or more are required to seek approval from my Department.  The assessment of these higher value projects usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company.  It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications.  It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme.  My Department currently has 52 projects at various stages of assessment and the LAGs that have projects currently undergoing assessment are listed below.</p><p>The policy in my Department is to work with the LAGs to ensure that the projects submitted are fully compliant and can be approved rather than to refuse approval for funding; it can therefore take some time to come to a final conclusion.  My Department will continue to work with the relevant LAGs to make a full assessment of the eligibility of these projects and will advise the LAGs once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>LAG</b></th><th><div><b>Date Received</b></div></th><th><b>Grant aid requested</b></th><th><div><b>Stage</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>Ballyhoura Development Ltd

Section 5 of the Act provides that the Minister may by order at any time revoke an establishment order.</p><p>  The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2012, enacted in June 2012, provided the legal framework for further implementation of the Department&rsquo;s Agency rationalisation programme with the overall number of Agencies reduced from 21 to 10.  The Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board were merged with the establishment of the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) in August 2012.  An Chomhairle Leabharlanna was dissolved on 1 November 2012 and its key residual functions were subsumed into the Local Government Management Agency.  The Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency (HSCA), also established in 2012, rationalises the functions of the National Building Agency (NBA), the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP) and the Centre for Housing Research (CHR).</p><p>  The operations of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (DDDA) will be wound up by the end of 2013 the intervening transitional period will allow the Authority to progress elements of on-going work and to make the necessary preparations for the migration to new arrangements, to be decided by Government.  Critical Reviews of possible mergers between some of the Department&rsquo;s Agencies and other Public Bodies were conducted in 2012 and resulted in a decision to merge the Environmental Protection Agency and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland by mid-2014.</p><p>  The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations of an independent assessment and in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, to establish a public water utility company, Irish Water, to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area. Following further analysis by my Department together with NewERA, the Government decided that Irish Water should be established as an independent State owned subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group.</p></reply>

As regards existing ground rents, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling. To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme. In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple in certain cases subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.</p><p>  The position regarding ground rents was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'. The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation. The Committee also noted that where leases were approaching expiry, any legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant. In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to introduce further legislation in this area. Operation of the existing law will, however, be kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

The case of the person concerned was then considered under Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. Refoulement was not found to be an issue. In addition no issue arises under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice  (UN Convention against Torture) Act, 2000.

Difficult conditions experienced on farms last summer have been compounded by an extended winter. </p><p>  It is also the case that farmers have increased the usage of concentrates to fill the fodder &ldquo;gap&rdquo;.  Whilst addressing the fodder issue, this has, in some cases, resulted in problems with cash flow and access to working capital on farms.</p><p>  Access to credit is crucial at this time and flexibility from both banks and merchants is vital. I have been speaking to banks to highlight the challenges facing farmers as a result of the weather, and insisting they take a flexible approach to dealing with short term credit issues.   I will also be meeting with the Banking Federation and other banks next week.  I have also be in contact with Co-Ops and grain and feed merchants to urge them to be flexible during this difficult time. </p><p>  This is an occasion when solidarity is needed among the farming community. I would ask those that have fodder to be proactive in making it available to neighbouring farmers who are encountering severe problems. I am aware that the farm bodies are working locally to assess whether there are farmers who have surplus fodder in stock and I commend them for these efforts.</p><p>  I am receiving daily updates from Teagasc on the situation and I have asked that for this crucial period, top priority is given to supporting farmers in need of assistance.</p><p>  In relation to the measures which can be taken to alleviate the problems on farms, I would urge farmers to contact their local Teagasc advisor.  Where winter fodder is limited, Teagasc is providing specific advice and assistance on how to cope with the consequences of the weather conditions experienced this Spring.  Staff at all Teagasc offices are available to provide advice to farmers over the phone and the fodder situation is a constant topic of focus at Discussions group meetings and other farm walks and events.  Agriculture advisers are equipped and ready to outline the options open to farmers facing difficulties and to make a plan that best suits their situation.</p><p>  Teagasc has also made extensive use of national and local media to provide farmers with advice and has co-ordinated with farm organisations, marts, local authorities, co-ops and other suppliers to provide targeted advice to all who need it.  Advice for farmers on coping with fodder shortages has also been published, including guidelines to dairy and drystock farmers with little or no grass on feeding this spring.</p><p>  I have also announced an extension to 15 May, 2013 for closing off of Traditional Hay Meadow in Agri &ndash; Environment Options Scheme (AEOS) allowing a deferral of one month to the closing off date.  This will help to maximise grass utilisation in this critical recovery period as the weather improves and grass growth resumes</p><p>  I fully appreciate and acknowledge that farmers are currently until financial pressure, however the outlook for our livestock sectors remains positive and that prices are relatively strong. </p><p>  There is no doubt that the availability of forage on farms is an on-going challenge.  The improvement in soil temperatures over the last week is very welcome and should see a return to more normal growth rates for grass and crops alike, and this, together with relatively positive market conditions should see a significant improvement in the situation on farms over the coming weeks.  That said, the challenges facing farmers at this particular time should not be underestimated and all available advice from public and private sources should be availed of on how best to manage individual situations being experienced.</p></reply>

Consequently, applications under the 2013 Single Payment Scheme must be posted/delivered to my Department's SPS Payments Unit in Portlaoise and can, therefore, no longer be lodged in Department Local Offices.  This has been clearly stated in the information provided to the farming sector that SPS forms in respect of 2013 Single Payment Scheme. My Department will be emphasising this message in through ads in the farming press next week. </p><p>  With regard to clerical work in the Tralee local office, following on from the successful restructuring of my Department's local office network, which reduced the number of local offices from 58 to 16, my Department has reviewed the business processes and procedures and, in particular, the administrative support requirements, in its 16 Regional Offices.  Arising from this review, the Department has recently introduced a number of significant changes to the procedures in relation to the implementation of controls in the context of the TB eradication programme.  In light of this and having regard to the significant efficiencies which have already arisen as a result of the investment made by the Department in IT in recent years and the substantial reduction in the incidence of disease, the number of administrative staff required to deliver the service in the local offices has been considerably reduced.  The review concluded that further substantial efficiencies would accrue from the centralisation of adminstrative functions and, in light of this, my Department has decided to centralise this support in one or more centralised office(s).</p><p>  Centralising administrative procedures will enable my Department to reduce the number of administrative staff it requires to support Veterinary Office operations and, accordingly, the cost of providing its services.  This is in line with Government policy. In addition, the centralisation of administrative functions will facilitate the re-deployment of staff from the regional offices to other State agencies and, thereby, enable the Government to provide services more efficiently through these agencies. </p><p>  I should emphasise that frontline services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Department's stakeholders will continue to be available at the 16 regional offices.  The Department vets, inspectors and technical officers will remain in place at these offices to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from our Regional Offices.  </p><p>  In line with my Department's decision to centralise administrative services, administrative functions have already been transferred out of a number of regional offices (notably, Clonakilty and Limerick), without any negative implications for the provision of services to farmer clients.  The administrative staff in the Tipperary office will also be transferred to the Garda vetting office shortly. It is not possible for me at this stage to give any indication of the time-frame for the transfer of the administrative functions out of other regional offices, such as Tralee, because this will depend on the availability of opportunities to redeploy the staff concerned to support other critical public services.  However, I can assure the Deputy that administrative support work in the local offices will not be transferred to a central office unless the staff concerned can be redeployed to other State services. </p></reply>

The NTA is the lead agency with responsibility for implementation of the recommendations of the Taxi Regulation Review Report 2011. </p><p>  The NTA carried out a consultation on vehicle standards as part of the Taxi Regulation Review which gave rise to recommendations for strengthening vehicle standards. </p><p>  Action 10 of the Review Report recommends retention of the 9 year vehicle age limit that applies at licence issue or renewal for all new vehicles entering the fleet. For existing vehicles in the fleet licensed prior to 1 January 2009, these can operate up to the 15th anniversary of each vehicle's first registration subject to 6-monthly NCT testing and NTA licence renewal assessment. In the circumstances, there is no change in the vehicle standards required for incumbent licence holders.</p><p>  An upper age limit has been applied this year for all wheelchair accessible vehicles, along with all other taxis and hackneys. The rule states that all such vehicles exit the SPSV fleet on their 15th birthday. An upper age limit has been introduced for replacement vehicles entering the fleet, such vehicles must not have passed their 10th birthday which is in line and equitable with, all other taxis and hackneys.</p><p>  New vehicle standards, not retrospectively applied to incumbent operators, have been in place for replacement vehicles since the 1st of January 2012. Single side access is not mandated. Indeed, two-sided access was never mandated either. The new standards allow for certain modern &quot;rear entry&quot; vehicles that would previously not have been capable of being licensed.</p></reply>
