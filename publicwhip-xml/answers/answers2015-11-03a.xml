This includes a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets which will guide actions in all countries to eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable development over the next fifteen years.  President Higgins and my colleague Minister of State Sherlock participated in the Summit.</p>  <p>  Ireland co-facilitated the intergovernmental negotiations that achieved agreement among all 193 Member States on the new development framework.  The 2030 Agenda is the second of three major international agreements that will be concluded this year to promote truly sustainable development. The first of these, the Addis Ababa Accord on the means of implementing the new SDGs, was agreed in July at the international conference in Ethiopia on Financing for Development.  The next challenge will be the adoption of a legally binding climate agreement in Paris in December.</p>  <p>  Ireland attaches great importance to the new Sustainable Development Goals and to their effective implementation.  I am determined that Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, which is central to our foreign policy, will continue to focus on ending poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries in the world, notably in sub-Saharan Africa.  The SDGs are universally applicable and all countries will have to take action.  Like our EU partners, we will now focus on developing the most appropriate institutional framework to deliver the 2030 Agenda at home and abroad.</p></reply>

Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have raised the issue of collusion with the British Government.</p>  <p>  We continue to do so, including in relation to a number of individual cases of long-standing concern such as this case.</p>  <p>   I have raised the case of this person on a number of occasions with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I made clear that the Irish Government considers there was a political commitment made at the highest level by both Governments at Weston Park in 2001 in relation to the holding of public inquiries in a number of controversial cases and that this commitment remains unfulfilled in this case. The Secretary of State continues to take the view that the De Silva Review of December 2012 and Prime Minister Cameron&rsquo;s apology in Parliament constitute the British Government&rsquo;s response to this case. </p>  <p>  On 26 June 2015, the High Court in Belfast dismissed an application for a judicial review of the Secretary of State&rsquo;s decision not to hold a public inquiry into this murder. I am aware of the decision of the family to appeal this decision and my Department will be monitoring developments on this application very closely.  In the meantime, we continue to call on the British Government for an independent public inquiry into this murder.  This is an approach which has cross-party support in the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I also note the Declaration issued by Mr. Justice Stephens on 8 September 2015 that as of 17 March 2009, an effective investigation into the murder had not been completed to a standard which complies with Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights. My Department is currently considering the possible implications of this Declaration. </p></reply>

Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that is worthy of being celebrated and shared with the world.</p>  <p>  The Embassy network works closely with Tourism Ireland and its representatives overseas, regularly promotes Irish tourism &ndash; including &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; &ndash; through its extensive network of social media sites, and supports tourism-promotion events in the network&rsquo;s countries of accreditation. To give two examples from the past six weeks, at the beginning of October, the Ambassador to France supported the launch in Paris of &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; at the IFTM (International French Travel Market), the largest travel trade exhibition in France, which attracts almost 30,000 visitors each year including influential tour operators and travel agents, as well as business tourism decision-makers and leading French travel media.  On 22 September, the Embassy of Ireland in Copenhagen hosted a tourism promotion event with Tourism Ireland Nordics, to promote &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; to tourism agents in Denmark.</p>  <p>  In my response to the Spring Statement of 30 April 2015, I gave a broad outline of the extensive work of my Department in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and education services overseas. </p>  <p>  In this work, my Department and its Embassy network work closely with other Government Departments, including the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Education and Skills; Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; and Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as with the relevant State agencies &ndash; Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Tourism Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland. Moreover, each of these is represented at Ministerial or CEO level on the Export Trade Council, which I chair. The ETC coordinates the implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy and its Review, which was published in February 2014. It met most recently on 6 October last. </p>  <p>  The Embassy network, comprising over 80 missions, plays a frontline trade promotion role. The network proactively addresses market access issues, supports Irish businesses seeking to grow overseas, holds promotional events for, and in association with, State agencies and actively contributes to the organisation and conduct of Enterprise Ireland Ministerial-led trade missions and events overseas. In each of Ireland&rsquo;s priority markets, Local Market Teams, chaired by the Ambassador, bring together the diplomats and State agency representatives present in the market to devise and implement annual Local Market Plans to steer Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and educations efforts overseas. These annual plans and implementation reports are reviewed by the Export Trade Council each year.</p>  <p>  Our air connectivity continues to grow, not least through the efforts of our Local Market Teams in lobbying for greater air access by supporting negotiations for increased capacity and expanded services on air routes to Ireland. There are regular welcome announcements of new routes and increased frequency on existing routes by airlines serving Irish airports. For instance, in late October, Aer Lingus announced an increase in the number of US destinations it serves by 50%, and will begin operating new direct flights from Dublin to Los Angeles, Newark and Hartford (Connecticut) next year. Such an expansion of routes represents a prime opportunity for tourism initiatives such as &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Ancient East&rsquo; to be marketed to key overseas audiences, in addition to facilitating increased bilateral trade and investment.</p></reply>

It was a valuable opportunity to hear the Senator&rsquo;s impressions of the ongoing talks following his meetings that day and the previous day with the leaders of the Northern Ireland parties and to exchange views on the current state of the discussions.</p>  <p>  We agreed that the current talks are the best way to resolve the differences among the parties in Northern Ireland on how to implement the Stormont House Agreement and to address the impact and legacy of paramilitarism. We stressed to Senator Hart that the Government will continue to make every effort to secure an outcome which will safeguard the progress made to date and protect the Good Friday Agreement and its institutions. Senator Hart made clear that the US values the Stormont House Agreement and wants to see it fully implemented. We share this key objective and my focus in the coming weeks will be to work for an outcome to the current talks that sees the Stormont House Agreement fully implemented. This includes agreeing legislation establishing the institutions for dealing with the past in a manner that faithfully complies with the provisions of the Stormont House Agreement. We also agreed that a solution on the issue of paramilitarism would be an important step forward - not just for politics &ndash; but for the further normalisation of society in Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  The US continues to be a crucial partner in the peace process and Senator Hart reaffirmed the Administration&rsquo;s commitment to assist in any way they can. The Senator&rsquo;s timely visit, and his ongoing engagement in the political process in Northern Ireland, is a tangible expression of the US determination to support an agreement being reached. The Taoiseach thanked the Senator for his continued commitment and conveyed, through him, the Government&rsquo;s appreciation to President Obama, Vice President Biden and Secretary Kerry for that continued interest, solidarity and support. We agreed to stay in close contact with Senator Hart in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

I understand that the Northern Ireland Department of Justice is currently examining the system of remand in the context of identifying efficiencies within the criminal justice system.</p><p>Engagement with the Independent Chair of the Maghaberry Prison Forum is an important means of building trust between separated prisoners and prison management and has the potential to address many of the issues which have caused friction between staff and prisoners, including those issues outstanding from the work of the Independent Assessment Team. I am aware that the Deputy and other Oireachtas members have met with the Independent Chair and have had the opportunity to discuss those concerns with him directly.</p><p>My officials are in regular contact with the Chair, <i>who has been working with both the prisoners and the staff side to agree an agenda</i>.While the current intensity  of the political talks in Northern Ireland have precluded me from meeting the Chair, I hope to have an early opportunity  to do so and look forward to receiving his assessment at first hand.</p><p>I understand that the Northern Ireland Prison Service is prepared to engage fully and openly once the format for the Prison Forum has been agreed and the meetings are re-established.  I do not underestimate the challenges involved and further progress in this format will require the engagement of all parties in a spirit of openness and goodwill</p></reply>

This serves to maintain the good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport worldwide which in turn protects Irish citizens as they travel abroad. The witnessing of applications by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the state has been a vital element of this identity verification and in combatting fraud. However, there has been a significant increase in passport applications in recent years, from 250,000 in 1995 to over 630,000 last year.  Recognising the additional workload that this has put on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Passport Service is reviewing the witnessing process.  The process used to apply for a Passport Card is serving as a pilot for an online application form.   The review of the Garda witnessing requirement for adults renewing their passports will be in tandem with the introduction of a number of new identity verification and anti-fraud measures.  These include increased reliance on the public services card as the core identity verification mechanism for all passport applicants in the state.</p></reply>

This is the first increase in the aid budget for seven years.  Of the total, &euro;486 million will be allocated to my Department for the Irish Aid programme.

We will continue to focus on the poorest communities in Africa, particularly in our key partner countries.  We are focused on delivering real and sustainable improvements to the lives of some of the world poorest and most vulnerable people in the areas of basic health, education, agriculture and food production.  While some of these countries have made remarkable economic progress, they still remain amongst the world&rsquo;s least developed and unequal. </p></reply>

In light of the welcome restoration of US-Cuba diplomatic relations earlier this year, the embargo serves no constructive purpose. Ireland, along with the other member states of the European Union, is firmly of the view that the lifting of the embargo would facilitate an opening of the Cuban economy to the benefit of the Cuban people. Our concerns about economic, commercial and financial measures against Cuba which are contrary to commonly accepted rules of international trade are long-standing and clear.  We object to unilaterally imposed measures that impede the economic and commercial relations of EU member states with Cuba.</p>  <p>  In supporting Cuba&rsquo;s resolution calling for an end to the US embargo, the EU also highlighted recent progress in talks to finalise the EU-Cuba Partnership, Cooperation and Dialogue agreement. Through this future framework agreement, the EU is ready to accompany Cuba on its path of reform and modernisation. Human rights form a key part of the EU-Cuba dialogue, and I urge the Cuban Government to fully grant its citizens internationally recognized civil, political and economic rights and freedoms. </p>  <p>  In last week&rsquo;s UN General Assembly debate on the US embargo against Cuba, the EU recognised that the embargo contributes to Cuba&rsquo;s economic problems, negatively affects the living standards of the Cuban people and has humanitarian consequences. However, the Union also encouraged Cuba to extend and implement the package of economic and social reforms that were adopted by the Cuban parliament in 2011, in a manner that would meet the concerns of the Cuban people. </p></reply>

It is therefore no surprise that we also have a thriving trading relationship from which both countries benefit. Trade has grown impressively in recent years to the extent that China was our 9th largest trading partner in 2014, representing around 2 and a half percent of our total trade.</p>  <p>  In 2014, exports in merchandise trade were &euro;2.111 billion and imports were &euro;3.480 billion.  The equivalent merchandise trade figures for 2013 were exports of &euro;1.94 billion and imports of &euro;3.09 billion. So overall merchandise trade with China grew by &euro;560m, or over 11% in 2014. The latest figures from the Central Statistics for the first eight months of this year show that they continue to grow, up by over 20% from the same period last year.</p>  <p>  Trade in services figures for 2014 are not yet available from the Central Statistics Office, but in 2013 services exports were &euro;2.71 billion and imports were &euro;0.37 billion.  The equivalent trade in services figures for 2012 were exports of &euro;2.57 billion and imports of &euro;0.34 billion. Taking merchandise and services figures together, Ireland is one a small number of countries which has a trade surplus with China.</p>  <p>  The new capital programme: &lsquo;Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021&rsquo; was launched on September 29 and is primarily under the remit of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.   It has a budget of &euro;27 billion over the 6 years of the Programme, and all projects will have an open and competitive procurement process.</p>  <p>  Both national and international companies will be permitted to tender for Public Private Partnership projects which are part of the Programme.  These have a combined value of around &euro;500 million, and will be developed in the Justice, Education and Health sectors as part of the new capital programme.</p>  <p>  There are no Chinese companies involved in any of the Public Private Partnership projects currently under construction. However, with regard to the new Public Private Partnerships under the new capital programme, the National Development Finance Agency along with the sponsoring Department, in each case run an open procurement competition fully compliant with EU procurement law and are therefore open to all, including Chinese, companies to bid.</p></reply>

The main factors are the operation of policies on the ground intended to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem in favour of settlers, the absence of any political process or perspective which might promise an end to this situation, and among Palestinians the consequent loss of authority by political leaders and belief in a political path. Tensions have been increased in recent months by a reckless and provocative challenge by minority elements in Israel to the long respected status quo of the holy places in Jerusalem.</p>  <p>  To these now have been added a genuine alarm and fear among Israeli citizens caused by a number of sudden attacks, resulting in pressure for a tougher response by the authorities. The risk of an escalating spiral of violence is very obvious.</p>  <p>  In common with others, I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians, be they prompted by despair or revenge. Any response by the security forces needs to be proportionate.  It is the job of local leaders, on all sides, to go beyond this, and beyond a mere security response, and to address the underlying issues. I again urge all sides to refrain from any provocative actions, and call on Israel to make clear &ndash; in practice as well as words &ndash; that the status quo on the Temple Mount or Haram al Sharif will be restored and respected. I note that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu have already taken some steps in this direction, and I encourage them to continue.</p>  <p>  More broadly, these events underline the message I have conveyed at international level since I took office. Political leadership, including from the international community, needs to address the problems of the relentless expansion of settlements and the absence of any process aiming at the end of the occupation.</p></reply>

The aim of these contacts is to achieve relief for undocumented Irish migrants in the US and to improve channels for legal migration between Ireland and America.</p>  <p>  The objective of achieving an E3 visa agreement between Ireland and the United States remains a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s overall position on U.S. immigration reform and one which we regularly emphasise both in contacts with US interlocutors at Ministerial level and through the  immigration reform activities of our Embassy in Washington, DC.</p>  <p>  Since I last updated Deputy Naughten in the D&aacute;il in July on the matter of E3 visas, I have visited New York and Washington DC to meet with the US administration, members of Congress and Irish community leaders.

I am also aware that while this particular measure would help with our objective of securing improved legal migration channels, it would not address the concerns of undocumented citizens currently in the US. These remain a key priority and continue to be the subject of our ongoing contacts with the US authorities.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including my Department in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to engage with Congressman Sensenbrenner and other Congressional contacts, across both sides of the political aisle, to encourage progress on the E3 visa Bill proposed by the Congressman through the legislative process.</p></reply>

Our response was led by my Department in Dublin and by our Consulate General in San Francisco, the latter reinforced by additional experienced officers from our Embassy in Washington.</p>  <p>  The Department quickly activated its Emergency Consular Response Centre to provide immediate consular assistance to those affected by the tragic incident. Practical assistance was provided to the families of the deceased and injured Irish citizens, with designated liaison officers being assigned to assist families making arrangements for travel and repatriation. On arrival in San Francisco families were met by an expert Consular team, who provided consular assistance and guidance during a very difficult time.   </p>  <p>  The Consul General and his team in San Francisco played a crucial role, liaising with the families of the victims, with other J1 students and with the local authorities. An incident Centre at the City Hall in Berkeley was established by the Consul General with the assistance of the local authorities and local Irish community groups. Minister Deenihan and the Irish Ambassador in Washington travelled to San Francisco to support the families and to attend memorial events, demonstrating the solidarity of the people and government of Ireland.   </p>  <p>  In the weeks and months that have followed the incident, the Consul General and his team, and the Consular Division of my Department here in Dublin have continued to provide sustained consular support to the injured students recovering in hospital and to their families, and to the families of those who tragically lost their lives. </p>  <p>  I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the valuable support of the Dublin Airport Authority and of Aer Lingus, who showed such flexibility and generosity in facilitating arrangements for the repatriation of the deceased and injured students and their families back home to Ireland.

The reasons for that are very well-documented: the UK&rsquo;s presence in the EU is central to the health of our economy and to the broader British-Irish relationship. The people of Northern Ireland also benefit from our joint membership of the Union. It is the Government&rsquo;s view as well that the Union as a whole is stronger on account of British membership.</p>  <p>  That helps to explain why our collective focus is on keeping the UK in the European Union. This means we need to maintain both our engagement with the UK Government on their potential reform plans and our willingness to work with them in support of common EU policy objectives &ndash; many of which relate to the single market and improving competitiveness. We are also doing our utmost to ensure that our other EU partners best understand the particular issues that arise for Ireland in connection with British membership of the EU.</p>  <p>  At the same time, the Government fully recognises that it must be prepared for all scenarios, particularly in relation to the economic impact of any change in the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU. We are already in regular contact with business and commercial groups, both here and in the UK, to improve our appreciation of the many different issues that could arise. Further work is also being undertaken across other Government Departments to enhance that understanding. This includes research that the Department of Finance has commissioned from the Economic and Social Research Institute on macro-economic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of EU membership.</p>  <p>  In my own contacts with the British Government, and especially in discussions with my UK counterpart Philip Hammond, I have emphasized the specific and instrumental role that the EU has played in bringing our two economies closer together. I also made the same point in a speech at Chatham House in London in September. I will continue to underline the importance of our joint EU membership to our excellent trading relationship in my future engagement with members of the British Government on this subject, including during my planned meeting with Foreign Secretary Hammond on November 23rd   next.   </p>  <p>  I remain convinced that the best way to safeguard the strong trading relationship between Ireland and the UK is through continued British membership of the Union. Our priority focus will therefore remain on helping to secure the UK&rsquo;s place in the EU. That said, we will continue to take a vigilant and comprehensive approach, across Government, to ensure that all of Ireland&rsquo;s interests &ndash; including in relation to trade &ndash; are best protected in the case of a British departure from the EU. </p></reply>

Ireland attaches importance to combating all forms of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity and we strongly believe that consensual, same-sex relationships should not be criminalised. I am delighted that Ireland became the first country in the world to introduce same sex marriage through a national referendum in May 2015 and I would urge other States to follow suit and to promote the rights for LGBTI citizens.</p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in progressing the rights of LGBTI persons at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).  Ireland identified the advancement of rights for LGBTI persons as a priority for the term of our HRC membership from 2013 to 2015.  During these three years we have consistently highlighted discrimination against LGBTI persons and worked with other countries to ensure that this issue is now firmly embedded in the work of the HRC. Most recently, at the 29th session of the Human Rights Council in June 2015,  Ireland supported a joint statement led by Colombia on violence and discrimination against individuals on the grounds of their sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>  <p>  We also have an opportunity through the UN Universal Periodic Review mechanism, which involves a peer review of the human rights records of all United Nations members, to raise a range of issues with our UN partners. Ireland has made recommendations in respect of 20 countries specifically on questions relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. </p>  <p>  During the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2013, Ireland facilitated and made substantial input into the EU Guidelines on LGBTI issues which were adopted at the meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers (Foreign Affairs Council) on 24 June 2013.  The Guidelines provide a concise overview of the human rights issues facing LGBTI persons in third countries, and provide EU officials and diplomats of EU member states, including Ireland, with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which LGBTI rights are protected. They also prioritise areas of concern which can lead to action by the EU; actions such as combating discriminatory laws and policies; combating LGBTI-phobic violence; and the protection of human rights defenders.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Policy for International Development also strongly affirms Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. Our aid programme supports civil society organisations and human rights defenders who are uniquely placed to ensure that the voices of the most marginalised are heard and that their rights are defended. In addition our Embassies work directly, and in cooperation with other EU member states, to engage with Governments on a range of governance and human rights issues, including the rights of the LGBTI community. </p>  <p>  Our diplomatic network has been active in advocacy relating to LGBTI rights; this advocacy has dealt with the issue of decriminalisation, concerns we have about new laws criminalising homosexuality and by supporting civil society organisations that are active in this field, many of whom are operating in very difficult environments.</p></reply>

The political and economic circumstances behind the displacement of millions of people must be addressed, if the flow of migrants is to be managed. The conflict in Syria (which is the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows) has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. More than 12 million Syrians have been displaced from their homes, of whom over 4 million are refugees in neighbouring countries. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed since the conflict began. Many thousands more have been displaced from other conflict zones including the Horn of Africa, South Sudan and Afghanistan.</p>  <p>  The Foreign Affairs Council of 12 October confirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to mobilise all appropriate instruments and policies to support efforts to address the root causes of migratory flows, including political instability, poor socio-economic development and poor governance. The Council expressed its support for diplomatic efforts by the United Nations to find solutions to the conflicts in Syria and Libya, major drivers behind the mass displacements of people.</p>  <p>  The Council emphasised that cooperation with third countries must be a key element of EU efforts to address the migration crisis. To this end the EU is working with Turkey on an Action Plan to better address the migration challenges we both face. </p>  <p>  As part of its efforts to develop a comprehensive migration strategy, the EU recently organised two high level conferences. On 08 October a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg. It issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge. Next week, an international summit focusing on migration will be held in Valletta. EU and African Heads of State and Government are being invited. Ireland will be represented by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Ms. Frances Fitzgerald T.D.</p>  <p>  At their meeting on 12 October EU Foreign Ministers called on the international community to provide greater support to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and other programmes and agencies assisting refugees. EU leaders have already agreed, at the 23 September European Council, to provide &euro;1 billion in funding to the UNHCR and the WFP.</p>  <p>  The EU and its Member States collectively are leading the international response to the refugee crisis. Since 2012, more than &euro;4.2 billion have been mobilised for assistance to Syrians in their country and to refugees who have fled. </p>  <p>  Ireland has been supporting the humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean. The L.&Eacute;. Samuel Beckett recently replaced the L.&Eacute;. Niamh and has already helped to rescue over 748 people. In total, the Irish Naval Service has now rescued 7,857 migrants from the Mediterranean Sea under the auspices of the ongoing rescue operations. It is expected that the L.E. Samuel Beckett will be deployed until at least 30 November. </p></reply>

The Taoiseach repeated the commitment when he addressed the United Nations in New York in September at the Summit to adopt the new framework for global development, the 2030 Agenda.</p>  <p>  We have consistently and very clearly stated that once economic conditions permit we would make further progress on meeting our commitment to the UN target.  As our economic recovery strengthens and consolidates we are now in a position to start delivering on that commitment. </p>  <p>  Last month the Government announced the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years.  For 2016, we have provided a total of over &euro;640 million in ODA, an increase of &euro;40 million, or almost 7% on the 2015 level.  This is   both a substantial allocation of public funding to ODA and a significant increase on last year&rsquo;s level. It also represents a clear demonstration of our determination to make good on our commitments to the aid programme.    </p>  <p>  Ireland played a leading role this year in brokering an agreement among EU Development Ministers to collectively reach the 0.7% target by 2030. Over the coming years we will continue to make sustainable progress towards the UN target in line with this wider agreement with EU member states. </p></reply>

The main factors are the operation of policies on the ground intended to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem in favour of settlers, the absence of any political process or perspective which might promise an end to this situation, and among Palestinians the consequent loss of authority by political leaders and belief in a political path. Tensions have been increased in recent months by a reckless and provocative challenge by minority elements in Israel to the long respected status quo of the holy places in Jerusalem.</p>  <p>  To these now have been added a genuine alarm and fear among Israeli citizens caused by a number of sudden attacks, resulting in pressure for a tougher response by the authorities. The risk of an escalating spiral of violence is very obvious.</p>  <p>  In common with others, I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians, be they prompted by despair or revenge. Any response by the security forces needs to be proportionate.  It is the job of local leaders, on all sides, to go beyond this, and beyond a mere security response, and to address the underlying issues. I again urge all sides to refrain from any provocative actions, and call on Israel to make clear &ndash; in practice as well as words &ndash; that the status quo on the Temple Mount or Haram al Sharif will be restored and respected. I note that President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu have already taken some steps in this direction, and I encourage them to continue.</p>  <p>  More broadly, these events underline the message I have conveyed at international level since I took office. Political leadership, including from the international community, needs to address the problems of the relentless expansion of settlements and the absence of any process aiming at the end of the occupation.</p></reply>

We know how important it is not just for our economy but also for the continuing strength of British-Irish relations and for peace and stability in Northern Ireland. It&rsquo;s also our firm view that the EU is better and stronger as a whole on account of British membership. That is why our main focus remains on doing all we can to ensure that the UK remains part of the Union, rather than planning for their departure.</p>  <p>  That does not mean, however, that we are ignoring the possibility of a fundamental change in the nature of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU. Indeed, analysis has been underway for some time of the various and complex issues that would arise for Ireland in such a scenario. The Department of the Taoiseach continues to coordinate cross-Governmental efforts in this area as we move forward with this work.</p>  <p>  My own Department, given its responsibility for both Foreign Affairs and Trade, is naturally heavily involved. My officials are engaging actively with counterparts across our own system, as well as within the British administration and further afield in other EU capitals. Our offices abroad, not least our Embassy in London and Permanent Representation in Brussels, are valuable assets in this context.</p>  <p>  A key aim for us is to ensure that the UK best understand why their EU membership matters as much as it does for Ireland. That is why I recently addressed an influential audience in Chatham House in London on this particular subject. I have also discussed the EU-UK relationship with Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond on a number of occasions and the Taoiseach has had similar exchanges with Prime Minister Cameron. I intend to re-emphasise the importance of continued UK membership of the EU during my planned meeting with Foreign Secretary Hammond on 23 November. </p></reply>

Through our Embassy in Washington and our Consulates throughout the U.S., in conjunction with regular high level political visits, the Irish Government continues to work closely on promoting the immigration reform agenda with high level Government contacts and with many other individuals and groups across Irish America and beyond.</p>  <p>  We have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.</p>  <p>  In Washington at the end of September, I met with key Democratic and Republican contacts on Capitol Hill, including Congressmen Joseph Kennedy III, Paul Ryan, James Sensenbrenner, Richard Neal and other members of the Congressional Friends of Ireland group, and also with Senator Patrick Leahy. I stressed the importance we attach to immigration reform in all of my meetings, as I did when meeting leaders of the Irish American community later that week in New York.</p>  <p>  The Government are aware of and have raised the matter of waivers for 3 and 10 year travel bans in relation to US visa applications for Irish undocumented who have overstayed their visa in the United States.</p>  <p>  At my request, the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade wrote to the US Ambassador earlier this year to ask him to explore further the question of such waivers. I have also had the opportunity to directly discuss the matter with the US Ambassador. The Taoiseach also raised waivers, amongst other immigration reform issues, during his visit to Washington for St Patrick&rsquo;s Day. </p>  <p>  I must respect the confidentiality of diplomatic communications on behalf of foreign governments, but I can offer some information on the basis of these representations and responses.</p>  <p>  The US Embassy have indicated that the US waiver system is applied in strict accordance with US laws and regulations and is operated uniformly worldwide, including in Ireland. Such a waiver can be applied for in the case of a 3 or 10 year ban having been imposed for overstaying a visa in the US.  </p>  <p>  However, the US Embassy has also underlined that applications are assessed individually on a case-by-case basis, with final decisions on each a matter for the US authorities in Washington, and that accordingly an applicant would not be able to predict with any degree of certainty as to whether they would be successful or not.  </p>  <p>  The Government has been assiduous in seeking to advance all viable opportunities to achieve relief for our undocumented citizens in the United States. While I am disappointed that representations to the US on this matter have not resulted in a more encouraging outcome ultimately it is a matter for the US Government and US Embassy to interpret and implement their immigration laws.</p>  <p>  The Government as a whole, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Dublin and our Embassy in Washington, will continue to actively follow up on all opportunities to improve the situation of the Irish undocumented, and to ensure channels for legal migration between Ireland and America, with the US Administration, with Congress, and with the US Embassy in Ireland.</p></reply>

This is reflected in the 17 SDGs, with a vision for a just, equitable, and socially inclusive world in which the needs of the most vulnerable are met.</p>  <p>  The SDGs bring a renewed focus on ensuring the inclusion of people with disabilities and the inclusion of data on disabilities. Specifically, the agreed agenda, with its commitment to leave no one behind, commits to strengthening the availability of data disaggregated by disability. This is an area on which Ireland has been and will continue to be a strong proponent.</p>  <p>  The universal nature of the SDGs will require all countries to take action. In common with our EU partners, we will focus on developing the most appropriate institutional framework to deliver the new development agenda at home and abroad.  </p>  <p>  Our Policy for International Development, One World, One Future, already highlights Ireland's clear commitment to addressing the rights and needs of people with disabilities. We are committed to devoting more resources to this area, by supporting specific initiatives as well as ensuring that these issues are effectively integrated into our ongoing work.

The political and economic circumstances behind the displacement of millions of people must be addressed, if the flow of migrants is to be managed. The conflict in Syria (which is the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows) has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. More than 12 million Syrians have been displaced from their homes, of whom over 4 million are refugees in neighbouring countries. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed since the conflict began. Many thousands more have been displaced from other conflict zones including the Horn of Africa, South Sudan and Afghanistan<font color="#004080">.</font></p><p>The Foreign Affairs Council of 12 October confirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to mobilise all appropriate instruments and policies to support efforts to address the root causes of migratory flows, including political instability, poor socio-economic development and poor governance. The Council expressed its support for diplomatic efforts by the United Nations to find solutions to the conflicts in Syria and Libya, major drivers behind the mass displacements of people.</p><p>The Council emphasised that cooperation with third countries must be a key element of EU efforts to address the migration crisis. To this end the EU is working with Turkey on an Action Plan to better address the migration challenges we both face. </p><p>As part of its efforts to develop a comprehensive migration strategy, the EU recently organised two high level conferences. Earlier this month a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg. It issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge. Next month, an international summit focussing on migration will be held in Valletta. EU and African Heads of State and Government are being invited. Ireland will be represented by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Ms. Frances Fitzgerald T.D.</p><p>At their meeting earlier this month EU Foreign Ministers called on the international community to provide greater support to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and other programmes and agencies assisting refugees. EU leaders have already agreed, at the 23 September European Council, to provide &euro;1 billion in funding to the UNHCR and the WFP.</p><p>The EU and its Member States collectively are leading the international response to the refugee crisis. Since 2012, more than &euro;4.2 billion have been mobilised for assistance to Syrians in their country and to refugees who have fled. </p><p>The Irish Naval Service has rescued 7,857 migrants from the Mediterranean Sea under the auspices of the ongoing rescue operations.

The Strategy was however reviewed in 2014.  This involved a long process of consultation with Local Market Teams abroad, the Embassy network, Government Departments, State agencies and also with the private sector through the Global Irish Economic Forum and the Export Trade Council.</p>  <p>  I would add that, under the existing Strategy, a number of new actions were initiated. For example, the Export Trade Council (ETC) which I chair, was established, as were the Local Market Teams chaired by our Ambassadors in priority markets. The ETC oversees the implementation of the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy and facilitates the close coordination of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and education promotion overseas.</p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has opened new diplomatic missions in recent years across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. Irish Embassies and Consulates provide a platform abroad for the promotion of Ireland as a business, investment, tourism and education destination. Of course, our engagement in emerging markets should not come at the expense of our efforts in our more established markets, such as the US, UK and Europe. </p>  <p>  The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period is of course a unique opportunity for us to promote greater awareness of our country overseas.  We have worked hard, particularly in recent years, to increase Ireland&rsquo;s profile abroad. The Embassy network worked closely with Tourism Ireland to arrange for 170 iconic buildings and landmarks around the world to be illuminated in green this year as part of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Global Greening&rdquo; campaign. Trade, tourism and investment in Ireland were promoted at 148 dedicated business events, attended by almost 18,000 Irish and international company representatives. </p>  <p>  My Department also engages with the Irish Diaspora throughout the year and later in November will host the fourth Global Irish Economic Forum here in Dublin.  Many of those attending are members of the Global Irish Network. This Network works closely with the Government and State agencies in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic, cultural and tourism messages in key markets.  </p>  <p>  The Embassy network also continues to work very closely with State agencies and other Government Departments on the planning and implementation of Ministerial-led international trade missions and to promote Ireland, Irish companies and Irish products overseas. </p>  <p>  Having reviewed the Strategy in 2014, Government Departments, the Embassy network and the State agencies are currently continuing to implement the Strategy and its Review.  The Review set out sectoral priorities and focused on how Departments and State agencies can coordinate better overseas, recognising that actions to improve the domestic enabling environment are being comprehensively addressed through the Action Plan for Jobs process.  </p>  <p>  On a successor to the current Strategy, my Department, through the structure of the ETC, has initiated a scoping exercise with other Government Departments, State agencies and private sector members, to consider possible future approaches in the trade, tourism, investment and education areas.  Bearing in mind the relatively recent completion and continued applicability of the Review, there is a widespread view that a full consideration of the successor Strategy would most appropriately be taken forward next year.</p></reply>

As host to well over two million refugees, Turkey is particularly important to any resolution to this crisis and, in this regard, it is important that the EU and Turkey formulate a coordinated and collaborative plan of action.</p>  <p>  This has been clearly recognised in the Joint EU-Turkey Action Plan, presented by President Juncker on 5 October and welcomed at the European Council on 17 October. The Action Plan identifies a series of collaborative actions to be implemented as a matter of urgency by the EU and Turkey.</p>  <p>  The Action Plan contains both short-term and medium term measures, and focusses on: (a) supporting the refugees and their host communities in Turkey and (b) strengthening cooperation to prevent irregular migration flows to the EU.  It is expected to constitute an integral part of the on-going political dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Turkey, and builds upon existing EU-Turkey relations, policy dialogue and cooperation instruments, as well as, more generally, Turkey&rsquo;s EU accession process. This includes in particular the visa liberalisation dialogue, the EU-Turkey readmission agreement and the EU instruments for the provision of financial assistance to Turkey. </p>  <p>  Implementation of the Action Plan will be key, a process which will be jointly steered and overseen by the European Commission and the High Representative and the Turkish Government through the establishment of an EU-Turkey high-level working group on migration.</p>  <p>  Implementation measures will be designed to allow the EU and Turkey to cover further emergency needs by providing immediate humanitarian assistance to refugees; alleviate the burden undertaken by Turkish society in hosting more than 2.2 million refugees; create better living conditions and medium and long-term perspectives for refugees in Turkey; and address key factors that push refugees to move from Turkey to the EU through irregular channels in search of alternative places of asylum.</p></reply>

In accordance with Article 29.6 of the Constitution international agreements to which Ireland becomes a party do not become part of domestic law unless so determined by the Oireachtas through legislation. No such legislation has been passed by the Oireachtas with respect to the Covenant. Accordingly, while the Covenant is binding under international law it does not have direct legal effect in Irish law.</p><p>The primary method for the Committee to monitor states&rsquo; implementation of the Covenant is by examination of state reports which are periodical. Following an examination of a state report, the Committee issues its concluding observations to the state. The concluding observations record the positive aspects of a state&rsquo;s implementation of the Covenant and areas of concern to the Committee and its recommendations.</p><p>An additional Optional Protocol to the Covenant, to which Ireland is also party, gives the Committee competence to examine with regard to alleged violations of the Covenant. </p><p>Following its consideration of an individual communication the Human Rights Committee forwards its views to the state party concerned and the individual.  If the Committee&rsquo;s views are that the Covenant has been violated it will appoint a Special Rapporteur (from among its members) to ascertain the measures taken by states to give effect to the Committee&rsquo;s views. </p><p>The Human Rights Committee also adopts &ldquo;General Comments&rdquo; on the articles of the Covenant which represent their interpretation of the substantive rights contained therein. </p><p>The Human Rights Committee is not a court and its recommendations are not legally binding. However given its mandate, status, and the fact that its members are elected on the basis of their independence, qualifications and expertise, there is a strong presumption in favour of the Committee&rsquo;s legal interpretations of the provisions of the relevant treaty and they are of persuasive value as regards states&rsquo; international obligations under the Covenant. States parties such as Ireland, which support the UN human rights system and the Committee, take its views seriously.</p></reply>

In line with our long standing leadership role with regard to the promotion of nuclear disarmament, Ireland has been deeply involved in the Humanitarian Consequences Initiative, including a series of conferences held prior to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Review Conference earlier this year.  This debate has focused on the serious risks and impacts associated with any nuclear weapon detonation, accidental or deliberate.</p>  <p>  Following the third HINW (Humanitarian impact of Nuclear Weapons) Conference in Vienna last December, the Government of Austria launched a Humanitarian Pledge.  This represents a commitment by nations to work together to fill the legal gap which currently exists for the prohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons and for the implementation of Article VI of the NPT Treaty which calls for all States to identify and implement effective measures for nuclear disarmament.  Ireland supported the Austrian pledge, subsequently adapted as the Humanitarian Pledge. As of this week, 122, States, including Ireland have signed the pledge.</p>  <p>  Following the failure of the NPT Review Conference to achieve an agreed outcome, Ireland has worked with a group of like-minded partners, to ensure that work on the Humanitarian Pledge should continue.  It will therefore be put forward to the United Nations General Assembly as a resolution later this month. </p>  <p>  Ireland is also striving to build on the impetus for change created by the Humanitarian Initiative by putting forward, with our like-minded partners, a draft resolution which would establish an open ended working group with the aim of beginning negotiations on a process leading to the implementation of effective, legally binding measures for the elimination of Nuclear Weapons.  Irish officials are active in promoting this resolution and the Humanitarian Pledge in ongoing discussions in the United Nation&rsquo;s First Committee. </p></reply>

As host to well over two million refugees, Turkey is particularly important to any resolution to this crisis and, in this regard, it is important that the EU and Turkey formulate a coordinated and collaborative plan of action. </p>  <p>  This has been clearly recognised in the Joint EU-Turkey Action Plan, presented by President Juncker on 5 October and  welcomed at the European Council on 17 October. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan contains both short-term and medium term measures, and focusses on: (a) supporting the refugees and their host communities in Turkey and (b) strengthening cooperation to prevent irregular migration flows to the EU.  </p>  <p>  It is expected to constitute an integral part of the on-going political dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Turkey.</p>  <p>  Clearly, the financial aspects of the plan are critical: the Turkish Government estimates that it has spent almost $8 billion US dollars on the refugee issue since the beginning of the crisis.   As part of the effort to share the burden, the EU has committed to allocated additional funding to Turkey, in a sustained manner. The funds will be mobilised in the most flexible and rapid way possible, including through the EU Trust Fund for the Syrian crisis. Priority will be given to providing immediate humanitarian assistance and to enhancing self-sufficiency and social inclusion of refugees, as well as to supporting host communities. </p>  <p>  The EU intends to  proceed with a comprehensive joint needs assessment as a basis for programming funding, and the details of any financial package are under active discussion. </p></reply>

At the same time the EU calls on the authorities to tackle the threat of terrorism in full respect of the rule of law.

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on the household benefits package for approximately 416,000 customers. </p>  <p>  The electricity and gas allowance is currently &euro;35 per month.  There have been no reductions to the electricity and gas allowance in recent budgets.  In 2013, I aligned the electricity and gas allowance with the cheapest available market rate for 1,800 units of electricity.  This allows customers to obtain savings by switching to cheaper companies.  Customers can now switch companies without the loss of any credit that may have built up, which was not possible under the old system.  I have no plans at this time to increase the household benefits package.  Any decision to increase the package would have budgetary consequences and would have to be considered in the context of budget negotiations. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, in Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the personal rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This will increase the maximum personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  I was also pleased to announce a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  The purpose of this allowance is to support qualifying people with the cost of heating their home, at the time of the year they most need such support.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of this Budget will be very positive for older people.</p></reply>

Claims for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance are subject to periodic reviews in order to establish that there is a continuing entitlement to receive this payment.  Following four such review interviews with the person concerned on 31 July 2015, 13 August 2015, 21 August 2015 and 28 August 2015, the Deciding Officer determined that he was not genuinely seeking suitable employment having regard to his age, physique, education, normal occupation, place of residence and family circumstances, and as a consequence his claim was disallowed.</p>  <p>  The person concerned then requested a review of this decision.  The Deciding Officer, having given due consideration to the contents of the request for a review, found that the information submitted did not warrant a revision of the original decision.  On 14 September 2015 the person concerned lodged an appeal against the decision with the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office which will be in contact him in connection with his appeal.</p></reply>

The payment continues to be paid in respect of children up to their 18th birthday who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.  Child benefit is paid to around 619,000 families in respect of some 1.19 million children, with an estimated expenditure of around &euro;1.9 billion in 2015.  </p><p>In Budget 2016, the Government increased child benefit by &euro;5 to &euro;140 per month, at a cost of &euro;72 million.  This measure recognises the sacrifices that low- and middle-income families made during the economic crisis and will help families to build a better financial future and will boost the economic recovery.</p><p>The previous Government in Budget 2009 reduced the age for eligibility for child benefit from 19 years to 18 years.  The Department of Social Protection published a value for money review of child income supports in 2010, which found that the participation pattern of children in education supports this age limit for child benefit.  There are no plans  to change the eligibility criteria for child benefit. </p><p>In addition to child benefit, families on low incomes can avail of a number of social welfare schemes that support children in full-time education until the age of 22, including:</p><p>- qualified child increases (QCIs) for recipients of social welfare payments;</p><p>- family income supplement (FIS) for low-paid employees with children;</p><p>- the back to school clothing and footwear allowance for low income families. </p><p>These schemes provide supports for low-income families with children aged 18 &ndash; 21 years participating in full-time education that are directly linked with household income.</p></reply>

Farm assist recipients can also access a broad range of activation supports available through the Department&rsquo;s Intreo offices.  The 2015 Revised Estimates for the Department provide for expenditure of almost &euro;89 million on the farm assist scheme which will benefit around 9,000 farmers with around 11,000 dependants each week.</p>  <p>  All recipients of farm assist benefitted from the Christmas Bonus in December 2014 and will receive the increased Christmas Bonus this December.

A person is considered a farmer if they farm land that they own or lease and use for the purpose of husbandry.  Husbandry means working the land with the object of taking produce from the land.</p>  <p>  If a person farms land for the purpose of husbandry but does not own or lease that land, then they may still qualify as a farmer as long as the land is not part of a larger holding.  The land, which includes commonage, must be within the State.  A person will not qualify for farm assist if they lease or let all their land to another person.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to transfer a farm assist claim between spouses.  However, it is possible for a spouse to apply for farm assist in their own right subject to scheme criteria.  The applicant should contact her local INTREO office in this regard.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to change the current scheme criteria.</p></reply>

While the client&rsquo;s PRSI contribution record appears to be fully complete, the person concerned does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  To qualify for Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit a person must satisfy certain PRSI contribution conditions:</p>  <p>- the person must have at least 104 class A, H and P contributions paid since he entered insurable employment and</p>  <p>- the person must have at least 39 reckonable contributions paid or credited in the Governing Contribution Year (GCY) and 13 of these contributions must be paid contributions or</p>  <p>- the person must have at least 26 reckonable contributions paid in both the Governing Contribution Year (GCY), which is 2013, and the year immediately preceding the GCY.  </p>  <p>  The GCY is the second last complete tax year before the year in which the claim is made. So, for claims made in 2015, the GCY is 2013.</p>  <p>  In relation to Jobseekers Allowance (JA), the client&rsquo;s claim was disallowed as his means are in excess of his entitlement.  </p>  <p>  In assessing means from self-employment, legislation provides for the assessment of 'all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year'.  The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.  Generally self-employed persons are assessed with their income in the past 12 months and a decision is given on that basis. However, each case is examined and treated on its merits.</p>  <p>  The person concerned provided information on his savings and earnings, as required.  The client&rsquo;s assessable savings resulted in a calculation of total weekly means from capital of &euro;390.  This alone exceeds the person&rsquo;s entitlement rate of &euro;188.</p>  <p>  In addition the client is a proprietary director of two companies. The two businesses generated earnings in 2014 and have the potential and reasonable expectation to generate the same over the course of 2015.  Means from self-employment have been assessed at &euro;1,277.  This also exceeds the person&rsquo;s entitlement rate of &euro;188.</p>  <p>  As these contribution conditions stated above also apply to illness benefit, the person concerned does not satisfy the contribution conditions to qualify for illness benefit.  With regard to a potential entitlement to disability allowance (DA), a person must satisfy the conditions as to means.</p>  <p>  The person concerned has appealed this decision.  His claim has been reviewed in Kilbarrack Intreo Office but was unaltered.  The Appeals Office will be in touch with the person concerned in due course.  The person concerned may of course contract Kilbarrack Intreo Office to discuss his claim and his means assessment.</p></reply>

In order to qualify for the scheme a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment from the Department, live alone or only with one of a list of exempted persons and satisfy a means test.  The criteria for Fuel Allowance are framed in order to direct the limited resources available to the Department in as targeted a manner as possible.</p>  <p>  In budget 2016, I announced an increase of &euro;2.50 per week on the Fuel Allowance, increasing the payment to &euro;22.50 per week from January 2016.  This increase is expected to benefit 381,000 households including pensioners, people with disabilities, lone parents and jobseekers.  There have been no changes to the qualifying criteria for fuel allowance as a result of the Budget.</p>  <p>  A 75% Christmas Bonus will be paid this December to recipients of a long-term Social Welfare payment.  It is expected that 1.23 million people will benefit from the Christmas bonus at a cost of &euro;197 million.  The Bonus this year will be paid to the beneficiaries of the same schemes to which the bonus previously applied, and on the same basis. </p>  <p>  If a person who previously qualified for Fuel Allowance and/or a Christmas Bonus does not qualify for one this year, it is most likely a result of a change in their circumstances.

The package is generally available to people living in the State, aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test.  It is a universal payment from the age of 70.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on the household benefits package for approximately 416,000 customers. </p><p>Qualifying schemes for people aged between 66 and 70 are as follows:</p><p>- State Pension(Contributory/Non Contributory/Transition)</p><p>- Widow&rsquo;s/Widowers/Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Contributory or Non Contributory pension</p><p>- One-Parent Family Payment, Deserted Wife's Benefit / Allowance or Prisoner's Wife's Allowance</p><p>- An ordinary Garda Widow's Pension (from Department of Justice and Equality)</p><p>- a Social Security Pension/Benefit from a country covered by EC Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a Bilateral Social Security Agreement.</p><p>A person aged between 66 and 70 (i.e., who has not reached their 70th birthday) who is not in receipt of one of the above qualifying payments may alternatively qualify for the package if they satisfy a means test and a household composition test.  The means test involves calculating a person&rsquo;s appropriate weekly means limit.  This limit is &euro;100 above the current maximum rate of State pension (contributory) including any increases, e.g., for living alone, and adult/child dependents. </p><p>The recipient of a State pension (contributory) will have qualified for that payment, and for secondary benefits such as Household Benefits, based on their PRSI contribution record.  Similarly, the recipient of a Widow&rsquo;s contributory pension will have qualified for that payment, and for secondary benefits such as Household Benefits, based on the PRSI contribution record of either their late spouse, or of their own PRSI record.</p><p>While full-rate Class A contributions provide coverage for such payments, reduced rate contributions may not.  Class D contributions, which have a much lower Employee contribution than Class A, provide coverage for Widow&rsquo;s, Guardians, Occupation Injuries and Carer&rsquo;s contributory benefits.  While there is no entitlement to those benefits if the required contributions have not been made, equivalent means-tested payments may be available if the same contingency arises and the person has an income need. </p><p>In cases where the required PRSI contributions have not been made for an appropriate benefit, and where a person does not satisfy the required means test, a person will not qualify for the Household Benefits package until their 70<sup>th</sup>birthday.Expanding eligibility to people who do not currently qualify for the package would have cost implications which would have to be met either through increased spending (which is funded by taxation/PRSI), or through reducing the level of support under the package, and neither option is being considered by the Government. </p><p>As I do not believe that any legal questions arise as a result of the above, legal advice has not been sought on this matter.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  State pensions account for the single largest block of social welfare expenditure, and while expenditure on pensions is increasing because of demographic pressures, this is being successfully managed within the overall welfare budget.</p>  <p>  This year (2015), the Department will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014.  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  A number of changes have been made to the State Pension Contributory in the past five years in the context of State pension reform and to provide for sustainable pensions in the future.  The main changes are as follows:</p>  <p>  1. The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (Transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014.  </p>  <p>  2. The number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions with effect from 6th April 2012, as provided for in the Social Welfare Act 1997. </p>  <p>  3. From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  4. From April 2012 the period for which a claim for State Pension can be backdated is six months as provided for under the Social Welfare Act 2011.</p>  <p>  5. Budget 2016 provided for the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This will increase the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30. This is a 1.3% increase over 2015 rates, and slightly ahead of the projected annual inflation rate of 1% for 2016.  There will also be proportional increases in the rates paid for Qualified Adults.  This will amount to up to &euro;2.70 per week for such dependent adults aged 66 or over. This change will be legislated for through the forthcoming Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2015.</p>  <p>  6. It is planned to introduce a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; for new pensioners from 2020, where pension entitlements will more closely reflect contributions made over a working life, than under the current &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system.  It is intended that the final details of this approach will be announced 3-4 years before the scheme takes effect for new pensioners. </p>  <p>  Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

It should be noted that this figure includes a reduction in expenditure on the back to work family dividend (BTWFD).

The basis for this is that two individuals maintaining one household will incur lower costs than two people maintaining two separate households.</p>  <p>  On Budget Day 2016, I was pleased to announce a number of measures that will be of benefit to families in the situation outlined above.  The top up for Community Employment participants will be increased by &euro;2.50 per week.  Child Benefit will increase by &euro;5, from &euro;135 to &euro;140 per month.  This couple will also benefit from the increase in Fuel Allowance, if eligible, of &euro;2.50, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.</p>  <p>  In addition, currently, Class A employees, including CE participants, are liable to pay PRSI at the rate of 4% once their weekly earnings exceed &euro;352.  From 1 January 2016, the introduction of a new tapered PRSI Credit will reduce the amount of PRSI actually paid, for those earning between &euro;352.01 and &euro;424 in a week.  The maximum PRSI Credit of &euro;12 per week is reduced by one-sixth of the difference between gross earnings and &euro;352.01.  In the case of a CE participant receiving income of &euro;392.40 the PRSI charge will, after 1 January 2016, amount to &euro;10.43 per week (a reduction of some &euro;5.27 a week).</p></reply>

A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out and the person is deemed by a housing authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. </p>  <p>  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the housing authority. Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. Rent supplement is not generally payable to a new applicant where a person or their spouse/partner is in full time employment i.e. 30 hours or more per week. </p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short term income support by transferring responsibility for persons with long term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).  Payments under the HAP scheme are based on the local authority differential rent means test under which the full-time employment restriction does not apply.  </p>  <p>  The persons referred to by the Deputies are not currently in receipt of rent supplement and in the first instance are advised to contact their local authority to have their housing need assessed. I would also advise that the persons concerned contact the Department to assess their individual circumstances including an assessment of their eligibility under the Family Income Support scheme.  </p></reply>

The EEC Equality Directive 79/9 and the subsequent Supreme Court case (Hyland <i>v </i>Minister for Social Welfare, 1989) led to the change in treatment of non-married cohabiting couples in the social welfare code.

Since then, the seasonally adjusted youth unemployment rate has fallen steadily to 20.6% as of September 2015, reflecting the impact of government policy and the overall improvement in the labour market.</p>  <p>  The share of youth not in employment, education or in training is driven largely by the level of unemployment, so this figure also rose significantly in the recession, to a level of close to 19% in each of the years 2010-2012.  It has also fallen in line with the fall in youth unemployment &ndash; to 15% in 2014 as noted in the question &ndash; and continues to fall. </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s primary strategy to tackle youth unemployment is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. However, the Government recognises that as the recovery takes hold, there is a need for additional measures to ensure that as many as possible of the jobs created are taken up by unemployed jobseekers and, in accordance with the EU Council Recommendation for a Youth Guarantee, by young jobseekers in particular.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee implementation plan. </p>  <p>  As, under services such as Intreo, Youthreach, VTOS, PLC programmes, and JobBridge, Ireland already had many of the recommended component parts of a Youth Guarantee, the main plank in Ireland is to prioritise access to these existing supports for young people, who become unemployed, with the objective of ensuring that they have an opportunity for employment, further education or work experience within the recommended period of four months as per the EU council recommendation.  </p>  <p>  In this regard our first intervention is to provide case officer support to help newly unemployed young people find and secure sustainable jobs.  Accordingly operating processes have been refined in each of our regions to prioritise the early engagement of young people through Intreo to ensure that all young people receive expert advice and have access to progression options.  In addition as part of our commitment to engage with 100,000 long-term unemployed people through the Intreo/JobPath process during 2015 we prioritised engagement with the c 13,000 young people who are already long term unemployed.  In implementing these processes DSP making extensive use of the services of Local Employment Services and Job Clubs.</p>  <p>  For those who do not find employment through the process just described, additional offers are provided for.  Most such offers (over 70%) are in existing further education or training programmes.  Others are in existing community-based employment programmes such as CE, Gateway and T&uacute;s. Overall, over 23,300 opportunities were taken up on the relevant programmes in 2014 and a similar number is expected to be taken up in 2015.</p>  <p>  In addition we have introduced new programmes specifically for young people including JobsPlus youth &ndash; an employment subsidy for unemployed people under 25 years of age which is payable after four months of unemployment, and First Steps &ndash; a work experience programme for very disadvantaged young people. </p>  <p>  The continued roll-out of the Intreo activation model in conjunction with the implementation of these specific measures for youth will further assist young people to make the transition to the labour market. This, together with the forecast further improvement in the economy and employment, should support further substantial decreases in youth unemployment, and in the number of young people not in employment, education or in training.</p></reply>

State pensions account for the single largest block of social welfare expenditure, and while expenditure on pensions is increasing because of demographic pressures, this is being successfully managed within the overall welfare budget.</p>  <p>  This year (2015), the Department will spend an estimated &euro;6.675 billion on pensions &ndash; 34.4% of all welfare expenditure and an increase of &euro;168 million over 2014.  The overall concern of the Government in recent budgets has been to protect the primary weekly social welfare rates where possible.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty. </p>  <p>  A number of changes have been made to the State Pension Contributory in the past five years </p>  <p>  in the context of State pension reform and to provide for sustainable pensions.  The main changes are as follows: </p>  <p>  1.	The Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011 provided for the necessary amendments to increase the State pension age in line with the National Pensions Framework as set out in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  It provided for an increase in the age for qualification for the State Pension from 66 years to 67 years from 2021, and a further increase to 68 years from 2028.  It also discontinued the State Pension (Transition) for new claimants with effect from 1 January 2014.  </p>  <p>  2.	The number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions with effect from 6 April 2012, as provided for in the Social Welfare Act 1997. </p>  <p>  3.	From September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contribute more during a working life benefit more in retirement than those with lesser contributions.</p>  <p>  4.	From April 2012 the period for which a claim for State Pension can be backdated is six months as provided for under the Social Welfare Act 2011.</p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided for the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This will increase the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  This is a 1.3% increase over 2015 rates, and slightly ahead of the projected annual inflation rate of 1% for 2016.  There will also be proportional increases in the rates paid for Qualified Adults.  This will amount to up to &euro;2.70 per week for such dependent adults aged 66 or over. This change will be legislated for through the forthcoming Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2015.</p>  <p>  Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. </p><p>To qualify for a state pension (contributory) a person must </p><p>- have at least 520 paid contributions, and </p><p>- satisfy a yearly average condition (a yearly average of 48 contributions paid or credited is required for a full rate State pension (contributory), and reduced rates of payment may be payable for pensioners with lower averages). </p><blockquote>The homemaker's scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.  However, it is important to note that the homemaker's scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a SPC. The standard qualifying conditions for the SPC must also be satisfied. These require a person to enter insurable employment at least ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 520 contributions at the correct rate (credited contributions do not satisfy this condition) and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions paid or credited on their record. </blockquote><p>The rate of pension a person with 25 years of paid contributions will qualify for will vary depending on their circumstances, most notably the duration of their working life, whether they have credited contributions in respect of periods they were in receipt of social welfare payments, and whether they have periods under the homemaker's scheme.</p><p>For those with insufficient contributions to meet the requirements for a State pension (contributory), the State pension system provides alternative methods of support. Where someone over 66 does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may apply for a non-contributory pension, which is based on need and is means tested.  Currently the maximum rate of this pension is &euro;219 weekly, which is 95% of the maximum rate of the contributory pension.  Where it is more beneficial for the claimant, they may instead seek an Increase for Qualified Adult payment, on their spouse&rsquo;s State pension contributory, currently the maximum rate of which is &euro;206.30, which is 90% of the maximum personal rate. This increase is, by default, paid directly to the Qualified Adult. </p><p>Work is underway to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo;.  Under this approach, the number of contributions recorded over a working life will be more closely reflected in the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical challenges to be overcome in its implementation.The position of women who were homemakers will be considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p></reply>

Firstly there is the contributory principle.  Under this principle there is a direct link between the PRSI contributions that a person has paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions.  Where a person has sufficient PRSI contributions, then benefits and pensions may be paid as of right, where a particular contingency arises and without a means test.</p>  <p>  Secondly there is the solidarity principle.  Under this principle the benefits and pensions that are paid are not directly related to the amount of PRSI contributions paid by insured persons.  PRSI contribution income is instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable.  In this regard, it should be noted that some PRSI contributors do not experience all of the contingencies during their life, or may not be in a position to benefit from one or more such payment.  For example, one contributor may never require access to Invalidity Pension whereas it may be a crucial support for another.  Similarly, there will be many contributors who would not require coverage for Maternity Benefit, but who nevertheless continue to be levied PRSI at the full rate during their working years.</p>  <p>  In addition, there is a general principle of one person, one payment, which applies across the whole of the social welfare system.  Given the contingency-based nature of this system, it can happen that a person may experience more than one contingency at the same time.  For example, an unemployed person may become sick.  As a consequence, if a person experiences more than one of these contingencies at the same time, he or she can receive only one of those payments.  This principle is common to social security systems across the world.</p>  <p>  There were a limited number of exceptions in the social insurance system to the general principle of one person, one payment.  These exceptions usually applied in the context of short-term benefits.  For instance, recipients of One-Parent Family Payment, Widows and Widowers Pensioners could, until recent years, also receive short-term social insurance benefits, such as Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit at half-rate at the same time.  These overlapping payment arrangements were introduced in the early 1950s when the social insurance system was first established, at a time when there were only 10 individual social welfare payments and when rates were significantly lower in real terms than they are now.  However, the social welfare system has been significantly developed over the intervening period, with the result that the number of possible combinations of concurrent contingencies has increased greatly.</p>  <p>  In the context of the difficult fiscal environment in recent years and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain existing core rates of primary payments for social welfare recipients, the concurrent payment of half-rate Illness Benefit and Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit in addition to One-Parent Family Payment, and Widows and Widowers Pensions was discontinued from January 2012.   </p>  <p>  It is realistic and prudent to maintain the underlying principle of entitlement to only one payment at any one time, that is, one person, one payment.  To do otherwise could involve very significant and unsustainable additional expenditure in the long-term.  I have no plans, therefore, to introduce legislation allowing concurrent payment of Widows Pensions and Illness Benefit to the same person.</p></reply>

Where a person is born in the State, a PPS Number is allocated at the time of birth registration.  Where a person comes to the State and requires a PPS Number, they must attend at a PPS Number allocation centre.  Before a PPS Number can be allocated, the person making the application must provide evidence of identity and demonstrate a valid reason for the application.  PPS Numbers are issued by the Department following checks on an individual's identity.  In addition, acceptable evidence of address must be provided.  The process of allocating a PPS Number includes the capture of a photograph and signature.  Photographs captured are compared with other photographs previously captured in order to detect any possible duplicates.  </p>  <p>  A booking service for appointments for PPS Number allocations is being gradually introduced across all PPS Number allocation centres.  The PPS Number allocation centre for Dublin has moved to online bookings only because the number of persons turning up for allocations was resulting in long queues and delays, and some people being asked to return on an alternative date.  Details of these operational changes at the Dublin PPS Number allocation centre were displayed in the centre for 10 days prior to the changes being implemented and were detailed on the Department&rsquo;s website shortly afterwards.</p>  <p>  Other PPS Number allocation centres which are operating a booking service may also deal with people who drop in without making an appointment where time slots are available.</p></reply>

Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The weekly minimum contribution is &euro;30 for a single adult household and &euro;40 for coupled households. Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.  </p>  <p>  For rent supplement, maintenance payments of up to &euro;95.23 per week are assessed in determining the appropriate rate payable. Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than &euro;95.23, the first &euro;75 a week together with 25% of any additional maintenance above &euro;75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes.  Any changes to the conditions of the rent supplement scheme can only be considered in a budgetary context.</p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s overall strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose, short-term income support, by transferring responsibility for persons with long-term housing needs to the local authorities under the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP).</p></reply>

In this regard, I announced as part of Budget 2016, plans for NAMA to fund the delivery of 20,000 residential units by 2020 on a commercial basis.</p><p>The flexibility afforded by Section 11(2) of the NAMA Act allows NAMA to take account of distortions in the market for development land in achievement of its objectives. However, it is important to point out to the Deputy that this plan is a wholly commercial initiative which will go some way to addressing the current supply shortage, particularly in Dublin.  The initiative is fully in line with the Agency's primary objective to achieve maximum recovery on its assets and to maximise the return to Irish taxpayers through its funding for individual development projects. </p><p>I am advised that the NAMA Board has carried out a preliminary, high-level analysis of development sites controlled by its debtors and receivers with a view to identifying the scope for residential delivery over the five-year period to the end of 2020. Based on this preliminary analysis, NAMA advise that sites capable of delivering 14,000 units are commercially viable to develop based on current sales prices, current planning and current completion costs. I am further advised that sites capable of delivering at least another 6,000 units are commercially marginal to develop at current sales prices but may become commercially viable through intensive asset management and planning work by NAMA. The provision of requisite infrastructure by the local authorities, Irish Water and Transport Infrastructure Ireland will also contribute to the commercial viability of some sites. NAMA is currently carrying out a detailed, site-by-site, bottom-up review of the residential sites controlled by its debtors and receivers with a view to refining the potential delivery programme. </p><p>The delivery of this plan is estimated to require total funding from NAMA of &euro;4.5 billion with a peak funding requirement of &euro;2.5 billion.  This funding is expected to be fully recovered and is expected to enhance the overall recovery on NAMA's loans.  This funding will be drawn entirely from NAMA's own resources.</p><p>It is also very important to understand that NAMA is not building houses itself.  NAMA is not becoming a developer or a builder. Rather, NAMA is ensuring the delivery of these units through continued work with its existing debtors to agree development plans, secure/alter planning permission and funding the delivery of these residential units on a commercial basis.  All NAMA funding is on a commercial basis.</p><p>NAMA have produced a useful infographic which provides an overview of the key details of the proposal. This can be found on the NAMA website via the following link: </p><p>As regards social housing, NAMA funded developments are subject to the same planning and regulatory requirements as all other developments and this includes policy relating to social housing delivery as set out in Local Authority Housing Strategies in line with Part V of the Planning and Development Act (as amended). Therefore residential developments funded by NAMA will include Social Housing where required under said Part V.</p></reply>

This reinforces the highly progressive nature of the Irish income tax system.</p><p>Budget 2016 also increased the USC exemption threshold to &euro;13,000, and it is expected that in 2016 over 700,000 people, approximately 29% of income earners, will be outside the scope of USC.  The exemption threshold of &euro;13,000 relates to income liable to USC, and is in addition to any income which is not liable to USC such as social welfare pensions.</p><p>All the figures provided are based on estimates for 2016, using the actual data for the year 2013 (the latest year for which data are available) adjusted as necessary for income, self-employment and employment trends in the interim. They are provisional and may be revised.</p></reply>

As a consequence credits, tax bands and reliefs cannot be transferred from one partner to the other.</p><p>A cohabiting couple where both partners are working are entitled to claim, in aggregate, the same tax credits as a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership where they are both working.  The amount of income subject to tax at the standard rate (&euro;33,800 for each individual in 2015) equates to the &euro;67,600 marginal rate threshold in the case of a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership.</p><p>The difference between the two groups is the ability of married couples or civil partners to transfer certain elements such as the personal tax credit and part of the standard rate tax band. Specifically, part of the standard rate band entitlement of &euro;67,600 may be transferred, allowing one spouse or civil partner to earn up to &euro;42,800 at the standard rate.  This is of benefit where one of the individuals earns more than the standard rate threshold of &euro;33,800 and where the other individual earns less than &euro;33,800 or has no income.</p><p>The basis for the current tax treatment of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy vs. Attorney General (1980). This decision was based on Article 41.3.1 of the Constitution where the State pledges to protect the institution of marriage. The decision held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple, both of whom are working, to pay more tax than two single people living together and having the same income.</p><p>To the extent that there are differences in the tax treatment of the different categories of couples, such differences arise from the objective of dealing with different types of circumstances while at the same time respecting the constitutional requirements to protect the institution of marriage. Any change in the tax treatment of cohabiting couples can only be addressed in the broader context of future social and legal policy development in relation to such couples.</p><p>From a practical perspective, it would be very difficult to administer a regime for cohabitants which would be the same as that for married couples or civil partners.  Married couples and civil partners have a legal status that is verifiable. By contrast, it would be difficult, intrusive and time-consuming to confirm declarations by individuals that they were actually cohabiting.  It would also be both intrusive and administratively difficult to establish when a period of cohabitation started or ceased for any given couple.</p><p>The treatment of cohabiting couples for the purposes of social welfare is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Ms Joan Burton TD.  However, it is also based on the principle that married couples should not be treated less favourably than cohabiting couples.  This was given a constitutional underpinning following the Supreme Court decision in Hyland <i>v.</i>Minister for Social Welfare (1989) which ruled that it was unconstitutional for the total income a married couple received in social welfare benefits to be less than the couple would have received if they were unmarried and cohabiting.</p></reply>

The Central Bank had briefed industry representatives in August that it was proposing significant increases in those levies in 2015. The proposed increases were driven by a proliferation of legislative regulation and corresponding regulatory activity; a need to meet a shortfall from 2014's levies; and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17 (which was coupled with prevailing low yields on the bond market).</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's original proposals have since been revised to partially mitigate those increases as per a statement of 30th September 2015 published on the Central Bank's website. The revised proposals significantly reduced the increase in pension costs charged to the regulated sector in 2015 which is instead spread over coming years thereby easing the burden on financial services sector firms this year.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation. A well regulated financial services sector also benefits consumers, industry, and the economy at large. In order to ensure a well regulated financial services sector the Central Bank must be sufficiently resourced, particularly in terms of staff who are key to an effective regulatory regime. Pensions are a standard component in financial regulation costs given their link to staff costs.</p>  <p>  Under Section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank is required to seek my approval for the Regulations prescribing industry levies. As part of that process officials from my Department met with intermediary industry representatives in order to hear their concerns on the increase in levies payable by their members. Following the publication of the Central Bank's revised proposals, which significantly reduced the pension element of the 2015 levies, I approved the Regulations prescribing the 2015 levies on 7 October last.</p></reply>

I have received representations suggesting that instead of this, the rate and thresholds which apply should be those in place at the time of the grant of probate. I have no plans to make such a change. It is a general legislative principle that tax legislation should follow general law. According to the law of inheritance an inheritor comes to own an inherited asset on the date of inheritance, rather than on any other date. This is therefore the soundest and most appropriate date on which the rates and thresholds can apply.</p>  <p>  The amount of time elapsing between inheritance and grant of probate can vary greatly, and can also be determined to a large extent by inheritors themselves. As such, were the rate of tax due and the tax-free threshold available to be defined by date of probate there would be considerable scope for individuals to delay probate with the hope that the CAT regime would become more favourable for them.</p>  <p>  While I understand that there are inheritors for whom it would currently be advantageous for the tax-free threshold and rate of tax to apply according to the date of probate, as the threshold for inheritances from parents has been increased, there have been and could again be situations where the opposite is the case, for instance when the thresholds have been reduced or the rate increased.</p></reply>

I will ask the Registrar of Credit Unions to consider the views of the credit union movement as regards the draft regulations and their implementation and report back to me before I commence the remaining sections of the 2012 Act on 31 December 2015 in line with the introduction of the regulations. These sections of the 2012 Act, when commenced, will replace, amend or supplement existing sections of the  Credit Union Act 1997.</p>  <p>  The need for credit unions to grow income has been recognised as a requirement for sector viability. While developing new products and services is a necessary element of this, the Central Bank has highlighted the importance of credit unions ensuring that they are in a position to grow their income from their traditional lending business. It is also recognised that there is a level of change in the sector arising from the voluntary restructuring programme.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the concerns highlighted by the credit union sector and am satisfied in relation to the cap on members' savings that the Central Bank is developing an application process for credit unions to apply to continue to hold member accounts with savings in excess of the &euro;100,000 cap. Credit unions will be provided with the relevant information before end 2015. </p>  <p>Regarding lending restrictions placed on certain credit unions by the Central Bank,  the  Registrar of Credit Unions announced a review of lending restrictions   in February 2015 with a closing date for applications of 30 September 2015. The Central Bank has informed me that 59% of applications received have been reviewed. Of the applications which have been fully reviewed, 83% have had their lending restriction lifted and are now operating under the board s stated credit risk appetite. As of this week c. 40% of credit unions are now subject to a lending restriction.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has informed me that since 2010 it has received less than 10 applications for approval of additional services under sections 48 to 52 of the Credit Union Act 1997. These applications have all been received in recent months and are currently at a various stages of the approvalprocess. The e Central Bank further informed me that it is open to working with the credit union sector to ensure that prudent and appropriate development can be facilitated within the regulatory framework. In supporting the sustainable and prudent development of the sector, the Central Bank is working to ensure that proposed changes to the business model are prudently structured and implemented. To that effect the Central Bank has invited a number of interested parties in the credit union sector to participate in focused dialogue in November 2015 with a view to gaining a better understanding of how credit unions want to develop their business model and to identify changes that may be required to the regulatory framework to facilitate prudent development.</p>  <p>  Commencement of all sections of the 2012 Act has been aligned with the credit union financial year and the introduction of the underpinning Central Bank regulations, with a view to implementation of the 2012 Act in a coherent and cohesive manner. The publication of the regulations marks another important step in the development of a strengthened regulatory framework for credit unions. It is considered that these regulations, combined with the commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act and the prudential and governance requirements already in place, provide an appropriate regulatory framework for the credit union sector at this time.</p>  <p>  The provision of regulation making powers to the Central Bank on commencement of the remaining sections of the 2012 Act provides flexibility so that the Central Bank can, in the future, review and update the regulations as appropriate on a timely basis following consultation. The Central Bank is keen to ensure that the regulations remain appropriate for the credit union sector and in the future, where credit unions set out a clear path on how they wish to develop the Central Bank will consider any amendments to the regulations that may be appropriate.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the International Credit Union Regulators' Network (ICURN) review was to assess the performance of the Central Bank's performance of its regulatory functions in relation to credit unions. The review assessed the legal, regulatory and prudential supervisory framework in place to fulfil the Central Bank's mandate under section 84 of the Credit Union Act, 1997 and accordingly focused on the legal and regulatory framework for the regulation of credit unions in effect at the time of the review. Overall the review found that the Central Bank effectively performs its functions in the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector.</p>  <p>  ICURN made a number of recommendations for refinements. Under the heading Communications and Guidance, ICURN also suggested that consideration be given by the relevant authority to directing a review to evaluate the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions. ICURN further stated that this is not a matter for the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the suggestion made in the ICURN report that a review to evaluate the implementation of the original recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions could be carried out by the Credit Union Advisory Committee.</p>  <p>   The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is absolutely determined to continue to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement.</p></reply>

Participation in rounding is voluntary for retailers and consumers.  It is expected that the introduction of rounding will reduce the use of 1 cent and 2 cent coins. The production costs of 1c coins exceed their face value (unit cost of 1.65c), while the production costs of 2 cent coins is only slightly lower than their face value (unit cost of 1.94 cent). While no formal study has been done on the overall economy-wide cost of having 1 cent and 2 cent coins in widespread circulation, extrapolating from an international study suggests that they cost approximately &euro;10m per annum when the costs of storing, transporting, counting and processing is included. The Central Bank has produced 2.5 billion of these coins since the launch of the euro, though these are taken out of circulation by consumers rather than being used in shops, indicating that consumer see them as little benefit in facilitating transactions. The Central Bank ran a trial of Rounding in Wexford in 2013 which showed strong support for Rounding, with 85% of consumers and 100% of retailers who expressed an opinion wanting it rolled-out nationally.</p>  <p>  The Government does not intend to eliminate the production of 1c and 2c coins. These coins retain their legal tender status, a status which can only be changed at a eurozone level. The EU Commission reviewed the continued use of these coins in 2013 and set out a number of options given the cost of their production and the fact that EU consumers seem to hoard the coins rather than actually use them for transactions. However it was decided not to abolish these coins at a Eurozone level at this stage.</p></reply>

Last May, I requested a report from the Central Bank on the topic which I subsequently published. This report was entitled 'Influences on Standard Variable Rate Pricing in Ireland'.</p><p>The Central Bank has informed me that in its research on mortgage interest rates, it has focussed mainly on four aspects. First, the cost and risk factors which have influenced, and are likely to continue to influence, mortgage rates. Second, the influence of the competitive environment on the rates charged. Third, the distribution of borrowers as to size of loan, date of borrowing and rate currently charged. Fourth, the transparency of the banks' policies for determining movements in rates, especially their &quot;standard variable rates&quot;.

Contrary to the premise of the question, this particular document does not refer to mortgage contracts.</p><p>With regard to my action in relation to mortgage holders more generally, as you know, I have taken steps to ensure that the banks provide options for mortgage holders to reduce their monthly repayments.  Last May I met with the six main mortgage lenders May and outlined my view that the standard variable rate being charged to Irish customers was too high. The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.</p><p>In September I concluded a series of follow up meetings with these banks and the reality is that the majority have put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments. These options range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan to value and reductions in fixed rates.</p><p>While, it is a matter for each individual borrower to decide what suits their circumstances, I have encouraged borrowers to contact their bank to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory.</p></reply>

These owners and insolvency practitioners are responsible for managing all assets, including the procurement of design, planning and construction services as required. NAMA requires debtors and receivers to agree project budgets in advance of incurring any expenditure. Where drawdown requests are made by debtors or receivers in line with agreed budgets NAMA typically processes such requests within 2 working days.  In the context of such short approval periods, the suggestion that there are administrative blockages does not stand up to scrutiny. While there is no question of NAMA's credit application and drawdown processes giving rise to any material delay in the payment of approved expenditure, the Deputy will no doubt appreciate that expenditure of taxpayers' money must be managed rigorously and prudently.</p><p>Within the context of the above, NAMA expects its debtors and receivers to discharge all approved expenditure in a timely fashion. The Deputy will appreciate that in most commercial situations works commissioned will require completion prior to payment. If the Deputy wishes to raise a particular case then I would encourage him to contact NAMA using the dedicated Oireachtas email address and NAMA has assured me they will examine the matter.</p></reply>

It is critical that work pays for every family. The tax system has a role to play in supporting job creation and the maintenance of existing jobs.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, there are costs associated with hiring an employee, which include the wages of that employee and the relevant employer's PRSI liability. In addition, the level of the income tax liability of employees affects net pay, with consequential effects on decisions whether to take up or return to employment, or indeed to work additional hours. Reductions in income tax therefore can support job creation and thus lead to more job opportunities for individuals in general, as well as for those who have been absent from the workforce for a number of years for reasons of child-rearing or other family considerations.</p><p>The changes I announced in Budget 2016 aim to support job creation. They focus the majority of the available resources on tax reductions for low and middle income families.</p><p>From the 1st of January, the entry threshold to USC will increase from &euro;12,012 to &euro;13,000, removing over 40,000 workers from the scope of the charge entirely. It is estimated that over 700,000 income earners will not be liable to USC at all from next year.</p><p>The three lowest rates of USC are also being reduced, from 1.5%, 3.5% and 7% to 1%, 3% and 5.5% respectively. This will reduce the marginal rate of tax to 49.5 per cent for all earners under &euro;70,044; the first time since the supplementary budget in April 2009 that the marginal rate has dropped below 50 per cent for middle income earners.</p><p>The Home Carer Tax Credit is being increased by &euro;190 to bring it up to &euro;1,000 per year, to assist single income married couples with children or who care for an elderly or incapacitated relative.  In a move specifically targeted at supporting lower-income families, the income threshold up to which the home carer can earn has also been increased by &euro;2,120. Where the income of the primary earner does not exceed &euro;35,600, the home carer will now be able to earn up to &euro;7,200 and still benefit in full from the tax credit.</p><p>I have also announced in Budget 2016 changes to the current PRSI system, to address an issue affecting lower-paid workers which could result in a situation where an employee could receive a pay increase but find themselves with less net salary after deductions due to the PRSI 'step effect'. A tapered PRSI credit is being introduced to alleviate the step effect across a range of incomes. This change will ensure that low income earners within this income range will see a significant improvement in net take-home pay.</p><p>For Employer's PRSI, the entry point to the top 10.75 per cent rate will be increased by &euro;20 per week to &euro;376 per week. This will ensure that the liability to employer's PRSI for a full-time worker on the minimum wage will remain subject to the lower 8.5 per cent rate of PRSI following the increase in the minimum wage announced in Budget 2016.</p><p>These changes are designed to support job creation and reward work, both for new entrants to the job market and for people returning to the workforce after a number of years.</p><p>In addition, the Deputy may be interested in the JobsPlus scheme. It is an employer incentive which encourages and rewards employers who employ jobseekers who are on the Live Register. It is designed to encourage employers and businesses to employ individuals who have been out of work for long periods. It is administered by the Department of Social Protection. Further information is available at that Department's website at the following link .</p></reply>

The Deputy will appreciate that tax reliefs and exemptions have costs which have to be paid for and their introduction must be considered only where there is a clear economic and social policy need to be addressed.</p>  <p>  Stamp Duties are payable on the acquisition of residential property. The current rates are 1% on values up to &euro;1M and 2% on any balance over that. I do not consider that a rate of 1% on the purchase of a property would represent a serious disincentive to any property owner considering trading down.</p>  <p>  In relation to Capital Gains Tax (CGT), an exemption is in place on the disposal of a person's principal private residence.  The exemption applies to any gain made on the disposal of an individual's dwelling house together with land occupied up to an area of one acre, excluding the site of the house. Full CGT relief applies where the period of occupation matches the period of ownership, and partial relief applies where the house has not been occupied by the individual for the full period of ownership.</p>  <p>  It should be noted in relation to local property tax (LPT), that where a person downsizes their residential property, assuming they stay in a similar location to the property they are selling, their LPT liability will, most likely, be less than the amount they would have been liable for on their original property. </p>  <p>  Finally, individuals over the age of 65 with annual incomes below &euro;18,000, or couples over that age who are married or in civil partnerships with annual incomes below &euro;36,000 are exempt from DIRT on any savings with a financial services provider. Marginal relief is available for those whose incomes slightly exceed these amounts. This exemption would be available to such persons where the downsizing involved the movement to a property of lower value with part or all of the balance being placed with a financial services provider. </p></reply>

In this regard, Construction 2020 sets out the Government's strategy for tackling those critical blockages that appear to be inhibiting the sector's capacity including problems in the planning system, the weak balance sheet situation of developers, access to development finance, rigid construction costs and industry capacity constraints - including skilled labour shortages. </p>  <p>  I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to the announcement made in Budget 2016 in relation to NAMA's intention to target the delivery of 20,000 additional residential units before the end of 2020.  90% of the residential units will be provided in the greater Dublin Area, where the demand for housing is greatest. Approximately 75% of these units will be houses, primarily starter homes. </p>  <p>  These actions along with other initiatives such as Social Housing Strategy are important in revitalising the sector and increasing the supply of housing however it will take time for the full effect of these measures to be realised. </p>  <p>  I can assure the Deputy that the sector's recovery is being actively monitored and where appropriate this Government will adopt additional measures that support the long-term sustainable development of the sector. </p></reply>

Article 30 of the TFEU  (ex Article 25 TEC) provides that customs duties on imports and exports and charges having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States. </p>  <p>  Prior to 1 January 1993, Motor Vehicle Excise Duty (MVED) was levied on a motor vehicle upon manufacture and release for purchase in the State or upon importation into the State. Following the signing of the Maastricht Treaty, considerable reform of Ireland's excise duty regime was undertaken to ensure the compatibility of all excise duties with European Union law.

In replying to the Deputy's question of 20 October, I also noted that the Irish tax treatment   of exempting income and chargeable gains   applies regardless of whether the ARF provider is an insurance company or a different type of provider. </p>  <p>  The Deputy's question concerns the United Kingdom treatment, under the Ireland/UK Double Taxation Convention, of income and gains from UK property of an ARF. As stated in my reply to the previous Parliamentary Question, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that this UK treatment is a matter that is under consideration by her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and the Revenue Commissioners. The UK treatment for tax purposes of the income and gains concerned is primarily a matter for the United Kingdom. In these circumstances it would be inappropriate to comment on the possible relevance for such treatment of, as yet unpublished, EU Commission decisions.</p></reply>

The Directive does allow Member States to impose a minimum excise duty on tobacco products, which in practice puts a floor under retail prices and protects tax revenues.</p>  <p>  The minimum excise duty in Ireland currently amounts to &euro;6.15 on a pack of 20 cigarettes; VAT on this excise duty would amount to &euro;1.41, giving a total of &euro;7.56 before any account is made for the trade element in the price and consequential further excise and VAT.  The excise duty payable on a 25g pack of roll-your-own tobacco is &euro;7.29; VAT on this excise duty would amount to &euro;1.68, giving a total of &euro;8.97 before any account is made for the trade element in the price and consequential further VAT.</p>  <p>  Tobacco companies are obliged to declare to Revenue the maximum retail selling price of cigarettes. No such obligation applies in relation to other tobacco products. The Commissioners inform me that, at present, the lowest maximum price declared for cigarettes range from &euro;8 to &euro;8.50 for 20 cigarettes. Most cigarettes sold in Ireland retail at higher prices and the Budget 2016 tax increases had the effect of increasing the price of cigarettes in the most popular price category by 50 cent to &euro;10.50 per pack of 20.</p>  <p>  The high levels of tax have a key influence on the retail price of tobacco products and Ireland has among the highest prices and taxes in respect of  tobacco products in the EU. The high rates of tax prevailing here reflect the long-standing commitment by successive Governments to use tobacco taxation to raise the retail price of tobacco as an instrument to discourage smoking, particularly amongst younger people. The tax and pricing policy is having the desired affect and the Healthy Ireland survey carried out this year for the Department of Health indicates that the number of daily smokers has been reduced to 19% of the adult population.</p></reply>

A letter setting out an overview of the non-life insurance sector and the Central Bank's 2015 specific supervisory engagement with loss-making firms within it, while abiding by the relevant provisions under statute that prohibit the Central Bank from disclosing confidential information other than in summary or collective form.</p>  <p>2. Section 3.3 of the Central Bank's 2015 Macro-Financial Review which provides a review of insurance in Ireland, the challenges faced by its sub-sectors and the interplay of insurance with financial stability.</p>  <p>3.  A note on changes taking place in Ireland that are making the claims environment volatile. </p>  <p>4. Some suggested areas of domestic policy which could bring greater stability to the operating environment of general insurance in Ireland and reinforce the Central Bank's ability to supervise insurance firms.</p>  <p>  A number of issues are widely reported to be contributing to the increasing cost of insurance in Ireland and some of these were raised by the Governor in his letter.  This has in turn coincided with the introduction of Solvency II in January 2016 leading to a necessity for insurance companies to increase their capital reserves.  The Central Bank has stated publically that insurance companies may need to increase their premiums in order to do this.</p>  <p> This is an important issue, but also a complex one involving a number of different parties, including Government Departments, State bodies and private sector entities.  My officials are examining the points raised by the Governor and those raised by other interested parties in this area. A process is underway to examine them in detail and to determine what actions may need to be taken. </p></reply>

Where an individual is entitled to the State pension and such pension is increased by virtue of that individual having a qualifying adult dependant, it remains one pension for tax purposes.</p>  <p>  This position was not changed by Finance (No.2) Act 2013 which inserted Section 126 (2B) into the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 in order to reaffirm the position that any increase in the amount of such a pension in respect of a qualifying adult is treated as if it arises to and is payable to the beneficiary of the pension i.e. the person who qualifies for the pension.  It is, therefore, that person's obligation to declare the pension, including any amount paid in respect of a qualifying adult dependent as part of his or her income.</p>  <p>  With regard to the effective tax rates suggested in the details supplied, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as only the individual in receipt of the State pension is liable to income tax on it, and as any such element of their income is only taxed once, there is no basis for the effective rates suggested.  It is also worth pointing out that all social welfare payments are exempt from USC.</p>  <p>  I would point out that the changes to the income tax system included in Budget 2015 mean that individuals who paid Income Tax and or USC in 2014 are seeing a reduction in their tax bill in 2015 where incomes are equal.  This process is continuing with the Budget 2016 changes, which will lead to a further reduction in the tax burden on low and middle income earners from next year.</p></reply>

The group published its report in July 2015 and a copy of the report is available on the website of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs at.</p><p>In that report, while tax credits and/or fee subsidies were ranked very highly by parents as a key measure to improving affordability of child care, the group recommended that direct subsidies would be a more effective way of targeting scarce Government resources.  Among the many arguments against the introduction of tax relief was the fact that tax relief is only of benefit to those in the tax net and it is estimated that in 2016, 36% of income earners will be exempt from income tax altogether. It was also argued that any tax relief would most likely be absorbed by child care providers in the form of higher prices. Whilst a credit based on a range of take-up and eligibility assumptions was considered (with tentative costings in the range of &euro;290 million to &euro;592 million per annum), pursuit of this option was not recommended.</p><p>The Deputy will also be aware of measures that were announced in Budget 2016 in relation to child care, which are set out below for his information. </p><p>The Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme has been extended to provide that children will be eligible for free child care from three years of age up until they are five and a half, or until they start primary school.

The banks agreed to review their rates and products and, by the beginning of July, to have simple options to reduce monthly mortgage payments for SVR customers.</p>  <p>  I then conducted a follow-up series of meetings with these banks in September to discuss various issues and review the progress that had been made in relation to mortgage interest rates.  I met senior management of AIB on 14 September 2015.</p>  <p>  In advance of this meeting, a suggested agenda was circulated internally.  The item in relation to media plans was a standard point which referred to asking the banks about their media plans to advertise rate changes, options for mortgage customers or switching opportunities, for example.</p>  <p>  At these meetings, the banks updated me on general issues and outlined where they had put options in place to allow borrowers reduce their repayments.  These options range from lower variable rates to new suites of variable rates based on loan to value and reductions in fixed rates.  The banks also discussed any media campaigns which they were undertaking in relation to these initiatives.</p>  <p>  I have since encouraged borrowers to contact their banks to see what is available to them in their circumstances or consider moving to another bank, where possible, if the offer is not satisfactory.</p></reply>

The Programme has a total value, including Member State contributions, of more than &euro;280 million for the period 2014-2020.  The INTERREG programme has four key priority areas for investment, namely research and innovation, the environment, sustainable transport, and health.    </p>  <p>  In addition, I am pleased that the Irish Government was able to secure the approval of the European Council for &euro;150 million of EU funding towards a new cross-border PEACE Programme for the same period, and that the UK Government subsequently decided to allocate an additional &euro;50 million of ERDF funding from its European Territorial Cooperation allocation to the Programme, bringing the total amount of EU funding to &euro;200 million.  Along with match funding from the two Member States, the programme will have a total value of almost &euro;270 million.   The focus of the PEACE IV programme will be on social inclusion and combating poverty,  with investment proposed in a number of areas, including shared education, children and young people, shares spaces and services, and building positive relations at a local level.  I look forward to the new Programme being adopted by the Commission before the end of the year.</p>  <p>  Together the two programmes represent more than half a billion Euro of investment in Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland over the next seven years.  The programmes are managed on behalf of the two Member States by the Special EU Programmes Body, operating under the aegis of the North South Ministerial Council and the Monitoring Committees established under the relevant EU legislation.</p></reply>

Engineering consultants have been appointed by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to implement the Programme, through six regional studies. Local authorities and other stakeholders are involved, in partnership with the OPW, on Steering Groups and Progress Groups across the six study areas.  The Programme is focusing on 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFAs), including 90 coastal areas, identified as being at potentially significant risk from flooding. The CFRAM Programme includes a number of areas within Co. Meath and involves the production of predictive flood hazard and risk mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of Flood Risk Management Plans. The Plans will be used to determine national priorities for State investment in flood defences, on a systematic and objective basis taking into account social, environmental and economic factors.  </p><p>Under the CFRAM Programme to date, draft flood maps have been produced and were the subject of a series of local public consultation days held in March 2015.  Draft flood maps for those AFAs in County Meath which are being assessed under the East CFRAM study, have been produced and are available to view and to comment on via the website www.eastcframstudy.ie. The draft flood maps will be finalised following a national consultation scheduled for late 2015.  </p><p>Bettystown AFA was studied under the pilot Fingal East Meath Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study (FEM FRAMS). The draft Flood Risk Management Plan produced under this study includes a number of flood protection measures for the Laytown/Bettystown area, with Meath County Council as the lead agency for implementation, pending finalisation of the Plan by Fingal County Council. Details of this study are available at: .</p><p>The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the CFRAM Plans.</p></reply>

The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010 were introduced unilaterally by the previous Government to deal with the fiscal crisis.  The current Government introduced the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act (Amendment Act) 2011 on foot of a referendum of the people and the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 following the negotiation and agreement of a Collective Agreement.  These Acts are collectively known as FEMPI Acts 2009-2013.</p>  <p>  Underpinned by the FEMPI legislation, in the period from 2010 to 2015 two major Public Service Agreements were put in place: the Public Service Agreement 2010 to 2014 (Croke Park Agreement) and the Public Service Stability Agreement 2013 to 2016 (Haddington Road Agreement).  These reflected agreements reached between public service employers and staff on a comprehensive series of radical measures such as pay cuts,  numbers reductions, moratorium on recruitment, voluntary redundancy programmes and so on. From 2009 to 2014 the cost to the Exchequer of public service pay was reduced by &euro;3.7 billion, or more than 21%.</p>  <p>  In my statutory role under the legislation, I am required to carry out a review and report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the operation, effectiveness and impact of the FEMPI Acts, and to consider whether or not any of the provisions of the Acts continue to be necessary.  My most recent report was completed and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in accordance with the legislative requirements on 29 June.  In my report to the Oireachtas I noted that the expenditure reductions and savings generated by the legislation remain an integral and necessary part of the financial adjustment required to meet our international commitments but that I proposed to bring forward legislation to ameliorate the impact of those measures on public servants and others affected.  That legislation, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2015, is currently before the Oireachtas for consideration and  reflects the terms of  the Lansdowne Road Agreement which has been negotiated and accepted by  the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, following a ballot among members of staff associations and unions. That we are able to consider reversing the pay reductions reflects the encouraging improvements in the public finances that have resulted from the necessary but extremely difficult fiscal consolidation path which this Government has pursued since 2011. The provisions of the legislation provide for pay restoration to all public servants while focussing on those at the lower levels of pay, and are to be implemented on a phased basis from January 2016 to September 2018. The pay restoration measures provided for in the Bill are consistent with the current fiscal space available to the Government   and the requirement to manage public expenditure in accordance with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact.</p>  <p>  The proposal made for a total reversal of the measures as provided for under the  FEMPI Acts 2009-2013 would simply recreate the fiscal crisis and reverse the significant improvements secured to date. </p></reply>

I would also point out that PSPR has never been applied to  those retired public servants and their dependants on the lowest annual pensions up to &euro;12,000.  </p><p>Based on the 2015 Bill's PSPR proposals which I have outlined, a major amelioration of the PSPR burden over a multi-year time horizon is proposed, at the end of which the great majority of public service pensioners, with the exception of those on the higher levels of pension income, will no longer be affected by PSPR. </p><p>Under section 12 of the FEMPI Act 2013, I am required to review the necessity of FEMPI legislation annually and cause a written report of my findings to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Economic progress and fiscal consolidation in the years ahead will determine the scope and timing of possible further scale-back or elimination of the financial emergency measures including those applying to public service pensioners.</p></reply>

This includes &euro;20 million in capital carryover from 2014.</p>  <p>  The &euro;810.16 million is broken down between Capital funding of &euro;509 million and Current expenditure of &euro;301.16 million. The capital provision is by way of grants for enterprise development and research and innovation supports via the enterprise agencies, primarily though Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and the Local Enterprise Offices. The current monies are used to support the day-to-day running costs of the Department and its agencies covering Pay, Pensions and Non-Pay expenditure.</p>  <p>  In addition to the direct Exchequer provision of &euro;810.16 million referred to above, the enterprise agencies also have sanction from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to generate and expend Own Resource Income totalling &euro;115 million in support of the enterprise, regulation and innovation agendas this year. The indicative gross Current expenditure on the Department&rsquo;s Vote at the end of October is &euro;235 million representing 5% behind the initially profiled level. The Department will have a current underspend by year end though it is difficult to be precisely accurate given the nature of current expenditure and with two months activity still remaining in the year.</p>  <p>  Full capital expenditure is envisaged in 2015. In addition a further &euro;50 million in capital monies has recently been approved by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to be provided to the Department for use this year. This will necessitate a Supplementary Estimate in the weeks ahead. The additional capital provision is to be used to further enterprise, research and innovation activities. It will also allow for earlier payment on matured liabilities relating to the Programme for Research in Third-level Institutions (PRTLI). </p>  <p>  The 2016 provision for the Department as set out in the 2016 Expenditure Report published on Budget Day 13 October, 2015 totals &euro;792 million. This is broken down between &euro;495 million in Capital and &euro;297 million in Current allocations. The aforementioned earlier payment of matured PRTLI liabilities will ensure that the funding available to the Department&rsquo;s enterprise agencies will be maintained in 2016. Indeed I would point out that some additional monies are being provided for next year. For example IDA Ireland is being provided with an additional &euro;14 million to enable it to continue expansion of its Regional Development Advanced Facilities programme.</p>  <p>  In addition it is anticipated that Own Resource Income totalling &euro;115 million will be sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform through the 2016 Revised Estimates Volume for use by the enterprise agencies next year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-03a.742.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300072#WRO00500"><p>The goal of this Government has been to replace all of the jobs lost during the economic crisis and deliver sustainable full employment by the end of 2018.   The Government introduced the Action Plan for Jobs process in 2012, where annually we have mapped out a significant number of targets to support the maintenance and creation of jobs. We are on track to exceed our target of 100,000 additional jobs by 2016. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I announced funding for a competitive process to drive enterprise growth and new employment in all regions. As part of this initiative, Enterprise Ireland has launched two competitive funds in 2015:</p>  <p>  - A &euro;5 million Community Enterprise Initiative Scheme to support collaborative proposals to promote entrepreneurship, create jobs, foster innovation and enhance export opportunities for small business.</p>  <p>  - A &euro;5 million Competitive Fund for Local Enterprise Offices to fund initiatives impacting on and supporting micro-enterprise throughout the country.</p>  <p>  - A &euro;40m open competitive call for strategic, sectorally focused and regionally based projects will also be launched by Enterprise Ireland over the coming months. To inform the design of this formal open competitive call, submissions were invited in August that will help to identify potential areas of enterprise and sectoral opportunities. These submissions are currently being examined by Enterprise Ireland.</p>  <p>  The Clonshaugh Business and Technology Park is currently the location of IDA Ireland clients such as Forest Labs and Amazon. There are no marketable lands remaining in the Park but there are, however, a number of vacant large-scale industrial units and, as part of its value proposition for Dublin, IDA Ireland markets these large facilities to suitable potential clients. </p>  <p>  As is evidenced with IDA Ireland investment announcements over the past number of years, a significant number locate in Dublin so it is reasonable to expect that this trend will continue and, while significant progress has been made in supporting job creation and in reducing unemployment rates in all regions of the country, this Government is not complacent about the challenge of achieving sustainable full employment over the medium term, in all regions including Clonshaugh Industrial Park.</p>  <p>  Dublin is recognised as one of Europe&rsquo;s leading business locations and is now an internationally renowned cluster for technology and financial services companies. The city has been a spectacular success in terms of Foreign Direct Investment as it hosts many of the world&rsquo;s leading companies such as Google, eBay, PayPal, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Oracle, Pfizer, Amgen, IBM, Citi and Accenture, BNY Mellon, Takeda and Bristol Myers Squibb. All of these multinationals use the abundance of infrastructure and utilities available in the capital to run their operations. </p>  <p>  As Ireland competes for high quality investments, the concept of scale is crucial.  Leading global corporations require a significant population pool, access to qualified talent, world class physical and digital infrastructure in addition to the availability of sophisticated professional and business support services.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland&rsquo;s strategy for Dublin is aimed at progressing the business infrastructure, including the development of a knowledge economy, in order that the region can compete both nationally and internationally for foreign direct investment.  The Agency continues to work with the existing client base in Dublin to encourage them to expand and diversify into higher value added goods and services. They also act as a broker between the Higher Education Authorities, key client companies and Science Foundation Ireland, to encourage further research and development. Dublin is already global in the scale of its education and research infrastructure and is well positioned as a &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; city which competes successfully on the global stage.</p></reply>

The strategy has a strong focus on regional development, setting forth aims and strategies to achieve a significant increase in investment going into regional locations. To support that aim, IDA Ireland is rolling out a &euro;150million capital investment programme to help attract more multinational jobs into each region over a 5-year period. This programme will include investments over the coming years in building advanced technology buildings and office facilities in a number of regional locations to provide state-of-the-art property solutions for clients.  Tralee is to be the site of one such advanced technology building.IDA Ireland markets Kerry as part of its South West region, along with Cork.  There are 12 IDA Ireland client companies, employing 1,874 people. Companies supported by IDA Ireland in Kerry have added 361 additional new jobs between 2011 &ndash; 2014 (a 24% increase) compared to 502 job losses in the period 2008 &ndash; 2010 (a 25% decrease). It should be noted that 70% of new IDA jobs come from existing client companies, not from new investments.</p><p>Marketing of any regional area, including Kerry, for Foreign Direct Investment is done through IDA Ireland&rsquo;s network of overseas offices.  IDA Ireland actively incentivises and encourages investors to consider a range of potential locations in Ireland although the ultimate locations selected are always decided<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>by the companies themselves.</p><p>Finally, a further boost to the county is the reinstatement of Regional Aid for Co. Kerry under the new Regional Aid Guidelines, which came into force on 1 July, 2014. The RAGs enable the State to grant State Aid, at enhanced rates, to businesses in order to support new investment and new employment in productive projects in Ireland's most disadvantaged regions. The funding for this comes from the Exchequer. This means that the full range of Regional Aid assistance options are available in Kerry.  </p></reply>

The Action Plan process is working. Over 126,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012, exceeding the original target of an additional 100,000 jobs by 2016, 21 months ahead of target. The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 9.3 per cent in September 2015.  We are not complacent about the requirements to sustain the momentum of job creation across the range of policy areas that impact on the environment for business and competitiveness and efficient labour market operation, including issues relating to the property market.</p><p>The adequate supply of quality, affordable housing, in the right locations, is a contributing factor to Ireland&rsquo;s overall competitiveness. For example, it contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s attractiveness for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), for mobile talent, and house price inflation can feed into wage pressures which in turn can impact on our competitiveness.  This is particularly true in urban areas where employment growth is especially strong, and housing supply is still suffering from the impact of the property crash.  </p><p>Following several years of significant cost reductions &ndash; in terms of both construction and rental/purchase costs, property costs are again emerging as an issue to sustained cost competitiveness. The link between house prices and wage expectations means that developments in the residential property sector do impact on international competitiveness. </p><p>The Government is addressing the shortage of supply in a number of ways. <i>Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>, which was published last year and drew on analysis and research by Forf&aacute;s for my Department, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed. </p><p>The regulation of the rental market raises many complex economic and legal issues. Measures proposed have to be balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike. I understand that my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government intends to bring proposals in relation to the rental sector to Government for decision as soon as possible. Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government.</p><p>The Government has also prioritised social housing, as set out in the Government&rsquo;s Social Housing Strategy 2020 and the &euro;2.9 billion in funding under the Government&rsquo;s capital plan. In Budget 2016 investment in housing infrastructure was given priority with a total housing provision in 2016 of &euro;923 million. NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020 with 90 per cent of these units to be in the greater Dublin area. </p><p>In addition, the Regional Action Plans for Jobs, which my Department is developing with stakeholders in all regions this year, have placed a strong emphasis on creating attractive places where people can live and work, with consequent links to the competitiveness of the environment for start-ups, innovation and entrepreneurship. The progress in creating attractive and competitive environments for business in the regions, across all the key dimensions including property solutions, will be part of the work of the stakeholder Implementation Groups for the Plans at regional level.  </p></reply>

Both companies have very substantial operations in Ireland, encompassing a wide range of activities, one of the companies employs about 2,300 staff and the other has a workforce here of about 3,200.  These are quality jobs, and mostly in regional locations, which makes their presence in this country of significant strategic value.    The proposed acquisition is not yet complete and no decisions have been announced as to the future business direction of the enlarged company. Accordingly it is not possible at this stage to give an indication of any likely outcomes for the Irish businesses.  I have asked IDA Ireland to engage closely with the local and head office management of the two companies in order to emphasise the value of their Irish operations and to seek to secure and embed their operations in this country. In addition, I myself have met senior management of both companies in the recent past and I will continue to engage with them into the future, to highlight the importance of their operations here and the advantages and attractions which Ireland can offer to contribute to their ongoing development.       </p></reply>

The enterprise sector has led the economic recovery, with our enterprises and entrepreneurs innovating, developing and improving their products and services to meet the needs of customers in markets across the globe    The goal of this Government has been to replace all of the jobs lost during the economic crisis and deliver sustainable full employment by the end of 2018. This whole of Government effort has been integrated into the Action Plan for Jobs process which aims to strengthen the enterprise base, support entrepreneurship, improve competitiveness and support regional development. Since the launch of the first plan in Q1 2012, 126,000 more people are at work - exceeding the original target of an additional 100,000 jobs by 2016.</p>  <p>  The recovery in jobs and exports to date is in large part due to the considerable improvements in the business environment for enterprise that have taken place in recent years. The measures announced by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2016 last month will further strengthened the attractiveness of Ireland as a place for innovation, entrepreneurship and investment &ndash; delivering sustainable job creation and growth.  A competitive, innovative enterprise base is at the core of Ireland&rsquo;s future economic development and growth. </p>  <p>  Ireland is the first country world-wide to offer an OECD compliant Knowledge Development Box (KDB) offering certainty to global and Irish owned enterprises.  The OECD nexus approach sets out the principles and guidelines under which income arising from IP assets can qualify for a lower rate of tax under a KDB initiative.  Ireland&rsquo;s KDB rate is 6.25 percent (half of the corporation tax rate of 12.5 percent) and is internationally competitive. </p>  <p>  The Knowledge Box, as announced in the 2016 Budget speech, will support and encourage investment in research and development in Ireland and the increased the protection and exploitation of intellectual property arising. </p>  <p>  The Finance Bill also allows for the introduction of a provision pertaining to &lsquo;Companies with income arising from intellectual property of less than &euro;7,500,000&rsquo; which will be introduced during 2016 when the necessary legislation to give it effect is enacted and will be of direct benefit to companies of a relatively lower scale, with global income of less than &euro;50 million.

However, not all regions are yet fully experiencing the benefits of economic recovery.  The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs includes a Disruptive Reform to develop the potential of the regions to support enterprise growth and job creation.  A key element of this disruptive reform involves the development of 8 <i>Regional Action Plans for Jobs, </i>to include actions to be taken across a range of Departments and agencies to ensure that all regions of the country can fulfil their enterprise and jobs potential.  </p><p>The objective of the Regional Action Plans is to strengthen and develop regional collaboration by encouraging local authorities, regional bodies, higher education institutions, the private sector and communities to come forward with innovative ideas to boost job creation in their area.The aim is to capitalise on regional strengths, assets and areas of competitive advantage in order to support businesses in each region to start-up, succeed, expand, and export.</p><p>To date four  plans (Midlands, South West, South East and Mid West have been published,  The West plan will be launched in November, with the remaining three (Border, Mid East, Dublin) currently in development and due for launch as soon as possible.</p><p>Each regional Action Plan includes a series of practical actions to support enterprise growth and job creation in the region, within clear timelines for delivery.The Action Plans seek to capitalise on the particular strengths and opportunities of each region and have been developed by my Department with the support of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland, in close consultation with regional stakeholders from the public and private sectors.  </p><p>As is the case with the national Action Plan process, it is the cumulative effect of delivering the actions in the regional Plans that will make a real and lasting impact on the business environment and jobs in the regions.  While there is already a lot of collaboration between public bodies, Higher Education Institutions, the private sector and communities at local level, a central aim of the regional Action Plans for Jobs is to deepen collaboration at regional level  to boost job creation.</p><p>The Regional Action Plans will cover the three-year period 2015-2017 to allow for the process to take hold and develop, and to capture a more medium-term ambition for the regions.  However, the Regional Action Plans need to be flexible and dynamic to allow additional actions and ideas to be added as they emerge over the period of the Plan.  Additional actions will arise, for example, from the competitive funding calls announced by Enterprise Ireland.  </p><p>The success of the regional Action Plans will lie in the delivery of the actions on schedule.  At national level, the Action Plan for Jobs has achieved the delivery of over 90% of actions since the process commenced in 2012.  The process is underpinned by robust reporting arrangements, with the publication by the Government of Quarterly reports, setting out the progress on each of the actions due for delivery.  It is intended to replicate the monitoring model in respect of the regional Action Plans for Jobs, with some modifications and simplifications.  For example, given the longer timeframe of the regional Plans, actions will be monitored on a 6 monthly basis (rather than Quarterly), with twice yearly updates to be published in each region.</p></reply>

Inevitably t<font color="#212100">he financial crisis and economic collapse experienced by Ireland after 2008 led many companies to adapt their innovation strategies with a consequent decline in patent filings.  </font>The revision of the patent royalty tax exemption in 2006 and its ultimate abolition in 2011 may also have impacted the level of patent applications.However, 2015 has seen a significant increase with 367 national applications received up to the end of September &ndash; an increase of almost 50% over the same period in 2014.  Whilst this has to be seen in the context of a lower baseline figure in 2014, it appears to signal an upturn in activity by Irish-based applicants in particular, as they typically account for over 70% of national patent filings.  </p><p>It is important however to note that the presence in Ireland of high-tech multinational companies availing of the supportive environment for innovation does not necessarily result in high levels of national patent filings.  Irish-based foreign-owned companies who develop Intellectual Property (IP) in Ireland often have a policy of filing patent applications through their parent company headquartered abroad. In such cases, even though the R&amp;amp;D which has given rise to the IP may have been carried out in Ireland, any resulting applications might not necessarily be recorded as filings by Irish-resident firms. In this respect, over the same period from 2008 to 2014, the number of patents granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) and which take effect in Ireland increased by 57% from 36,825 to 57,749. Patent filings at the EPO by Irish resident firms remained relatively stable during the same period with 712 in 2008 and 709 in 2014.  </p><p>The measures announced by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2016 relating to the Knowledge Development Box for qualifying intellectual property assets should act as a further R&amp;amp;D stimulus for the Irish enterprise base potentially leading to an increase in the volume of patent applications filed in Ireland.</p></reply>

A second tariff offer was exchanged and both sides have now arrived at a level of proposal in terms of tariff line coverage which will assist and benefit further negotiations.  There was also discussion in relation to public procurement and it is envisaged that there will be an exchange of market access proposals on public procurement by February 2016.   </p>  <p>  The negotiations also provided an opportunity to clarify some of the main principles of regulatory cooperation.  These included the fact that any cooperation is possible only if the level of protection for consumers stays the same or improves and any form of regulatory cooperation will not change or affect the EU regulatory and democratic process.  </p>  <p>  In line with the new EU Trade Strategy, the EU also tabled its proposal for sustainable development, including on labour and the environment and also discussed rules for trade facilitation, competition, energy and raw materials and others.  Negotiators on both sides remain positive and expect further substantial progress by early next year. </p>  <p>  According to assessments made by the EU Commission, a comprehensive EU-US trade agreement could over time boost EU GDP by 0.5% bringing significant economic gains as a whole for the EU.  This converts into 400,000 jobs across the EU.  An independent study commissioned by my Department, carried out by Copenhagen Economics, estimates that these benefits in Ireland will be proportionally greater than in the EU as a whole. It suggests a boost to GDP of 1.1%, growth in Irish exports of almost 4%, increases in investment of 1.5%, and an increase in real wages of 1.5%.  It estimates somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 additional export related jobs. </p>  <p>  It also suggests that Irish SMEs will be particular beneficiaries.  Many of these are part of European supply chains where their exports to the UK, Germany or elsewhere to the EU, feed into Europe&rsquo;s exports to the U.S.  In these negotiations, Ireland will seek to have opportunities created in the agreement where we have clear strengths, and we will seek to defend our interests where we have sensitivities.</p>  <p>  As an economy that lives and grows by the freedom to trade, we have first-hand experience of how trade liberalisation has continually shaped and reshaped our economy.  We have used openness to trade in the past, and will continue to use it, as an instrument for structural reform, modernisation and development, creating new opportunities for innovation and stronger productivity growth with higher skilled jobs throughout the economy.</p>  <p>At the Council of Trade Ministers scheduled to meet on 27 November in Brussels, I will have the opportunity to discuss progress on these negotiations with Commissioner Malmstr&ouml;m and with EU Council colleagues. </p></reply>

This situation arises as a result of a review by the parent company of its global manufacturing operations, in the context of increased competitive pressures.    IDA has worked with the company intensively in an effort to minimise the impact of this process for the Irish operations. I myself have spoken directly to senior executives of the company both globally and in Ireland and urged them to reconsider their decision. However the competitive pressures facing the company appear to be very significant. IDA Ireland will continue to engage with the company in an effort to explore all possible routes that could mitigate the impact of this process and, in the event of a decision being made to cease operations, I have asked that agency to intensify its efforts to pursue a replacement project.  In addition, supports from the relevant State bodies to the affected employees will be put in place as and when required.</p>  <p>  I have also urged the company to provide as generous as possible a package for departing workers. </p>  <p>  You will appreciate that while I and my Agencies seek to mitigate any potential loss of jobs, the final decision rests with the company, which will come to a conclusion based on the wider interest of their business.</p>  <p>  Job creation in the Mid-East Region of which County Meath is a part, has improved considerably and the most recent data shows that at the end of Quarter 2 of this year the unemployment rate in that region stood at 8.7%, compared to 14.5% just two years previously. While this is still too high, it represents a very significant achievement. </p></reply>

I have however received correspondence raising some concerns about this section of the 2014 Act.  Every company in Ireland, with the exception of investment companies, is obliged to file an annual return with the Registrar of Companies at least once every calendar year.  The annual return is a document setting out certain prescribed company information which is required to be delivered by an Irish company to the Companies Registration Office.  The rationale for the statutory provisions requiring certain information to be disclosed is for the purposes of protecting shareholders, creditors and the public.  </p>  <p>  To a large extent, the requirements in Part 6 of the Companies Act 2014 are unchanged from the previous Companies Acts.  However certain provisions have been redrafted in order to make them easier to understand and thus improve compliance.

All of the Action Plans to date have provided a sharp focus on specific aspects of the competitiveness agenda, particularly in the area of costs, improving Ireland&rsquo;s global competitiveness ranking and making it easier to start, run and scale a business. We have improved the incentives for investment and work, improved access to finance for business, streamlined regulatory processes and reduced the administrative burdens on business. Our domestic cost base has improved making enterprises trading from Ireland more competitive on international markets. The exporting sectors of the economy, particularly companies supported by EI and IDA are creating jobs at record levels and Ireland&rsquo;s traditional assets (such as our competitive taxation regime, highly skilled and innovative workforce, and pro-enterprise regulatory environment) have been strengthened. As a result of our concerted efforts to improve competitiveness, Ireland&rsquo;s relative international competitiveness as measured by a range of international indices has improved. Ireland moved from 24th to 16th in the IMD&rsquo;s World Competitiveness Yearbook, from 29th to 24th in the WEF Global Competitiveness Report and 17th out of 189 countries, up two places on last year as assessed by the World Bank. The Bank&rsquo;s latest report published last week shows Ireland is now ranked 4th in the euro area in terms of ease of doing business and has moved from 19th n 2014 to a rank of 17th among all countries benchmarked. </p>  <p>  This is a positive result for Ireland. It is evidence that the implementation of high-level reforms and more other efficiencies and improvements are reflected in the business and regulatory environment. However, there is no room for complacency. The report shows international competition is intense and incessant.   There is increased competition this year, with most EU Member States making up ground and improving their position relative to Ireland's. While we have made improvements in a number of areas, for example, reducing the costs of starting a business - in relative terms other countries have improved more. The report highlights that maintaining our strong international competitiveness performance requires constant progress. The Action Plan for Jobs is the key mechanism to drive further reforms which will continue to improve the Ease of Doing Business for Irish SMEs.</p>  <p>  We will maintain an unrelenting focus on improving our competitiveness performance and as part of the preparation of the 2016 Action Plan for Jobs. The immediate challenge is to sustain the recovery underway by remaining competitive. There is a continuing and urgent necessity to enhance the regulatory environment for start-ups, and for SMEs to enable them to trade successfully in increasingly competitive global markets. I will shortly receive the advice of the National Competitiveness Council on the priority areas for the coming period. Further actions and reforms driven by the 2016 Action Plan for Jobs will enable us to further narrow the gap with the world&rsquo;s most competitive countries and achieve our objective of sustainable full employment.</p></reply>

My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, has been working closely with Teagasc to address staffing issues in the organisation. Teagasc have been authorised to fill a number of mission critical posts in the organisation. It was also approved to appoint 40 new temporary teachers to meet the demand from young farmers for Green Cert courses. In addition, exceptional arrangements have been agreed to permit Teagasc to recruit contract staff where they can secure external funding to cover the costs. This has facilitated the recruitment of some 180 contractors working in research and knowledge transfer. </p>  <p>  New arrangements for managing staff numbers have recently been finalised to provide public bodies under the aegis of DAFM, including Teagasc, with greater discretion over staff appointments but strictly within an overall pay framework. It permits those bodies to fill vacancies through recruitment and/or promotion in specified, designated grades, subject to compliance with multi-annual pay ceilings. The multi-annual pay ceilings are binding and it will fall on each body to deliver services within the agreed allocations. This includes responding to emerging expenditure pressures without recourse to additional Exchequer allocations and will involve commitment to ongoing reform and efficiency measures and reprioritisation of expenditure as appropriate.   </p></reply>

My Department has been very supportive of the sector and that has been reflected in increased financial support for 2016 as announced in the context of the recent Budget. My Department is providing an additional &euro;6m in 2016 to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund, bringing it to &euro;74m, of which 80 per cent is dedicated to thoroughbred horses and an extra &euro;50,000 to Horse Sport Ireland totalling &euro;1.87m for sport horses.</p>  <p>  The Irish bloodstock industry is of enormous economic benefit to this country. It has been estimated, that the industry provides in excess of 14,000 jobs, approximately &euro;1.1bn in economic output and is responsible for exports worth in excess of &euro;200m. Regarding the Irish Sport Horse industry its contribution to the Irish economy is in excess of &euro;700 million per annum and it accounts for some 12,500 jobs.   </p>  <p>  Harness racing is a significant equestrian sport in a number of countries, notably France, Sweden, Italy and North America. However, harness racing has been a minority-interest sport in this country. </p>  <p>  I believe the Irish Harness Racing Association is actively seeking to expand the sport in Ireland and believes it has significant potential for development to bring it more into line with the profile it enjoys elsewhere. </p>  <p>  Following on from the establishment of a limited company in May 2015, the Irish Harness Racing Association has applied for Ireland to become a full member of the European Union Trotteurs (UET), which is the umbrella organisation for national harness racing organisations in 22 European countries. This would open the way for Irish competitors to compete in Europe.   </p>  <p>  Also in line with its ambition to elevate the sport to a more professional and sophisticated plane in this country, the Irish Harness Racing Association has been considering the feasibility of running fixtures at venues of a higher quality than those to which it has heretofore been confined. In this regard the Irish Harness Racing Association requested permission from Horse Racing Ireland to stage a number of harness racing fixtures at Dundalk racecourse. My Department wrote to Horse Racing Ireland requesting them to facilitate the specific request. The Board of HRI decided to allow a trial event under strict supervision. My Department awaits the report from the Turf Club in this regard. </p></reply>

The question raised by the Deputy is an operational matter for the ICC. Nonetheless my Department has made enquiries and the ICC has indicated that the issue, muzzling of greyhounds at open coursing events, was discussed at an ICC AGM held in August 2015. The agenda and rule amendments or new rules had been circulated to each club representatives prior to the AGM. </p>  <p>  The rule amendment regarding this issue was put to the floor at the AGM for comment for or against and the vote was taken. A rule amendment passing the muzzling of greyhounds at open coursing events was passed by the members. It is not the practice of the ICC to publish rule amendments and invite submissions. </p>  <p>  This rule was subsequently ratified by Bord na gCon as is the procedure as per the Greyhound Industry Act, 1958.   </p></reply>

The aim of this initiative was to create 250 cross sectoral jobs in the Killybegs area by 2014. Seafood processing was just one of the areas identified as having the potential to create additional employment.  To drive forward the initiative, I established a High Level Group on Job Creation in the Killybegs Region and requested that the Group identify the potential actions required to deliver job creation in the following five key areas, that is; promoting seafood value added activity; enhancing ancillary services; developing offshore supports; promoting tourism and marine leisure; and promoting the green economy and renewable energy. </p><p>The High Level Group comprised representatives of the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation (who chaired the Group), Bord Iascaigh Mhara, Donegal County Council, Letterkenny Institute of Technology, Enterprise Ireland, local industry and from my Department. BIM provided secretariat services to assist the chair.</p><p>The High Level Group finished its work in 2011 and its Report is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>Since 2012, a local implementation group reporting to Donegal County Council has taken on responsibility for driving forward the initiative. The Council may be able to assist the Deputy with the information he is seeking. </p><p>I am informed by Bord Iascaigh Mhara that by the end of 2014, 89 jobs had been created in seafood processing companies in the Killybegs area. I do not have information available to me on jobs created in areas outside of my area of responsibility.</p><p>It is clear that the future is very promising for the seafood industry generally and Killybegs is central to that growth story. While the Killybegs Jobs Initiative was important in terms of fostering a diversified blue economy in Killybegs, seafood will continue to be the driver of economic growth for Killybegs in the years to come.</p><p>The seafood sector continues to be a high-growth area of the economy and indeed of our food industry. Exports have grown 70% since 2009 and the sector is now worth &euro;850 million in sales. Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Bord Bia are working with seafood companies in Killybegs and elsewhere around our coast to grow the sector to &euro;1 billion in the next few years. This will be driven by our seafood processing sector adding value to commodity products, innovating and developing new consumer seafood products, with the assistance of BIM&rsquo;s Seafood Development Centres in Clonakilty and Killybegs, and winning new markets for Ireland&rsquo;s top quality seafood. </p><p>Earlier this year, I announced a new &euro;241 million Seafood Development Operational Programme under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This new Programme will double the level of supports for the sustainable development of the seafood over the coming years. I expect that the new Programme will be adopted by the European Commission in November. My Department is working with Bord Iascaigh Mhara to have a range of supports ready to launch from the start of 2016 to support and promote the sustainable growth of the processing, aquaculture and fishing sectors through that Programme.</p></reply>

Following an intensive consultation process, my Department introduced a new policy and procedures in this area on 1 May, 2015. The purpose of the new policy is, while allowing properly regulated economic activity to proceed, to mitigate the potential risk to both animal and public health, particularly from Category 2 ABP meat which is derived from fallen animals.  The key elements of this policy are that:</p><p>i. Collection and sale of Category 2 and 3 ABP is restricted to Collection Centres, approved and supervised by the Department; </p><p>ii. Purchase and use of Category 2 and 3 ABP for greyhounds is restricted to Licensed Meat Feeders, authorised by the Department following a recommendation by either one of the greyhound bodies - Bord na gCon and/or the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) - on foot of the issue of a Recognised Kennel Authorisation (RKA).</p><p>Operators of authorised Collection Centres supplying relevant material other than fish offal to final users must ensure that the material being supplied is labelled appropriately and supplied only to authorised end-users; and the operator must verify authorisations in each instance. Collection Centres are fixed premises, <b>facilitating effective supervision of controls, including the effective and reliable identification and denaturation of ABP</b>by staining or other means. Such premises can, for example, be attached to a knackery (Category 2) or a slaughterhouse (Category 3), or can be an independent building. The sale of ABP meat from mobile units such as vans/trucks /lorries at any unauthorised venue is prohibited. The Department is reviewing the possibility of permitting direct delivery, by approved Collection Centres to Licensed Meat Feeders, on a pre-order basis and subject to compliance with strict conditions including use of refrigerated transport. </p></reply>

The relevant EU legislative provisions providing for this direct aid payment came into force in the last fortnight and provide that Member States have the flexibility to distribute this aid through the most effective channels at their disposal. It is a clear requirement of the provisions regarding this aid that the funds need to be distributed on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria and also needs to ensure that farmers in the relevant sectors are the ultimate beneficiaries of the targeted aid.</p>  <p>  I have discussed these matters with representatives of the dairy sector, most recently at the dairy forum on 29 September. I took the opportunity to update stakeholders regarding progress to date and to seek their opinions regarding how best to distribute this aid. Any decision on distribution obviously had to await the adoption at EU level of the relevant legislative provisions. In addition officials in my Department have also had discussions with representatives of the Irish pig sector. I am currently considering various options and intend to announce final decisions regarding the aid levels and mechanisms in the very near future.</p>  <p>  In respect of the other areas mentioned by the Deputy, i   n early September I presented a paper offering possible solutions to both the EU Commissioner and my EU ministerial colleagues, which included utilising the provisions of Article 219 of the CMO Regulation to temporarily increase the threshold prices, with particular reference to skimmed milk powder. I also made calls for numerous other measures in the areas of Aids to Private Storage for cheese, which was introduced by the Commission in September 2014 but discontinued shortly after. In addition I called for the existing aid rates in the PSA schemes for butter and SMP to be reviewed immediately.</p>  <p>  I am pleased to note that the final decision at Council took significant account of Ireland&rsquo;s requests. The improved PSA scheme for SMP, which will include longer periods for storage as well as the improved aid rates, the re-introduction of PSA for cheese, the provision of increased funding for promotion and the provision of the aforementioned almost &euro;14m in targeted direct aid for farmers can undoubtedly go some way towards alleviating the worst effects of the current market downturn on primary producers. The PSA schemes are now open to producers and I expect that the Irish dairy sector will be availing of these.</p>  <p>  In addition, the provision allowing 70% advance in the single farm payment and I am pleased to note that the vast bulk of these payments have been paid.</p></reply>

The US is one of our leading trading partners, and we have a large and growing agri-food trade surplus with them (exports of &euro;570m last year, compared to imports of &euro;268m). The drinks industry currently accounts for over 60% of the value of exports.  We have significant offensive interests in the TTIP negotiations. For example, we see worthwhile opportunities in the US for cheese, powdered milks and sports products, and further opportunities for branded packaged butter, if we can remove some regulatory barriers. Prepared consumer foods and fish could also benefit from trade liberalisation.</p>  <p>  Beef is a unique sector in that we have both offensive and defensive interests. In the long term, any significant increase in beef imports to the EU could have adverse effects on the Irish industry. That was confirmed by a number of recent studies and is an issue we have raised strongly with the European Commission. Admittedly, adverse effects look much less likely at present, as US prices are currently at historic highs. But it does mean that we have legitimate concerns about the size, composition and administration of any quota offered to the US.</p>  <p>  Of course, we should also seek a significant EU quota for beef to the US as part of any TTIP agreement. Following the re-opening of the market, Irish beef exports now fall under a 65,000 tonne quota for &lsquo;other countries&rsquo; on a first come, first served basis. This is mainly filled by Latin American countries. When we get access for manufacturing beef - which I hope will be soon - we would stand to benefit greatly from a specific EU import quota in the US and this can only be achieved through TTIP.</p>  <p>  A number of key issues in these negotiations arise in relation to hormone treated beef, food standards, GMOs and Geographical indicators. All of these arose in the Canadian negotiations and were resolved and I believe they can also be resolved in TTIP.</p>  <p>  It is important to ensure that the principle of equivalence will continue to apply so that even where food production processes in the EU and US are not identical they will provide equivalent guarantees regarding the standards of production. This principle is already enshrined under the World Trade Organisation Agreement and is also recognised by both sides in the EU US negotiations as the basis for the TTIP agreement. Equally it is important that both the EU and United States retain the policy space to restrict certain practices and processes on social and ethical grounds and this is also recognised, in principle, by both sides.</p>  <p>  This is particularly relevant in relation to the use of hormones in meat production.  The EU Commission has made it clear that it will not allow the importation of hormone treated meat into the EU and this is well understood by the US side. In these circumstances, we do not anticipate that the TTIP agreement will have any impact on food standards within the state.</p></reply>

My Department has been engaged in intensive follow-up with the European Commission, with the US Embassy in London, with EU Member State colleagues and with the industry in an effort to limit the impact of the measure on the industry. We have in particular been assisting the Commission in its consultations with the United States, and in this regard have focused on the lack of meaningful consultation in advance of the announcement, the inconsistency of the approach this year compared to previous years, and the fact that, while imports of butter into the US have increased over recent years, there is no evidence of any impairment of the US butter market. In addition to asking the Commission to use all of its efforts to persuade the US to withdraw the SSG, we have asked it to seek a commitment from the US concerning non-activation in future years. We have also supported the Commission&rsquo;s efforts in clarifying the status of product in transit so as to minimise the practical impact of the measure on exporting companies.</p></reply>

A reply issued on 30 October . On the overall issue I am very much aware of the problems surrounding the herring fishery off Donegal. The unfortunate facts are that the total allowable catch (TAC) for herring in the waters off Donegal (part of Area VIa South), as advised by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) for 2015, is zero. Consequently, Ireland therefore has no fishing opportunities for herring in the area for 2015. This applies to all vessels and all fishing methods.  At last December&rsquo;s Fisheries Council I secured a commitment from the Commission to urgently review this situation on foot of new scientific advice that was expected in April of this year. A new benchmarking exercise was undertaken by ICES but unfortunately the outcome was to confirm their advice that there should be a zero TAC for 2015. In light of this review the Commission confirmed that it could not support any in year amendment of the herring quota.</p>  <p>  With regard to the future of this stock, ICES strongly recommend, and I fully support, a re-building plan for the stock.  This is also the view of the Pelagic Advisory Council, in which Irish industry representatives are very active, and I will be supporting them in their endeavours on this matter. Any rebuilding plan recommended to the Commission would need to be evaluated and approved by ICES and it may not be possible to have this for a number of months given the complexities involved. The ICES advice, in the absence of a rebuilding plan for 2016 is again for a zero TAC. Consequently, the focus now must be on developing that rebuilding plan so that a viable and sustainable fishery can be re-established as quickly as possible.  In the context of the 2016 TAC and quota negotiations in December, I will be working closely with industry to examine all possible options, taking account of the current ICES advice, including a case for a small TAC that would support scientific work on the stock.</p></reply>

The amount of loans outstanding has reduced from &euro;3,953 million in September 2012 to &euro;3,354 million at the end of June 2015.</p><p>Teagasc and Bank of Ireland launched a report earlier this year, &ldquo;A Review of the Financial Status of Irish Farms and Future Investment Requirements&rdquo;, which indicated that, relative to the EU average, Irish farms have low debt and high asset values. The average level of debt on all farms (farms with and without debt) in 2013 was &euro;24,000. Dairy farms had the highest level of debt at an average of approximately &euro;62,000 for all dairy farms. However, 34% of dairy farms have no debt at all &ndash; the average debt on the 66% of dairy farms that have loans outstanding is &euro;94,000.</p><p>As part of the regular contact that I maintain with them, I recently met with the CEOs of the three main banks to discuss issues relating to the sector. All consider the sector to be vitally important to them and have specialised offerings to farmers, especially young farmers. I have stressed the need for them to be flexible in the context of increased income volatility and they all informed me that they are aware of the challenges facing farmers in this regard.</p><p>As well as the offerings from the main banks, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) was established by the Government to deliver lower cost, long-term, innovative and accessible funding to Irish SMEs, by offering tailored flex ible products, through its &lsquo;on-lending partners&rsquo; (currently AIB &amp;amp; Bank of Ireland). Their products include &lsquo;Agriculture Investment Loans&rsquo; , available for investment by agricultural SMEs, including farmers, involved in primary agricultural production, the processing of agricultural products or the marketing of agricultural products. Of the almost &euro;45 million of SBCI loans approved and drawn down since March, a third has been accessed by the agricultural sector.</p></reply>

It is known that in some cases the invoices submitted were for amounts different to those actually paid by the participants.  Funding provided under the scheme comes partly from the EU and partly from the National Exchequer. There is a requirement and obligation to ensure that the expenditure claimed by scheme participants reflects the reality of what took place. For that reason my Department wrote to participants requesting alternative proof that the amounts claimed were in fact the amounts paid.</p>  <p>  The person named above was written to on 11 June 2015 regarding the non-productive capital investment claim that they had submitted. This letter requested the submission of alternative verifiable proof to support one of the invoices that was included in the claim. A reply to this letter was received on 19 June last.</p>  <p>  My Department officials carefully examined the application in light of this reply; this examination indicated that the amount claimed was different to the verified costs. A letter informing the applicant of this determination, and of the proposed penalty, was issued on 14 October. This letter also offered the applicant an opportunity to submit additional information if he wished and to have the proposed determination reviewed within the Department.</p></reply>

Its objective was to enable qualifying applicants, who had experienced the accidental loss of a vessel under certain specified circumstances and who were otherwise unable to do so for financial or related reasons, to continue a family tradition of sea-fishing. The objective of the scheme was to assist families in introducing a replacement for a lost vessel which would be owned and skippered by the applicant or by an immediate relation of the applicant. Essentially, the scheme provided replacement capacity (not direct financial compensation) which the applicant would otherwise have had to purchase on the tonnage market, for the purpose of introducing a replacement vessel for a fishing boat lost at sea between 1980 and the establishment of the fishing boat register in 1990.  Under the terms of the scheme, replacement capacity in the form of gross tonnage and kilowatt engine power was provided free of charge to qualifying applicants equivalent to the capacity of the lost vessel and the capacity awarded to the successful applicants could not be traded, sold on or otherwise disposed of for financial gain. The terms of the scheme were introduced as a balance taking into account that capacity was granted free of charge at a time when other entrants into the fleet were required to purchase replacement capacity at a high cost. I have no plans to consider a change to this licensing policy which would involve the privatisation of such capacity. </p></reply>

A robust and reliable replacement index , built specifically for Irish animals and production systems , on which farmers can make informed breeding decisions, is an essential element of the drive to meet these goals.  It is imperative that the index uses the most accurate information available to us and that is why genotyping constitutes such a major part of the BDGP. The genotyping requirement within the BDGP reflects the need to genotype a large percentage of female calves at birth within scheme herds and to genotype female animals introduced from non-scheme herds so that a sufficient amount of 4 and 5 star animals can be identified. Genotyping substantially improves the reliability of the breeding indexes and ensures the identification of sufficient numbers of 4 &amp;amp; 5 star female animals required by BDGP herds.</p>  <p>  The refinement of the index unavoidably leads to minor fluctuations in some individual animals&rsquo; ratings due to the addition of new and more accurate information. This will further improve the reliability of that animal&rsquo;s rating and similarly, the collection of additional information across the entire herd, including the genomic data, will result in more accurate &euro;uro-Star evaluations. Some animals will end up moving to lower star ratings while others will increase their rating reciprocally, but with these changes the index becomes more accurate and a more useful tool for suckler farmers across the country. The cattle breeding industry in Ireland is very accustomed to genetic evaluations moving over time, as more data accumulates.</p>  <p>As the Deputy will be aware, the female replacement requirements for a BDGP participant are focussed on ensuring that a percentage of their heifers/eligible suckler cows (rounded to the nearest animal), in the years 2018 and 2020 are genotyped animals that are:</p>  <p>(i) 4 or 5 stars on the replacement index</p>  <p>(ii)at least 16 months old and;</p>  <p>(iii) born in 2013 or later,</p>  <p>  I have subsequently clarified on point (iii) above that a female animal born before 2013 will be considered eligible if it was present in the herd before 5th June 2015 and also meets the requirements of parts (i) and (ii). In addition, BDGP also allows animals to be considered eligible even if their rating is subsequently downgraded from 4 and 5 stars, provided that the animal is genotyped 4 or 5 star at the time of purchase. The focus on the BDGP has turned towards engagement with individual scheme participants. My priority now is to work closely with the ICBF and BDGP farmers to ensure that implementation of the Programme continues to deliver for Irish suckler farmers.</p></reply>

However the tuberculin used for the test is now much improved since &lsquo;old tuberculin&rsquo; was replaced by the PPD tuberculin (Purified, Protein Derivative) which was introduced in the 1970s. Another aspect of the testing regime that has contributed to the improvements in the accuracy of the skin test is the actual performance of the test and the site of injection on the neck. With regard to the performance of the test, my Department has put in place a comprehensive quality control system aimed at ensuring that the test is performed correctly by the testing veterinarian.  The introduction of the AHCS system has also facilitated more effective monitoring of the disease.  In addition, there has been a significant improvement in the on-farm facilities over the years with the result that, in general, there is now a good testing environment on most farms that allows the test to be conducted with care and this greatly enhances the accuracy of the test. The issue of the most appropriate site has been repeatedly examined and the most recent studies have confirmed previous findings i.e. that the centre of the neck is the optimal site for an accurate test.</p>  <p>  The introduction of the Interferon-gamma blood test for use in recent years in TB infected herds to complement the TB Skin test also ensures that the maximum numbers of infected animals are removed from herds. This helps to reduce TB spread and return the herd to TB-free status as soon as possible. In several studies in TB infected herds in Ireland and Northern Ireland, this test has been shown to find positive animals that would fail to be detected on the initial skin test. These animals are at much higher likelihood of becoming a skin test reactor or a TB confirmed case at slaughter in the future than animals that remain IFN-gamma negative.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, while the skin test has remained relatively unchanged over the years, the accuracy of the test has been enhanced by several factors such as the introduction of the new PPD tuberculin, the quality control system implemented by my Department and the improvement in on-farm facilities. Various attempts to develop more accurate tests for bovine TB (M Bovis) have been unsuccessful with the result that the skin test remains the most accurate test currently available.</p></reply>

It is a clear requirement of the provisions regarding this aid that the funds need to be distributed on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory criteria and also needs to ensure that farmers in the relevant sectors are the ultimate beneficiaries of the targeted aid.  I have discussed these matters with representatives of the dairy sector, most recently at the dairy forum on 29 September. I took the opportunity to update stakeholders regarding progress to date and to seek their opinions regarding how best to distribute this aid. Any decision on distribution obviously had to await the adoption at EU level of the relevant legislative provisions.

This scheme replaces the former Disadvantaged Areas Scheme and the Less Favoured Areas (LFA) Scheme. The ANC Scheme is worth &euro;195 million annually to some 100,000 farmers and in excess of &euro;1.3 billion over the life time of the Programme. The annual budget of &euro;195 million is in line with previous years funding and is focused on those farmers who are most actively pursuing a farming activity and contributing to the economic life of the rural areas where they farm.  The total amount paid to applicants under the LFA Scheme in 2007 was &euro;254,750,496. Since that time a number of changes to the scheme have been put in place. While it is difficult to be absolutely precise in this matter given the changes since 2007, it would be expected that, if payment levels were set again at 2007 levels, the annual value of the scheme in 2015 would be similar to the total amount paid in 2007.</p>  <p>  Many changes occurred over the lifetime of the previous RDP which gave rise to the need to amend expenditure under certain schemes . However, in making changes to the LFA scheme, every effort was made to maintain the level of aid to those farmers who were actively pursuing a farming activity and were contributing to the economic life of the rural areas where they farm.</p>  <p>  The rates of aid payable to farmers whose holdings are situated in these areas are in line with the difficulties that they have had to overcome in farming in the areas in question and were not subject to any reduction during the years cuts were required. The reductions in funding in previous years were achieved by reducing the maximum area payable from 45 to 34 hectares and some other technical changes. Therefore, the vast majority of farmers, who are actively farming and are participants in the Scheme, were not impacted in any way by the budgetary cuts.</p></reply>

The only State body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non-military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.</p><p>There have been 5 appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011. Commandant Adam Lagun was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011. This position became vacant in October 2014 due to Commandant Lagun being deployed overseas. On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff the temporary appointment of Commandant Syed Shah from 16 October 2014 to 31 May 2015 to the Board was made to cover the Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s absence. Commandant Lagun resumed as Ordinary member of the Board in June 2015. The position became vacant again in September 2015 with the deployment overseas of Commandant Lagun. On the recommendation of the Chief of Staff Commandant Zdenek Osecky was appointed temporarily from 10 September 2015 to 30 June 2016 to cover this temporary vacant position.</p><p>As the Army Pensions Act 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, the positions outlined above were not publicly advertised on either occasion. Details of these appointments to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.</p><p>A civilian doctor, Dr. Loretta Nolan, was appointed as ordinary member of the Army Pensions Board in November 2013. The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website. A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process.</p><p>There are currently no vacancies on the Army Pensions Board.</p><p>The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished. Against this backdrop, in July 2011 the then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure. In this context none of the positions were advertised. Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence. The membership of the interim Board appointed in July 2011 is set out in the following table:<table><tr><th>Name </th><th>Nominating Bodies </th></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Chairperson </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Brian Spain <br /><br />Director, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Civil Defence Board Members </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Cathal Duffy <br /><br />Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Clare Tiernan <br /><br />Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Robert Mooney <br /><br />Principal, Department of Defence </td><td>Nominated by Minister for Defence </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Bill Smith <br /><br />Director General, Civil Defence Board </td><td>Appointed as Director General, Civil Defence Board </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Ned Gleeson <br /><br />County Manager, Limerick City Council </td><td>Nominated by City &amp;amp; County Managers Association </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Keith Leonard <br /><br />Assistant Fire Advisor </td><td>Nominated by the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government </td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Barbara Rafferty </td><td>Nominated by Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland </td></tr><tr><td>Mr. Becci Cantrell </td><td>Nominated by the Environmental Protection Agency </td></tr><tr><td>Ms. Veronica Forde <br /><br />Assistant Civil Defence Officer </td><td>Nominated by the Civil Defence Officers Association </td></tr><tr><td>Lt.

In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The formal wind up of the Company, including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office, was completed in early 2013.</p></reply>

A major recruitment campaign last year did not achieve the desired effect with the process yielding only 152 inductees. Following a review of last year&rsquo;s campaign a number of changes were introduced. The most recent returns indicate that there have been 314 inductees to date in 2015 and this is a welcome improvement on last year&rsquo;s figure.  The military authorities estimate that there will also be a further 100 inductees by year end. The Defence Forces will continue to strive to improve the level of RDF recruitment in 2016.</p>  <p>  While recruitment is an immediate challenge, the retention of members is also a key requirement in order to meet strength targets. The implementation of measures set out in the White Paper will provide opportunities for certain members of the Reserve to undertake duties. I believe that this will be a key motivating factor in encouraging more people to join the Reserve as well as making it more attractive for current members to stay. I am confident that the measures for the Reserve outlined in the White Paper will, in due course, lead to a more vibrant RDF which will deliver enhanced military capabilities for the benefit of the State.</p></reply>

Private Doherty was later found dead from gunshot wounds and Private Joyce was missing. The attackers are unknown.

To date, no information has been elicited to lead to the recovery of Private Joyce&rsquo;s remains.</p>  <p>  In late June 2015, Mr. Roderick Murphy presented his report to me.

In addition, I advised the House that &ldquo;The LE Samuel Beckett will continue humanitarian search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean in close co-ordination with the Italian authorities. Following completion of her mission in early December, the operation will be reviewed in detail.&rdquo; As such, detailed consideration of the legal provisions of potential Defence Forces participation in the EU mission has not arisen to date.</p>  <p>  As part of that review, the question of any further deployment and the nature and operational context of any such deployment will be examined, including whether Ireland should participate in the CSDP mission. It is at that stage that the legal issues, including the question of whether and what UN Security Council Resolution might be required in terms of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the CSDP operation, having regard to the requirements of the provisions of the Defence Acts regarding overseas deployment of Defence Forces personnel, fall to be considered.</p>  <p>  It is our understanding that various aspects of the proposed mission, in particular Phase 2 part (ii) and phase 3, will, of their nature, require a UN Security Council Resolution and/or a request from the host State, if the mission is to proceed to these stages in accordance with international law. However, the question of Ireland&rsquo;s participation will still need to be considered in the context of any then applicable UN Security Council Resolutions, international law, the situation in Libya and the provisions of the Defence Acts and that will be a matter for the Attorney General to advise on at the appropriate juncture.</p></reply>

People with disabilities are only half as likely to be in employment as others of working age. The reasons for this are complex, and include level of education and skills, fears around loss of benefits, employer know-how, low expectations, and limited re-entry to work following onset of a disability, as well as a higher incidence of ill-health.</p><p>The Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities is a cross-government approach that brings together actions by different Departments and State agencies in a concerted effort to address the barriers and challenges that impact on employment of people with disabilities. In tandem with that, it seeks to ensure there will be joined-up services and supports at local level to support individuals on their journey into and in employment.</p><p>The Strategy's six strategic priorities are:</p><p>- Build skills, capacity and independence</p><p>- Provide bridges and supports into work</p><p>- Make work pay</p><p>- Promote job retention and re-entry to work</p><p>- Provide coordinated and seamless support</p><p>- Engage employers.</p><p>Implementing the Strategy will require continuing interdepartmental co-operation and a joined-up approach to supports and services for jobseekers and workers with disabilities.

The Commission proposed the establishment of an EU-wide resettlement scheme to offer 20,000 resettlement places by the end of 2016. Ireland has committed to accepting 520 persons for resettlement during the 2015/2016 period under this initiative.  Ireland is one of 27 states worldwide that participate in a refugee resettlement programme led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  To be eligible for resettlement under this programme, a person must be a refugee, i.e. they must have left their country of origin and sought protection in another country.  For example, refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict currently resident in Lebanon and Jordan would be eligible for resettlement whereas a person still resident in Syria would not.</p>  <p>  The focus of the Irish resettlement programme in recent years has been on the resettlement of refugees displaced by the Syrian conflict.  UNHCR, in cooperation with NGOs at a local level, identify the most vulnerable persons for resettlement purposes, regardless of their race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.  UNHCR then proposes the cases to Ireland for consideration.  Self referrals or referrals by other organisations or individuals do not form part of this programme.</p>  <p>  The Resettlement team of the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration of my staff went to Lebanon on two occasions in 2015 and to Jordan on one occasion in 2014 to interview refugees for resettlement purposes.  397 persons, including Syrians and Iraqis of both Christian and Muslim faiths were selected for resettlement during those selection missions.</p></reply>

In relation to legislation, the Deputy will be aware that Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, 2015 is currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas and that it provides new tougher measures to target repeat burglary offenders. In addition, the Government is making significantly enhanced resources available to the Garda Commissioner, including the very significant investments in manpower, vehicles and surveillance resources which were announced on Budget Day and in the Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.</p>  <p>  Yesterday I joined the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda&iacute; at Garda Headquarters for the launch by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of Operation Thor, a new multi-strand national anti-crime and anti-burglary operation.  Operation Thor has been in the planning for several months and is being launched both as a follow-on to recent announcements regarding investment in policing and to coincide with the advent of longer winter nights.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor will entail a broad range of activities to tackle burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders as well as working with communities to prevent crime. These include: additional high-visibility patrols in identified burglary hot-spots; increased used of checkpoints to tackle the criminal gangs using the national road network; the use of new high powered vehicles by the armed Regional Response Units; efforts to disrupt the stolen goods market; programmes to help reduce re-offending by prolific offenders; a high-profile national crime prevention awareness campaign to be launched later this month, and targeted crime prevention advice for local communities and enhanced supports for victims.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor is made possible by the increased investment in policing by this Government, including an allocation of &euro;5 million to specifically support this new Operation. This follows the investment of &euro;34 million in Garda vehicles since 2012, with 640 new vehicles becoming available this year, including high powered vehicles for armed Garda units. There is also important investment in airborne surveillance and the Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 provides for a very significant investment in new Garda technology and information systems as well as the ongoing delivery of new Garda vehicles, amounting to &euro;205 m over the life of the Plan. Operation Thor is further supported by the ending of the moratorium on Garda recruitment by this Government, with 550 new recruits having already been taken in and a further 600 to commence training next year.</p>  <p>  In addition to the extensive policing measures, there are several crime prevention initiatives which have been established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in partnership with the Irish Farmers Association, Muintir na Tire and other rural community organisations, including the well established Community Alert Programme, the ongoing work of the Metal Theft Forum, the Crimestoppers campaign highlighting the Theft of Livestock, the new Theftstop initiative in relation to farm equipment, and the highly successful Garda Text Alert Scheme. I am pleased to say that I have secured &euro;397,000 for the crime prevention initiatives supported directly by my Department in 2016, including Community Alert and Crimestoppers, and this represents a doubling of funding in this area.</p>  <p>  Taken together the measures which I have outlined mark a significant step-up in the overall response to burglaries and underlines the Government's determination to confront crime and protect communities in rural and urban areas.</p></reply>

This judgement in the UK Courts found that the policy of disclosure of <i>all</i>criminal convictions under the UK&rsquo;s equivalent legislation was contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention of Human rights. The UK Courts found that there must be some assessment of the relevance and proportionality of offences, in particular old, minor offences.</p><p>A review of the provisions of the Vetting Act has been completed and amendments to the Vetting Act and consequential amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill have been drafted.  I intend to bring the amendments to the Bill before the Oireachtas in the next month or so, with a view to then commencing the Act.</p><p>Pending the amendment of the Bill, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>This Administrative Filter already gives effect to the main provisions which I consider likely to be contained in the amended Act.</p><p>A copy of this Administrative Filter is attached.</p><p>Garda Vetting Procedures</p><p>Administrative Filter</p><p>In anticipation of the amendment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, an administrative filter in respect of Garda Vetting Unit Disclosures will operate in accordance with the following procedural guidelines.</p><p>A. Criminal Convictions to be disclosed in all cases:</p><blockquote>1)Offences Against the Person.<br /><br />2)Sexual Offences<br /><br />3)Convictions on indictment.</blockquote><p>B. District Court Convictions which will not be disclosed: </p><blockquote>1)<i>Motoring Offences</i>:District Court convictions for motoring offences will not be disclosed after 7 years even where more recent offences have been committed. This is because it is considered that old minor motoring offences would not be relevant due to the passage of time.2)<i>Minor Public Order Offences</i>:The following convictions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will not be disclosed <i>if</i>the offence is over 7 years old even where more recent offences have been committed:<br /><br />- Section 4 (Intoxication),<br /><br />- Section 5 (Disorderly conduct),<br /><br />- Section 6 (Threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour),<br /><br />- Section 7 (Distribution or display of material which is offensive),<br /><br />- Section 8 (Failure to comply with direction of Garda),<br /><br />- Section 9 (Wilful obstruction).3)<i>Other minor offences &ndash; 1 Only</i>:District Court<b></b>convictions for any other minor offence will not be disclosed after 7 years where the person has one such offence only (excluding motoring or public order offences over 7 years old). This provision does not apply to offences against the person or to sexual offences.<br /><br />C. Probation Act ProvisionsWhere persons have been dealt with by a district court in accordance with the provisions of section 1(1) (i) or 1 (1) (ii) of the Probation Act 1907, the offences will not be disclosed except in cases where the circumstances of the offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person.<br /><br />Where persons have been dealt with by a court in accordance with section 1 (2) of the Probation Act, these will be disclosed in all cases. (Section 1 (2) relates solely to persons &ldquo;convicted on indictment&rdquo;.)<br /><br />D. Offences in respect of which a person is charged but subsequently not prosecuted or acquitted.<br /><br />Non convictions will be <i>considered</i>for disclosure where the circumstances of an offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person. This information will only be disclosed if the information is of such a nature that its disclosure is necessary, proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of children or vulnerable persons, or both, as the case may be.<br /><br />The Garda Central Vetting Unit will make such decision in the context of:<br /><br />- The information concerned<br /><br />- The relevance of the information to the type of work/activity<br /><br />- The source and reliability of the information<br /><br />- The rights of the vetting applicant and any submissions made by them.<br /><br />Where the GCVU makes a determination to disclose information under this section  the GCVU will:<br /><br />- Notify the person who is the subject of the application for the vetting disclosure concerned, in writing, of its determination and of the reasons for it,<br /><br />- Provide to the person a copy of the information to be disclosed,<br /><br />- Notify the person of the intention to disclose the information to an Authorised Signatory for the registered organisation concerned after the expiry of 14 days from the date of notification, and<br /><br />- Allow the applicant the opportunity to make a written submission.<br /><br />- There will also be an appeals process in respect of a decision to disclose the information.</blockquote><p>The GCVU will not issue a vetting disclosure in respect of a person until this process has been completed.</p></reply>

The available statistics are those in the report of the Inter-Departmental Committee to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries - otherwise known as the McAleese Report - which submitted its report to Government in February 2013.  That Report is available on my Department's website - www.justice.ie.  The Committee no longer exists and its report does not contain the data in the format sought in these questions.</p>  <p>  It is important to note, by way of general information, that the McAleese Report sets out in detail the basis for its data.  It further explains that the Central Statistics Office carried out a review of the database used to ensure the highest levels of professionalism and accuracy in analysis.</p>  <p>  I understand that the main database used was based on congregations' records and was limited to 14,607 recorded admissions to Magdalen Laundries from 1922 to the closure of the last Magdalen Laundry in 1996.  Because of multiple entries the total number of individuals who entered in the period in question was estimated at 10,012 - see Chapter 7 para.34 of the Report.  The remit of the Committee was limited to State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries and therefore the Committee did not examine in any detail material predating the establishment of the State in 1922  - see Chapter 2 paras. 11-17.  However legacy cases (i.e. women who were admitted to Magdalen Laundries before 1922 but were still there after 1922) were included separately and totalled an additional 762 women  - see Chapter 8 para. 75 and following. </p>  <p>  As pointed out in Chapter 7 paragraphs 20-30, there are gaps in available information and the records are not always clear.  There is no assertion, therefore, that the database is definitive but it is the most comprehensive database available and provides a statistically sound basis for providing general information on routes of entry and exit and lengths of stay.</p>  <p>  I also understand that the religious congregations gave full access to the Committee to their records and that these records were returned to the Congregations.  I can also advise the Deputy that the McAleese Archive is not held by my Department.  It has been deposited with the Department of An Taoiseach.  This had been agreed as the most appropriate course of action in order to ensure the proper maintenance of the records gathered as a result of Committee's work and as a resource for future researchers.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources.  The Garda stations mentioned are in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) West which on the 30 September 2015, the latest date for which figures are readily available has a total Garda strength of 694, of which there are 197, 94 and 74 assigned to Clondalkin, Ronanstown and Lucan Garda stations respectively.</p><p>This Government is committed to the ongoing recruitment of trainee Garda&iacute;, and to this end the first intake since 2009 of new recruits commenced training at the Garda College, Templemore, in September of last year.  To date there has been five intakes of Garda Trainees to the Garda College, giving a total intake of 475.  It is planned that a further 75 recruits will enter college by the end of November, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550.  So far 295 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On attestation, new Probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform policing duties.  I am assured by Garda management that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute;.</p><p>The increased budget allocation for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016 which I recently announced, provides for the recruitment of 600 new Garda&iacute; in addition to the 550 that will be recruited by year end.  This will bring the total number of trainee Gardai recruited since September 2014  to 1,150 by the end of 2016.  The ongoing recruitment of new Garda&iacute; is crucial to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the safety of communities throughout the State.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b>This ramped-up recruitment underscores the determination of this Government to deliver an effective, responsive police service to protect our communities and respond to emerging crime trends.</p><p>This Government has also  invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units.  This will ensure Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.  We are also investing in airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems. </p><p>Operation Thor, a new multi-strand national anti-crime  and anti-burglary operation which was launched yesterday by the Garda Commissioner will make full use of this continuing investment. Operation Thor, which has been in planning for several months, builds on previous and current Garda operations and entails  a broad range of activities to tackle crime, particularly burglaries in both urban and rural communities nationwide.  A further allocation of in excess of &euro;5 million has been committed to Operation Thor.  This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.<b><font color="#000080"> </font></b>Operation Thor will be further supported by new laws aimed at prolific offenders which I am introducing including the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill, which is currently going through the Oireachtas. That Bill will</p><p>- require the District Court to provide for consecutive jails sentences where a burglar is being sentenced for multiple offences;</p><p>- allow Courts to refuse bail for offenders who have a previous conviction for domestic burglary coupled with two or more pending charges.</p><p>I am confident that the totality of the Government's response in terms of resources and legislative initiatives will disrupt the activities of burglars, organised crime gangs and prolific offenders and will improve the safety for all communities across the country. </p></reply>

Details in respect of both categories are outlined below.  However, there is a large volume of information in tabular format, contained in 5 Appendices, which I am forwarding to the Deputy directly.</p><p><b><i>Civil Legal Aid</i></b></p><p><b><i>New Applications:</i></b></p><p>In relation to civil legal aid the Legal Aid Board operates 29 general full time law centres in 23 different counties. Appendix 1 (forwarded to the Deputy directly) giving the number of new applicants in each of the counties in which the Board has a full time presence (the Board has five law centres in Dublin and two  law centres in both Cork and Galway respectively). Persons seeking legal services can apply at any law centre and are not required to apply within the county in which they reside. The Board also operates part time law centres in the counties where it does not have a full time presence. Each of these part-time centres is overseen by a full time centre and the numbers getting services at these centres are included in the applications figure for the full time centre.</p><p><b><i>Cost for each county:</i></b></p><p>In 2014, the Legal Aid Board received total Exchequer funding of &euro;32.574 million. The Board also generated its own income of &euro;2.63 million, largely through contributions from clients towards the cost of the service and costs recovered, giving a total budget of just over &euro;35.2 million.</p><p>In respect of the civil legal aid operations, legal services are provided from 29 law centres throughout the country and a small number of specialist units, with administrative offices in Cahirciveen and Dublin supporting these law centres. </p><p>I am (forwarding to the Deputy directly) the cost of operating these centres by county during 2014.</p><p><b><i>Legal Practitioners:</i></b></p><p>The total amount paid to legal practitioners for civil legal aid in 2014 was &euro;6.7m.</p><p>The Board does not maintain information on the number of cases dealt with by each practitioner, nor does it maintain information on payments to legal practitioners on a county by county basis.  I am however forwarding to the Deputy directly  a list of total payments made to each legal practitioner.  The Board does not maintain information on the number of cases each practitioner is paid for.</p><p><b><i>Criminal Legal Aid</i></b></p><p>The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962, which is the primary legislation covering the operation of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, provides that free legal aid may be granted, in certain circumstances, for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.</p><p>Criminal prosecutions originate in the District Court and if so satisfied, the Judge will grant a criminal legal aid certificate.  Figures are not kept in such a way as to be able to provide a breakdown by county of the number of certificates granted for criminal legal aid and the cost for each county.  The Courts Service has informed my Department that the number of legal aid certificates granted in the District Court in 2014 was 51,128.  Material being forwarded to the Deputy directly gives a breakdown of the number of legal aid certificates issued by Court area.  Expenditure on criminal legal aid in 2014 was &euro;49.9 million.</p><p>I am also forwarding to the Deputy directly a list detailing payments made under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to solicitors and barristers in 2014. It is not possible to provide details by county for 2014 of the legal practitioners that were paid for free legal aid and the number of cases 00each practitioner was paid for.  This information is not readily available and could not be compiled without disproportionate use of staff resources.</p></reply>

Garda management keep this distribution under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the best possible use is made of resources. It is important to note that roads policing is the duty of every Garda member, this duty is not reserved for Garda members of the Traffic Corps Units.

The Deputy may be aware that the Courts Service recently indicated that in relation to cases fully heard and decided upon by the District Courts average conviction rates for drink driving offences in recent years are between 85-88%.  Such outcomes are a matter which is wholly the responsibility of the courts and as the Deputy will appreciate judges are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.

This reform will simplify and streamline the existing arrangements and provide applicants with a final decision on their protection application in a more straightforward and timely fashion and will also, as a consequence, reduce the length of time applicants spend in the Direct Provision system. The Bill is expected to be published shortly.  </p></reply>

Any charity established before 16 October 2014 and not automatically registered must apply directly to the Authority for inclusion on the Register by 16 April 2016.</p>  <p>  The Authority has undertaken a variety of work since its establishment on 16 October 2014 including establishment of the Register of Charities and a fully online system for registration and annual reporting by charities; communication with the 8,500 CHY charities with tax exemption status regarding the additional information and legal documentation required to support their registered status; development of an online system for organisations to apply for inclusion on the Register of Charities; provision of information to the charities sector on their obligations and duties under the new regulatory regime; and the continuation of services hitherto provided by the Commissioners for Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland.</p>  <p>  The range of services to be provided by the Authority is being developed on an ongoing basis. These services include the development of an annual reporting framework for registered charities, the development of a monitoring and compliance programme and the development of the investigative role of the Authority under Part 4 of the Act which has not yet been commenced. The Register, when more advanced, will underpin the investigative and other regulatory work of the Authority.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that the Authority has the necessary resources available to enable it to fulfil its statutory mandate. Significant additional resources - a budget allocation for 2016 of &euro;2.665 million which represents an 88% increase over 2015 - are being made available to the CRA. This includes additional funding of &euro;1.25 million which will enable an expansion in the level of staffing and other resources available to the CRA in 2016.</p>  <p>  Specifically on the issue of the regulation of charitable fundraising activities, I recently requested that the Authority consider the establishment of a Consultative Panel in accordance with its powers under the provisions of Section 36 of the Charities Act 2009, to examine the issue of charitable fundraising and the possible need for regulation of such fundraising in the future and I understand that the Authority intends to advance this matter. It is my intention that the outcome of the deliberations of the Consultative Panel would inform the development in due course of Regulations in relation to charitable fundraising in accordance with the provisions of the Charities Act 2009.</p></reply>

With this in mind, I have instigated a review of the effectiveness of the Community CCTV Scheme in conjunction with the Garda authorities.  The outcome of that review will inform future decisions on the continuation of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government, has recently made an announcement in relation the provision of CCTV in rural areas, which is to be funded from the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.</p>  <p>  CCTV schemes certainly have a part to play in the detection and prevention of criminal activity, but of paramount importance is a visible and responsive policing service.  There is no doubt that this Government is determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.  This Government has invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. This will ensure Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan.</p>  <p>  Operation Thor, a new multi-strand national anti-crime  and anti-burglary operation which was launched yesterday by the Garda Commissioner will make full use of  this continuing investment. Operation Thor, which has been in planning for several months, builds on previous and current Garda operations and entails  a broad range of activities to tackle crime, particularly burglaries in both urban and rural communities nationwide and criminal gangs using the national road network.  A further allocation of in excess of &euro;5 million has been committed to Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p>  <p>  This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the ongoing recruitment of new Garda with 600 to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year.</p>  <p>  The totality of this investment will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly-mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt the activities of burglars and prolific offenders, and improve the safety for all communities across the country.</p></reply>

This judgement in the UK Courts found that the policy of disclosure of all criminal convictions under the UK&rsquo;s equivalent legislation was contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention of Human rights. The UK Courts found that there must be some assessment of the relevance and proportionality of offences, in particular old, minor offences.</p><p>A review of the provisions of the Vetting Act has been completed and amendments to the Vetting Act and consequential amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill have been drafted.  I intend to bring the amendments to the Bill before the Oireachtas in the next month or so, with a view to then commencing the Act.</p><p>Pending the amendment of the Bill, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.<font color="#000080"> </font>This Administrative Filter already gives effect to the main provisions which I consider likely to be contained in the amended Act.</p><p>A copy of this Administrative Filter is below.</p><p>Garda Vetting Procedures</p><p>Administrative Filter</p><p>In anticipation of the amendment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, an administrative filter in respect of Garda Vetting Unit Disclosures will operate in accordance with the following procedural guidelines.</p><p>A. Criminal Convictions to be disclosed in all cases:</p><p>1) Offences Against the Person.</p><p>2) Sexual Offences</p><p>3) Convictions on indictment.</p><p>B. District Court Convictions which will not be disclosed:</p><p>1) Motoring Offences  :</p><p>District Court convictions for motoring offences will not be disclosed after 7 years even where more recent offences have been committed. This is because it is considered that old minor motoring offences would not be relevant due to the passage of time.</p><p>2) Minor Public Order Offences  :</p><p>The following convictions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 will not be disclosed if the offence is over 7 years old even where more recent offences have been committed: </p><p>-  Section 4 (Intoxication),</p><p>-  Section 5 (Disorderly conduct),</p><p>-  Section 6 (Threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour),</p><p>-  Section 7 (Distribution or display of material which is offensive),</p><p>-  Section 8 (Failure to comply with direction of Garda),</p><p>-  Section 9 (Wilful obstruction).</p><p>3) Other minor offences - 1 Only  :</p><p>District Court convictions for any other minor offence will not be disclosed after 7 years where the person has one such offence only (excluding motoring or public  order offences over 7 years old). This provision does not apply to offences against the person or to sexual offences.</p><p>C. Probation Act Provisions</p><p>Where persons have been dealt with by a district court in accordance with the provisions of section 1(1) (i) or 1 (1) (ii) of the Probation Act 1907, the offences will not be disclosed except in cases where the circumstances of the offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person.</p><p>Where persons have been dealt with by a court in accordance with section 1 (2) of the Probation Act, these will be disclosed in all cases. (Section 1 (2) relates solely to persons &ldquo;convicted on indictment&rdquo;.)</p><p>D. Offences in respect of which a person is charged but subsequently not prosecuted or acquitted.</p><p>Non convictions will be considered for disclosure where the circumstances of an offence gives rise to a bona fide concern that the person concerned may harm a child or vulnerable person. This information will only be disclosed if the information is of such a nature that its disclosure is necessary, proportionate and reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of children or vulnerable persons, or both, as the case may be.</p><p>The Garda Central Vetting Unit will make such decision in the context of:</p><p>-  The information concerned</p><p>-  The relevance of the information to the type of work/activity</p><p>-  The source and reliability of the information</p><p>-  The rights of the vetting applicant and any submissions made by them.</p><p>Where the GCVU makes a determination to disclose information under this section  the GCVU will:</p><p>-  Notify the person who is the subject of the application for the vetting disclosure concerned, in writing, of its determination and of the reasons for it,</p><p>-  Provide to the person a copy of the information to be disclosed,</p><p>-  Notify the  person of the intention to disclose the information to an Authorised Signatory for the registered organisation concerned after the expiry of 14 days from the date of notification, and</p><p>-  Allow the applicant the opportunity to make a written submission.</p><p>-  There will also be an appeals process in respect of a decision to disclose the information.</p><p>The GCVU will not issue a vetting disclosure in respect of a person until this process has been completed.</p></reply>

It is planned that a further 75 recruits will enter college by the end of November, bringing total recruitment of Garda Trainees to 550. So far 295 of the new Garda Trainees have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  On attestation, new Probationer Garda&iacute; are assigned to Garda stations throughout the country by the Garda Commissioner, where they are assigned to mainstream uniform policing duties.

This will bring the total number of trainee  Gardai recruited to 1,150 by the end of 2016.

Based on this report,  on 25 June 2013 the Government approved the implementation of a scheme involving cash lump sum payments to the women concerned based on the duration of their stay in the Laundries.

The conduct of and decision reached in any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.  If a person believes that their interests would be affected if a particular judge were to hear and determine the matter in question, then an application to recuse a judge must be made to the judge concerned by or on behalf of that person.  The decision on recusal is a matter for the judge concerned and, if the applicant is not satisfied with the decision the judge makes, it is possible to appeal any decision of that judge to the appropriate appeal court.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government undertakes to &ldquo;<i>legislate to establish a Judicial Council, with lay representation, to provide an effective mechanism for dealing with complaints against judges&quot;.  </i>This commitment is being pursued by way of the proposed Judicial Council Bill which will provide for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board of that Council to promote excellence and high standards of conduct by judges.  In addition, the proposed Bill will provide for the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee, the membership of which will include lay persons, to facilitate the investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct. </p><p>The Government Legislative Programme which was published on 22 September includes the Judicial Council Bill amongst those Bills which are expected to be published in the period from the commencement of the current Dail session to the start of the next session.

The primary function of the Authority will be to determine, on the basis of an objective assessment of all the issues, with safety of the public being paramount, whether particular forms of firearms may be licensed in the State, whether there should be any limit on the number of such firearms and what safety conditions might properly be applied to their licensing. The functions of the Authority will be subject to further consultation with key stakeholders in advance of the preparation of the necessary enabling legislation, which will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence. I have also sought submissions on the proposed Authority from the Firearms Consultative Panel, which is made up of key stakeholders, including the Sports Coalition. Accordingly, it is premature at this stage to decide on the make up of the Authority before the consultation process.</p></reply>

As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p>  <p>  The deployment of resources is kept under review at all times by the Garda Commissioner to ensure that Garda resources continue to be used in the most efficient and appropriate way possible to target criminal activity at the local and national level.</p></reply>

I acknowledge that these savings are modest. However, it is important to recall that the primary objective of the Programme was to identify opportunities to introduce strategic reforms to enhance service delivery, increase efficiency and streamline practices within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p>  <p>  In its review of the Garda Station Network, Garda management concluded in relation to certain stations, many of which were only open part-time and manned by a single Garda, that resources could be better deployed and more effectively used on the front line if those stations no longer had to be staffed and maintained.   In reaching these conclusions, Garda management reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the overall operation of Garda stations.  The Programme supports the provision of a modern 21st century policing service for both urban and rural areas and  allows  front line Garda&iacute; to be managed and deployed with greater mobility, greater flexibility, and in a more focused fashion, particularly with regard to various targeted police operations.  As a result of the Programme, communities have benefited from increased Garda visibility and increased patrolling hours which has enabled  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deliver an improved policing service to the public.</p>  <p>  In tandem with the rationalisation of stations this Government has been determined to ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the resources to deliver highly-mobile and responsive Garda patrols in both rural and urban communities.   Since 2012, this Government has invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles, with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. This will ensure Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community.  This investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides an additional &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles over the life time of the Plan.</p>  <p>  This substantial level of investment will be accompanied by the continued renewal of Garda personnel with 600 new Garda to be recruited next year on top of the 550 to be recruited by the end of this year. The totality of this investment will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of highly-mobile criminal gangs and to disrupt crime, particularly burglaries, across both rural and urban communities.</p></reply>

Our thoughts are with their families and friends in their grief.  In carrying out their duties they both displayed the courage and commitment to duty which is in the best traditions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>The allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I am informed by the Commissioner that the allocation of personnel is monitored continually to ensure optimal deployment and this process is reviewed periodically in light of particular incidents of concern. In this context, the Garda Commissioner has directed the allocation of an additional 27 Garda&iacute;, including two Sergeants, to the Louth Division as an interim measure.  These Garda&iacute; are being transferred on a temporary basis to support the work of the 283 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na assigned to the Louth Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to the ongoing renewal of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and I have secured an increased allocation in Budget 2016 that allows for the recruitment of an additional 600 new Garda&iacute; next year on top of the 550 that will be recruited before the end of this year. The work of local Garda&iacute; in the Louth Division is augmented, of course, by a number of Garda national units, such as the Drugs and Organised Crime Unit or the Criminal Assets Bureau, in accordance with operational demands. This Government has also invested over &euro;34 million in new Garda vehicles since 2012 with over 640 new vehicles coming on stream in 2015, ranging from more Garda patrol cars to high-powered vehicles for armed units. This will ensure Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. We are also investing in airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems. This investment in Garda personnel and resources will  ensure that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity  to deliver a highly-mobile and responsive policing service in both rural and urban communities.</p><p>Operation Thor, a new multi-strand national anti-crime  and anti-burglary operation which was launched yesterday by the Garda Commissioner will make full use of  this continuing investment. Operation Thor, which has been in planning for several months, builds on previous and current Garda operations and entails  a broad range of activities to tackle crime, particularly burglaries in both urban and rural communities nationwide and criminal gangs using the national road network.  A further allocation of in excess of &euro;5 million has been committed to Operation Thor. This allocation, which includes funding for Garda overtime will support a combination of additional patrols, checkpoints, rapid armed response and public awareness measures.</p><p>Tackling organised crime is a priority for both the Government and the Garda and other law enforcement authorities.  Of course, it is a shared priority with the authorities in Northern Ireland and there is extensive cross-border co-operation in place to tackle smuggling and other border-focused criminal activities.  This work involves the police, customs and other law enforcement agencies from both jurisdictions.  The interagency cross-Border enforcement groups on fuel and tobacco fraud are two examples of this joint working in action. I met recently with the North&rsquo;s Justice Minister, David Ford, to discuss what more can be done to tackle cross-border crime.  Minister Ford and I jointly hosted the Annual Cross Border Organised Crime Seminar in Sligo on 30 September/1 October last with over 100 delegates attending from North and South.  It is one demonstration of the close and ongoing co-operation between the two jurisdictions in this regard. I am examining, in co-operation with my counterparts in the North ways to build on the excellent co-operation that already takes place in this area. It is the joint working of all the law enforcement agencies involved, on both sides of the border, which will be crucial to tackling these issues.</p><p>The totality of the Government response will ensure that Garda&iacute; have the necessary tools and manpower to tackle the scourge of criminality in all its forms and improve the safety for all communities across the country.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

Over thirty locations around the country will benefit from the Programme which includes new stations, major refurbishment of stations/facilities including facilities for meeting victims of crime; essential remedial works to existing stations; development of large scale property and exhibit management stores and the upgrade of cells and provision of improved custody management facilities. The Programme will be delivered by the Garda Authorities in cooperation with the Office of Public Works (OPW) which has responsibility for capital expenditure in this area.</p><p>The refurbishment of Drogheda Garda Station and the provision of a PEMS (Property &amp;amp; Exhibit Management Stores) at Collon, Co Louth are included in the Programme.</p><p>I am advised by the OPW that proposals are being developed to provide increased facilities at Drogheda Garda Station by extending the main station building and by providing new locker facilities.

The development of these projects under PPP involves collaboration between my Department, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Office of Public Works and the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA). In general the timescale for completion is dependant on the market&rsquo;s response but projects of this type generally take in the region of three to four years to complete. Initial discussions have taken place  between the stakeholders in relation to preliminary matters such as the governance arrangements that will need to be put in place. Once such matters have been finalised detailed discussions will be held between the stakeholders with a view to developing the necessary procurement documentation to allow the NDFA to invite proposals for the construction of the Garda projects included in the PPP.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

These include:</p><p>-  what is in the best social and economic interests of the State;</p><p>-  the security of the State and the people within it; </p><p>-  Ireland's international obligations, for example those international protection and refugees;</p><p>-  maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area;</p><p>-  Fairness.</p><p>Policy in this area is essentially a matter of balancing the sometimes competing interests.  Operationally the objective is to facilitate the coming to Ireland of those whose presence here is beneficial to the State, for example tourists or high skilled workers, etc. while protecting the State's borders against those whose presence would be harmful or otherwise undesirable.</p><p>Determining Ireland's need for non-EEA workers and the policy choices around that are matters for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and dealt with at an operational level through the employment permits system.Employment rights similarly fall under the remit of that Minister.My Department will facilitate entry and residence to those granted an employment permit by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, assuming that there are no security or related concerns.  Other non-EEA nationals are permitted to work by virtue of their immigration status, in particular those holding a Stamp 4 immigration permission.</p><p>Ireland has always lived up to its obligations and will continue to do so in the area of international protection, whether it is through processing cases for asylum and other protections for persons who claim asylum here or through specific programmes aimed at addressing international crises.  In this regard, in September, the Government approved a package of measures - the Irish Refugee Protection Programme - which provides for a total of 4,000 persons to come to Ireland under the programme either through Resettlement of refugees from countries close to the conflict regions or under the EU Relocation Programme which is designed to alleviate the pressures on other EU Member State such as Italy and Greece.</p><p>Apart from those persons in the direct provision system, resettled refugees or those who will come to Ireland under the EU Relocation programme, my Department is not responsible for matters relating to accommodation and cannot confer entitlement via the immigration system to public housing or other services.  Eligibility determination is a matter for the relevant Departments and agencies although they will generally have regard to immigration categories in doing so. </p></reply>

However, due to issues relating to the operational effectiveness of untargeted electronic monitoring, these provisions have not been commenced.</p>  <p>  Experience in other jurisdictions has shown that electronic monitoring has significant limitations.  For example, the report on the Scottish pilot of electronic monitoring as a condition of bail found that neither the aims of increasing public safety perceptions nor reducing the custodial remand population had been achieved in any significant way. The report also found electronic monitoring for persons on bail to be more expensive than custodial remand and in the circumstances it was decided not to introduce electronic monitoring on a national basis in Scotland in connection with the granting of bail.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that, in the overall context, electronic monitoring would not stop a person on bail committing a serious offence and, in addition, the equipment that would be used can be subject to technical failures or blind spots.  As it is not feasible to monitor live the movements of a large number of persons, jurisdictions are primarily compelled to use historical data rather than live data to monitor compliance with electronic monitoring.  Furthermore, the equipment can be removed or disabled, which may register as a breach of conditions but it also means that the person will be unmonitored at that stage.</p>  <p>  While, as I have indicated, there are issues involved in relation to electronic monitoring, I believe that it has the potential to be effective as a means of enhancing compliance with bail conditions in appropriate cases. For this reason, I will be bringing forward streamlined proposals for electronic monitoring in the new Bail Bill, which is being drafted on a priority basis with a view to its publication in the current parliamentary session.  The Bail Bill will provide that electronic monitoring may be imposed as a bail condition if the prosecution applies to the court for such a condition.  This will facilitate the focused and targeted use of electronic monitoring for persons on bail.</p>  <p>  In 2009, a project group was established to examine the potential to use electronic monitoring in the management of offenders.  Having considered the experience in other jurisdictions of the monitoring of persons on bail, the project group recommended that electronic monitoring for such persons should not be introduced until a programme was in place for electronic monitoring of prisoners granted early release.  Given the operational limitations involved, electronic monitoring has been used in relation to a relatively small number of these prisoners.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Law Reform Commission published an administrative consolidation of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 to take account of the amendments made to the Act.  In the course of this exercise the Commission did not undertake a review of the operation of the 2007 Act.</p></reply>

The Scheme provides that civil servants may be granted special leave without pay for a specific reason. A career break may be granted for family reasons, other domestic reasons, travel, educational purposes, taking up employment in the private sector or becoming self-employed. Career breaks may be granted for a period of at least six months up to a maximum of 3 years for taking up employment in the private sector or becoming self-employed and a maximum of 5 years for other reasons. Eligible staff may, in general, avail of three career breaks during their career in the Civil Service subject to a maximum of 12 years in total.  On completion of a career break, an officer will be assigned to the next appropriate vacancy, with a guarantee of re-employment in his/her original grade (in line with redeployment arrangements in place), within twelve months of the end of the career break.  Circular 4/2013 revoked Circular 18/1998 -Special Leave without pay for career breaks.</p><p>The Deputy may also wish to note that Circular 13/ 2009 - Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme 2009 was introduced as a once-off measure that was included in the Supplementary Budget on 7 April 2009.

This investment supports more than 100,000 children each year. </p>  <p>  Community/not for profit childcare providers are eligible to participate in all of the childcare programmes implemented by my Department.  I announced in Budget 2016 additional annual funding of &euro;85 million to support the achievement of affordable, accessible, high quality childcare.  This funding represents an increase of 33% in the annual investment in childcare supports and provides for the significant enhancement of a number of programmes implemented by my Department.</p>  <p>  In relation to the childcare service referred to by the Deputy, funding totalling &euro;333,672 has been provided to this service under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme since 2012.  This enables the service to provide childcare at reduced rates to low income and disadvantaged families.  I recently announced the lifting of restrictions on the provision of additional places by community services participating in the CCS programme. This will enable services to increase the number of children and the services provided for under the programme. </p>  <p>  Further funding totalling &euro;34,186 was provided to the service under the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme during this period.  I wish to point out that in Budget 2016 I announced the expansion of the ECCE programme to provide pre-school places for children when they reach the age of 3 years until they make the transition to primary school.    I also  restored the capitation payments to pre-2012 levels which means that the standard capitation payment will be increased from &euro;62.50 to &euro;64.50 per week for each eligible child and the higher capitation rate from &euro;73 to &euro;75 per child per week.  This will assist childcare providers to address some of the cost issues that impact on their services.  </p>  <p>  My officials recently made enquiries with Pobal, who administer the funding under the Community Childcare Subvention on behalf of my Department. Pobal report that, based on the financial returns made by the service to Pobal, they would have no concerns with regard to the sustainability of the service at that point in time.</p></reply>

This Group reported to Government in July this year, setting out a range of options for future investment to enhance affordablility, increase the accessibility and improve the quality of early years and after-school childcare.  The recommendations of the Group, some of which relate to after-school childcare,  were considered as part of the Estimates process prior to Budget 2016. </p>  <p>  A number of measures were introduced in Budget 2016 including a &euro;3 million capital fund, which will be provided to enable both community/not-for-profit and private providers to develop after-school childcare services using existing school and other accessible community facilities.  Work will also begin on the development of Quality Standards for After-School Childcare, along with a consultation with children on their views about after-school childcare. </p>  <p>  These new developments add to the  range of programmes implemented by my Department to assist parents in accessing quality and affordable after-school childcare. These include:</p>  <p>  - The After-School Childcare (ASCC) programme that provides after-school care for primary school children of eligible parents for a period of 52 weeks.  Eligibility for the programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.  The programme contributes &euro;40 per week for an after-school place or &euro;80 per week in situations where the childcare service provides a pick-up service that collects the child from school. The programme also provides a full day care rate of &euro;105 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods. In all cases, the maximum fee payable by parents is &euro;15 per week per child.</p>  <p>  - The Community Employment Childcare (CEC) programme, which is targeted specifically at participants in the Community Employment (CE) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection.  Under this programme, &euro;80 per week is provided for pre-school places for children up to the age of 5 and &euro;40 per week for after-school places for primary school children up to the age of 13, with a set charge of &euro;15 per week to the parent in either case.   The programme also provides a part time day care rate of &euro;80 per week, for a maximum of 10 weeks, to cater for school holiday periods.  Places are approved for 50 weeks.  Eligibility for the CEC programme is determined by the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  - The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, which provides childcare places, including part-time and after-school places, to qualifying Solas or Education and Training Boards (ETB) trainees or students for the duration of their courses.  Eligibility for the CETS programme is determined by the Department of Education and Skills.  The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to provide quality childcare, including after-school care, at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income working parents. </p></reply>

This includes a provision of &euro;1.113 billion in current expenditure and &euro;25 million in capital expenditure.  The net funding allocation for the Vote amounts to &euro;1.112 billion when Appropriations-in-Aid receipts of &euro;25.450 million in current funding are taken into account.  This level of funding represents an increase of 11% on the 2015 Revised Estimate.</p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s provision for 2016 takes into account a number of adjustments relating to Haddington Road Agreement/Lansdowne Road Agreement.  These include an increase of &euro;171,931 in pay costs, a reduction of &euro;3,310,197 in Pension Related Deduction (PRD) receipts and an additional &euro;18,000 in respect of pension restoration costs over 2015 levels.</p>  <p>  Demographic change and its influence on the cost of implementing programmes and services is one of many considerations taken into account in securing and finalising expenditure provisions in the context of the annual estimates cycle.  In this regard the Deputy might note, for example, that the 2016 allocation includes significant extra resources to Tusla for 2016.  The overall allocation amounts to &euro;676 million, representing an increase of &euro;38 million over the 2015 allocation.  This includes &euro;662.4 million in current expenditure and &euro;13.6 million in capital expenditure.  This will significantly strengthen the Agency&rsquo;s base funding level and will facilitate it in responding to anticipated demand, as well as alleviating service pressures in child welfare and protection services, in particular pressures being faced in the areas of unallocated cases, private residential and foster care and Domestic Sexual and Gender Based Violence Strategy.</p></reply>

From the establishment of my Department in June 2011 until 31 December 2013 the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs was responsible for appointments to the Boards of the Family Support Agency (FSA) and the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB).  With the establishment of the Tusla on 1 January 2014, the FSA and the NEWB ceased to exist and their roles were subsumed into the Agency.</p><p>In line with Government Decisions in 2011 relating to appointments to State Boards and bodies, the vacancies on the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under my Department's aegis were published on my Department's website and expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to these boards were invited.  My officials acknowledged all expressions of interest received and maintained a database of those expressions.</p><p>In May 2013 the Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of my Department, sought expressions of interest from those interested in being appointed to the Board of the FSA, having regard to both its existing statutory functions and its planned role in facilitating the establishment of Tusla.  The members of the FSA Board, in place at end-2013, were subsequently appointed to the Board of Tusla on its establishment on 1 January 2014.</p><p>New arrangements concerning appointments to State Boards were approved by Government in November 2014.  Guidelines covering the process to be used were published on 25 November 2014 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Under these new arrangements, PAS manages the process of advertising vacancies and the selection of suitable potential appointees to State Boards.</p><p>There is currently one vacancy on the Tusla Board and this position was recently advertised by PAS.  There are also two vacancies on the Board of Management of the Children Detention Schools.  The Children (Amendment) Act 2015 creates a legal framework to amalgamate the 3 existing Schools in Oberstown into a single detention school with a new board of management to be appointed by me.  I am also arranging for four vacant positions on Gaisce, the President's Award scheme, to be advertised through the State Boards process.  Seven members were appointed to the Board of the Adoption Authority of Ireland with effect from 1 November 2015, following the advertisement and selection process by PAS. </p><p>My decisions on appointments to boards are subject to the relevant governing legislation, and take into account the particular responsibilities of the body or agency in question.  At all times I seek to ensure that the body or agency is best served by an appropriate mix of skills and experience.</p><p>The following tables set out the appointments to the respective boards since 2011:<div><b>Adoption Authority of Ireland</b></div>The credentials of the persons appointed were in accordance with Section 98 of the Adoption Act 2010.<table><tr><th>Board Member</th><th>Term </th><th>Credentials </th></tr><tr><td>Dr. Imelda Ryan</td><td>02/02/12 - 02/02/17 (Board term ended 31/10/15)<br /><br />Appointed to new Board 01/11/15- 31/10/20</td><td>Doctor</td></tr><tr><td>Anne O&rsquo;Flaherty</td><td>11/03/13 - 11/09/18 (Board term ended 31/10/15)<br /><br />Appointed to new Board 01/11/15- 31/10/20</td><td>Appropriate training in Psychology</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Geoffrey Shannon</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Chairperson</td></tr><tr><td>Orlaith Traynor</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Deputy Chairperson</td></tr><tr><td>Paul Harrison</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Social Worker with Adoption Experience</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Helen Buckley</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Social Worker with Research Experience</td></tr><tr><td>Patrick McMahon</td><td>01/11/15 - 31/10/20</td><td>Retired District Court Judge</td></tr></table><div><b>Family Support Agency and Tusla (the Child and Family Agency)</b></div><table><tr><th>Board Member</th><th>Term </th><th>Credentials</th></tr><tr><td>Sharon Foley (Chair)</td><td>30/01/12 - 26/03/13 (Ordinary Board member) &amp;amp; 26/03/12 - 31/05/13 (FSA Chair)</td><td>CEO Irish Hospice Foundation</td></tr><tr><td>Caroline Murphy</td><td>20/10/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Organisational Psychologist and Broadcaster</td></tr><tr><td>Dick Hickey</td><td>02/06/11 - 01/12/11<br /><br />02/12/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Executive Director, St. Brigid&rsquo;s Family resource Centre</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. John Griffin</td><td>30/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Consultant Psychiatrist</td></tr><tr><td>Marie Fenlon</td><td>01/09/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Nominee of the Family Resource Centre National Forum</td></tr><tr><td>Liz Chaloner</td><td>30/01/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Independent Researcher, Facilitator, Consultant</td></tr><tr><td>Nuala Ryan</td><td>30/01/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>President UCD Women Graduates Association</td></tr><tr><td>Catherine Downey Murphy</td><td>11/07/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Management positions in Health Service, Southern Health Board</td></tr><tr><td>Catherine Hazlett<br /><br />(Resigned on 16/05/12 due to restructuring of Department) </td><td>26/07/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 16/05/12</td><td>Civil Servant &ndash; Department of Children and Youth Affairs Rep</td></tr><tr><td>Yvette O&rsquo;Malley<br /><br />(Resigned on 10/11/11)</td><td>01/09/11 - 10/11/11</td><td>Family Support Agency Staff Rep, Mediator</td></tr><tr><td>Marie Dullea</td><td>11/07/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Civil Servant - Department of Children  and Youth Affairs Rep</td></tr><tr><td>Imelda Martin</td><td>28/11/11 - 31/03/12<br /><br />16/04/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Family Support Agency Staff Rep</td></tr><tr><td>Lorraine Mulligan</td><td>12/12/12 - 31/03/13</td><td>Experienced Researcher, financial analysis, advocacy</td></tr><tr><td>Dr. Nollaig Byrne</td><td>08/02/12 - 31/05/13</td><td>Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist</td></tr><tr><td>Norah Gibbons (Chair)</td><td>01/06/13 - 31/12/13 (FSA) <br /><br />Appointed to Tusla Board 01/01/14</td><td>Former member of Task Force on the establishment of Child and Family Agency</td></tr><tr><td>Sylda Langford</td><td>17/09/13 - 31/12/13 (FSA)<br /><br />Appointed to Tusla Board 01/01/14</td><td>Retired &ndash; former Director General of the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs</td></tr><tr><td>PJ Fitzpatrick</td><td>17/09/13 - 31/12/13 (FSA)<br /><br />Appointed to Tusla Board 01/01/14</td><td>Former Independent Chair of the Implementation Body for the Public Service Pay and Modernisation (Croke Park) Agreement 2010-2013.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people by the voluntary youth sector.  It is estimated that the voluntary youth services throughout the country involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  In 2015, the overall allocation provided by my Department for the youth funding schemes was &euro;49.930 million.  I am pleased to tell the Deputy that Budget 2016 has provided an additional &euro;1.1 million in current funding to my Department for the voluntary youth services. </p><p>All youth organisations in receipt of funding from my Department are required to implement <i>Children First, the National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children (2011). </i></p><p>The organisation in question receives funding under the Youth Services Grant Scheme administered by my Department.  In 2015, an allocation of &euro;814,250 was provided to support the national organisation in the provision of services to young people throughout the country.

The Child Protection Programme works primarily with the voluntary youth work organisations to address the needs of the youth sector in implementing the <i>Children First</i>guidance.  The programme provides child protection awareness programmes and training to the youth sector organisations for both staff and volunteers, including the organisation indicated in the Deputy&rsquo;s question.  Under the programme, a range of resources has been developed to assist youth services to comply with best practices in child protection and welfare. </p><p>My Department will continue to work closely with the youth services on the further development of these initiatives and in the context of the implementation of the proposed Children First legislation which is before the Oireachtas at present.</p></reply>

The implementation date of September 2016 was chosen so that providers would have time to plan for extra free pre-school places.  City and County Childcare Committees will be in a position to help parents identify other pre-school providers within their area with sufficient capacity to enrol additional children.</p>  <p>  It will be up to individual pre-school providers to determine how many children they can take, and whether they will provide places to children who are currently attending rather than to new entrants.

An assessment of need is undertaken with 16 and 17 year olds who, may be received into care or provided with a service under Section 5 of the Child Care Act 1991. </p><p>The Crisis Intervention Service (CIS) provides an out-of-hours emergency social work service to young people aged under 18 years who are in crisis.  The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Wicklow &amp;amp; Kildare).  Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours ie: Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel.  Outside of Dublin, the Emergency Place of Safety Service (EPSS) operates, whereby placements within a family setting can be accessed by Gardai for children found to be at risk out of hours.  The placements are usually until the next working day when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  The following table shows the end of year referrals and placements for both the CIS and the EPSS:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>Out of Hours Services</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015 Q1</th><th>2015 Q2</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>Referrals</td><td>1076</td><td>Not Available</td><td>1012</td><td>752</td><td>273</td><td>213</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Children Accomodated By CIS</td><td>Placed</td><td>179</td><td>Not Available</td><td>286</td><td>174</td><td>79</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Referrals</td><td>370</td><td>266</td><td>370</td><td>343</td><td>111</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Children Accomodated By EPSS</td><td>Placed</td><td>253</td><td>183</td><td>262</td><td>200</td><td>96</td><td>71</td></tr></table></p><p>The reasons for a referral not requiring placement varies, and include<font color="#000080"> </font>children not requiring a care placement, family arrangements put in place or referrals relate to queries from Gardai and hospital but do not require an emergency placement. </p><p>The Review of Adequacy is the annual report compiled and published by the HSE (now Tusla) which reviews the adequacy of the child and family services provided as required under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991.  The following table shows the number of children accommodated for more than four consecutive nights (or 10 separate nights over a year), and the number of children in care accommodated under Section 5 of the 1991 Act on the 31st December of the last three years.  In such circumstances, these children are provided with the same supports and safeguards as children in care.  In some instances, they may not wish to be taken into care and will take up services only on the basis of receiving support under Section 5 of the Act.  As these figures are released on an annual basis, figures for 2014 and 2015 are not yet available. <div><b>No. of Children Accommodated under section 5 of the CCA 1991</b></div><table><tr><th>-</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th></tr><tr><td>No. of Children accomodated for more than 4 consecutive nights</td><td>131</td><td>99</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>No. of Children in care accomodated on 31/12</td><td>9</td><td>14</td><td>10</td></tr></table></p><p>The accommodation needs of children who are in the care of their parents where the family is homeless are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities.

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people by the voluntary youth sector.  There are some 30 national youth organisations in receipt of funding under the Youth Service Grant Scheme, administered by my Department.  Funding schemes also support the provision of youth services that target young people who are disadvantaged.  It is estimated that the voluntary youth services throughout the country involve approximately, 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.  Youth workers are employed directly by the voluntary youth organisations, services and projects to deliver programmes that provide recreational, sporting, learning, volunteering, and personal and social development opportunities for young people.  The recruitment, employment and deployment of staff including youth workers are matters for youth organisations and services themselves. </p><p>The overall allocation provided by my Department for the youth funding schemes in 2015 was &euro;49.930 million. I am pleased to tell the Deputy that Budget 2016 has provided an additional &euro;1.1 million in current funding to my Department for voluntary youth services.  The increased funding will support, in the main, the targeted programmes for young people who are at risk of drugs, alcohol misuse, homelessness, early school leaving and unemployment.  It will also assist the national youth organisations to better support the local voluntary youth services. </p><p>The funding for the local youth services is distributed, on behalf of my Department, by the Education and Training Boards throughout the country.  Information in relation to the allocation of funding to the West Wicklow area is not readily available.  However, details of the allocations provided to the relevant Education and Training Board to support the provision of youth services for Wicklow is set out in the following table:</p><p><i>2015</i><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Special Projects for Youths (SPY)</td><td>&euro;210,971</td></tr><tr><td>Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF 1)</td><td>&euro;130,661</td></tr><tr><td>Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF 2)</td><td>&euro;500,383</td></tr><tr><td>Youth Information Centres (YIC)</td><td>&euro;47,163</td></tr><tr><td>Local Youth Club Grant Scheme (LYCGS)</td><td>&euro;34,910</td></tr></table></p><p><i>2014</i><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Special Projects for Youths (SPY)</td><td>&euro;210,971</td></tr><tr><td>Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF 1)</td><td>&euro;130,661</td></tr><tr><td>Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF 2)</td><td>&euro;500,383</td></tr><tr><td>Youth Information Centres (YIC)</td><td>&euro;47,163</td></tr><tr><td>Local Youth Club Grant Scheme (LYCGS)</td><td>&euro;34,910</td></tr></table></p><p><i>2013</i><table><tr><th>-</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>Special Projects for Youths (SPY)</td><td>&euro;219,190</td></tr><tr><td>Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF 1)</td><td>&euro;135,792</td></tr><tr><td>Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund (YPFSF 2)</td><td>&euro;519,881</td></tr><tr><td>Youth Information Centres (YIC)</td><td>&euro;49,001</td></tr><tr><td>Local Youth Club Grant Scheme (LYCGS)</td><td>&euro;34,910</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These skills include learning to learn, social and civic competence, leadership, communication, teamwork, and entrepreneurship.

This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2011 and 30 June 2012 will qualify in the school year commencing in September 2015.</p><p>The recent Budget decisions, which introduced an extended provision under the ECCE programme that allows children to access the free pre-school programme from the time they are 3 years of age until they start primary school, come into effect from September 2016.  The start up date for the introduction of this new measure was decided so as to allow pre-school providers an adequate timeframe to make any necessary infrastructural or service changes and to put in place extra staff resources to accommodate the additional numbers benefiting from the programme - which is estimated to increase from 67,000 to over 127,000 children in a given year.</p><p>Children born between September and December 2012 will avail of 38 weeks of free pre-school while children born between January and February 2013 will avail of 38 weeks of free pre-school (if they start school at age 4) or 76 weeks of free pre-school (if they start school at age 5).</p><p>When the extended ECCE programme is fully in place from 2017, the number of weeks of free pre-school a child will benefit from will depend on their birth date and on the age at which they start primary school.  This number ranges from 38 weeks (for children born between April and August who start school at age 4) to 88 weeks (for children born between January and March who start school at age 5).

He found that the health status of Magdalen women was diverse in nature, that not all the HAA services might be directly relevant to the Magdalen women and that any comparable set of services for the Magdalen women would require suitable adaptation. </p>  <p>  Judge Quirke specified what the suite of services should be - GP services, prescribed drugs, medicines, aids and appliances, dental, ophthalmic, aural, home support, home nursing, counselling, chiropody and physiotherapy services.  Under the Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act 2015, all of the primary and community health services made available free of charge from 1 July 2015 to Magdalen women in Ireland are as specified by Judge Quirke. </p>  <p>  Judge Quirke recommended, the women are eligible for a greater range of services than those provided under the standard medical card.  The Redress for Women Resident in Certain Institutions Act provides a statutory basis to more services than the medical card, e.g., physiotherapy, chiropody, counselling and home support.  Moreover, a participant in the scheme can chose a private GP or chose a GP who has a contract with the HSE.  With regard to dental services, participants are categorised as high risk/priority patients and are entitled to a greater range of services than those provided under the standard medical card.  The enhanced care provided to them is not limited to services currently available under the Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS) but includes the wider range of services which were available prior to 2010.  In addition, the prescription fee is not be payable for all medicines, medical devices or other medical products that are reimbursed by the community drug schemes.</p></reply>

It is estimated that up to 95% of people&rsquo;s health and social service needs can be met within a primary care setting.</p><p>Significant additional resources have been invested over the past number of years in the State&rsquo;s primary care and disability services with a view to enhancing therapy service provision.  For example, additional funding of &euro;20 million was allocated in 2013 to strengthen primary care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts.  As part of this initiative, the HSE commenced the recruitment of over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams.  This included 52 speech and language therapist posts, all of which have now been filled.  In addition, the HSE has introduced a number of initiatives specifically in relation to speech and language therapy services that are aimed at improving access to these services, such as therapists increasing clinic based work and providing family centred interventions in a group, as opposed to a one-to-one setting, whenever possible.  </p><p>The HSE is also currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multi-disciplinary geographically based teams, as part of its National Programme on Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18 years)<i>.</i>The key objective of this Programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery, with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live, what school they go to or the nature of the individual child&rsquo;s difficulties. </p><p>An additional &euro;4 million was allocated in 2014 to assist in implementing the Progressing Disability Services Programme, equating to approximately 80 additional therapy posts, including speech and language therapist posts.  Further investment of &euro;4 million (equating to &euro;6 million in a full year) has been provided this year to support its ongoing implementation. </p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding is being provided  in 2016 to expand the provision of speech and language therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of speech and language and other therapies under the Progressing Disability Services Programme.  Full implementation of the Programme is expected before the end of 2016.</p><p>The HSE has convened a dedicated Group to examine its current speech and language therapy service provision with a view to enhancing its model of service delivery into the future, based on international best evidence.  This Group is expected to conclude its work in 2016.  The focus of its deliberations will be on ensuring that each child receives the type of speech and language treatment most appropriate to its individual needs.  It should be noted, in this context, that not all children with speech and language impairment require individual clinical treatment sessions; significant outcomes can be achieved by therapists educating parents, families and teachers in how best to support children in learning to speak within their home, pre-school or school environment. </p><p>While close intersectoral collaboration is important the provision of health related therapy supports and interventions such as speech and language therapy is and should remain the responsibility of the health sector.  Therefore the transfer of speech and language therapists employed by the HSE to the Department of Education and Skills as suggested by the Deputy does not arise.</p></reply>

In addition, it is sometimes the case that additional recruitment campaigns are conducted in order to fill specialist posts or posts in specific regional locations.  As nurses form the largest cohort of healthcare staff it is essential that the HSE makes every effort to ensure that appropriate panels are in place and constantly replenished to ensure that as nursing vacancies arise these posts can be filled in a timely manner.  It is common practice within the HSE to operate supplementary panels to ensure that there is an ongoing supply of suitably qualified nurses to meet the service demand.</p></reply>

Under these new arrangements, the approved level of net non-capital determination for the HSE in 2015 was set at &euro;12.135 billion. This approved level of non-capital expenditure was to be supported by the collection of an expected &euro;131 million of outstanding private patient fee income. </p><p>Negotiations are ongoing with private health insurers in relation to reaching agreement on a Memorandum of Understanding which will address this outstanding debt issue by introducing better payment terms and improved cash collection for the HSE.</p><p>The additional measures provided during the course of 2015, not covered by the 2015 Revised Estimate for Health, are as follows:<table><tr><th>-</th><th>&euro;m</th></tr><tr><td>Waiting List Initiative</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td>Emergency Department Overcrowding and Delayed Discharges</td><td>74</td></tr><tr><td>Winter Initiative</td><td>18</td></tr></table></p><p>Earlier this year, agreement was reached with the IMO on a package of measures, including terms for the delivery of GP care without fees for all children under 6 years and the provision of GP care without fees to all persons aged 70 years and over. These represent the first phase in the delivery of a universal GP service. The new under-6 arrangements are effective from 1 July 2015 while the service for all persons aged 70 years and over commenced on 5 August 2015. The additional full year cost for the under-6 arrangements is &euro;67m. There is no additional cost for persons aged 70 and over.</p><p>Whilst it is too early to be definitive on the requirement for Vote 38 in 2015, it is clear that the health sector will require a Supplementary Estimate. The HSE is pro-actively engaged in internal efforts to maximise savings and to ensure that additional measures are identified and safely implemented to mitigate any projected deficits which are within HSE direct control.  My Department continues to work closely with the HSE to ensure that the greatest degree of budgetary control is exercised.</p><p>The amount of supplementary funding required is currently under discussion between my Department, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>The total estimated expenditure for my Department in 2016 and the allocation contained therein to cover the Lansdowne Road Agreements and demographic and other inflationary pressures is set out in the 2016 Expenditure Report published on Budget Day 2016.</p></reply>

This three year project commenced in 2014 and is being led by the Chief Dental Officer. The project includes a needs assessment, a review of resources and involves consultation with stakeholders, including dental professionals and the public. As further results from the FACCT survey are confirmed, they will be considered in the context of the development of the policy.</p>  <p>  Dental services for children up to 16 years of age and persons of all ages with special needs are provided by the HSE. The HSE provides a screening and fissure sealant programme for children at key stages of development. Fissure sealants are a proven effective way of preventing dental caries. The service includes referral for further treatment, including orthodontic treatment, where necessary. Emergency care for children up to 16 years of age and treatment for special needs patients is also provided. Resources have been released in 2015 and into 2016 to improve dental services in areas where there have been difficulties. The HSE is also commencing a pilot scheme for children from 0 to 3 to assess what advice should be given to parents regarding best care of their teeth and to inform future policy. The Department of Health also continues to support a community water fluoridation policy.</p></reply>

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. In the assessment process, the HSE can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.</p>  <p>  A separate reply to the correspondence received will issue this week.</p></reply>

This Regulation aims to increase transparency and availability of information on clinical trials and their results.  A new clinical trials portal and database will be used for submission and maintenance of clinical trial applications and authorisations within the EU and it will serve as the source of public information on all clinical trials conducted in the EU.</p><p>Under this new Regulation the public will be able to access extensive details of each trial including the major characteristics of the trial, the start and end of recruitment, end date of the trial and substantial modifications to the trial.  These details will be made public as they occur starting with the decision on the trial.  </p><p>A summary of results and lay summary will be published 12 months after the end of the trial.  For trials which are part of a marketing authorisation application in the EU, clinical study reports will also be published 30 days after the procedure for granting the marketing authorisation has been completed or the application has been withdrawn.</p><p>The Regulation requires that the database will be publicly available unless an exception applies, for example protection of personal data or protection of commercially confidential information, unless there is an overriding public interest.  </p><p>Rules for the operation of these exemptions are currently being developed by the EMA with input from member state competent authorities, including Ireland's Health Products Regulatory authority (HPRA).</p><p>With particular regard to the Deputy's query on the human papilloma virus (HPV) cervical cancer vaccine, there are 2 authorised HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sub>&reg;</sub>and Cervarix<sub>&reg;</sub>).

Unfortunately it was one of two locations which did not complete the planning process within the time frame for inclusion in the PPP project; the other was Knocklyon-Rathfarnham. </p>  <p>  In the context of the delivery of primary care health services, the Armagh Road location is also known as Cashel Road-Walkinstown.  This project is to be delivered using the operational lease mechanism.  The HSE has signed an agreement for lease with the developer.  This means that the HSE will lease accommodation if the facility is built to specifications and GPs have agreed to locate in the building and deliver health care services from there.</p>  <p>  While the Government's objective is to deliver a high quality, integrated and cost effective health care system the mechanism and timescale for delivery of primary care infrastructure is dependent on a number of factors.  Regardless of the delivery mechanism, all potential primary care infrastructure is subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available to successful planning processes and GP commitment to sharing accommodation and delivering health care services with HSE staff.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to adequate financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.  At this stage it is not possible to give a definitive opening date for these facilities.</p></reply>

The vision for the HSE Disability Services Programme is to contribute to the realisation of a society where people with disabilities are supported, as far as possible, to participate to their full potential in economic and social life, and have access to a range of quality personal social supports and services to enhance their quality of life.  </p><p>The provision of appropriate day placements for young adults with disabilities is a key priority in the HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Operational Plan for 2015.  Each year the HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, young people and their families to identify training needs and explore suitable options for school-leavers and those leaving rehabilitative (lifeskills) training. </p><p>The Government currently provides funding of almost &euro;1.5 billion to the HSE&rsquo;s Disability Services Programme for a range of services, including residential and day services and supports.  Of this amount, &euro;12 million was allocated to meet the full year costs of new day services for school leavers and those graduating from rehabilitative training programmes this year, of which &euro;6 million was made available from September 2015.  An additional &euro;1.5 million has since been added by the HSE to the overall allocation making a total of &euro;13.5 million full year costs available to meet the needs of this cohort of young people.  A further &euro;1.5 million once-off capital funding was also allocated by the HSE for the provision of suitable buildings, premises and accommodation.</p><p>This funding was allocated to Community Healthcare Organisation areas, in line with identified needs, and according to the HSE&rsquo;s policy on day services for adults with a disability.  This policy, which is set out in <i>New Directions - Report on the National Working Group for the Review of HSE funded Adult Day Services</i>proposes that health-funded day services for people with disabilities, including young adults, should be based on the principles of person-centredness, community inclusion, active citizenship and high quality service provision.  </p><p>The HSE is currently in the process of preparing its 2016 National Service Plan and is not in a position to comment on the funding details or quantum of services to be delivered in respect of residential services for people with disabilities in 2016.  However the HSE will continue to seek to maximise the provision of health and personal social services, including residential services and supports, within existing resources.</p></reply>

Their recommendations are based on the prevalence of the relevant disease in Ireland and international best practice in relation to immunisation.  The NIAC guidance is regularly updated and the latest updates including details of local and general adverse events to each vaccine are available on the HSE website.</p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 and 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.  This is done by monitoring both individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe and Periodic Safety Update Reports submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for the vaccine on a regular basis.  The introduction of new vaccines is based on the expert advice of the NIAC.  Decisions on the supply of vaccines into the market are undertaken by specific expert agencies rather than being the responsibility of the Minister of the day.  </p><p>All vaccines are licensed by the HPRA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  No vaccine is or will be licensed by the HPRA and the EMA unless it is has been approved as safe by the Licensing Authority.</p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, with healthcare professionals and patients encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.  All reports received through the online reporting options receive an acknowledgement and case record number on successful submission of a report and further information is provided to reporters in respect of any questions/concerns reflected in their reports, in the context of report follow up.  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the World Health Organisation and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies. </p><p>In the context of monitoring the safety of medicines, new information on a possible risk is called a signal.  Signals of possible, previously unknown adverse reactions or changes in the severity, characteristics or frequency of known adverse reactions may arise from various data sources, including spontaneous reports, clinical trials and epidemiological studies.  Once a signal has been identified, investigations are necessary to confirm and quantify the risk.  These investigations consider the likelihood that a medicine may have caused or contributed to the effect, try to identify risk factors and estimate the frequency of occurrence.  Following the assessment of a safety signal, a decision on the most appropriate regulatory action is taken by the competent authorities.  The regulatory action is communicated to healthcare professionals, patients and the general public through established channels, and timelines reflect the degree of urgency.  The established channels include publications on websites, information provided to patient and healthcare professionals and the media as well as direct mailing to healthcare professionals.</p><p>The HPRA is participating in the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee's (PRAC) review of HPV vaccines to clarify aspects of their safety profile.  As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the PRAC (an EU level drug safety committee) where the HPRA is actively represented and contributes.</p><p>The EMA has commenced a review of the HPV vaccine <i>&quot;to further clarify aspects of their safety profile,&quot;</i>although the agency points out that this review <i>&quot;does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks.&quot;</i>The review is specifically focusing on rare reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, a chronic pain condition affecting the limbs) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS, a condition where the heart rate increases abnormally after sitting or standing up, causing symptoms such as dizziness and fainting, as well as headache, chest pain and weakness).  Reports of these conditions in young women who have received a HPV vaccine have been previously considered during routine safety monitoring by the PRAC but a causal link between them and the vaccines was not established.  Both conditions can occur in non-vaccinated individuals and it is considered important to further review if the number of cases reported with HPV vaccine is greater than would be expected. The outcome of the PRAC review is anticipated before the end of this year.</p><p>As of the 9 October, the HPRA has received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions or events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines.  Of the 921 reports received, 918 were associated with use of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and three were associated with Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>.  This level of reporting for Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>reflects the very positive response to calls for monitoring and reporting of national experience associated with use of the vaccine and the very high level of vaccine uptake, following its introduction into the national immunisation programme which commenced in May 2010.  The vast majority of reports received by the Authority have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information.  The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the disease being treated, a new disease the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  </p><p>Vaccination related events, occurring at the time of vaccine administration, such as syncope (faints) has been among the most commonly reported effects.  Other commonly reported symptoms include gastrointestinal symptoms, malaise, headache, dizziness and injection site reactions.  Reports of allergic-type reactions including skin rashes, urticaria and flushing have also been received, including isolated reports of more severe hypersensitivity-type reactions.</p><p>The EMA has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

Alcohol is causing significant damage across the population, in workplaces and to children in families. It also carries a substantial burden to all in Irish society.  The General Scheme of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill was approved by Government on the 3 February 2015. The Scheme includes provisions for minimum unit pricing, health labelling on products that contain alcohol, restrictions on the advertising and marketing of alcohol and the regulation of sports sponsorship. The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill will also provide for the making of regulations to restrict promotions including price based promotions.  As part of the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the measures were debated in detail by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.  The JOCH report was published in June 2015.  The Department of Health is continuing to work on the preparation of the legislation.  The Bill is due to be published shortly.</p></reply>

For persons availing of public in-patient services, the current public hospital statutory in-patient charge is &euro;75 per night, subject to a maximum of &euro;750 in any twelve consecutive months.</p>  <p>  Section 55 provides that the HSE may provide private in-patient services to persons who are not entitled to, or who do not have or have waived eligibility to public in-patient services. An essential element of the eligibility arrangements is that the public or private status of a patient must be specified on admission to hospital.  Section 55 also provides for the charging of private in-patients. Where a patient elects to be treated privately by a consultant the hospital must treat that patient as a private patient. Persons who opt to be private on admission to hospital are liable for the fees of all consultants involved in his or her care and for hospital charges under Section 55 for that episode of care. The hospital charge applicable depend on the hospital treating the patient and on whether a person is accommodated in a single or multiple occupancy room or on a day case basis. The application of a charge by a hospital for in-patient services is obligatory under the legislation, irrespective of whether the patient occupies a public designated bed or private designated bed, as it relates to the private service provided.</p>  <p>  Should a patient consider that a charge by a hospital for in-patient services has been inappropriately applied, the patient should in the first instance address those concerns to the private health insurer who will address the matter with the hospital concerned.</p></reply>

Any future investment at Beaumont must be considered within the overall acute hospital sector infrastructure programme, and also within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. It must also be considered in the context of the establishment of hospital groups. Each hospital group will be required to develop a strategic plan to describe how it will provide more efficient and effective patient services and reorganise its services to provide optimal care to the populations it serves. </p>  <p>  As part of its 2015 - 2016 winter capacity planning, Beaumont is extending the Day Hospital at St. Joseph's, Raheny from a 2 day to a 5 day service. The Day Hospital provides a multi-disciplinary team for frail older people, thus providing an alternative care pathway for these patients, helping them to avoid ED admission. Rehabilitation and transitional care services are also provided in St. Joseph's, which facilitates earlier discharge from Beaumont and assists in avoiding re-admissions.</p>  <p>  Following the announcement last month of the health capital envelope of &euro;3,061 million for the multi-annual period 2016-2021, the HSE has undertaken preliminary work on the Capital Plan.  This Plan, which requires my approval together with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, will include a schedule of projects to be delivered.  This recently announced capital envelope has increased funding available in the later years of the period and therefore potential scope for additional investment concentrated towards the end of the period.</p></reply>

It has been the practice to offer appointments to patients from other counties in the Saolta Hospital Group region in Galway and this has worked well since the re-organisation of symptomatic breast care services several years ago.  The service in Letterkenny is augmented by surgeons who are based in Galway travelling to Letterkenny General Hospital periodically to carry out clinics there. </p>  <p>  The centralising of triaging of breast cancer referrals for the entire Saolta Group to Galway University Hospital, which commenced in May this year, is consistent with providing a uniform service to patients across the Saolta Hospital Group.

It is difficult to comment on this survey in the absence of further information on the survey methodology and the basis on which comparisons were made as between wait-times in 2010 and in 2015.  </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of primary care and to modernising the scope and content of GP contracts. In this context, the HSE, the Department of Health and the Irish Medical Organisation are currently engaged in a comprehensive review of the General Medical Services (GMS) and other publicly funded health sector contracts involving GPs. This review is taking place within the context of the Framework Agreement which was signed by the above named parties in June 2014.  Among the topics comprehended by the review process is the issue of supports for General Practice in remote rural areas and in urban/deprived areas.</p>  <p>  There are approximately 20 GMS vacancies throughout the country.  This represents less than 0.1 % of all GMS contracts held nationally. Of those vacancies, 10 are in rural areas (i.e. centres with a population less than 1,500).  Without exception, locum arrangements are in place for all vacancies to ensure continuity of services to the relevant communities. </p>  <p>  Over 2,400 GPs currently hold a contract with the HSE under the GMS Scheme compared to some 2,100 GPs in 2009; this is due to an increase in training places in recent years and the elimination of restrictions on access to GMS lists on foot of the Health (General Practitioner Services) Act 2012.

It was estimated that 350 women would apply to the Scheme, but in fact 578 applications have been accepted by the Scheme and as at 23 October 2015, 317 offers have been made.</p><p>Judge Clark has confirmed to my officials that she consults leaders in the fields of obstetrics, gynaecology, orthopaedics, pelvic surgery and radiology to assist her in assessing applications. The consultants concerned are eminently qualified in their respective fields to do this work. As the operation of the Scheme is independent, it is a matter for the Judge to decide what or whose medical expertise is required. The Judge will publish details of these experts in her final report to the Minister, but she is not prepared to have them personally challenged in their role as her advisers at this stage.  </p><p>It may be useful to point out to the Deputy that &ldquo;surgical symphysiotomy&rdquo;<b></b>means a procedure undertaken for obstetric purposes, involving the cutting of the pubic symphysis, which excludes the spontaneous separation of the pubic symphysis during childbirth.The majority of women who applied to the scheme had undergone this procedure and a proportion of that cohort had significant disability as a result of the procedure.  Their awards were either &euro;50,000 or &euro;100,000, depending on the extent of the disability resulting from the procedure.  A further amount of &euro;150,000 is awardable where a symphysiotomy was carried out immediately following caesarean section and caused significant disability. </p><p>A &ldquo;pubiotomy&rdquo; means a procedure undertaken for obstetric purposes, which cuts through the pubic bone.  A very small percentage of the Applicants had undergone this procedure.  Pubiotomy carries an award of &euro;100,000 once the procedure is established and &euro;150,000 if significant disability is established.  </p></reply>

It was estimated that 350 women would apply to the Scheme, but in fact 578 applications have been accepted by the Scheme and as at 23 October 2015, 317 offers have been made.</p>  <p>  The Scheme has brought to an end years of uncertainty and costs for women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy.  The Scheme was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment.  It was set up to give women who do not wish to pursue their cases through the courts an alternative option in which payments are made to women have had a surgical symphysiotomy, whether or not negligence is proven. The Scheme is voluntary and women did not waive their rights to take their cases to court as a precondition to participating in the Scheme. </p>  <p>  In the interest of accountability, the Scheme requires each Applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in order to be considered for the assessment of an award. The level of proof required is clearly set out in the terms of the Scheme.  As the Scheme is designed to be simple, straight forward and non-adversarial, the women are not expected to give oral testimonies as they might do in a court setting.  I understand, however, that Judge Clark, Assessor for the Scheme has met with women in different parts of the country, where she considered it necessary, particularly in cases where women have been unable to locate hospital records.  </p>  <p>  I believe that Judge Clark operates the Scheme in a generous manner within its terms and in accordance with the principles of justice and fairness. </p>  <p>  The Government has given careful and detailed consideration to this complex and sensitive matter.  It believes that the provision of the Scheme, together with the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a comprehensive response to this issue, which should  help bring resolution for the women, many of whom are elderly, and their families.  </p></reply>

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they who face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness. </p>  <p>  It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 94,000 at the beginning of October this year.  This followed the measures announced by Minister Varadkar and I last year, when the "Keane" Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility was published.  The Deputy may be aware that a key recommendation of that report was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.  It also recommended that it is neither feasible nor desirable to list conditions in priority order for medical card eligibility. </p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses. </p>  <p>  On foot of the Keane Report, the HSE established a Clinical Advisory Group to develop clinical oversight and guidance for the operation of a more compassionate and trusted medical card system.  The Director General of the HSE accepted an interim recommendation of the Group to award medical card eligibility to all children under 18 years of age with a diagnosis of cancer, effective from 1 July 2015.  Any child not 18 and who has had a diagnosis of cancer within the preceding 5 years ending 30 June 2015 may be awarded a medical card under the terms of this decision for such period, not to exceed five years, as seems appropriate in the individual circumstances.  The Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions. </p>  <p>  We do not have a universal eligibility system for primary and community health services.  Until we have universal health care and everyone is entitled to health care, one will always have anomalies and injustices.  There will always be somebody who is just above the means threshold, or who does not have the prescribed disease, or whose condition is not sufficiently severe and, as a result, these individuals will not meet the assessment criteria.</p></reply>

In the case of public acute hospital care, a prospective, casemix-adjusted activity based system was recommended.  It has been recommended that the existing &lsquo;per diem&rsquo; charging regime for private activity in public hospitals be replaced by a case-based charge using DRGs.  Taking account of international evidence and of the detailed analysis already undertaken in the context of the above reports it was advised that the Programme for Government commitment on &lsquo;Money Follows the Patient&rsquo; should be realised through the introduction of a prospective Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) case-based payment system.  Since January, 2014 the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) grouping system has been used to facilitate the introduction of a new prospective, case-based funding model for public hospital care called Activity Based Funding (ABF - also known as Money Follows the Patient).  </p><p>Activity Based Funding is being rolled-out on a phased basis and full implementation will take a number of years.  The ABF approach is initially being applied to in-patient and daycase activity in public hospitals.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intention to develop policy proposals for the introduction of a case-based charging system for private patients in public hospitals.  However, it must be acknowledged that given the complexity and breadth of the issues to be examined and addressed, significant preparatory policy work must be undertaken.  This work must take full account of eligibility and legal issues, private income issues and the need for a sustainable mechanism for meeting the cost of private patients in public hospitals.

In accordance with the Disability Act and in the context of Government policy on mainstreaming, every Department has responsibility for disability within its own policy remit.  Responsibility for existing legislation regarding the control of dogs, rests with the Department of Environment and Local Government.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health does not commission the provision or training of assistance/service dogs for children or adults with disabilities and matters relating to specific dog training companies do not come within its remit.  The Health Service Executive's (HSE's) focus is on the protection of core activities such as residential, respite, day and core-therapy provision.  The provision of assistance / service dogs to people with a disability is not considered a core health service and is not prioritised for funding by the HSE.</p></reply>

The conditions covered by the LTI Scheme are as follows: Acute Leukaemia; Mental handicap; Cerebral Palsy; Mental Illness (in a person under 16); Cystic Fibrosis; Multiple Sclerosis; Diabetes Insipidus; Muscular Dystrophies; Diabetes Mellitus; Parkinsonism; Epilepsy; Phenylketonuria; Haemophilia; Spina Bifida; Hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide.  There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the Health Service Executive (HSE), unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.

Suicide prevention in Ireland up to 2014 was guided by <i>Reach Out,</i>the first National suicide prevention strategy.  The National Office for Suicide Prevention was established  in 2005 within the HSE to oversee the implementation, monitoring and coordination of the strategy.  </p><p>Between the years 2007 and 2011, particularly since the onset of the economic downturn in 2008, there was an increase in the suicide rate, specifically among men.The overall increase in suicide in Ireland between these years can be wholly attributed to an increase in the male rate of suicide.  According to official CSO data there were 541 deaths by suicide in 2012.  This represents a 2.35% decrease on the 2011 figures.  Provisional data for 2013 and 2014 suggest a further decreasing trend in the rate of suicide.</p><p>The setting of targets in this area is difficult, however, an interim target to achieve a 10% reduction in suicide by 2010 was agreed around 2009, using the 2005 suicide figure as the baseline.  However, this target was set against the backdrop of an upward trend in suicide from mid-2000.  No further targets were set under the <i>Reach Out</i>strategy.  </p><p>We recognise that the number of deaths by suicide is far too high.  In June, as part of our effort to address this issue, the Government published <i>Connecting for Life</i>&ndash; our new National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015&ndash;2020.  The new Strategy, which has a strong focus on implementation and outcomes to reflect national and international best practice, aims to reduce the level of suicide and achieve a reduced rate of self-harm presentations over its lifetime.  The World Health Organisation target of a 10% reduction in the rates of suicide by 2020, has been adopted as a minimum for the Strategy. </p></reply>

It will also continue to provide a donation clinic for whole blood, platelet apheresis and a service to Haemochromatosis patients.  A therapeutic apheresis service will be provided for patients in Cork hospitals and blood and platelets will continue to be stored and distributed through the Cork Centre.  </p>  <p>  The IBTS has reviewed all aspects of their operations with a view to delivering better value for money, while at the same time ensuring that services are delivered to the highest standards of quality.  This resulted in changes to collection teams, administrative services and laboratory services.  The changes include the closure of the processing laboratory in the Cork Centre on 23 October 2015.     </p>  <p>  The closure of laboratories in Cork will impact directly on a relatively small number of employees.

The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland, has advised that they are not aware of any specific discussions with the Department of Defence in this regard but cannot provide a definitive reply at short notice as there may be correspondence in archived files.  </p>  <p>  In addition, no guidelines for clinical use were provided by my Department, the HSE or the HPRA to the Department of Defence.  </p>  <p>  When any medicine is authorised it is issued with specific approved product information.  This consists of the summary of product characteristics (SmPC), which is the legal licence for that medicine, a package leaflet (PL) and the labelling (outer carton).  An SmPC is a document for healthcare professionals which contains all the known information available about a particular medicine at a given time, including information on how to use that medicine safely.  It is updated on an ongoing basis and at any stage of the life cycle of a medicine whenever new information becomes available about it.  The corresponding document for patients is the package leaflet (PL).  The PL is required to be presented in patient-friendly language and is subject to user testing.  The SmPC and PL for Mefloquine/Lariam are available on the HPRA website.  </p>  <p>  My Department is advised that a medical risk assessment is carried out on an individual basis and there has been no mass issuing of Mefloquine/Lariam by the Defence Forces.  The question of the prescribing procedures followed in the Defence Forces is a matter which should be addressed to the Minister for Defence and I understand that the Minster for Defence addressed this question from the Deputy in responding to parliamentary questions on the 8 October, 2015. </p></reply>

There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.  The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers.  Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.</p><p>While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.  This is done by monitoring both individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe and Periodic Safety Update Reports submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder for the vaccine on a regular basis.</p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.</p><p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has commenced a review of the HPV vaccine <i>&quot;to further clarify aspects of their safety profile,&quot;</i>although the agency points out that this review <i>&quot;does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks.&quot;</i></p><p>The HPRA is participating in the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee's (PRAC) review of HPV vaccines to clarify aspects of their safety profile.  As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the PRAC (an EU level drug safety committee) where the HPRA is actively represented and contributes.</p><p>The current review will look at available data with a focus on rare reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, a chronic pain condition affecting the limbs) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS, a condition where the heart rate increases abnormally after sitting or standing up, causing symptoms such as dizziness and fainting, as well as headache, chest pain and weakness).  Reports of these conditions in young women who have received a HPV vaccine have been previously considered during routine safety monitoring by the PRAC but a causal link between them and the vaccines was not established.  Both conditions can occur in non vaccinated individuals and it is considered important to further review if the number of cases reported with HPV vaccine is greater than would be expected.  The outcome of the PRAC review is anticipated before the end of this year.  </p><p>While the review is ongoing the EMA has advised healthcare professionals that available data does not warrant any change to the use of HPV vaccines.  Healthcare professionals should therefore continue using Gardasil<sup>&reg;</sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>in accordance with the current product information.</p></reply>

"One World, One Future", our policy for international development, clearly articulates the Government's commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  We have consistently stated we would make progress towards the 0.7% target once economic conditions allow.  As our economic recovery now gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can begin to deliver on that commitment.  </p>  <p>  Last month the Government announced the first substantial increase in the aid budget in over seven years.  For 2016, we have provided a total of over &euro;640 million in Official Development Assistance, an increase of &euro;40 million, or almost 7% on the 2015 level. &euro;486 million will be managed by Irish Aid in my Department through Vote 27 International Cooperation.  A further estimated &euro;155 million will be accounted for by allocations to other Government Departments and Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperation budget.  We estimate this level of allocation will result in a projected ODA/GNP percentage of 0.36 % in 2016, a small increase on the 0.35% projected for 2015.  </p>  <p>  The EU&rsquo;s international cooperation and development policy is managed and implemented by the European Commission's Directorate-General for International Cooperation and Development.  In any given year, Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development Cooperating budget is calculated by attributing our percentage share as a Member State to the total EU expenditure on ODA. Based on the increase in the EU Development Cooperation budget which the Commission is forecasting for 2016, and an expected increase in Ireland's percentage share, we project our share for 2016 will be just over &euro;100 million, an increase of &euro;18 million on the 2015 projection.</p></reply>

I have raised this issue with the British Government on a number of occasions, including most recently on 8 October, and have received assurances from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that the British Government is actively considering how it can respond to the D&aacute;il motions.  </p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has also raised this issue with Prime Minister Cameron, most recently on 18 June, emphasising the Government&rsquo;s continued support for the D&aacute;il motions.  </p>  <p>  Cases, such as the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, must be adequately addressed if we are to achieve a genuinely reconciled society.  Successive Irish Governments, in our ongoing bilateral relations and through the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg, have raised the issue of collusion with the British Government.  </p>  <p>  Many families, including those bereaved by incidents in which collusion has been alleged, continue to deal not only with the awful pain of losing a loved one, but with the struggle for answers decades after these traumatic events.  I understand and acknowledge the frustration of families who for too long have had to contend with inadequate mechanisms for addressing their cases.  For that reason, the establishment of a new comprehensive framework for dealing with the past, as envisaged in the Stormont House Agreement, remains a priority of the Government.  We believe that these mechanisms offer the best hope of helping the thousands of families touched by the Troubles &ndash; including those affected by collusion.  </p>  <p>  These institutions will include a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward investigations into Troubles-related deaths, as well as an Independent Commission on Information Retrieval (ICIR) to enable victims and survivors seek and privately receive information about Troubles-related deaths.  Good progress is being made in the current political talks on the establishment of these institutions which I believe will assist all victims, including the victims of collusion, in their quest for justice and the truth.</p></reply>

Unlike the Millennium Development goals, they are universally applicable, and all countries are required to take action to implement them, domestically and internationally.  </p><p>The Inter-Departmental Committee on Development (IDCD) met shortly after the publication of One World One Future. It was clear that Agenda 2030 would provide the context for Ireland's whole-of-government approach to development and this would necessitate a whole-of-government approach to the UN negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda.</p><p>Throughout the UN negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda, which culminated with the Summit in New York, Ireland's approach and positions were agreed through a whole-of-Government coordination process involving all relevant Government Departments.  My Department, together with the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government co-chaired a dedicated inter-departmental coordination mechanism comprising all relevant Government Departments, to ensure a comprehensive Irish position.  This inter-departmental committee met six times including with civil society representatives.  </p><p>With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals by world leaders, we will now focus on developing the most appropriate institutional framework to deliver the new development agenda domestically and internationally.  I have asked officials to review the structure and working of the IDCD to ensure it can deliver effectively on our commitment to policy coherence for development, on the basis that the new development agenda, <i>'Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</i>', requires action across Government.</p></reply>

However, over time most individual banks in Iran were placed under sanctions because of their involvement in efforts to evade the sanctions on the nuclear and military sectors.  For this reason, and because of other specific US sanctions on financial dealings with Iran, many banks in Ireland and other countries became reluctant to engage in business with Iranian banks, including in relation to business activities which were not themselves subject to sanctions.     </p>  <p>  It is important to be clear that these sanctions are still in place. While it is anticipated that, in line with the agreement on the nuclear issue reached in July, the EU sanctions and some of the US sanctions will be removed in the next few months, this has not yet taken place.  So the constraints under which banks were operating still apply.  </p>  <p>  I have strongly welcomed the nuclear agreement with Iran, and like others I hope that this may lead to increased opportunities for Irish trade with Iran.  I hope that Irish banks and other banks in Europe will feel able to provide normal services in support of such trade, once sanctions are removed. But that point has not yet been reached.</p>  <p>  When, as is anticipated, sanctions are removed, it will be for the banks as commercial entities to decide how far and how fast they are willing to re-engage in business with Iran.  My Department will be happy to provide any assistance and encouragement, and a policy of openness and transparency on the part of the Iranian authorities will also be important.</p></reply>

Also in the case of an application for a minor it provides evidence that both parents give consent for a passport to be issued to the child and reduces the risk of abduction.  I am aware of the difficulties which witnessing of forms places on Garda resources and on citizens who do not have a Garda station in their immediate locality.  However this requirement must remain for the moment to mitigate against fraudulent passport applications or identity theft and to maintain the integrity of the Irish Passport for our citizens travelling and residing abroad.  The Passport Service is currently scoping a project to redevelop the passport application process as part of the Passport Reform Programme. It is anticipated that the Garda witnessing requirement for adults renewing their passports will be reviewed as part of this process. The reform programme will also introduce a number of new identity verification and anti-fraud measures to ensure that the integrity of the Irish Passport is maintained. </p></reply>

I would repeat first of all my view that, while security measures to prevent violent attacks may be necessary, an attempt to deal with this crisis just through security measures will not succeed, or will at best gain a short respite only for the trouble to quickly re-emerge.   Secondly, any response must be consistent with international law, including the prohibition on the forcible transfer of individuals and populations, as provided for in Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.</p>  <p>  I would be seriously concerned at any attempt to revoke the residency of East Jerusalemites.</p></reply>

The climate in this region is extremely harsh. Access to basic resources such as food, water, healthcare, housing and education, and opportunities for employment are very limited.  This year, the EU has provided &euro;10 million to improve the living conditions of the Sahrawi refugees. Ireland has raised concerns regarding the situation in Western Sahara on an ongoing basis, including through the Moroccan Embassy in Dublin, and in Geneva at Morocco&rsquo;s Universal Periodic Review at the UN Human Rights Council. Last month, heavy rains and flooding in south western Algeria caused widespread damage to five camps providing shelter to some 90,000 Sahrawi refugees in the Tindouf region. UNHCR is playing a leading role in the humanitarian response to the recent flooding, working with the Sahrawi refugee population, as well as the World Food Programme, UNICEF and other partners. UNHCR and its partners have begun to assist some 25,000 people whose homes and food supplies were damaged or destroyed.  Ireland provides un-earmarked core funding to all of these agencies to allow swift response to crises as they occur.  In addition, the International Federation of the Red Cross plans to allocate approximately &euro;200,000 through its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to assist the Algerian Red Crescent in its work to assist the victims of the floods.<font color="#004080"> </font>My Department provided &euro;1.1 million to the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund this year. I believe that our core support to these agencies, who are well placed to respond rapidly to such crises, is the most effective way in which Ireland can support those affected by these floods.</p></reply>

In such cases, the EU national is regarded as having resided in the island of Ireland for the declared periods for the purposes of the 1956 Act, unless the contrary is proved. These declarations must be supported in passport applications by original documentary evidence that must verify the actual and continuous residence of the parents in question.</p><p>Passport applications for the children concerned were received by the Department last August.

However, recognising the additional workload which the significant increase in passport applications (from 250,000 in 1995 to over 630,000 last year) has put on An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Passport Service is reviewing the witnessing process. The process used to apply for a passport card is serving as a pilot for an online application form.

The political and economic circumstances behind the displacement of millions of people must be addressed, if the flow of migrants is to be managed. The conflict in Syria (which is the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows) has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis. More than 12 million Syrians have been displaced from their homes, of whom over 4 million are refugees in neighbouring countries. The Foreign Affairs Council of 12 October confirmed the EU&rsquo;s commitment to mobilise all appropriate instruments and policies to support efforts to address the root causes of migratory flows, including political instability, poor socio-economic development and poor governance. The Council expressed its support for diplomatic efforts by the United Nations to find solutions to the conflicts in Syria and Libya, major drivers behind the mass displacements of people. The Council also called on the international community to provide greater support to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Programme (WFP) and other programmes and agencies assisting refugees. EU leaders agreed at the 23 September European Council to provide &euro;1 billion in funding to the UNHCR and the WFP. An emergency summit on migration via the Balkans called by the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Junker was held on 25 October. The heads of state of Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia met their counterparts from non-EU states Macedonia and Serbia to discuss the challenges of dealing with the increase in migration along this route. The leaders agreed to a 17-point plan, with the goal of improving co-ordination, including measures aimed at increasing shelter capacities, border registration and naval operations. In addition, an additional 100,000 places in reception centres are to be made available along the route from Greece to Germany, half in Greece and half in the countries to the north  <font color="#004080">.</font></p><p>As part of its efforts to develop a comprehensive strategy, the EU recently organised two high level conferences. On 8 October, a conference focusing on migration flows into the EU through the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route took place in Luxembourg attended by both Justice and Home Affairs and Foreign Ministers. The Conference issued a Declaration endorsing a five-pronged approach to addressing the migration challenge. Next month, an international summit focussing on migration will be held in Valletta. The Summit will bring together EU and African leaders to identify, agree and launch actions to jointly address immediate and long-term migration challenges. </p><p>The EU and its Member States collectively are leading the international response to the refugee crisis. Since 2012, more than &euro;4.2 billion have been mobilised for assistance to Syrians in their country and to refugees who have fled. </p><p>For our part, Ireland has been supporting those affected by the Syria crisis since 2012, and by the end of 2015, our total support for the Syrian people over this period will reach at least &euro;41 million<i>. </i>In addition, a member of Ireland&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps with expertise in water and sanitation issues has been deployed to assist UNHCR&rsquo;s current work in the Balkans. Irish Aid&rsquo;s response to the Syria crisis is our largest effort for a single crisis in recent years.  In addition, our naval service continues to be deployed in the Mediterranean and has to date rescued almost 8,000 people.</p></reply>

Fourteen out of thirty-five Chapters have been opened for negotiation, of which one has been provisionally closed. Progress has been slow, due in part to Turkey&rsquo;s relationship with Cyprus. Ireland takes the view that the accession process is also important to drive forward the country&rsquo;s reform agenda. Following President Erdogan&rsquo;s visit to Brussels on 5 October and Chancellor Merkel&rsquo;s visit to Turkey on 18 October, there has been some discussion about opening new Chapters, in the context of the Joint Action Plan for Turkey. Ireland is open to intensifying engagement on Turkey&rsquo;s accession, but all benchmarks, of course, must be met.

They also involve the clear and persistent abuse of human rights, especially of women and girls.  The abduction in April 2014 of more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok appalled the world.  It has been one of a number of attacks on defenceless young people, seeking to destroy their education and their futures.  I am encouraged by reports that 338 captives, almost all women and children, were rescued last week by the Nigerian army from Boko Haram camps in the Sambisa forest in the north-east of the country.  However, I am dismayed that none of the girls abducted from the school in Chibok has yet been rescued.   The Government has consistently condemned the acts of violence being perpetrated by Boko Haram.   At a meeting convened by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on 30 June and at a Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 1 April, we highlighted the terrible human rights and humanitarian impact of the terrorist violence.  The extent of the humanitarian crisis, including the threat to women and children, has also been emphasised by EU Foreign Ministers at the Foreign Affairs Council on 9 February.  </p>  <p>  The EU has pledged to continue providing immediate relief to those in need and to increase its efforts at a regional level.  Ireland is providing support of nearly &euro;1.4 million this year to address the humanitarian needs of those affected by   Boko Haram activities, including Nigerian refugees in Northern Cameroon.</p>  <p>  It is the responsibility of the Nigerian Government, as well as of its military authorities, to create a secure environment in which the human rights of civilians are promoted and protected, including in those areas affected by Boko Haram.</p>  <p>  The new President of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, was inaugurated on 29 May.  I welcome his comments on the need to address corruption and security threats, including those posed by Boko Haram.  I would again urge the Government of Nigeria to commit the necessary resources to finding the women and girls who are being held hostage so that they can be returned to their families without delay.</p>  <p>  We will continue to monitor the situation through our Embassy in Abuja, which is in regular contact with the Government of Nigeria on developments, and will ensure, with our EU partners, that we maintain the focus on the human rights abuses being perpetrated against innocent civilians, and especially young people, in the region.</p></reply>

This in turn has led to some rise in support for those who are sceptical towards or are in outright opposition to the European project.  This is a concern of all Member States and the EU institutions themselves and is a point which is raised in general discussions at European level.  However, I believe that the majority of Europe&rsquo;s citizens still look to the EU as indispensable to managing common challenges.  It is worth recalling that, despite heightened public criticism of the EU, the European Parliament elections of 2014 returned a substantial majority of pro-EU parties and candidates.  </p>  <p>  It should also be recognised that the scale of the migration crisis, possibly Europe&rsquo;s greatest current challenge, is partly a reflection of the success of the EU.  The EU has evolved to become a beacon of security, stability and prosperity across the European continent, so much so that people are prepared to risk their lives to seek sanctuary here.   </p>  <p>  The European Council, and also the Commission and Parliament, have recognised that we must focus relentlessly on the key issues which affect citizens&rsquo; lives and their futures, and I believe that this is reflected in the policy and legislative priorities the institutions have set for themselves - most recently in the Commission&rsquo;s annual work programme, which was published on 28 October.</p>  <p>  In respect of Irish citizens, it is worth noting that the most recent Euro barometer surveys record 57% of Irish respondents as having a positive image of the EU, as against 12% negative, with 77% reporting that they were optimistic about the future of the Union - the highest percentage of any member state.</p></reply>

We attach great importance to combating all forms of discrimination based on religion or belief and incitement to religious hatred.  We firmly believe in tolerance, non-discrimination, freedom of expression, freedom of thought, conscience, religion or belief.  Ireland is deeply concerned by the persecution of Christians.  I have been shocked by the reports of the brutal killings by ISIS and its affiliates.  These monstrous acts are beyond comprehension and I condemn them in the strongest possible terms.  Ireland has repeatedly recalled the duty of States to protect vulnerable minorities in the Middle East, including Christian communities.  Ireland and the EU consistently press for effective action to counter the persecution of minorities in all relevant international fora, including at the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Human Rights Council, of which Ireland is currently a member. Ireland reiterated its commitment to defending the right to freedom of religion or belief during a UN Security Council debate on the victims of attacks and abuses on ethnic or religious grounds in the Middle East, on 27 March 2015.  I personally highlighted the alarming rise in attacks on Christians when I addressed the UN General Assembly in New York on 1 October 2015 and the UN Human Rights Council at its 28<sup>th</sup>session on 4 March 2015.  I also raised it during my meetings with the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, in September 2014 and May 2015.  On 22 October at the Third Committee at the United Nations General Assembly Ireland presented a statement specifically addressing the importance of freedom of religion or belief at an Interactive Dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief, Professor Heiner Bielefeldt. The statement can be found on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the following address: </p><p>Ireland is active in the negotiation of the EU led draft resolution on Freedom of Religion or Belief in the Third Committee.  Ireland works within and alongside the EU to address<i></i>the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, notably with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief adopted during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013. These Guidelines provide EU officials with an overview of the legal and policy framework within which the right to freedom of religion or belief is protected. They also elaborate an EU strategy on how to engage with third countries on the right to freedom of religion or belief, a strategy which we hope to see bear fruit as we assess the implementation of the Guidelines.</p><p>On 20 July 2015, the EU Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) adopted the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy 2015-2019. The Action Plan forms part of the EU Strategic Framework and Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy which was adopted by the FAC in June 2012.  Its purpose is to improve the effectiveness and consistency of the EU&rsquo;s policy and commits the EU to promoting human rights in all areas of its external action. Responsibility for the implementation of the Action Plan is shared between the EEAS, European Commission and EU Member States.</p><p>Within the EU, Ireland pressed for the promotion of freedom of religion or belief to be included in the Action Plan, and this is now reflected as a stand-alone point with the following actions:</p><p>Ensure that freedom of religion or belief remains high on the agenda of relations with third countries, as well as in multilateral fora, in close cooperation with relevant stakeholders; promote the exchange of best practices, and deepen awareness on the various components of freedom of religion or belief at Headquarters, EU delegations and Member State embassies.</p><p>Encourage and support relevant partner countries and other stakeholders&rsquo; initiatives on freedom of religion or belief in particular those aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to religious minorities, enabling them to manifest their religion or belief without fear of violence, discrimination, political pressure, censorship or persecution.</p><p>Promote inter-cultural and inter-religious dialogue and the role of religious and other leaders in ensuring freedom of religion or belief.</p><p>Together with the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Religion or Belief, the Action Plan will strengthen the EU&rsquo;s co-ordinated response to persecution based on religion or belief throughout the world.</p><p>Ireland will also continue to raise the issue of the persecution of Christians, through its official bilateral contacts with the countries in question, stressing the responsibility of the government to protect all citizens and minorities, irrespective of their religion or belief.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that Ireland will continue to actively support freedom of religion or belief across our foreign policy.</p></reply>

While the majority of Irish services and merchandise exports go to Europe and the US and we must continue to cultivate these markets, the Government is strongly focused on the further development of trading partnerships with other important emerging markets.</p>  <p>  &ldquo;Trading and investing in a Smart Economy 2010-2015&rdquo;, the Government Trade, Tourism and Investment Strategy, runs to the end of 2015.  Under this Strategy, a number of new actions were initiated.  For example, the Export Trade Council (ETC), which I chair, was established, as were Local Market Teams chaired by our Ambassadors in priority markets.  The ETC oversees the implementation of the Strategy and facilitates the close coordination of Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and education promotion overseas. </p>  <p>  On a successor to the current Strategy, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through the ETC, has initiated a scoping exercise with other government Departments, State agencies and private sector members, to consider possible future approaches in the trade, tourism, investment and education areas. There is a widespread view that a full consideration of the successor Strategy would most appropriately be taken forward next year. </p>  <p>  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has opened new diplomatic missions in recent years across South East Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. Irish Embassies and Consulates provide a platform abroad for the promotion of Ireland as a business, investment, tourism and education destination. </p>  <p>  The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day period of course offers us a unique opportunity to promote greater awareness of Ireland in general and Irish trade links in particular. During the 2015 St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day celebrations, trade, tourism and investment in Ireland were promoted at 148 dedicated business events, attended by almost 18,000 Irish and international company representatives. </p>  <p>  In November, my Department will host the fourth Global Irish Economic Forum in Dublin.  Many of those attending are members of the Global Irish Network.  This Network works closely with the Government and State agencies in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s economic, cultural and tourism messages in key markets. </p>  <p>  Both at home and abroad, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continues to work in cooperation with other Government Departments in promoting Ireland&rsquo;s trade, tourism, investment and education efforts. In addition to supporting the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine&rsquo;s 2025 Agri-Food Strategy, my Department is also closely involved in the implementation of the International Financial Services Strategy, launched in March this year. </p></reply>

Almost 60 million people are now displaced globally, half of them children, and the great majority of them living in situations of conflict. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response focuses on the most severe crises, especially protracted and forgotten emergencies. The core objective of our assistance is to save and protect lives, alleviate suffering and maintain human dignity, before, during and in the aftermath of such crises.  Ireland's humanitarian response is focused on where needs are greatest and is underpinned by a strong commitment to the humanitarian principles of independence, neutrality, impartiality and humanity, and to respect fundamental human rights. </p>  <p>  Ireland is committed to working with a range of partners including non-governmental and UN organisations, and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.  These partners have the experience and capacity to deliver assistance to the most vulnerable communities in times of crisis and stress. </p>  <p>  Four crises, in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and South Sudan, are classified by the UN as &lsquo;level 3&rsquo; emergencies, the most severe, large-scale humanitarian crises.  These four crises are expected to remain at this level in 2016.  They are all complex crises in conflict situations which have resulted in significant internal displacement, food insecurity, rising malnutrition levels and human rights abuses.  In addition to responding to these severe crises, Ireland has provided humanitarian assistance in a number of major crises in Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and across the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, including Somalia and Ethiopia. </p>  <p>  Last year, we dedicated &euro;85 million in providing lifesaving humanitarian assistance to vulnerable people across the world and we expect to surpass that figure in 2015.</p>  <p>  On 2 July, I addressed the first ever Irish Humanitarian Summit, which took place in UCD and was opened by President Higgins.  One of the key themes which emerged was the importance of serving the needs of people affected by conflict.  Ireland will continue to highlight this issue in the lead up to the World Humanitarian Summit, an initiative of the UN Secretary General, which will be held in Istanbul in May 2016. </p></reply>

The key to resolving the conflict remains the comprehensive implementation of the Minsk Agreements.  This requires a genuine and complete ceasefire, the removal of heavy weapons and progress on the political track, including arrangements for local elections in eastern Ukraine, the withdrawal of all foreign forces and equipment from Ukraine and the restoration of Ukrainian control over its border with Russia.  There has been some progress in recent weeks.  The security situation has improved considerably with a very significant reduction in violence. Heavy and light weaponry have begun to be withdrawn from the contact line in accordance with an agreed schedule.  These developments have facilitated progress on the political track.  At the Normandy Format (France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine) Heads of State Summit in Paris on 2 October, a broad agenda for progress was agreed.  While this progress is welcome, other key elements of the Minsk Agreements need to be implemented. It is incumbent on all sides to do everything in their power to ensure the full implementation of the Agreements. In this regard, the EU is playing an important role in advancing the political process with a view to securing a stable, lasting peace in Ukraine. </p>  <p>  It is expected that Ukraine and other Eastern Partner countries will be discussed at the next EU Foreign Affairs Council.</p></reply>

The key focus of our extensive engagement on this complex and sensitive case remains securing this citizen&rsquo;s best interests in so far as we can, working to see him released by the Egyptian authorities at the earliest possible opportunity and providing consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention.  I have had numerous discussions with my Egyptian counterpart about this case.  I and my officials have extensive contact with the Egyptian Ambassador here in Dublin, and there has been ongoing contact between our Ambassador and Embassy in Cairo and the Egyptian authorities. The Taoiseach has also raised this case with the Egyptian President, and discussed it with him in person recently in New York. We are also in extensive contact with other international partners who have had citizens in similar situations. The information we receive from all of these contacts is carefully considered and used in reviewing our approach to this case on a constant basis.  I have also raised it with the EU and have been in direct contact with HRVP Mogherini on this case, as well as with her predecessor Baroness Catherine Ashton. I would also note that<font color="#004080"> </font>Embassy officials visited this citizen in detention most recently on 1 November 2015.  This exceptional level of action has been taken by the Government and by my Department because of the very exceptional nature of this case &ndash; he was a minor at the time of his arrest and the group nature of his trial gives rise to particular concerns.</p><p>We will continue to take all appropriate action that we believe to be in the best interests of this citizen. However, the reality is that any decision to release this citizen will ultimately be taken by the Egyptian authorities, not by us. </p><p>Given that the trial is ongoing, the Government has to be extremely careful to ensure that its actions, both public and private, are well judged and do not detract from our key goal of securing positive progress for this citizen at the earliest possible time.

The Egyptian authorities are in no doubt about our position. We await the Judge&rsquo;s ruling on the most recent application we have supported. While the further adjournment of the trial on 4 October was a disappointment to us all, above all for this citizen, the Government's considered view remains that the firm, measured and sustained diplomatic approach we are taking continues to be in his best interest and represents<font color="#004080"> </font>the best hope to achieve his return to Ireland at the earliest possible date.  </p></reply>

The circular states that capitation funding provided for general running costs and funding provided for caretaking and secretarial services may be regarded as a common grant from which the Board of Management can allocate according to its own priorities.</p>  <p>  Where a school uses the grant funding to employ a Caretaker and/or Secretary, such staff are employees of the individual school.  The Department therefore does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged.  These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school management, subject of course to any relevant statutory provisions.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, it was recently agreed that my Department would engage with the union side in relation to issues around the pay of Secretaries and Caretakers.  The parties have now entered an arbitration process conducted by the Labour Relations Commission.  The Deputy will appreciate that as the arbitration process is ongoing, it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this time.</p></reply>

In this context, the government established a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector.  The Forum advised  on how the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none and also advised on the practicalities of transferring/divesting patronage for individual primary schools where it is appropriate and necessary.  Arising from the work of the Forum, eight new primary schools have opened under the patronage divesting process and work is continuing to advance choices in other identified areas.  I intend to meet with the Catholic bishops in order to re-invigorate the patronage divestment process.</p>  <p>  New schools are established to meet demographic need. In the past ten years the total pupil enrolment in first and second level schools has risen by almost 100,000 pupils.  Enrolment levels are still rising annually at both levels and are projected to rise by some 44,000 pupils in 2018/19 compared with current levels.  This level of increase has meant that the available financial resources have to be prioritised towards ensuring that every child has access to a physical school place.  It is simply not practical for every student to be provided with access to a place in a school operated by a patron of their choice.  The new school establishment arrangements introduced in 2011 place a strong emphasis on parental choice.  In any area identified as requiring a new school it is open to all patron/prospective patron bodies to make application for patronage under the patronage determination process.

Once the requirement is established, my Department then conducts a process to allow for different patrons/bodies to be considered as the patron of the new school.  A school patron has significant responsible duties which relate to the whole school community including students, teachers, parents and the wider community served by the school.  A prospective school patron therefore needs to be able to demonstrate sufficient structure, continuity and reliability to conduct the responsible functions of patron in an ongoing way.  For a group that is not a statutory body and wishes to be established as patron of a school, the group needs to establish itself as a corporate entity or as some other acceptable legal entity.  In this process the group should articulate its educational philosophy and educational objectives in the memorandum and articles of association.  The group should name three members as directors/trustees.  Among the other requirements is that the applicant patron should have charitable status.  Meeting these requirements in themselves  does not confer any automatic right to become a patron of a new school.  The awarding of patronage of new schools is governed by a patronage determination process and all applicants must comply with published mandatory requirements and criteria under that process.  Full details of that process are published on my Department's website.</p></reply>

We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect pupil teacher ratios.  Between this year and last year this has involved an increase of around 2,300 teachers in our primary and post-primary schools.  This is a very significant investment at a time of scarce resources.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that I have made provision in Budget 2016 for some 2,260 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year.  These posts will provide for an improvement in the staffing schedules at primary and post primary levels, enhance the leadership and management roles of deputy principals at post-primary level by reducing their teaching time, an improvement to the scheme of release time for principal teachers at primary level and additional resource posts to meet special education needs.</p>  <p>  At primary level, teaching principals may take a certain number of days release time in a school year in order to assist them fulfilling their principal duties.  Under these arrangements, my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal.  Under the current arrangements the number of principal release days ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school. Budget 2016 will increase those days to range between 15 and 25 days, effective from the start of the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  Economic constraints and the moratorium on recruitment albeit alleviated to some extent for schools, have presented challenges within the education sector. They also provide an opportunity to review the role of the principal so that our principals are leaders of learning, and to reconfigure the middle management structure to support principals in their role, ensuring ownership of responsibility rather than tasks, thereby building expertise and supporting a career path within the profession.</p>  <p>  The Department, in consultation with the representative management bodies has commenced an exploration of the opportunities to support and thereby advance our understanding of the needs of school leaders and how they might be addressed.</p></reply>

Budget decisions since 2009 have reduced significantly the number of language support posts provided to schools.  Arising from these decisions new arrangements (rule based allocations and appeal process) were put in place in recent years for the allocation of language support to schools. Prior to the 2012/2013 school year, these posts were allocated on a temporary basis by way of applications by individual schools.</p>  <p>  Reforms introduced in the 2012/13 school year created a single simplified allocation process for both learning and language support. At primary level, learning/language support hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school.  At post-primary level, learning/language support is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school.</p>  <p>  The new arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.</p>  <p>  Further additional temporary support is also provided, as necessary, to schools that have high concentrations of pupils that require language (EAL) support.  At primary level, these allocations are made on the basis of appeals by any of these schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  Where at least 20% of the total enrolment of the school is made up of pupils that require EAL support, the school may lodge an appeal with the Appeals Board.  Having considered the circumstances outlined by the school and having regard to the high number of pupils requiring EAL support, additional post(s) may be approved by the Appeals Board.</p>  <p> I will arrange for the information sought by the Deputy in relation to post numbers to be forwarded to him separately.</p></reply>

Work is continuing on implementing the Action Plan arising from this Forum, including advancing the patronage divesting process.</p>  <p>  In addition to divesting, in those areas where there is a demographic need for new schools, the arrangements introduced in 2011 place a strong emphasis on parental choice.

In the past ten years the total pupil enrolment in first and second level schools has risen by almost 100,000 pupils.  Enrolment levels are still rising annually at both levels and are projected to rise by some 44,000 pupils in 2018/19 compared with current levels.  This level of increase has meant that the available financial resources have to be prioritised towards ensuring that every child has access to a physical school place. It is simply not practical for every student to be provided with access to a place in a school operated by a patron of their choice. The new school establishment arrangements introduced in 2011 place a strong emphasis on parental choice. In any area identified as requiring a new school it is open to all patron/prospective patron bodies to make application for patronage under the patronage determination process.  Since 2011, 42 new school have opened (24  primary and 18 post-primary). 39 of these schools have a multi-denominational ethos.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government gives a commitment to move towards a more pluralist system of patronage for our schools. In this context, a Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector was established to look at how schools could cater for diversity and ensure an inclusive environment for all their pupils. Work is continuing on implementing the Action Plan arising from this Forum.  One of the outcomes of the Forum was the initiation of a school patronage divesting process at primary level. This  process has the aim of creating  greater choice for parents in areas of stable population growth by re-configuring existing provision where there is not a demographic need for new school provision. To date, eight new primary schools have opened (seven of which are under the patronage of Educate Together) and work is continuing to advance choices in the other identified areas. However, more needs to be done.

These EAL allocations are made on the basis of appeals by schools to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board, using projected enrolment for the following September.  </p>  <p>  The school referred to by the Deputy submitted an appeal under the EAL criterion to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board. The Board upheld the appeal subject to the school achieving its projected enrolments on 30 September 2015.</p>  <p>  As the projected enrolment was subsequently not achieved, the temporary EAL post was withdrawn. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.</p></reply>

It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2015/16 school year by 18 March 2015. The NCSE also continued to accept applications after this date in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has published details of SNA allocations for schools for September 2015 on its website www.ncse.ie. Details of SNA allocations for 2014/15 are also available on the NCSE website.</p>  <p>  The website indicates that the school in question had an allocation of 24 whole time equivalent (WTE) SNA posts in the 2014/15 school year, increasing to 28 WTE posts for the 2015/16 school year. </p>  <p>  I understand that the NCSE has recently visited the school on foot of correspondence received from the school in relation to its SNA allocation. I have been advised that the NCSE will be in further contact with the school in this regard shortly.</p>  <p>  All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

Differentiation should be based on the outcomes of teaching and learning and should ensure that all students are sufficiently challenged and can experience success at their particular level.</p>  <p>  Students/pupils with special educational needs (SEN) for example should be fully included within PE lessons and challenged to achieve to the best of their ability.  Some mixed schools occasionally offer separate PE activities for boys and girls in some year groups, particularly at senior cycle in post-primary schools where more independent learning opportunities are often provided.  But streaming on the basis of ability rarely takes place and is not part of DES policy.</p>  <p>  With regard to school teams which are extra-curricular etc., then there can be 'streaming' of sorts.  A school might have two teams entered in a school sports competition for a similar age group, for example, one of whom might be at a higher standard than the other.</p>  <p>  There is considerable international research regarding a phenomenon known variously as the 'relative-age effect' or the 'birthdate' effect which suggests that physical activity should group children with regard to their developmental age rather than their chronological age as there can be a wide disparity in physical size, for example, between two 11 year-old girls or two 13 year-old boys depending on whether they are pre or post puberty.

The approach taken is sometimes described as a "college of professionals" approach.  In the first instance, a group of people who are deemed to have an expert knowledge of what the students in the target audience ought to be able to achieve in the subject concerned reach a consensus regarding the content standards of the syllabus.  This is achieved through the various committees in the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA).  Following on this, these content standards are then put into effect as a set of performance standards by the State Examinations Commission (SEC).  Once these performance standards have been tested, reviewed and fully established, the SEC, in accordance with its Establishment Order, then endeavours to ensure that the standards remain consistent over time.</p>  <p>  As part of its remit the SEC is charged with maintaining standards year on year and it endeavours to achieve this by the processes it has in place for the preparation of examination papers and other test items, and by the quality assurance procedures it implements at the examining and appeal stages of the state examinations.</p>  <p>  All of the SEC's examinations are prepared in accordance with the principles outlined in the document, The Preparation of Test Items &ndash; Principles and Protocol, available on its website at www.examinations.ie.  Similarly, all examinations are assessed in accordance with the key assessment principles of validity and reliability.</p>  <p>  In order to maintain standards, the Chief Examiner for each examination takes all necessary steps to ensure that the examination paper, the marking scheme and its application combine to ensure that established standard are maintained.</p>  <p>  Standards of achievement of large cohorts of students do not radically change in the space of a year.  A certain amount of variation from year to year may happen, and a gradual change in the pattern of grades may occur over time, provided the subject experts involved are satisfied that it reflects real changes in achievement.  Furthermore, syllabus change and other deliberate interventions may impact on grade patterns, as may changes to the size or composition of the cohort.</p>  <p>  The examinations are marked by examiners, (generally experienced teachers in the subject), who work under the overall direction and management of the Chief Examiner for the subject.  Examiners normally mark scripts from a number of schools.  Examiners do not know either the region or the schools from which the papers they mark are drawn.  They have sight only of examination centre numbers and candidate numbers, thus maintaining the anonymity of the system.  There are no 'quotas' applied to the number of grades, including E, F and NG, coming from any examination centre or indeed from the overall batch of scripts allocated to any examiner or the cohort generally.</p>  <p>  The marking process is overseen by a team consisting of the Chief Examiner, a Chief Advising Examiner and a number of Advising Examiners, who monitor and advise the examiners in their work.  The Chief Examiner and the advisory team test the draft marking scheme at a two day pre-conference.  During the pre-conference, the draft marking scheme is also considered in the light of commentary and correspondence from teachers, professional bodies and other interested parties, before being applied to exemplars of candidates' work.</p>  <p>  All examiners attend at a training conference prior to commencing the marking.  The training process involves the use of exemplars of candidates' work both for standardising purposes and for purposes of training examiners in the consistent application of the marking scheme.  Random sampling is conducted in the early stages of the marking which serves to assist in the appropriate adjustment, clarification and refinement of the marking scheme as well as an initial quality assurance on the work of examiners.  If the grade distribution differs substantially from the established norm, this is interrogated to determine the underlying factors and where appropriate adjustments may be made to the marking scheme before the full marking process executes.  Once the marking scheme has been finalised, the marking proceeds, subject to rigorous ongoing monitoring of the process.</p>  <p>  Ongoing and systematic monitoring is a critical element of the marking process.  The monitoring is designed to enable each examiner to apply the agreed marking scheme consistently and accurately to all scripts.  A minimum of 5% of the scripts, marked by each examiner, is monitored by Advising Examiners during the course of the marking.  As a consequence of this examiners who are found to be off-standard are required to remark all scripts that had been marked to that point.  This may result in grade changes.  Advising Examiners are also available to the examiners for consultation and advice throughout the marking period.</p>  <p>  The marking schemes in each Leaving Certificate subject are published shortly after the issue of the examination results and in advance of the viewing of their scripts by candidates.  These are issued to all schools and are available to download from the SEC's website.  The Junior Certificate marking schemes are published on the website.</p>  <p>  A formal appeals process is provided by the State Examinations Commission.  It is open to every candidate to appeal the result awarded in any particular subject.  The appeals system involves a sophisticated combination of measures.  Candidates are provided with the option to view the marked scripts and are also provided with the facility to comment on the marking through a dedicated form.  Appealed scripts are re-marked in accordance with the same standard as applied in the initial marking, and the same marking scheme as utilised in the initial marking.  Candidates may also view the appealed script after the appeal marking.</p>  <p>  Quality assurance measures are in place at each stage of the appeal process to ensure that the marking scheme is applied fairly to the work of each candidate. If a candidate is still dissatisfied with the result after the appeals marking has concluded, he/she has recourse to a review by the Independent Appeals Scrutineers and beyond that to the Ombudsman.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment.</p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  I note that the Deputy did not identify the school that the child, the subject of the question, is currently attending and so it is not possible for me to speak to her specific identified needs.  I would advise therefore that her parents be advised to raise their concerns with the school Principal with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist</p></reply>

These projections are published on my Department's website.  My Department is currently reviewing the latest nationwide demographic data to assess where further additional provision may be required at primary level.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, earlier indicative figures of the cost of providing for demographics were set out in an analytical paper compiled by the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service and published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the context of Budget 2013.  The link to this paper is at the following address: .  I understand that an updated version of this paper will shortly be completed by that Department.</p><p>This paper calculated the impact of demographics in terms of teacher numbers in schools and of the cost of capitation grant payments.  It estimated additional costs in this regard of some &euro;207 million arising between 2016 and 2021.  In addition to these costs, there would also be impacts on other areas such as special needs expenditure, school transport and student grants.  Demographic pressures will also create pressures on school accommodation and consequent pressure for capital investment.  Much, however, will depend in this regard on the location and distribution of the additional pupil numbers.</p><p>In November 2011 under the Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework a total over &euro;2.2 billion was allocated to the Education sector of which over &euro;2 billion was assigned to the schools sector (Primary and Post-Primary).  In addition to large scale projects, this allocation also provided for permanent classrooms under the devolved Additional Accommodation and Prefab Replacement Schemes where smaller sized projects are capable of addressing increased enrolment numbers.</p><p>Significant capital funding will be invested in the education system through the Government's &euro;27bn capital programme announced on 29 September last.  Over the next six years some &euro;3.8bn in direct funding will be invested in education projects.  An additional &euro;200m in PPP funding over the lifetime of the capital programme will result in more than &euro;4bn in public investment.  It is planned to announce the large-scale projects to be advanced over the period 2016 to 2021 shortly.</p></reply>

Under this Framework the re-employment of retired staff should only occur in very limited exceptional circumstances and in these cases the salaries offered may not exceed 20% of the full-time salary of the post of the individual at the time of their retirement, adjusted to reflect the application of Government pay policy in the period since their date of retirement &ndash; including in particular the application of salary adjustments imposed under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.  Any such proposed arrangements must be notified in advance to the Higher Education Authority.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2015, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that the existing ECFs and associated moratoriums would be lifted and replaced with a system of delegated sanction for recruiting and promoting up to Principal Officer level, subject to adherence by Departments to binding 3 year pay ceilings and ongoing compliance with Workforce Planning requirements.  In light of this announcement a new ECF for the higher education sector will be put in place shortly, however, it is expected that much of the basic principles of the existing ECF will remain.</p></reply>

The Bill will also enshrine in law a ban on schools charging parents to apply for a place in school.</p>  <p>  The Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, provides for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.  The Bill also requires schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.</p>  <p>  The Bill seeks to strike an appropriate balance between school autonomy and the interests of parents in our education system.  This can be achieved through regulations that foster greater transparency and consistency in terms of how schools communicate and interact with parents.  To that end the Bill sets out clearly matters relating to enrolment that regulations may address.  The regulations have not been finalised; following enactment of the Bill, the draft regulations will be updated and published for consultation with the relevant education partners.</p></reply>

It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the specifics of any individual case.  Under the Act, enforcement of PRTB determination orders is a discretionary power and the Board exercises this power taking account of the circumstances pertaining to each case.  While there is no legal obligation on the PRTB to enforce, the Board takes the issue of non-compliance with determination orders very seriously.  In 2014 alone it referred 402 cases to its legal advisors for enforcement proceedings.  It is also open to parties to pursue enforcement independently through the Courts, including the seeking of a garnishee order.  It should be noted that going to Court does not of itself ensure successful enforcement and, more particularly, recoupment of an award.  In many cases the best option, and one which the PRTB facilitates, is for the parties to agree a schedule of payments.</p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2012 will amend the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 to provide, inter alia, for the introduction of a new procedure to enforce a tenant&rsquo;s obligation under section 86 of the 2004 Act to pay rent pending the determination of a dispute.  This will allow the PRTB to deal effectively and quickly with tenants who do not comply with their statutory obligation to pay rent during the dispute process.  The Bill has passed all stages in the D&aacute;il, together with second stage in the Seanad and will return to the Seanad for Committee Stage shortly.</p></reply>

The LCDP was implemented until March 2015 pending the roll out of SICAP in April 2015.</p><p>The objective of SICAP is to reduce poverty, promote social inclusion and support equality through local, regional and national engagement and collaboration.  SICAP is being overseen and managed by the Local Community Development Committees (LCDCs) in each Local Authority area.  The programme&rsquo;s target groups are children and families from disadvantaged areas, lone parents, new communities (including refugees and asylum seekers), people living in disadvantaged communities, people with disabilities, Roma, the unemployed (including those not on the Live Register), Travellers, young unemployed people from disadvantaged areas and young people (aged 15-24) who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs).</p><p>SICAP is one of my Department&rsquo;s key priorities and is operating for a 9 month period for 2015, with funding of &euro;28 million.  This includes an allocation of &euro;2 million under the European Structural Funds (ESF) Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning (PEIL) 2014-2020 and &euro;2 million under the Youth Employment Initiative.</p><p>The amount of SICAP funding for the Wicklow area was calculated using the Resource Allocation Model (RAM).  The RAM , underpinned by the Pobal/HAASE Deprivation Index, which is used in relation to allocations, allows funds to be allocated in a manner which means that a disadvantaged person in any area of the country will have equality of resources available to their areas to support their needs.  In relation to the Deputy&rsquo;s query regarding funding that has been provided to Wicklow, including West Wicklow over the last three years, LCDP allocations are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th><b>Allocation</b></th><th><b>2012</b></th><th><b>2013</b></th><th><b>2014</b></th><th><b>2015</b><br /><br /><b>Jan to March</b></th></tr><tr><td>Bray Partnership </td><td>943,239 </td><td>839,483 </td><td>818,496 </td><td>191,323 </td></tr><tr><td>County Wicklow Community Partnership </td><td>628,695 </td><td>584,686 </td><td>584,686 </td><td>136,670 </td></tr></table></p><p>It should be noted that under SICAP, Wicklow&rsquo;s Local Community Development Committeehas been allocated &euro;972,584 in 2015 to support the community services which the Deputy refers to.</p><p>In addition to the funding above, the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme for 2014-2020 will provide &euro;6.3 million for the Wicklow sub-regional area.  There is a specific focus on social inclusion under LEADER for the 20 14-20 20programme period and LEADER local action groups are currently working on local development strategies that will identify, in a community led way, the priorities for the funding over the next number of years.</p></reply>

EHS was one of the potential health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF) examined by an Expert Group Report commissioned by the Government and published in March 2007. The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion was that no adverse short or long-term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). There is specific reference to EHS in the Report which concludes, at page 35, that EHS has no scientific basis to link its symptoms to EMF exposure. This remains my Department&rsquo;s position based on the considerable scientific evidence available.</p><p>The report, entitled <i>Health Effects of Electromagnetic Fields</i>, is available for download on my Department&rsquo;s website at: </p><p>.</p><p>A substantial volume of research is being carried out internationally by bodies with responsibility for monitoring the health effects of electromagnetic fields, including the European Commission&rsquo;s Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR). This Committee published a <i>Final Opinion on Potential Health Effects of Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields</i>in January 2015, updating its previous opinions from 2009 and taking account of the many studies undertaken in the intervening years. In relation to EMF hypersensitivity, the Final Opinion stated &ldquo;Concerning EMF hypersensitivity research consistently shows that there is no causal link between self-reported symptoms and EMF exposure.&rdquo;</p><p>My Department will continue to monitor the extensive international research on the issue which continues to be undertaken in this area by bodies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p></reply>

The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks. Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum in many areas.  The implementation of the HAP scheme is a key Government priority and a major pillar of the Social Housing Strategy. Local Authorities and the Department of Social Protection are working closely together in order to ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.</p>  <p>  In the circumstances described where an individual is at risk of homelessness, both Exceptional Needs Payments and Rent Supplement Payments available under the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme, can be utilised. While, in general, Rent Supplement is paid once an assessment of housing need has been completed, Exceptional Needs Payments are made on an entirely discretionary basis.</p>  <p>  Questions in relation to payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance Scheme are a matter for my colleague the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.   </p></reply>

One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme. Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers. </p><p>The provision requiring that mortgage protection insurance is held by mortgage holders is contained in the Consumer Credit Act 1995. This legislation is the responsibility of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. </p><p>In terms of comparison to other schemes of mortgage protection, it is important to note that it covers disability as well as death and that the disability cover is for the full period of the disability and not just 12 months as is the case in the majority of MPI policies available.</p><p>The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided. In negotiating a renewal of the scheme, which came into effect from 1 January 2012, the Committee were able to harness the downward pressure on pricing in the economy and secure an average 19% reduction on the rate which applied to the previous scheme. As part of the upcoming re-tendering process, the Committee will seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017, the most appropriate Mortgage Protection Insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.</p></reply>

The instruments at the monitoring stations calculate hourly average values for each pollutant. These values are picked up by the telemetry system at between one minute and thirty five minutes past the hour.  The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are conducted for the purpose of assessment and management of air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of air quality in Ireland, and monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network. </p><p>Under the CAFE Directive, EU Member States must designate &quot; zones&quot;  for the purpose of assessing and managing air quality.  The EPA, as the competent authority for the implementation of the Directive in Ireland, designated four zones which were originally designated in the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011.  The zones were subsequently amended on 1 January 2013 to take account of population counts from the 2011 Census. </p><p>The main areas defined in each Irish zone are:</p><p>- Zone A: Dublin</p><p>- Zone B: Cork</p><p>- Zone C: Other cities and large towns, including Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Drogheda, Dundalk, Bray, Navan, Ennis, Tralee, Kilkenny, Carlow, Naas, Sligo, Newbridge, Mullingar, Wexford, Letterkenny, Athlone, Celbridge, Clonmel, Balbriggan, Greystones, Leixlip and Portlaoise.</p><p>- Zone D: Rural Ireland, i.e. the remainder of the State excluding Zones A, B and C.</p><p>Upper and lower assessment thresholds are prescribed in the legislation for a number of pollutants. Within each zone, air quality is assessed and classified with respect to these thresholds, based on measurements over the previous five years. The results of this assessment help to inform decisions on the extent of monitoring. The greatest monitoring effort applies where concentrations are above the upper assessment threshold, i.e. where they approach or exceed the limit value. Where concentrations are between the two thresholds, less intensive measurement combined with other assessment methods, such as air quality modelling, will generally suffice. Monitoring sites are located in accordance with CAF&Eacute; Directive requirements. </p><p>The EPA also publishes an annual report on air quality, based primarily on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.  The most recent report, <i>Air Quality in Ireland 2014 - Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality</i>, was published in October 2015 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2014, compared to the CAFE Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health. That report indicates that Ireland currently meets all EU standards for air quality but exceeds WHO air quality guidelines for particulate matter in some areas. </p></reply>

My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure that there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.</p>  <p>  Following the recent tragic loss of life in Carrickmines, my Department&rsquo;s National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management is leading a Programme to Review Fire Safety in Traveller Accommodation. The objective of the review is to take immediate action to ensure that practical and appropriate fire safety measures, which can contribute to preventing loss of life and serious injury in local authority Traveller accommodation, have been applied systematically across the country. This will include community fire safety initiatives.   Initial steps have been taken to identify the key issues and consultations with stakeholders at both national and local level, including Traveller Representative Groups, have taken place. </p>  <p>  Practical solutions to the issues that are identified through this engagement will be developed on a collaborative basis over the coming weeks. This collaborative approach will ensure that the review is carried out in a consistent and coordinated manner.  The programme to review and enhance fire safety in Traveller accommodation will be rolled out nationally over the coming months and is anticipated to be concluded by the end of Quarter 1, 2016.   As well as the enhancements that I hope will already be in place at that stage, it will identify or propose further actions to sustain fire safety which will be given appropriate consideration by relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  As provided for under sections 21 and 22 of the  aforementioned Act, each local authority has in place a Local Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee (LTACC) . The role of the LTACC is to advise local authorities on the provision and management of accommodation for Travellers, and to provide a liaison between Travellers and Members and officials of the appointing authority concerned.   At least one quarter of the membership of the LTACC must comprise local Travellers and Traveller groups, with the remaining members comprising elected members and officials of the housing authority. I see the role of these local committees as crucial to resolving local issues , including health and safety issues on sites. </p></reply>

The regional approach is considered more effective as it brings a more strategic perspective to bear on action to address homelessness, including avoidance of over-concentration of homelessness services in certain centres and promoting appropriate regional availability of services, consistent with need. Funding has been allocated to housing authorities over the past three years on the basis of established patterns of expenditure while my Department engages with housing authorities on an on - going basis with regard to the needs of the various regions.  Details of the Exchequer funding provided under section 10 of the Housing Act 1988 for the years 2013 and 2014 , and allocated for 2015 , by my Department to housing authorities towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services are as follows:</p>  <p>  - 2013  - &euro;45,000,000</p>  <p>  - 2014  - &euro;49,205,774</p>  <p>  - 2015  - &euro;52,849,125 (allocation)</p>  <p>  As confirmed in the Budget 2016 announcement, I have secured funding of &euro;70 million for homeless services in 2016, which is an increase of approximately 32% on the 2015 allocation.

Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities and, under section 10 funding arrangements, responsibility for rigorous assessment, appraisal and decision-making in relation to the need for, and funding, of particular services rests with the Management Group of the region led by the lead housing authority.  In this regard, housing authorities enter into Service Level Agreements with non-governmental service providers in respect of required services.   </p></reply>

An exemption from the Local Property Tax applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013. The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities utilising the categorisation employed for the purposes of the National Housing Survey 2012. The survey was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency. Only developments that were deemed by local authorities to be in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo;, regardless of whether a developer was on or off site, were included in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013.The Government has taken a number of significant steps to address the issue of Unfinished Housing Developments. In particular, the development of Site Resolution Plans (SRPs), agreed between residents, developers, funders and local authority personnel for the finalisation of works on site to render estates as habitable as possible, has been pivotal in resolving a large number of estates. In the 2014 National Housing Survey, of the 1,263 estates inspected, there were 587 in some stage of SRPs. Specifically, 270 were agreed and ready for implementation, 230 had commenced while 87 had been completed. I believe that a continuation of this collaborative approach serves the best interests of all concerned and is an effective tool in the resolution process. The 2015 National Housing Survey is being finalised and will illustrate further progress in resolving unfinished housing developments.</p><p>To assist further in addressing the legacy of unfinished housing developments, Budget 2014 contained a special provision, in the form of a targeted &euro;10 million Special Resolution Fund (SRF). The SRF is designed to encourage the resolution of the remaining tranche of unfinished developments identified in the National Housing Development Survey 2013 and, particularly, those developments not likely to be resolved in the normal way through solely developer/owner/funder action because of the presence of specific financial barriers. The SRF was particularly targeted to address the remaining unfinished developments with residents living in them and, in particular, any developments that local authorities identified, for the purposes of the Local Property Tax exemption, as in a seriously problematic condition. </p><p>On 2 May 2014, SRF allocations to 86 housing developments across the country were announced. Further information is available at the following weblink:</p><p>.</p><p>This public investment aimed to leverage an additional &euro;12 million from third parties (developers/lenders/bonds) which will be invested in these estates. The SRF has enabled very substantial progress to be made in resolving as many of the remaining unfinished developments as possible.</p></reply>

Such insurance providers are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland .My Department has no function in relation to this aspect of the matter .For consumers such products have the advantage of providing direct recourse from the insurer when problems arise rather than having to rely on the insurances of the builder/developer or other parties.</p><p>The <i>Construction</i><i>2020</i>strategy includes a commitment to consider the potential for latent defects insurance (LDI) as a form of recourse for consumers when faced with serious construction defects.My Department has given the matter some consideration in consultation with the Department of Finance and a number of industry bodies.</p><p>It is important to note that key reforms to the arrangements in place for the control of building activity introduced in recent years are leading to market conditions more conducive to insurers and a wider availability and use of latent defects insurance , including - </p><p>(i)S.I.

No. 9 of 2014 in order to provide a common platform for clear and consistent administration of building control matters across the local authority sector. The system facilitates a risk analysis of all projects for which commencement notices are received, which will inform each building control authority&rsquo;s own inspection arrangements thus ensuring that available inspection resources are used to optimum effect.</p><p>(iii)  A voluntary register of builders and contractors known as Construction Industry Register Ireland or CIRI is now in place and will be placed on a statutory footing in the near future. </p><p>All of the above measures ensure a greater emphasis on competence, professionalism and quality in our construction industry into the future and impose a new order and discipline on the execution of construction projects ,thereby reducing risk within the construction sector. </p><p>In this context, my Department welcomes the current focus by industry on promoting and supporting more widespread use of LDI . There are no plans at this time to introduce a mandatory LDI requirement for all new residential projects but my Department will keep the matter under review in the light of ongoing developments within the construction industry in general and in relation to construction insurance products in particular .</p></reply>

It is intended to have the first 150 units delivered as quickly as possible in the Dublin City Council administrative area, with the City Council acting as the contracting authority. The City Council expects the delivery of an initial 22 units by December,  with a further 128 units to follow by late Quarter 1 2016 through a fast-tracked procurement process.  A further 350 units will then be provided across the four local authorities in the Dublin region through a national procurement framework overseen by the Office for Government Procurement, with expected construction on sites by mid-2016.  As with any form of development, the development of modular housing units must comply with all regulatory obligations including building control and fire safety requirements .   </p>  <p>  This programme of modular housing provision is being implemented to mitigate the issues associated with an increasing volume of homeless families accommodated in inappropriate commercial hotel arrangements. These units will provide emergency accommodation in the first instance, with each unit providing accommodation for a single household at a given time. While the placement of individual households in these units is intended to be on a temporary basis, such placements will offer a greater level of stability than is possible in hotel accommodation, while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured. Furthermore, such arrangements will facilitate more coordinated needs assessment and support planning for access to all required services, including welfare, health and housing services.   </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin the role of housing authorities in addressing homelessness at local level. Statutory responsibility in relation to the provision of accommodation and related services for homeless persons rests with individual housing authorities. Accordingly, it will be a matter for the relevant housing authorities to determine what ancillary services may be required  . </p></reply>

My Department has met with representatives from ITWRA on a number of occasions this year. During these meetings, all aspects of the regulation of Tyres and Waste Tyres and the changes which are proposed were discussed. In addition to this, my Department also arranged for certain suggestions made by ITWRA to be examined and discussed directly with Repak ELT which will be the sole compliance scheme for the tyre sector.  In addition to these contacts, my Department has continued to copy ITWRA on all correspondence from the Tyres Working Group. A further meeting of the Working Group will be held on 11 November, to which ITWRA have been invited to attend.

Irish Water is being funded by a combination of domestic and non-domestic water charges, Government support and the raising of debt on capital markets.Irish Water is a regulated utility and its operating and capital plans are reviewed by the Commission for Energy Regulation, which approves an &ldquo;allowed revenue&rdquo; to end 2016-this represents the total costs (including depreciation and the return on capital employed) which Irish Water can recover from customer&rsquo;s bills, taking account of Government subvention. The annual average operational costs in the period 2015 and 2016 under the regulatory model are estimated at &euro;750m. It might be noted that some costs, such as the first fix programme amounting to around &euro;30m per annum are capitalised within the regulatory model, but are treated as operational costs under the relevant accounting rules. Details of Irish Water&rsquo;s proposed costs are outlined in their revenue and water charges plan which was reviewed by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER). Details of the review and the CER&rsquo;s decision are available at . </p><p>In relation to the period prior to 2014, information in relation to the annual spend by local authorities is outlined each year in the local authority's Annual Financial Statement. It should be noted that this expenditure included costs associated with non-public water services e.g. group water schemes, and in some cases other services such as surface water drainage, flood alleviation etc. which remain the responsibility of local authorities as these functions have not transferred to Irish Water. </p></reply>

These targets were issued in the context of the Social Housing Strategy 2020, which provides a comprehensive response to the need for social housing and targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme.

Galway City Council and Galway County Council have a combined target of 1,126 units, supported by &euro;58.5m of investment, broken down as follows:<table><tr><th></th><th>Local Authority Housing/ <br /><br />AHB delivery via CAS/ <br /><br />Return of vacant properties</th><th></th><th>Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme</th><th></th><th>Rental Accommodation Scheme </th></tr><tr><td></td><td>2015-1 7 </td><td>2015 </td><td>2016/7 </td><td>2015 </td><td>2016/7 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway City Council </td><td>136 </td><td>90 </td><td>251 </td><td>20 </td><td>21 </td></tr><tr><td>Galway County Council </td><td>144 </td><td>80 </td><td>230 </td><td>80 </td><td>74 </td></tr></table></p><p>The detailed implementation of the programmes and projects to deliver on these targets is a matter for each individual local authority, but I am confident that good progress is being made in their achievement. When the targets were announced, it was indicated that the funding would support the refurbishment of vacant social housing units and support local authorities in both building and acquiring housing. Subsequently, I announced new social housing construction projects to the value of approximately half a billion euros, including 155 new units for the Galway local authorities at a cost estimate of &euro;25 million. Details are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>Given the time-lag between approval and delivery in terms of construction projects, a successful programme to remediate vacant units, as well as the acquisition by local authorities of properties through turn-key developments and other purchases, are important parts of social housing delivery this year. The Galway authorities inform me they aim to deliver around 70 new acquisitions this year, while I am providing funding support to them to return 90 vacant social housing units to productive use.</p><p>Information on social housing units constructed and acquired in respect of all local authorities is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>The projects and programmes to deliver new social housing are being advanced strongly by local authorities. To date this year, investment in the broad range of initiatives under my Department&rsquo;s social housing current and capital programmes by both Galway authorities is &euro;8.6 million.

These targets were issued in the context of the <i>Social Housing Strategy 2020</i>, which provides a comprehensive response to the need for social housing and targets the provision of over 110,000 social housing units to 2020, through the delivery of 35,000 new social housing units and meeting the housing needs of some 75,000 households through the Housing Assistance Payment and Rental Accommodation Scheme.  The targets are for the period out to 2017 and the available funding is being invested in a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes by the local authorities, designed to accommodate 25% of those currently on the housing waiting lists. The target and provisional funding allocation in respect of Tipperary County Council was 832 units and &euro;57.1 million; targets in respect of all local authorities are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>When the targets were announced, it was indicated that the funding would support the refurbishment of vacant social housing units and support local authorities in both building and acquiring housing. Subsequently, I announced new social housing construction projects to the value of approximately half a billion euros, details of which are on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: </p><p>.</p><p>These included projects targeting 72 new units at a cost of over &euro;10.5 million for Tipperary County Council at Gortnahoe, Cloughjordan, Templemore and Thurles. These are now being progressed through the various stages of planning and design by the Council.</p><p>With a target of 287 units under the Capital Programme of the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>to the end of 2017, I am pleased that Tipperary County Council are projected to have 146 units delivered by the end of 2015, or over 50% of their capital target delivered just one year into a 3 year, capital-intensive programme of housing provision. This means that Tipperary County Council are well ahead of their capital target for delivery of social housing units with the funding I have provided. </p><p>To the end of September 2015, under the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (previously known as the leasing initiative), Tipperary County Council has delivered 330 social housing units and drawn down over &euro;4 million; this includes 31 units delivered in 2015 and over &euro;80,000 in expenditure drawdown. It should be borne in mind that current expenditure is on-going for the length of the agreements entered into by the local authority. Expenditure under the Rental Accommodation Scheme by Tipperary County Council in 2015 exceeded &euro;5 million up to the end of September, with a delivery of 74 transfers out of their target of 100. The Housing Assistance Payment scheme has been operational in Tipperary County Council since 29 June 2015 and to date, 115 households are being supported.</p><p>The detailed implementation of the programmes and projects to deliver on the targets that have been set is a matter for each individual local authority. However I am confident that by utilising all delivery mechanisms under these programmes, local authorities will continue to deliver on the social housing targets for 2015, in line with the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>. </p></reply>

This will see the establishment of a new sustainable waste management system for tyres and waste tyres which will stop the leakage of waste tyres and ensure that they are disposed of in a proper environmental manner. This new full Producer Responsibility Initiative, which mirrors the arrangements for the collection, storage and disposal of tyres and waste tyres in the majority of EU countries, should contribute to a decrease in the fly tipping of waste tyres.As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed.The results of this examination were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:</p><p>-a non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,</p><p>-a lack of consistent and accurate data,</p><p>-that the current system was not tracking data flows well, and</p><p>-between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping .</p><p>Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.</p><p>The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Both organisations have long and successful track records under existing producer responsibility arrangements in the packaging, battery and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ( WEEE ) areas and have been instrumental in making Ireland a top EU performer in these waste streams. </p></reply>

In order for a household to qualify for social housing support, a housing authority must carry out an assessment to establish whether the household meets specified eligibility requirements and has a housing need. One of the housing need criteria prescribed in the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 is that the household has a mortgage that is deemed to be unsustainable under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process. Qualification under this criterion is not dependent on the making of a possession order as my Department has advised housing authorities that, upon receipt of written confirmation from the lender that a household&rsquo;s mortgage has been deemed unsustainable, an authority may consider the household to have a housing need, even though the household may, at that time, remain the legal owners of the dwelling concerned.</p>  <p>  Under the Housing Act 1988 it is a matter for the local authority to determine whether a person is homeless. A homeless household is not required to undergo a social housing assessment in order to be placed in temporary accommodation which the housing authority may arrange itself or which may be operated by a State funded service provider. </p>  <p>  Section 63(3) of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that, subject to law, a local authority is independent in the performance of its functions. Section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 specifically provides that the Minister&rsquo;s power to issue policy directions and guidelines to housing authorities in relation to their housing functions shall not be construed as enabling the Minister to exercise any power or control in relation to any individual case with which a housing authority is or may be concerned.  While I am, therefore, precluded from intervening in relation to individual cases, I would recommend that the person concerned maintain contact with the relevant local authority, and ensure the authority is kept informed of all relevant information pertaining to the case.   </p></reply>

If the required improvement did not happen, it was made clear to the tyre industry that the system would be reviewed and replaced with a full Producer Responsibility Initiative (PRI) model.    As part of a wider review of producer responsibility arrangements completed in 2014, the structural and environmental effectiveness of all aspects of the current system for managing waste tyres was assessed. The results of this examination were stark. The report, published for consultation in November 2013 and in final form in April 2014, found:</p>  <p>  - A non-compliance rate with the Tyre Regulations of 46%,</p>  <p>  - A lack of consistent and accurate data,</p>  <p>  - That the current system was not tracking data flows well, and</p>  <p>  - Between 25% and 50% of waste tyres were not accounted for with widespread illegal dumping .     </p>  <p>Following extensive discussions with the tyre industry, I announced my decision to establish a full PRI scheme for Tyres and Waste Tyres in Ireland on 30 January 2015. Since my decision, significant progress has been made in discussions with the tyre industry.   </p>  <p>  The new scheme will be operated by Repak with a registration and reporting role for the WEEE Register Society. Both organisations have long and successful track records under existing producer responsibility arrangements in the packaging, battery and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) areas and have been instrumental in making Ireland a top EU performer in these waste streams. </p>  <p>  Operators based in other jurisdictions but bringing tyres onto the Irish market or distance sellers will have exactly the same obligations as any operator based in Ireland so the suggestion that operators based outside the jurisdiction will have a competitive advantage over their Irish counterparts is unfounded. The distance seller approach has been very successfully used under existing arrangements for distance sellers of electrical and electronic equipment. </p>  <p>  There will be no new tyre tax under the new system.  Consumers already pay a disposal fee to their tyre retailer whenever they buy a new tyre. The model that I am proposing will formalise a charge that tyre retailers already apply but which does not currently go towards the cost of managing the waste in all cases, as it is supposed to.  It is absolutely right and fair to provide a system that ensures it is properly directed in the future so that the consumer does not pay twice: once at the point of purchase and again when the taxpayer has to meet costs incurred by local authorities for the clean-up of illegally dumped tyres. </p>  <p>  My Department is proceeding with the introduction of a full PRI scheme for tyres which mirrors those arrangements which are in place in 20 other Member States and which from the outset will, I am confident, enjoy the full support of all members of the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers Association who make up approximately 50% of the Irish tyre market.  The tyre working group that I established last year continues to operate and will be tasked now with the detailed design of the scheme based around the overarching principles that have been announced. The scheme will respect the producer responsibility approach and be based on the polluter pays principle. </p></reply>

Rents for houses were 6.4% higher, while apartment rents were 7.6% higher than in the same quarter of 2014.  These annual rates of increase were driven mainly by the Dublin market.  Overall, in the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 9.2% in Dublin (with house rents up by 8.8% and apartment rents higher by 9.4%).  Annual growth in rents for the market outside Dublin was more subdued.  In the 12 months to the end of Q2 2015, rents were higher by 5.8% (with house rents up by 5.8% and apartment rents higher by 5.9%).</p><p>A shortage of supply is at the heart of rising rents and the Government is addressing this on a number of fronts.  <i>Construction 2020: A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector</i>, published last year, is aimed at addressing issues in the property and construction sectors and ensuring that any bottlenecks that might impede the sector in meeting residential and non-residential demand are addressed.  Social housing has been prioritised by this Government and over &euro;1.7 billion in Exchequer and self-funding was allocated to the Social Housing Strategy between the 2015 and 2016 budgets, to support the provision of over 33,000 units.  The Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan goes beyond 2016 and commits &euro;2.9 billion in capital funding towards social housing out to 2021.</p><p>Ultimately, the key to addressing upward pressure on rents is through increasing the supply of housing, which is a core focus of the Government&rsquo;s <i>Construction 2020</i>strategy.  In 2014 the number of house completions was 11,016 units nationally, an increase of 33% on the 2013 figure.  The latest figures for new house completions show that 8,914 units were completed to the end of September 2015, up 14% on the corresponding figure for 2014.  As announced in Budget 2016, NAMA is aiming to deliver a target of 20,000 residential units before the end of 2020, with 90% of these units to be in the greater Dublin area.</p><p>In addition to these measures, I am continuing to work on proposals to address the issue of rising rents.  The price of rental property, particularly in the greater Dublin area, presents a serious challenge.  The regulation of rent, however, raises many complex economic and legal issues and I have to be satisfied that any measures proposed are balanced and have the desired effect on the rental market while being fair to landlords and tenants alike.  Ultimately, any decision in relation to this issue is a matter for Government and it is my intention to bring final proposals to Government for decision as soon as possible.</p></reply>

As a long-term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP.  Any household with an identified housing need, including a homeless household, is eligible for HAP.  Once in receipt of HAP, a household&rsquo;s housing needs are considered to be met.     </p>  <p>  I have issued a statutory direction to the local authorities involved in the HAP statutory pilot, instructing them to take the necessary steps to ensure that households benefiting from HAP can avail of a move to other forms of social housing support, should they wish to do so, through the transfer option.  I have also directed that HAP recipients, who apply to go on the transfer list, should get full credit for the time they spent on the waiting list and be placed on the transfer list with no less favourable terms than if they had remained on the waiting list. </p>  <p>  The statutory pilot for the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme commenced in September 2014 and has been introduced incrementally to 15 local authority areas to date - Limerick City and County Council, Waterford City and County Council, Cork, Louth, Kilkenny, South Dublin, Monaghan, Donegal, Offaly, Carlow, Clare and Tipperary County Councils, and Cork City Council.  Kildare and Meath County Councils commenced HAP on 2 November 2015, and Galway, Mayo and Sligo County Councils will introduce the scheme from 16 November 2015.   </p>  <p>  The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.   </p>  <p>  In recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) (No. 4) Regulations 2015, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare County Council with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in the neighbouring Dublin area.  In recognition of the need for additional discretion in areas of high rental demand, and similar to the flexibility I have already provided for the operation of HAP in South Dublin County Council, these regulations provide for an additional 20% flexibility above the maximum rent limits that apply for the purposes of HAP in the administrative areas of Cork City Council, Cork County Council, Galway County Council, Kildare County Council and Meath County Council.  This additional flexibility will facilitate a greater number of qualifying households to source suitable accommodation in these local authority areas.   </p>  <p>  This approach mirrors the approach already taken by the Department of Social Protection in the operation of the discretion available in the context of the Rent Supplement scheme.  My Department is preparing guidance for the relevant local authorities in the appropriate use of this increased flexibility.  I will continue to keep HAP rent limits under review.   </p></reply>

As a long-term housing support, an assessment of housing need must be completed in order for a household to qualify for HAP.  Any household with an identified housing need is eligible for HAP. The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provide that subject to conditions, a housing authority shall deal with such an application within a period of 12 weeks.  Local authorities will prioritise housing needs assessments for those in greatest need and average waiting times are significantly shorter that the statutory maximum in many areas.To be eligible for HAP, a person must first apply for and be approved for social housing support by the relevant local authority.</p><p>Under the HAP scheme, eligible households source their own accommodation in the private rented sector, payments are made electronically directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the tenancy agreement is between the HAP recipient and the private landlord.  Accordingly, the tenancy will be covered under the terms of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 and the landlord must register the tenancy with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) as part of a landlord&rsquo;s terms and conditions under the scheme.</p><p>HAP also provides for the transfer of responsibility for long-term recipients of rent supplement who have a recognised housing need from the Department of Social Protection to the local authority sector, thus bringing all long-term social housing supports provided by the State together under the local authority system. Upon its introduction in a local authority area, HAP will replace rent supplement for those with a long-term housing need and who qualify for social housing support; rent supplement will no longer be an option for applicants in such cases.  Local authorities are taking an incremental approach to the transfer of recipients from Rent Supplement to HAP in their own areas.  This involves close co-operation with local DSP offices and individual tenants.  To date, over 4,500 households are being supported by HAP where the scheme is operational; 1,623 of these households have transferred from the Rent Supplement scheme.</p><p>The maximum rent limits for different household classes that apply in each local authority where HAP has been commenced are set out in regulations and are generally based on the Rent Supplement limits as set out by the Department of Social Protection (DSP).  In prescribing these limits, household size and prevailing rents in the relevant areas are taken into consideration.  My Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection and monitors data which it gathers, along with PRTB data, and data gathered through HAP pilot authorities, in relation to the rent limits applying.</p><p>In recognition of the need for greater flexibility in the challenging Dublin region rental market, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I have signed the Housing Assistance Payment (Amendment) (No.4) Regulations 2015, which provide for the introduction of HAP in Kildare and Meath County Councils with maximum rent limits equivalent to current Rent Supplement rates applicable in the neighbouring Dublin areas.

This approach mirrors and is informed by the approach already taken by the Department of Social Protection in the operation of the discretion available in the context of the Rent Supplement scheme.  This increased flexibility will assist a greater number of qualified households, including those already in tenancies and those in receipt of increased Rent Supplement payments, secure and maintain suitable accommodation under the scheme.  My Department will provide guidance for the relevant local authorities in the appropriate use of this increased flexibility.  This matter will be kept under active review in all HAP pilot authority areas.</p><p>Limerick City and County Council is currently providing a highly effective transactional shared service on behalf of all HAP local authorities on an interim basis. The shared service &ldquo;hub&rdquo; currently manages all HAP related rental transactions for the tenant, local authority and landlord.  Once a HAP application has been received and confirmed as valid by the relevant Local Authority, it is then processed in the transactional hub.  Any rental payment arising for a given month will then be made to a landlord on the last Wednesday of that month.  HAP rental payments are payable to the landlord from the date of confirmation of receipt of a valid and complete application form.</p></reply>

Under the ESD, EU-wide emissions in the year 2013 should be no more than the average of those same emissions in the years 2008 to 2010. Emissions in those three years were on average 4.5% below emissions in 2005. In the year 2020, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005. This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg. The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020.  Taking account of methodological changes underpinning the GHG emissions inventories and projections (in line with evolutions in the accounting rules under the Kyoto Protocol second commitment period), the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA) published in May 2015 new annual emission limits and projected emissions for 2020 compared to our target. These calculations and projections indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions in 2020 could be in the range of 9-14% below 2005 levels by 2020. However, even in the worst case scenario (i.e., a 9% reduction), Ireland could be very close to meeting its cumulative compliance obligations for the period 2013-2020 (ESD 2009), which on average required a 12% reduction relative to 2005, given over-compliance in the early years of the 8-year period.</p><p>Furthermore, in October 2014, the European Council agreed on the 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the European Union. The European Council endorsed a binding EU target of an at least 40% domestic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. The target will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible, with the reductions in the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and non-ETS sectorsamounting to 43% and 30% , respectively , by 2030 compared to 2005.</p><p>All Member States within the Union will participate in this effort, balancing considerations of fairness and solidarity. While Member State targets for 2030 are yet to be agreed, it is known that targets will be in the range of a 0% to 40% reduction relative to 2005, and that targets for Member States whose GDP per capita is above average should be adjusted to reflect cost effectiveness in a fair and balanced manner. A Commission proposal on this matter is expected towards the end of the second quarter of 2016.</p><p>The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU commitments, is well understood by Government, as reflected in the <i>National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development</i>, published in April 2014, and in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>, recently passed by the D&aacute;il and currently at Committee Stage in the Seanad. The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Proposed statutory authority for the plans is set out in the <i>Climate Action and Low-Carbon Development Bill 2015</i>.</p><p>In anticipation of enactment of the planned legislation, work is already underway on developing a low carbon plan, the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. In this context, key sectors in the low carbon transition process (electricity, transport, built environment and agriculture) are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.</p><p>To ensure a continued transparent and inclusive process, the <i>Strategic Environmental</i><i>Assessment Scoping Report on the National Mitigation Plan</i>is currently out for consultation to both the general public and statutory consultees and the input received from these consultations will further inform the SEA process.</p></reply>

Lottery funding is a limited resource utilised across a range of Government Departments and Agencies. National Lottery funding channelled through my Department&rsquo;s Vote currently supports a wide range of other worthy causes, including community groups and voluntary organisations. National Lottery funding is also distributed by other Departments to groups working in areas such as disability, health and sport.</p><p>It is important to note that should National Lottery funding be re-allocated to the natural environment, corresponding reductions would be required in other areas which are currently in receipt of such funding, within my own Department and also potentially within other beneficiary Departments. Accordingly, re-allocation of funding to support the natural environment at the expense of one or more of these other sectors can only be undertaken following careful consideration. However, I intend to keep this matter under review as the budgetary situation improves in the years ahead.</p><p>In taking this view, I am conscious that the natural environment, uniquely amongst the broad range of areas funded by my Department, also receives funding from the Environment Fund, which was established under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001. The Environment Fund comprises revenues from the environmental levy on the supply of plastic bags, collected by the Revenue Commissioners, and the environmental levy on the landfilling of waste, collected by local authorities. The Fund is used for activities or initiatives in a range of areas such as, <i>inter alia, </i>schemes to prevent/reduce waste and waste recovery activities; research &amp;amp; development into waste management; support of education and training and promotion of awareness of the need to protect the environment, including national and regional campaigns; and environmental protection initiatives undertaken by community groups and others.</p><p>From 2011 to 2014, in excess of &euro;255 million was disbursed to the environment sector from the Environment Fund. This is in addition to some &euro;146 million provided to the environment sector by way of Exchequer Voted expenditure by my Department. In 2015, I made Fund allocations totalling &euro;825,000 to the Irish Environmental Network and the Environmental Pillar. The total allocations from the Fund in 2015 amount to in the region of &euro;44 million.</p></reply>

The scenario outlined by the Deputy would likely be considered as a Class 1 development which relates to &ldquo;the provision of a house&rdquo;. Under Class 1, a planning application fee of &euro;65 per house would apply.</p>  <p>  While the Planning Regulations are generally kept under review in my Department, I do not consider planning application fees to be unduly onerous. Indeed, the fees have not been revised since their introduction in 2000 and represent very good value for money in the context of the administrative cost of processing planning applications. In this context, account should also be taken of the various technical inputs and site inspections required in assessing planning applications generally. In addition, the consideration of planning applications has become more complex for local authorities in recent years in the light of more onerous EU and national legislative requirements, as well as requirements in relation to public participation in the planning process generally.</p>  <p>  I believe that the planning fees applied in respect of residential development in particular are fair and reasonable, and are relatively modest in comparison to the overall cost of preparing planning application drawings and particulars and I do not consider them unduly onerous or a disincentive to residential development. I have no plans to revise the planning fee provisions at this time.</p></reply>

My Department issued revised guidelines to local authorities for dealing with mortgage arrears within the local authority sector in June 2014. <i>Dealing with Mortgage Arrears &ndash; A Guide for Local Authorities</i>is available on my Department&rsquo;s website by clicking on the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>Extending the term of the mortgage to a maximum of 35 years and a maximum borrower age of 70, depending on the type of loan, the remaining term and the circumstances of the individual borrower, as well as adding arrears and interest to the principal amount due at the interest rate applicable to the parent mortgage, are long term resolutions available to borrowers in mortgage arrears distress. In addition, a Mortgage to Rent scheme, specifically for local authority mortgage borrowers, is also available as part of the MARP arrangements.</p><p>In cases of acute mortgage arrears distress, all homeowners also have the option of seeking to avail of the legal process now also in place to deal with personal insolvency. The most important step any family in arrears can take is to engage early with the Arrears Support Unit of the local authority. Solutions are available and advice should be sought as early as possible.</p></reply>

All Local Authority affordable housing schemes were stood down in 2011.</p>  <p>  In order to prevent short-term profit taking on the resale of the house to the detriment of the objectives of the schemes, houses sold to first time buyers under the various affordable housing schemes, at a significant discount from market value, contain a clawback provision. However, where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result. A breach of contract conditions would be a matter for a local authority to pursue as it considers appropriate given the particular circumstances involved.</p>  <p>  The State provides a wide range of supports to assist households in meeting their housing need ranging from income support and rent supplement, provided through the Department of Social Protection, to social housing supports provided by my Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies.</p>  <p>  In order for a household to qualify for social housing support, a housing authority must carry out an assessment to establish whether the household meets specified eligibility requirements and has a housing need.  The housing need criteria, as prescribed in the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 include a requirement to have regard to whether the applicant&rsquo;s current accommodation is overcrowded within the meaning of Section 63 of the Housing Act 1966. The allocation of social housing supports to qualifying households is a matter for each housing authority in accordance with its allocation scheme made under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.</p></reply>

I am advised by IFI that its early intervention in this issue has primarily concentrated on its core statutory responsibilities as regards the protection conservation, development and promotion of the inland fisheries resource. </p>  <p>  IFI, together with the ESB undertook work to reduce the threat of further spread from angling activity and equipment. This was completed promptly and, with appropriate bio-security measures in place for anglers, the fishery was re-opened. IFI also contributed to the organisation of an international angling competition at Lanesborough aimed at showcasing the reopened fishery. It is understood, however, that the main potential vectors as regards spread of the species are outside the remit of IFI. </p>  <p>  IFI also engaged, as a groundwork measure, in a scientific survey in the Lanesborough area which sets out many of the physiognomies of the species. </p>  <p>  It would appear that the statutory remit in this matter rests with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and it is clear that a multi-agency response to the substantive issue is required, with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), as the body with a statutory remit, in the lead. I have agreed with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, who has responsibility for NPWS, to continue working collaboratively on this issue. </p>  <p>  My officials have again formally contacted the officials in NPWS to support a collective multi-agency approach and officials will meet shortly to discuss. IFI has confirmed to me that it is ready and willing to participate in a multi-agency group and to contribute any expertise it has in this regard. </p>  <p>It is important to emphasise that scientific expertise clearly indicates that this species is particularly pervasive in the environment and that eradication does not appear to be a viable option but that ongoing management of the situation, on a multi-agency basis, may be required. Assessment, on a multi-agency basis led by NPWS, may have to be made on the potential risks in disturbing the existing population.</p></reply>

In achieving its objectives, IFI is delivering on the imperative, common to all Public Bodies, to achieve efficiencies and to maintain a high level of service. </p>  <p>  IFI staff have embraced a range of changed work practices to improve operational efficiency.

My most recent engagement with union representatives was a fortnight ago.</p>  <p>  In 2013 Phillips 66 placed the refinery and marketing business up for sale and subsequently withdrew it from that process in 2014. The company advised my Department last month that they are putting the refinery and marketing business back up for sale on the market. A refinery sale would be a commercial matter between Phillips 66 and a potential purchaser. </p>  <p>  As this process is underway Whitegate will continue to be operated on a business as usual basis. My understanding from Whitegate management is that they are committed to honouring the 15 year agreement under the 2001 Sale and Purchase Agreement to keep the refinery operational until at least July 2016. That commitment is not affected by the planned sale.</p>  <p>  The Government views the continued operation of the Whitegate refinery on a commercial basis as highly desirable from an energy security and economic perspective.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2015-11-03a.2987.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1024" speakername="Alex White" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2015110300116#WRHHH00400"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1124 and 1126 together.</p><p>The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive sets all Member States a binding target that at least 10% of the energy used in the transport sector must come from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland aims to meet this target mainly through the use of sustainable biofuels with electric vehicles also making a contribution. </p><p>In this regard, biofuels are readily available in Ireland and regulations on fuel standards, introduced by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in 2011, and which transpose the Fuel Quality Directive, permit the sale of petrol with up to 10% bioethanol, and diesel with up to 7% biodiesel. Currently, when petrol and diesel are purchased at the petrol pumps, they contain a certain amount of biofuel which has been blended into the petrol or diesel.</p><p>The Biofuels Obligation Scheme was introduced in July 2010 as the primary means through which Ireland would meet the transport target and is the principal support for the uptake of biofuels in Ireland. The scheme, administered by the National Oil Reserves Agency (NORA), is certificate based and, since January 2013, an obligated road transport fuel supplier, at the end of each calendar year, must hold six biofuel obligation certificates for every 94 litres (6.383%) of petroleum based fuel it has placed on the road transport market. Two certificates are awarded for each litre of biofuel produced from wastes, residues, non-food cellulosic material, and ligno-cellulosic material placed on the market with one certificate awarded per litre of other biofuels. Certificates are only issued for biofuels that have been demonstrated to have complied with the sustainability criteria of the Renewable Energy Directive.</p><p>The scheme has resulted in increases in the amount of biofuels in Ireland since its introduction. In 2014, almost 167 million litres of biofuel was placed on the road transport fuel market, which is an increase of over 16 million litres from the previous year. This represented 5.2 percentage points of the 10% target required by 2020.</p><p>It is estimated that in order to achieve the binding target for Ireland of 10%, a biofuel obligation rate of 12% by volume may be needed by 2020. Therefore, the obligation rate must be increased progressively and in a managed and phased basis over the coming years. Last month, I launched a consultation seeking views on an increase to the biofuel obligation rate from 2016.

Eircode does not have the right to change postal address data on behalf of GeoDirectory.    It is important to note that as there is no official form of address for properties, the introduction of Eircodes has imposed no obligation to change the address normally used.

The work programmes carried out under the Licensing Options were primarily of a desk-top study nature. Had the holders of the Licensing Options proposed to undertake projects likely to have a significant effect on the environment then such activities would have been subject to Environmental Impact Assessment, which would have included public participation. The companies would have also had to hold a Petroleum Prospecting Licence and the process through which such licences may be granted also involves public participation.</p></reply>

BT employ a third party contractor, Conduit Ireland Ltd, to provide operators to answer calls. Operators at ECAS call answering centres in Navan, Ballyshannon, and Dublin, process emergency calls and forward these to the appropriate emergency service as quickly and effectively as possible. The ECAS operators handle calls effectively and efficiently, often in response to stressful and distressing situations for citizens. The Service answers over 2 million calls annually, and has one of the fastest emergency call answering times in Europe. </p><p>The number and cost of operators is assessed annually by the Commission for Communications Regulation as part of its annual review of the cost of the ECAS service. An expert report commissioned by ComReg is appended to this review. The latest expert report was appended to a decision on costs by ComReg published in January 2015. The expert report states that ECAS &ldquo;is run effectively against the service targets and quality requirements and overall is approaching &lsquo;leading practice&rsquo; from a performance perspective&rdquo;. Furthermore, ComReg&rsquo;s review concluded that an increase to the operator&rsquo;s hourly rate was reasonable and notified BT Ireland accordingly.</p><p>This is a matter now for BT and Conduit, and I understand that discussions between the two companies are advanced with a view to addressing ComReg's findings. I would hope therefore that the matter can be dealt with quickly given the important service that ECAS operators provide.</p></reply>

In summary, the initial report outlined that the future of the post office network would be best secured by seeking out opportunities in the following areas: financial services, including basic banking for the unbanked, Government services, social capital and enterprise, and white labelling of financial and other products.   To gain further insight into these areas, a public consultation exercise was held from 16 June to 28 July. Interested parties were invited to submit their views on the initial report. It is clear from the responses received that there is a strong public desire to maintain the nationwide network of post offices. The consultation responses are assisting the group in identifying opportunities that can benefit the post office network and will inform the final report, which I expect to receive presently.</p>  <p>It is premature to speculate, in advance of the final report, on what the next steps will be until I have had the opportunity to consider in detail the findings of the group.</p></reply>

This is being achieved through a combination of accelerated commercial investment by telecoms operators, and a proposed State intervention to provide high speed broadband to those parts of the country where the commercial sector will not invest.  Last November I published a national high speed coverage map for 2016. This map is available at <i></i>. The map shows Ireland with two colours, BLUE and AMBER and was developed based on the most up to date information available at the time of publication.

Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy. In 2014, 8.6% of Ireland&rsquo;s overall energy requirements were met from renewable sources, with energy from biomass accounting for 3.2%. Bioenergy is expected to contribute up to half of the 2020 renewable energy targets, both here in Ireland and in the EU as a whole.</p>  <p>  In 2014, I published a Draft Bioenergy Plan which is available on my Department&rsquo;s website. The draft Plan is currently undergoing Strategic Environmental and Appropriate Assessments which will inform the content of the finalised Plan.</p>  <p>  The draft Plan recognises that, although Ireland will remain a net importer of biofuels in the transport sector, meeting demand for solid biomass from indigenous sources could deliver significant economic benefits. Consequently, the draft plan also contains measures to stimulate and support the supply of Irish biomass. In this regard, the key recommendations include the continued support for the Afforestation Programme; the continuation of the Bioenergy Scheme for energy crops; and the establishment of Bioenergy Ireland, a joint venture between Bord na Mona and Coillte.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in terms of developing new sources of biomass, the draft Plan provides that the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government will endeavour to optimise the availability of waste for energy, and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will continue its support for innovative energy uses for animal by-products. </p>  <p>  In addition to its availability, the sustainability of biomass will continue to be a critical factor in the development of bioenergy policy, with liquid biofuels already having to meet certain strict sustainability criteria. The European Commission recently adopted a Directive which will limit the amount of certain crop based biofuels, whose use could lead to Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC), that Member States can count towards renewable energy targets.</p></reply>

The Eircode system is a vital piece of national infrastructure and before its introduction Ireland was the only country within the OECD that did not have a National Postcode System. A successful national information campaign was completed over the summer to inform the public about Eircodes and promote their usage. During the dissemination phase of Eircodes, Am&aacute;rach, an independent body, conducted two parallel surveys, a face-to-face survey of 1,200 households and 200 business premises. The results of the surveys showed that 89% of the public knew the Eircode for their address; a number in excess of the target set out for Capita, the Eircode contractor.  Public sector bodies, such as the Revenue Commissioners and Department of Social Protection, have started using Eircodes in customer engagement and this process will continue over the coming months. In accordance with the contract for the development and maintenance of Eircodes, my Department has put in place reporting structures with Capita which will, inter alia, include information on the commercial use of the Eircode system. Since the launch, a total of 21 Value Added Resellers have been signed up to develop and sell products and services using Eircode databases.</p></reply>

Taking consultancy costs, staffing costs and VAT the total cost of the project is estimated to be &euro;38m over its lifetime.    The total cost of the project covers design of the eircode, encoding public sector databases, accessing the GeoDirectory database, the launch and implementation of Eircodes and the ongoing management of the system for the licence period. The total spend to date on the postcodes project amounts to &euro;19.5m (including VAT). Capita have been paid &euro;17.5m (including VAT) to date on foot of delivery of agreed milestones. The bulk of this figure, &euro;9.4 million was spent on encoding public sector bodies' databases. Aside from payments to Capita, &euro;2m (including VAT) has been spent on specialist costs arising in the project in the period 2009 to date.</p>  <p>  Public sector bodies such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Protection are already using the codes in day to day business. </p>  <p>  Capita has signed up 21 Value Added Re-sellers who will develop products and services using the Eircode databases. </p>  <p>As the Eircodes were only launched in July, usage of the codes is only starting to be visible and it is too early to make an evaluation of the project.

This will make a strong statement to EU citizens about a single and unified EU where barriers to trade and travel are minimised.    As an interim measure, the Regulation will further reduce the maximum permitted retail roaming charges from current levels. This means that from April 2016, roaming charges (exclusive of VAT) for voice calls will reduce from 19 cent to 5 cent per minute. Roaming charges for SMS or text messages will reduce from 6 cent to 2 cent and for data downloads from 20 cent to 5 cent per megabit. The Regulation contains an additional provision to further reduce wholesale roaming charges to ensure the abolition of retail roaming charges is financially sustainable from June 2017. </p>  <p>The Parliament completed its legislative procedures on Tuesday last, the 27th October when it adopted the Council's proposed text without amendment. The legislative process will be completed shortly when the legislative text is signed by the Presidents of the Parliament and Council and the text is published.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.   The R156 Dunboyne - Summerhill Road Improvement Scheme includes works to be undertaken from Jenkinstown to Mullagh Cross as part of the project. Over the period 2009 to 2013 grant funding of &euro;183,853 was provided under the Specific Improvement Grant category for the design stage of this project.</p>  <p>  Given the challenging financial climate, the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme was curtailed from 2014 in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work on the existing road network and it was not, therefore, possible to provide further grant assistance to the R156 project. In this context, it is important to reiterate that the purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement local authorities' own resources and I have been emphasising to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating own resources, including revenue from Local Property Tax receipts. </p>  <p>  While the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for the build up over the period of the plan in capital funding for the road network towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement of the network, the primary focus in the next few years will continue to be on road maintenance and renewal rather than new projects.</p></reply>

Since July 2014, in addition to the current reading at the time of an NCT, up to three prior readings are recorded on the NCT Certificate, with the current reading being recorded on the NCT Disc.  To support the accuracy of the data, the vehicle presenter is required to confirm the reading at the time of the test.  </p>  <p>  As part of the rollout of the Commercial Vehicle Reform Programme, odometer readings are also being recorded in respect of all vehicles that are required to undergo a CVRT.  </p>  <p>  While the Department has no estimate of the extent of this issue over the last five years, odometer tampering is recognised as a widespread phenomenon throughout the EU.

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  My Department did provide funding for preparatory work related to the R336 Road Improvement Scheme under the Strategic Improvement Grant category up to 2014.</p>  <p>  Given the challenging financial climate, the Strategic Improvement Grant Scheme was curtailed from 2014 in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work on the existing road network and it was not, therefore, possible to provide further grant assistance to the R336 project.  In this context, it is important to reiterate that the purpose of Exchequer funding is to supplement local authorities' own resources and I have been emphasising to local authorities the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating own resources, including revenue from Local Property Tax receipts. </p>  <p>  While the Capital Plan 2016-2021 provides for the build up over the period of the plan in capital funding for the road network towards the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement of the network, the primary focus in the next few years will continue to be on road maintenance and renewal rather than new projects.</p></reply>

Accordingly, funding will be made available under the new Capital Plan (2016-2022) for planning, design and construction of new Metro North scheme, as detailed in the Fingal/North Dublin Transport Study, with a view to delivering the link by 2026/2027.</p><p>The NTA has recently published a draft Transport Strategy for Greater Dublin Area which provides a framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services in the GDA for the next two decades.

In addition to the new Metro North project the eastern part of this transport corridor will benefit from the extension of the Dart to Balbriggan, which will also progress to construction stage under the new Capital Plan.</p><p>Given the demand projections in the corridor overall, I have requested the NTA to keep the capacity issues on the Swords/Airport/City Centre route under review.  In the draft GDA strategy the NTA indicates that bus-based measures will be considered for this part of the corridor with any final arrangement designed to be complementary to the new Metro North Project. The question of funding does not arise until the proposed solution has been fully considered and decided on.</p><p>The draft transport strategy for the GDA is subject to a statutory public consultation and all interested parties are invited to review the proposals, and the supporting documentation, on the NTA's website () and to make submissions to the Authority, before the deadline of Friday November 13th, 2015.</p></reply>

Local authorities regulate many activities at local level through bye-laws made under local government regulation.

My Department is liaising with the Road Safety Authority in relation to the issue of roadworthiness testing of such vehicles which would be a necessary condition for licensing as SPSV's.

Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, provides for the protection of the architectural heritage.  The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.  The owner is the local authority, Monaghan County Council.  It is, therefore, primarily its responsibility to address the issues identified by the Deputy in terms of compliance with the Planning and Development Acts.</p><p>The scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances.  Funding for the protection of built heritage is being provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which are either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.  Applications for funding under these schemes are currently closed as all funding for 2015 has been allocated.</p><p>In 2015, under the Structures at Risk Fund, an allocation of &euro;624,000 was available,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund which is administered through the local authorities encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The fund was open to two applications per local authority of which one application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.  The amount of funding available per project was subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Since 2011, in excess of 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.</p><p>I recently announced a new &euro;2 million investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  This fund will operate on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  This announcement will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties</p><p>Officials in my Department continue to be available to advise local authorities on the conservation, reuse and regeneration of historic structures, where applicable.</p></reply>

Funding for the protection of built heritage is being provided by my Department in 2015 via a number of schemes, which are either directly administered or delivered through local authorities or through the Heritage Council.  Application for funding under these schemes is currently closed as all funding for 2015 has been allocated.  It is expected that schemes for 2016, which are currently being worked on, will be advertised before the end of the year or early in the new year.</p><p>I recently announced a new &euro;2 million investment scheme for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  This fund will operate on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme (BHJLS), which ran in 2014, and is expected to support a significant number of projects across the country and create employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  This announcement will come as a welcome boost to the custodians of heritage properties.</p><p>In 2015, under the Structures at Risk Fund, an allocation of &euro;624,000 was available,<i></i>to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, protected under the Planning and Development Acts 2000, as amended, which are deemed to be at significant risk of deterioration.  This fund which is administered through the local authorities encourages the regeneration and reuse of heritage properties and helps to secure the preservation of protected structures which might otherwise be lost.  The fund was open to two applications per local authority of which one application may be in respect of a privately-owned building.  The amount of funding available per project was subject to a minimum level of &euro;15,000 and a maximum level of &euro;60,000.  Since 2011, in excess of 130 structures have been safeguarded for the future as a result of the Structures at Risk Fund.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department also funds, provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  The announcement of any proposed grant schemes can be monitored on .  It will be primarily a matter for the Heritage Council to decide how its funding should be allocated across the range of research, education and conservation programmes it supports annually having regard to competing priorities for limited resources.  </p><p>I am sure the Deputy can appreciate that the scope for funding for the conservation of the built heritage is currently constrained by the significant reduction in the public finances. Nonetheless, the competing priorities regarding the preservation and enhancement of the national heritage are kept under on-going review having regard to the resources available to my Department.</p></reply>
