    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-29a.8.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092900045#WRA00600"><p>Under the LPT legislation the initial valuation of a property on 1st May 2013 was valid until 31 October 2016, and would not have been affected by any increase or decrease in property prices or other changes, including repairs or improvements made, during this period.  The next valuation date would have fallen on 1st November 2016.  During the passage of the Finance Bill in 2014 I gave a firm commitment that my Department would examine the LPT and any impacts on LPT liabilities due to increasing property prices. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, I asked Dr. Don Thornhill to conduct a review to consider and make recommendations on the operation of the Local Property Tax, in particular, any impacts on LPT liabilities due to property price developments. </p>  <p>  Dr. Thornhill made a number of recommendations in his report on his review of the Local Property Tax.  His central recommendation is for a revised system whereby a minimum level of LPT revenues in each local authority area would be determined by Government, ideally having regard to the apportionment between local authority areas of the historic yield.  This in turn would allow for the estimation of LPT rates for each local authority area and the application of these by taxpayers and Revenue.  Local authorities could adjust this rate upwards by a factor of up to 15%.  This new system was recommended by Dr. Thornhill with a possible interim deferral of the next valuation date until November 2018 or November 2019.</p>  <p>  In my Budget 2016 statement, I announced that I would be proposing to Government that the revaluation date for the LPT be postponed from 2016 to 2019.  This postponement means that home owners will not be faced with significant increases in their LPT in 2017 as a result of increased property values.  The postponement also gave sufficient time for the other recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report to be considered.  The Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015 gives effect to the postponement of the revaluation date of residential property for LPT purposes, and also to two of the recommendations in Dr. Thornhill's report, involving LPT relief for properties affected by pyrite and relief for properties occupied by persons with disabilities (recommendations numbers 11 and 12 respectively).  </p>  <p>  My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of other recommendations in the Report in due course in line with the 2019 timeline.  I also note that the Programme for a Partnership Government provides for the preparation of a report by mid-2017 for Government and for the Oireachtas, on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability. </p></reply>

The review focused on three key policy objectives for agri-taxation policy, including:</p><p>-increasing mobility and productive use of land</p><p>-assisting succession, and</p><p>-complementing wider agriculture policies and schemes, such as supporting investment to enhance competitiveness, environmental sustainability, alternative farming models such as farm partnerships and responses to increasing income volatility.</p><p>Following on from this review, a significant number of measures were introduced, retained or refocused in the last two Finance Acts.  These formed a comprehensive tax package to support the farming sector, including but not limited to:</p><p>- Extension of income averaging from 3 to 5 years</p><p>- Broadening of CGT retirement relief so that, for example, individuals can now lease out their land for up to 25 years prior to disposal and still be eligible for CGT retirement relief</p><p>- Extension of stamp duty relief for non-residential land transfers between certain close relatives</p><p>- Extension of general stock relief, stock relief for certain young trained farmers and stock relief for registered farm partnerships and</p><p>- Extension of the stamp duty exemption for young trained farmers. </p><p>In addition, a new &quot;succession transfer partnership&quot; proposal was introduced in Finance Act 2015. </p><p>A public consultation was held as part of the agri-tax review.  Proposals put forward from this consultation were considered and a number of meetings were held with stakeholders, including the ICMSA.  A number of respondents suggested a tax deposit scheme similar to the farm management deposit scheme put forward by the ICMSA.  Such a scheme is essentially a tax deferral scheme, where farmers lodge money tax free and pay tax on withdrawal after a number of years.  The idea is based on similar schemes in Australia and New Zealand, which are not subject to EU State Aid rules and which do not have a system of direct payments.</p><p>The Agri-tax working group concluded that a scheme such as this would not be compatible with EU State Aid rules which preclude supports to falling farm incomes arising from low commodity prices in the market place. </p><p>Accordingly, it would not be possible to introduce such a scheme.</p></reply>

Its objective is to identify immediate and longer term measures which can address increasing costs, while bearing in mind the need to maintain a stable insurance sector.</p><p>The core areas to be examined by the Working Group in this first phase are:</p><p>- The motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years</p><p>- The effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs</p><p>- The current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims</p><p>- Insurance data and information</p><p>- The impact of accident rates</p><p>- The impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector</p><p>- Other market issues.</p><p>Because the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and in order to get to the heart of these issues as soon as possible, I have established four subgroups to review them in detail.  Chairs have been appointed to these subgroups and work has commenced.  The subgroups are meeting weekly and their outputs are feeding into the meetings of the Working Group. </p><p>Separate to the work of the Cost of Insurance Working Group, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) has informed me that it has formally opened an investigation in August 2016 concerning suspected breaches of competition law in the motor insurance sector.  The investigation relates to industry participants openly signalling up-coming increases in motor insurance premiums in the State.  </p><p>The CCPC is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcement of competition and consumer protection legislation across the economy.  Its investigation is separate from the issues being considered by the Cost of Insurance Working Group and does not interfere with the important work being undertaken there. </p><p>By the end of October the Working Group will provide the Minister for Finance with an update report which will set out the priority actions required.  From November to December, the Working Group will then develop an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of these priority actions.  In this regard I will be consulting regularly with Government colleagues.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-29a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092900045#WRA01300"><p>On 2 September 2016, the Government decided that a motion would be put forward to the D&aacute;il to support an appeal in the Apple State Aid case.  At that time the Government also decided as follows:</p>  <p>  - to commit to the highest international standards in transparency in the taxation of the corporate sector;</p>  <p>  - to affirm its commitment to the 12.5% corporation tax rate; the Research and Development credit and Knowledge Development Box; and</p>  <p>  - to commit to arrange for a review of Ireland's corporation tax code by an independent expert; the review will exclude any possibility of a change to the 12.5% corporation tax rate.</p>  <p>  I am currently in the process of drawing up the terms of reference for the review.  I expect that the terms of reference will be announced at Budget time.  </p>  <p>  It is good practice to undertake periodic reviews of key areas of Government policy.  The last review of corporation tax policy took place in 2014.  Since then a wide range of new international developments have emerged in international taxation, such as BEPS.  We need to ensure that Ireland's corporation tax code meets these new standards while remaining competitive as the economy continues to grow.</p>  <p>  Ireland continues to take an active role in global work to reform the international corporate tax system and will engage constructively with any measures to work towards international tax reform.  </p>  <p>  In relation to the financial transactions tax, on 17th June 2016 the ECOFIN Council discussed the current state of play with regard to the proposal of a number of Member States to introduce a financial transaction tax.  In the context of this discussion, ten of the original eleven Member States (Estonia has indicated that it no longer supports the proposal), issued a statement setting out their agreement on the core design principles of an FTT.  The statement indicates that further reassurances were needed on two issues in particular, for which two task forces will be immediately set up.  First, taxation of derivatives should not have a negative impact on public borrowing costs.  Second, tax collection should be cost-effective.  The outcome of these two task forces was to be discussed in September.  I understand the task forces have had some discussions but that significant differences of opinion remain.</p>  <p>  Much uncertainty remains therefore as to the form the FTT might take and more detail would be needed on the final shape of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on Irish taxation revenue. </p></reply>

This regulation transposes the EU regulatory framework for insurance and reinsurance known as Solvency II into Irish law. </p>  <p>  It provides that the authorisation and the day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of insurance companies is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions. </p>  <p>  The European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 ensure that a rigorous and robust authorisation process takes place and they provide the appropriate safeguards to ensure that only companies that meet the necessary governance and capital requirements can be approved by the Central Bank.  In this regard, the regulations clearly outline the information that must be provided by companies seeking an authorisation to conduct business in Ireland.  In addition, the Central Bank has published guidelines to assist applicant firms and publishes a register of authorised non-life insurance firms in the Registers section of its website.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank has advised that its Insurance Supervision Directorate is responsible for the prudential supervision of insurance and reinsurance undertakings authorised in Ireland.  In carrying out this role, the Insurance Directorate monitors the risks posed by undertakings along with issuing standards, policies and guidance which undertakings are expected to meet.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Solvency II Directive provides for the 'passporting' of services into Ireland from other European and EEA countries.  'Passporting', which is the establishment of a branch or operation by way of freedom of services, is a right of EU-authorised firms under the single market.  Passporting is notified to the Central Bank by the home state regulator which is responsible for supervision of its foreign business. </p>  <p>  In relation to such foreign business, it should be noted that the Central Bank has indicated that supervisory authorities across the European Union co-operate and share relevant information to achieve the objectives of insurance supervision and, in particular, financial stability and adequate protection of policyholders and other stakeholders.</p></reply>

Any such allegations are of course very concerning and I fully support the full investigation by the appropriate authorities of any alleged illegal behaviour.  However, I am unaware of any allegations of wrongdoing against NAMA itself.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise that in no way have the integrity of NAMA or the NAMA Board or the integrity of its decisions been brought into question and so I have no intention of halting NAMA's activities.  To do so would irreparably damage NAMA's positive contribution to our recovery and damage our reputation as a credible, open and transparent market.  By extension, any such interference would be detrimental to the interests of Irish taxpayers.  In particular, it would likely:</p>  <p>  - constitute the State taking direct control of NAMA and bringing NAMA debt onto the State's balance sheet;</p>  <p>  - imply a u-turn for the Irish sovereign in the eyes of the rating agencies and the sovereign bond and broader investor community, potentially increasing the cost of government debt, damaging confidence in the recovery of our economy;</p>  <p>  - raise competition concerns which may limit the State's flexibility in ultimately recovering value from NAMA's assets;</p>  <p>  - reduce the surplus currently projected by NAMA to ultimately be returned to the exchequer; and</p>  <p>  - negatively impact NAMA's ability to fund the delivery of residential and commercial units on a commercial basis.</p>  <p>  As regards the recent value for money review of Project Eagle conducted by the C&amp;AG, the public disagreement over the opinions expressed by the C&amp;AG in his report are being examined by the Public Accounts Committee.  Today, the C&amp;AG and NAMA are appearing before the PAC regarding this report.  The PAC is the appropriate forum for consideration of the C&amp;AG report and for the exercise of public accountability in these matters.</p>  <p>  It is also important to remember that this value for money report was effectively an accelerated module of the C&amp;AG's normal Section 226 review of NAMA required under the NAMA Act.  As already provided for in the NAMA Act, in 2015 the C&amp;AG committed to reviewing a broad sample of NAMA's sales and investment decisions as the focus of his next Section 226 report.</p>  <p>  The Government also recognises that it has its own responsibilities regarding all matters of public concern around the functions of an important public body such as NAMA.  The Taoiseach has met with opposition party leaders with a view to seeking agreement on issues of public concern that may require further investigation and the most appropriate nature and terms of reference for such an investigation.  Subject to the outcome of those discussions, the matter will then be the subject of a D&aacute;il debate.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-09-29a.32.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016092900046#WRB00600"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 26 together.</p>  <p>  The fiscal rules - formally known as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) - have direct application through a number of EU regulations.  Changes to these regulations would have to follow the normal EU approach starting with a proposal from the Commission before consideration by Member States and the European Parliament.</p>  <p>  Having said that, it is important to note that there are existing provisions in the fiscal rules that are designed to promote public investment.  For instance, within the expenditure benchmark pillar of the rules, public investment is granted favourable treatment - as a result of four-year capital smoothing, only one quarter of the increase in public investment must be funded in the first year from within the fiscal space.  This provision means capital spending for housing and other purposes can be leveraged within the EU rules.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that there are also certain more explicit flexibility provisions within the rules, particularly with a view to encouraging public investment.  These take the form of what is known as the investment clause and structural reform clause.  Specifically, these provisions allow for temporary deviations from the required structural budgetary adjustment if spending on capital investment can be shown to qualify for either the investment clause or the structural reform clause.  Both of these provisions are subject to strict conditions; and while Ireland has not yet been in a position to apply given where we are in the business cycle, the situation is kept under constant review by my officials.</p>  <p>  The Government is very conscious of the need to boost the supply of critical infrastructure.  Investment in public infrastructure is vital for the medium and long-term competiveness of the economy as well as for underpinning social cohesion through the provision of vital services to people in the form of schools, public transport, housing, etc.  The public capital plan provides for &euro;42 billion of capital investment over the 2016-2021 period and the Government remains committed to this.  Further to this the Government set out in the SES proposals an additional cumulative &euro;5.1 billion in capital spending over the period 2017-2021.  This additional capital spending is aimed at addressing infrastructural bottlenecks, particularly regional infrastructural shortages.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Government has been exploring the objective to create 'off-balance' mechanisms that bring investment into social housing which is additional to the funding being provided directly by the State.  There is ongoing engagement with a broad array of domestic actors and European authorities to explore achievable solutions.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would point out that we are still running a deficit and our public debt remains high by international standards.  The answer, therefore, is not simply about spending more; it is about getting more from each euro of taxpayers' money that is spent.</p></reply>

Updates for later years will be published in due course as newer data becomes available.  I am advised that there are some other tax expenditures, not included in the above, for which estimates of costs are not readily available.</p>  <p>  I would also note that my Department, alongside the last two Budgets, has published reports on tax expenditures, including overall costings similar to the Revenue tables noted above, guidelines for the evaluation of tax expenditures and detailed evaluations of a number of different expenditures.  These reports are available on the Budget website.  The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the latest version this report will be published next month, probably on Budget Day.</p>  <p>  In relation to tax avoidance, where information is brought to my attention I will not hesitate to close off abuses of the tax code.  The Deputy will understand that it is not generally the practice to supply details of such measures in advance.  However, he will be aware I have already published draft proposals in relation to abuses that have come to light concerning section 110 companies.  Details of the proposed amendment to section 110 may be found in my press release on my Department's website.  The amendment as published is not finalised and may be subject to further refinements to clarify certain aspects of the provision.</p>  <p>  The rationale for publishing said proposal was to ensure appropriate feedback is received on a technical and complex section of the Taxes Acts.  As is standard practice when a technically complex piece of legislation is being examined, officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners have held meetings with a broad range of stakeholders including meeting with members of the Irish Debt Securities Association, the body that represents the securitisation industry and other members of the accounting, law and tax professions.  My officials are currently in consultation to clarify certain aspects of the provision and to ensure the proposal successfully carries out the intention for which it was created.  This is an ongoing process and I would like to reiterate that we welcome input from all stakeholders, including Deputies.</p></reply>

When expressed as a percentage of GDP, there is a small decline to 24.4% from 25.9%.  These forecasts take account of &euro;2.54 billion of fiscal space allocated to proposed tax reductions to be implemented over this period.</p>  <p>  It is worth noting that forecast tax revenues from 2016 to 2021 remain relatively flat as a share of GDP, whereas the forecast for appropriations-in-aid drops by over 1% of GDP over the same period.</p>  <p>  Almost 80% of the current appropriations-in-aid for 2016 relate to the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund.  The Social Insurance Fund is funded by PRSI receipts.  With both funds in surplus, the gross expenditure and appropriations-in-aid for the funds are assumed to net off in arriving at the Exchequer Balance.  Additional revenue forecast for both funds for the period to 2021 is then reflected in the General Government Balance.  If the surplus receipts in these funds were included in the forecast of receipts in table 3 of the Summer Economic Statement, the overall estimate of appropriations-in-aid, as a percentage of GDP, would have reduced only slightly from 2016 to 2021.</p>  <p>  The allocation of fiscal space in the Summer Economic Statement is consistent with the Programme for Partnership Government (PfPG) which outlines a split of at least two-to-one in favour of expenditure.  This reflects the priority the Government attaches to re-growing public expenditure in a sustainable way while also addressing the need to reward work and support enterprise and employment.</p>  <p>  In the PfPG, there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners.</p>  <p>  In terms of public infrastructure, the Government is conscious of the need to increase capital expenditure in order to boost the supply of critical infrastructure.  The public capital plan, published in September 2015, provided for &euro;42 billion of capital investment out to 2021 and the PfPG contained a commitment not only to protect this level of investment, but to increase it by a further &euro;4 billion.</p>  <p>  The level of capital expenditure provided for in the Summer Economic Statement allows for an additional &euro;5.14 billion over the 2017 to 2021 period in excess of the additional &euro;4 billion commitment given in the Programme.  This emphasises the importance the Government places on continued investment in the public infrastructure.</p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, the Government is prioritising infrastructural investment in order to support and broaden the economic recovery.</p></reply>

In general, there are two thresholds: the goods threshold, which is currently &euro;75,000, and the services threshold, which is &euro;37,500.  Different VAT registration thresholds for the supply of goods and services are a feature of the EU VAT Directive and Irish VAT legislation and reflect the profound difference between the two supplies; in general, the value added in relation to the supply of goods will be much smaller relative to turnover compared with a supply of services.</p>  <p>  In the absence of this special scheme very small enterprises would be required to register for VAT, charge VAT on supplies and make periodic VAT returns and payments.  In many cases, the compliance burden on such small enterprises would exceed the VAT payments to the Exchequer.  In general, a person or company who exceeds the thresholds must register and account for VAT where their annual income exceeds the services threshold of &euro;37,500, or the goods threshold of &euro;75,000.  For income tax purposes the income earned by a self-employed person is treated in the same manner as income earned by any other taxpayer.</p>  <p>  VAT is governed by the EU VAT Directive (Council Directive 2006/112/EC), with which Irish VAT law must comply.  The EU VAT Directive provides that VAT registration thresholds may only be raised by Member States to maintain their value in real terms, that is, they may only be increased in line with inflation.  The VAT thresholds were increased to their current values on 1 May 2008.  As the Central Statistics Office figures show the consumer price index is below the level it reached in 2008, it is not possible to increase the thresholds.  I would point out, however, that Ireland's VAT registration threshold for small enterprises supplying services is the seventh highest in the EU while the goods threshold is the third highest.</p></reply>

These frameworks are required to ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset for the State.  In addition, the Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank is independent in the carrying out of its supervisory functions of regulated financial institutions.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank's Consumer Protection Code sets down the obligations that regulated entities must fulfil before an offer of a mortgage is made to a borrower, including inter alia, details of the associated interest rate and other costs.  Under the same code, lenders are obliged to inform personal borrowers of any proposed changes to the interest rate on a loan.  In the case of a mortgage where a revised repayment arrangement has been put in place in accordance with the Code of Conduct for Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the notification must clearly indicate the revised repayment amount required.  All regulated entities must comply with the Consumer Protection Code.  However, the Central Bank does not regulate the rate of interest charged by lending institutions.</p>  <p>  Generally, the terms governing the interest payable on a mortgage will be provided for in the loan contract.  In respect of a mortgage on a primary residence, provision 11 of the CCMA places a restriction on regulated entities 'from imposing charges and/or surcharge interest on arrears arising on a mortgage account in arrears' to which the CCMA applies, unless the borrower is not co-operating.  Therefore, I would encourage anyone who is experiencing difficulty in meeting the contractual repayment requirements of their mortgage to engage with their lender to address their difficulty and in turn, I would ask lenders to put in place sustainable repayment arrangements to deal with a mortgage repayment difficulty in the best interests of consumers.</p>  <p>  In conclusion I would reassure the Deputy that the CCMA is designed to provide appropriate and effective consumer protection measures and to ensure that borrowers are treated in a fair and transparent manner.  It applies to all regulated mortgage lenders operating in the State when dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence, including any mortgage lending activities outsourced by these lenders.  Lenders are required to comply with all aspects of the CCMA and non-compliance with the CCMA is enforceable against regulated entities by the Central Bank.</p></reply>

This was to allow for a sufficient period of time having elapsed before considering the operations and impact of the Fund. </p>  <p>  The investment strategy review will play an important role in examining the performance and impact of ISIF.  The review includes an appraisal of the success of ISIF's mandate to date and will involve interactions with both my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as part of the review process. The NTMA (ISIF) inform me that preparatory work in respect of the review has commenced and the review itself is due for completion by year end.  </p>  <p>  I am sure the Deputy shares my view that ISIF's 'double bottom line' mandate - to invest on a commercial basis in a manner designed to support economic activity and employment in Ireland represents a unique strategic opportunity for the Ireland.  That mandate is designed to ensure that ISIF's investment generates a return, attracts investors and recycles funds.  Whilst not wanting in any way to pre-empt the review that is currently underway, I am greatly encouraged by the quality and impact on the Irish economy of it's investments. ISIF has built up momentum already, including through its future pipeline.  </p>  <p>  ISIF has already committed &euro;2.4 billion and it acts as a catalyst for other investors to invest in Irish projects. It's ability to attract co-investment from the private sector means that &euro;5.8 bn of total investment has been committed to date. </p>  <p>  It is apparent from the investments already in the public domain that, as envisaged at inception, ISIF is utilising its unique investment characteristics scale, long-term perspective and flexibility - to target high economic value investment in Ireland in a way that other funds cannot. This, along with the fact that the proceeds of ISIF investment unlike State spending can be recycled again and again to support future economic activity in Ireland, illustrates the potential that the ISIF model offers, and which ISIF is currently delivering on.  </p></reply>

The Programme for a Partnership Government, therefore, has set out a range of measures which seek to provide for greater transparency and competition in the mortgage market. These actions include establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, which will be administered by the Central Bank, and the development of a new, easy-to-use standardised and dedicated mortgage switching form. </p>  <p>  In addition, the Government will request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and to improve the degree of competition and consumer protection. Also the recent transposition of the Mortgage Credit Directive, which is intended to develop a more pan European mortgage market consistent with a high level of consumer protection, into Irish law should help contribute to this process over the medium term. The primary objective of this approach by Government, therefore, is to develop an overall banking policy that encourages more entrants and a vibrant banking sector with real competition in order to provide more choice to mortgage holders but without giving rise to potential negative consequences that could impact on the supply of residential mortgage credit.</p>  <p>  I had a series of formal meetings with the main mortgage lenders last year where I outlined the Government's opinion that the standard variable rate being charged, to both existing and new Irish mortgage customers, was too high. The banks have since reviewed their rates and subsequently reduced them which has been evidenced in the latest Central Bank statistical release on retail interest rates for July 2016. Nevertheless, this is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in our ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Such procedures involve engaging in a public consultation and passing a special resolution at a meeting of the elected council members.</p>  <p>  A Local Authority that has passed a special resolution to vary the rate of LPT must notify Revenue of its decision by 30 September (preceding year) to allow appropriate time to arrange timely implementation of the changes.  Any slippage in implementing the changes could result in incorrect notices issuing to property owners and/or incorrect phased payment mandates operating from the beginning of the due year. </p>  <p>  To ensure all notifications and payment mandates are correctly calculated and issued on a timely basis, the latest date by which Revenue must complete the necessary adjustments is early October. This is the reason that the 30 September deadline in respect of the Local Authority notifications is so important for the efficient administration of LPT.</p>  <p>  The scale of the task for Revenue in calculating varied rate changes for some Local Authorities while maintaining the basic rate for others within such a short period of time is very considerable. The task includes ensuring the calculations are correct for over 1.9 million properties, which includes issuing written notifications in respect of approximately 800,000 properties, ensuring correct deductions in respect of almost 360,000 Direct Debit mandates and 220,000 Deduction at Source salary or pension instructions and setting up correct mandates for almost 350,000 Single Debit Authority payments. </p>  <p>  Given the scale of the LPT case base and the number of Local Authorities that exercise their right to vary the base rate each year (14 in 2015 and 11 in 2016), Revenue has confirmed that any further narrowing of the 30 September deadline would have adverse implications for the ongoing efficient administration of LPT.</p>  <p>  At my request Dr Don Thornhill carried out a review of the operation of the Local Property Tax in 2015. Following the receipt of Dr Thornhill's report, a number of measures arising from the recommendations in the Report were implemented in the Finance (Local Property Tax) (Amendment) Act 2015, including the deferral of the revaluation process to 2019. My Department will be considering issues relating to the implementation of the remaining recommendations in Dr Thornhill's Report.  The issue raised by the Deputy can be considered further in that context. </p></reply>

Other actions to support the position of borrowers in arrears and to adjust the legal framework are being advanced separately by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may have seen the latest Central Bank statistical bulletin on residential mortgage arrears, published on 13th September, which presents data to end-June 2016. This release shows the continuing improvement in the level of mortgage accounts with associated arrears, for example, 89 per cent of PDH mortgage accounts have no mortgage arrears. It is very welcome that the numbers in mortgage arrears have continued to decline across the various maturity categories and those in arrears for more than two years have declined for the fourth consecutive quarter.   However, there are still large numbers with long-term arrears, despite the various borrower supports that have been put in place.  Therefore, it is important that we now concentrate our efforts to ensure that those who remain in arrears engage with their lender to resolve their difficulties.  I understand that this will be a major focus for the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, being established on foot of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.    I am hopeful that this new service will be instrumental in addressing and resolving those remaining cases in mortgage arrears.</p></reply>

At that time, the proposal was considered in detail by officials in my Department and there was engagement with Sparkassenstiftung f&uuml;r Internationale Kooperation, the Public Banking Forum of Ireland and Irish Rural Link on the issue.</p>  <p>  Local or public Banks, such as Sparkassen in Germany, focus on the needs of SMEs in their catchment area rather than profit maximisation. This is very similar to the business model of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland. It is encouraging to note that to the end of June 2016, &euro;347 million has been lent through the SBCI to 8,619 SMEs across Ireland in a wide variety of sectors and all regions. Additionally, the Government has to date delivered a number of initiatives that already support increased access to finance for SMEs such as: the Supporting SMEs Online Tool, the Credit Guarantee Scheme, Microenterprise Loan Fund, Local Enterprise Offices and the Credit Review Office. Given the significant SME supports that have already been put in place by the Government to support SME financing it was not clear, when my Department considered the proposal, how local public banks could create a distinct product offering that would avoid replicating both regional and national supports that are already available. </p>  <p>  The current Programme for Government contains a commitment to investigate the German Sparkassen model for the development of local public banks that operate within well-defined regions and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (DAHRRG) are the lead department in respect of this commitment. As the department with primary responsibility for this matter, they are now tasked with considering the issue further within the parameters of the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

Proposals from both representative bodies, in relation to the funding of social housing, are at various stages of development.</p>  <p>  However, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is primarily responsible for the formulation and implementation of policy and for the preparation of legislation in relation to housing. Also, the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank is responsible for the regulation and supervision of the credit union sector. Earlier this year the Central Bank amended regulations to allow for investments to be made by credit unions in projects of a public nature, to include but not limited to investments in social housing.</p>  <p>  The ILCU has submitted a proposal setting out a means by which funding could be provided to Approved Housing Bodies by credit unions, for the development of social housing. CUDA has also submitted a proposal in respect of the funding of social housing. For credit union investment to work in providing additional investment it has to be  off-balance sheet . Credit unions cannot simply hand over money to the State to build social housing. This would effectively be Government borrowing by another name and would end up on the State's balance sheet. The credit union bodies themselves will therefore have to put in place the necessary financial structure for investing in the delivery of social housing by the AHBs. Both representative bodies are working on these structures with the Department of Environment providing necessary technical advice and support.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department and officials from the Department of the Environment have met jointly with the Central Bank to provide information and to discuss issues arising from these proposals. The Department of the Environment provides updates on progress and has been in ongoing contact with the credit union representative bodies. I have been informed that the most recent meeting between Department of Environment officials and the ILCU was on 12 July. It was agreed that the representative bodies would progress their proposals, with both Departments indicating their availability should any assistance be required regarding technical advice or further information.</p>  <p>  Ultimately, any funding mechanisms will have to be put in place in the first instance by the credit unions themselves, with the support of their members, and these must be sanctioned by the Central Bank. </p>  <p>  Both myself and Minister Coveney are happy for our officials to continue to contribute to this process by providing necessary technical advice and support as required.</p></reply>

The Government's medium term fiscal strategy is to 'balance the books', which is defined in structural terms as a deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP. This is Ireland's medium term objective or MTO and it should be achieved in 2018.</p>  <p>  The European Commission makes a recommendation to each Member State on the appropriate improvement required on an annual basis in the structural balance to reach its MTO. This analysis takes account of the debt-to-GDP ratio, the size and sign of the output gap and whether the economy is growing faster than potential GDP growth. Currently, Ireland is required to improve its structural balance by 0.6 per cent of GDP per annum. My Department's latest forecasts, as published in the Summer Economic Statement, indicate that Ireland will achieve a structural balance improvement of 0.5 percentage points this year. Whilst this preliminary ex ante estimate falls slightly short of the required adjustment, it is not considered a significant deviation under the SGP framework. Furthermore, on the basis of this outlook, Ireland remains on track to achieve its MTO in 2018.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the expenditure benchmark is to keep expenditure growth in line with the trend growth rate of the economy after taking account of discretionary revenue measures. It is designed to ensure that the level of spending is sustainable and can continue to be supported by the economy. Thanks in part to Eurostat's decision to classify an AIB banking transaction in 2015 as general government expenditure, my Department's preliminary ex ante estimates suggest Ireland will be compliant with the benchmark in 2016.</p>  <p>  Assessment of compliance with the preventive arm of the SGP is undertaken by the European Commission and is based on overall assessment, taking account of both pillars (the expenditure benchmark and the balanced budget rule). As part of the Budget 2017 process, there will be a detailed re-assessment of both pillars in respect of both 2016 and 2017. The final assessment of compliance with the rules in 2016 on an ex post basis will take place once data outturns are confirmed in the context of the European Commission's Spring 2017 forecast.</p></reply>

The measure was designed to boost tourism and create additional jobs in that sector. The tourism sector is a key sector in the Irish Economy and the introduction of the 9% VAT rate was aimed at reducing costs during a very challenging time for the sector. The objective was to boost tourism and create additional jobs. While the VAT rate was due to revert to 13.5% in 2014, I retained the 9% rate on tourism activity in Budget 2014 because the initiative had proved to be a major success. Between the second quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2016, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of people working in the Accommodation &amp;amp; Food Services Sector nationally increased by 31,000, taking total employment from 114,900 to 145,900. This increase of 27% compares to an increase of 7.2% in overall employment over the same period indicating that the measure may have been successful in terms of job creation and has made a significant impact on the competitiveness of the tourism product. </p>  <p>  The Government, in the Programme for Partnership Government, has committed to increasing revenue from overseas visitors, growing employment in the tourism sector and increasing the number of visits to Ireland, through the retention of the 9% VAT rate on tourism related services, among other measures, providing that prices remain competitive. With reports of rising prices within the tourism sector, particularly in Dublin, it is incumbent on the industry to ensure that this relief continues to be passed through fully to the consumer. My Department will continue to monitor developments in this regard.</p>  <p>  With regard to employment within the sector, Ireland has a robust suite of employment rights legislation to protect all workers, including minimum wage legislation. These rights apply across all sectors. Other wage setting frameworks include joint labour committees, registered employment agreements and sectoral employment orders which are underpinned by recent legislation. Engagement in these frameworks is voluntary on the part of the stakeholders concerned.</p></reply>

Revenue in conjunction with HMRC developed Operation Shard which resulted in six significant seizures in the United Kingdom and the closure of a French tax warehouse.</p>  <p>  Revenue continues to meet its obligations under the National Drugs Strategy.  Revenue has primary responsibility for the prevention, detection, interception and seizure of controlled drugs intended to be smuggled or illegally imported into /exported from the State.</p>  <p>  Revenue maintains an excellent working relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, HM Revenue and Customs, National Crime Agency and U.K. Border Agency/Force with a view to countering the activity of those involved in importing drugs.  Revenue's Customs service were involved in a number of joint operations with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Drugs &amp;amp; Organised Crime Bureau which involve criminal activity with a cross border element.</p>  <p>  Revenue along with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) who have primary responsibility for enforcing regulations in respect of medicines, run regular operations countering the activities against those involved in the importation of illicit products.  </p>  <p>  For my part, I have, over recent years, taken action through the Finance Acts to ensure that Revenue has all the powers necessary to combat these forms of criminal activity.</p></reply>

Where a company acquires a loan book there will be three possible sources of profits which are: the interest payments that are made by the borrowers; the capital repayments made by the borrowers that exceed the capital cost of the loan book to the lender; and any gain arising on the disposal of a loan or any property on which a loan is secured.  </p>  <p>  In addition, to accurately estimate the full impact of the measure would require ex ante knowledge of any behavioural changes on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of the amendment. Revenue would not therefore be in a position to anticipate the extent and impact of any such behavioural changes or corresponding impact on the tax yield.  The proposed amendment is in draft form and not yet finalised which also leads to difficulties predicting any potential yield.</p></reply>

To this end the Deputy will be aware that the Government launched 'Rebuilding Ireland - The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness' last July. Implementation of the plan is being led by the Minister Coveney at the Department for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, with cross Departmental support including from my Department.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector. While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the proposed help-to-buy scheme should be considered. Its role would be to complement the other measures in the Action Plan. The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases. Therefore, the impact of the help-to-buy scheme on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply. </p></reply>

These rules were also given domestic legal effect through the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 following the passage of a constitutional referendum in May 2012 in which the Irish people supported accession to the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union.  </p>  <p>  The rules are designed to ensure that increases in public expenditure are suitably financed and do not rely on cyclical or windfall revenues. The deteriorating international outlook illustrates the need for caution and prudent economic and fiscal policies. These rules do not per se limit spending. They do, however, require that any additional spending is financed through sustainable revenue raising measures. Through adhering to the requirements of the SGP Ireland's economic and fiscal situation has improved as illustrated by the abrogation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure earlier this year.</p>  <p>  However an area with limitations under the rules is the harmonised methodology for calculating the economic cycle used in the implementation of the SGP. My Department has secured useful changes to this methodology over the years by consistently raising concerns and objections at European level. These changes have partially compensated for the reality that the harmonised methodology is not suitable for small open economies. My Department continues to advocate for improvements in the harmonised methodology and will continue to engage constructively on this and other relevant technical issues. </p>  <p>  Finally I would point out that fiscal sustainability is a pre-requisite for economic growth.</p></reply>

Ceteris paribus, this will reduce the level of royalty imports and as result increase Irish GDP;</p>  <p>  It is important to note that these factors do not reflect activity levels we are seeing on the ground. Although these revisions have significantly boosted investment and net export growth, they do not have a direct bearing on employment and wealth creation for Irish citizens. </p>  <p>  It is important to stress that whilst these headline GDP figures have clearly been distorted and are exaggerated in an Irish context, more concrete indicators of the underlying levels of economic activity point to a continuation of a now firmly-rooted recovery. Specifically, indicators such as consumer spending, tax trends and labour market developments all confirm that Ireland's economic fundamentals remain strong. </p>  <p>  It is also important to stress that the figures published by the CSO are compiled in accordance with best international practice and statistical standards. They measure what they are supposed to measure. However, in a small, open and very globalised economy such as Ireland, it is clear that relevance of these figures   as a metric by which underlying economic trends and changes in living standards can be assessed   is considerably less than elsewhere.</p>  <p>  With this in mind, the Central Statistics Office has put together a group of experts to provide guidance on how a more relevant indicator could be produced and published alongside these figures in the future.  My Department is represented on this group. It is expected that this group will publish a report detailing their findings later this year. </p></reply>

Therefore I was satisfied that, while being cognisant of the longstanding principles governing the taxation of expenses of travel, it was appropriate to make an exception in this case and I introduced the relevant change via Finance Act 2015. This Act also included a change to exempt certain expenses of State Examinations Commission examiner staff from taxation. </p>  <p>  Following further review of the submissions other legislative changes were not identified as immediately necessary.

As part of their engagement process, in November 2015 the Central Bank established Sector Stakeholder Dialogues to facilitate engagement with credit unions.

Under the 2016 Regulations, issued at the beginning of January, credit unions continue to be allowed to lend up to 30% of their loan book over five years and up to 10% of their loan book over 10 years, subject to a maximum maturity of 25 years.  In addition, credit unions can apply to the Central Bank for an extension to their longer term lending limits (up to 40% of their loan book over 5 years and up to 15% of their loan book over 10 years).  Approval of this extension is subject to conditions set by the Central Bank.  The 2016 Regulations do not provide for a specific limit of 5% of current member shares. </p>  <p>  The Government recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement in this country.  The Government's priorities remain the protection of members' savings, the financial stability of credit unions and the sector overall and it is determined to support a strengthened and growing credit union movement into the future.</p></reply>

To this end the Deputy will be aware that the Government launched 'Rebuilding Ireland - The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness' last July.  Implementation of the plan is being led by the Minister Coveney at the Department for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, with cross Departmental support including from my Department.</p>  <p>  This comprehensive Action Plan takes a holistic approach in addressing the many interacting structural constraints affecting the housing market in areas such as planning and land use, as well as regulation and skills deficits in the construction sector.  While the primary focus of the Action Plan is to tackle structural constraints, fiscal supports can play a supporting and time-bound role in addressing the current problems in the housing sector.</p>  <p>  It is in this context that the proposed help-to-buy scheme should be considered.  Its role would be to complement the other measures in the Action Plan.  The extent to which the scheme could lead to an increase in residential property prices will very much depend on the speed and efficiency with which structural supply constraints are eliminated and residential building activity increases.  Therefore, the impact of the help-to-buy scheme on property prices cannot be considered in isolation from the impact of other measures contained in the Action Plan, which are primarily designed to increase supply.</p></reply>

These frameworks are required to ensure that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the banks as an asset for the State.  </p>  <p>  The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) sets out a process, called the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  Under the MARP, each lender must explore all of the options for alternative repayment arrangements offered by his company and must document its consideration of each option examined including the reason(s) why the option(s) offered to the borrower is/are appropriate and sustainable for his/her individual circumstances and why the option(s) considered and not offered to the borrower is/are not appropriate and not sustainable for the borrower's individual circumstances.  This requirement ensures that if 'extending the term of the mortgage' is one of the alternative repayment arrangements offered by the lender then he must consider whether this option is appropriate and sustainable for the borrower and if he concludes that it is not then he must inform the borrower of the reasons for this conclusion.</p>  <p>  The CCMA applies to the mortgage lending activities and credit servicing activities in respect of mortgage loans of all regulated entities, except credit unions, operating in the State.  It provides a strong consumer protection framework to protect borrowers struggling with mortgage repayments, ensuring that they are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated entities to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Action Plan For Housing and Homelessness sets out how the Government plans to meet the challenging commitments made in the Programme for a Partnership Government in respect of dealing with homelessness, including how it will address the high level of mortgages currently in arrears for more than two years.  Implementation of this plan is being overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  One action on mortgage arrears relates to a commitment to work with the Central Bank to amend the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to include an obligation on providers of mortgage credit to provide a range of sustainable arrears solutions.  I have written to the Governor of the Central Bank in this regard to request that an assessment be undertaken of the range of available sustainable restructure solutions offered by banks and non-bank entities.  I have asked that this assessment should consider in particular how the available options may impact on the distressed borrower's capacity to remain in their primary residence.  Other actions to support the position of borrowers in arrears and to adjust the legal framework are being advanced separately by the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

Last year, the underlying deficit was reduced to 1 per cent of GDP, thereby facilitating Ireland's successful exit from the excessive deficit procedure.</p>  <p>  It is important that the public finances are maintained in a sustainable position.  In this regard, our new fiscal anchor is to achieve a structural deficit of 0.5 per cent of GDP.  Based on the revised trajectory and assumptions set out in the recent Summer Economic Statement, we are on track to achieve this medium term objective, of a balanced budget in structural terms, by 2018. </p>  <p>  Once this goal is achieved, it will provide us with more flexibility to increase expenditure on priorities over the medium term.  In the short term, the estimated indicative fiscal space for 2017 is around &euro;1 billion, with the cumulative available fiscal space over the period 2017 to 2021 projected to be around &euro;11.3 billion.  This is the amount that remains after providing for pre-committed policies such as demographics etc., while still complying with the fiscal rules.</p>  <p>  Expenditure increases in the order of &euro;0.6 billion in current expenditure and &euro;0.25 billion in capital expenditure are expected from the fiscal space available for Budget 2017.  These increases will allow targeted improvements in the public services, with a particular focus on health, housing, education, disability and child development and care. </p>  <p>  One third of the available fiscal space in Budget 2017 will be allocated to taxation measures.  I have long said that the burden of income tax in Ireland is too high and that I would seek to reduce it as soon as it is prudent to do so.  I introduced measures to reduce this burden in both Budgets 2015 and 2016, with a particular focus on low and middle income earners.</p>  <p>  In the Programme for Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  Reductions will be introduced on a fair basis with an emphasis on low and middle income earners. </p>  <p>  Seperately, my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Pascal Donohoe is considering budgetary expenditure proposals which will be subject to a seperate announcement on Budget day.</p></reply>

The latest figures from the Central Bank of Ireland, show that Ireland's real harmonised competitiveness indicator (a widely used measure of competitiveness in Europe) has improved by over 20 per cent since 2008. </p>  <p>  The gains in Irish competitiveness achieved since 2008 have been hard-won through productivity improvements and wage and price moderation.  These gains, along with the stabilisation of the public finances, have helped ensure that Ireland remains an attractive location for investment.  Indeed, rapid growth in both domestic and foreign direct investment in recent years is testament to investor confidence in the Irish economy. </p>  <p>  As a small open economy it is essential that we remain a competitive, strategically important location for trade and investment as we work to expand our exports and continue to build the foundations for a solid and sustained recovery going forward.  In this regard we must be cognisant that favourable exchange rate movements can reverse, as can be seen for example in the recent strengthening of the euro against sterling.  Similarly gains from the fall in oil prices may unwind in the future.  This highlights the importance of maintaining competitiveness-oriented policies to help weather emerging uncertainties.</p></reply>

Therefore, the residential mortgage market cannot be assessed solely by looking at standard variable rate mortgages and any overall assessment of mortgage rates would need to consider the large number of different factors that influence interest rate pricing for different aspects of the overall mortgage market.  Nevertheless, as the Deputy is aware, the issue of standard variable mortgage rates is a significant one for this Government and it has made it clear that it is not acceptable for lenders to charge excessive rates on residential mortgages. </p><p>On my request the Central Bank produced a report on this issue entitled, 'Influences on Standard Variable Mortgage Pricing in Ireland'.  You will find this report available at the following link: .  This research identified three main reasons for higher mortgage interest rates in Ireland.  Firstly, the pricing of loans needs to reflect credit risks.  In Ireland these risks are elevated due to high levels of non-performing loans and the lengthy and uncertain process around collateral recovery.  Second, competition is weak.  This is not unrelated to credit risks since high credit risk deters new players from entering the market.  Third, bank profitability is still constrained by legacy issues.  As indicated, profitability is essential to ensure banks build up adequate capital buffers to meet increasing regulatory requirements and to withstand future adverse shocks and thereby make a positive contribution to the overall economy.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, I had a series of formal meetings with the main mortgage lenders last year where I outlined the Government's opinion that the standard variable rate being charged, to both existing and new Irish mortgage customers, was too high.  The banks have since reviewed their rates and subsequently reduced them which has been evidenced in the latest Central Bank statistical release on retail interest rates for July 2016.  Nevertheless, this is a policy area that the Government will keep under active review in our ongoing engagement with mortgage lenders and in implementing the Programme for Government.</p><p>The Government is of the opinion that real competition among lenders is the best way to ensure that retail lending rates are driven down in a sustainable way for the market as a whole without giving rise to potentially unforeseen and undesirable consequences for new mortgage lending.  In line with this general approach, the Programme for a Partnership Government indicates that the Government will take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider to be administered by the Central Bank of Ireland and also requesting the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out options for Government in terms of market structure, legislation and regulation to lower the cost of secured mortgage lending and improve the degree of competition and consumer protection.  Therefore, the primary policy approach of this Government in this area is to develop an overall banking policy that encourages more entrants and a vibrant banking sector with real competition in order to provide more choice to mortgage holders.  In this context, the Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank has carried out research which showed the scope for borrowers to save money by switching mortgages and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has launched a mortgage switching tool for consumers which itself notes the findings of the Central Bank research of cases were borrowers could make savings.</p></reply>

This follows on from annual growth of 3.9 per cent in the first quarter. </p><p>Importantly, economic activity is now more balanced between domestic and external sources of growth.  While the recovery in economic performance was initially led by the export sector, domestic demand is now making a strong contribution with personal consumption up 3.5 per cent in the first half of this year on an annual basis. </p><p>The economic recovery is most clearly evident in the labour market.  Employment grew by 2.9 per cent (+56,200) over the year to Q2 2016, the fifteenth successive quarter of employment growth.  The increase in employment remains broad based with gains recorded in 12 of the 14 sectors reported by the CSO.</p><p>Recent data published indicate that:</p><p>- The volume of retail sales increased by 5.2 per cent year-on-year in August 2016.  Core sales (excluding motor trades) were up by 4.1 per cent over the same period. </p><p>- New cars licensed for the first time were up 20 per cent to end-August year-on-year.</p><p>- Expansion in the construction sector continued in August with the Purchasing Managers' Index for the sector recording its thirty-sixth successive month of expansion. </p><p>- The Consumer Sentiment Index recovered most of July's post-Brexit fall as it rose to 102.7 in August 2016, from 99.6 in July.  The index remains well above its long run average. </p><p>- The seasonally-adjusted monthly unemployment rate for August was 8.3 per cent, down from 9.1 per cent in August 2015.  As a result, the unemployment rate has fallen by almost 7 per cent since its peak of over 15 per cent in early-2012.</p><p>However, there are several sources of uncertainty including the UK's decision on EU membership to which the Irish economy is particularly exposed.  In the short-term, the increased uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets could undermine confidence while the depreciation of sterling has led to a loss of competitiveness.</p><p>In addition, weaker than expected trading partner growth would negatively impact on Irish growth through reduced exports.  Growth in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) disappointed in 2015, and there are concerns regarding the growth transition in China.  EMEs have been an important growth engine in recent years, and while Ireland's direct trade exposure remains relatively small, the Irish economy would be exposed to a more generalised slowdown in the world economy.</p><p>Domestically, the high level of private debt, while falling, remains a concern, and any deterioration in the external environment could prompt households and firms to raise the pace of deleveraging, with adverse implications for domestic demand.</p><p>This uncertainty highlights the importance of prudent management of the public finances and of competitiveness-oriented policies that would help the Irish economy to weather any global economic downturn that may emerge.</p><p>In summary, I am satisfied that the economic indicators remain stable although the full impact of the UK's decision is yet to be seen.  In this regard it is critical that appropriate polices are implemented and that is what the Government intends to do.</p></reply>

In July 2015, the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing) Act 2015 (&quot;the 2015 Act&quot;) was introduced to fill the consumer protection gap where loans are sold by the original lender to an unregulated firm.</p><p>Under the 2015 Act if the firm who bought the loans from the original lender is an unregulated firm, then the loans must be serviced by a 'credit servicing firm' (Credit Servicing Firms are typically firms that manage or administer credit agreements such as mortgages or other loans on behalf of unregulated entities).  Credit Servicing Firms are required to obtain authorisation from the Central Bank in order to conduct credit servicing activities as defined in the 2015 Act.As a result, all firms who either currently operate in this area or intend to operate in this area (and meet the definition of a Credit Servicing Firm) require authorisation by the Central Bank.  </p><p>Credit servicing firms must act in accordance with Irish financial services law that applies to 'regulated financial service providers'.  This ensures that consumers, whose loans are sold to another firm, maintain the same regulatory protections that they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory Codes of Conduct issued by the Central Bank including; </p><p>- the Consumer Protection Code 2012 ('the Code'); </p><p>- the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears 2013 ('the CCMA'); </p><p>- the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015; </p><p>- the Minimum Competency Code 2011 ('the MCC');</p><p>- Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997; and</p><p>- Fitness and Probity Regulations and Standards issued under Part 3 of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010.</p><p>I would note that if a firm is servicing a portfolio of loans on behalf of a regulated lender then they do not need to be separately authorised by the Central Bank as a credit servicing firm, as this arrangement is covered under existing rules covering outsourcing that apply to all regulated financial services firms.</p><p>In addition, where the purchasers of distressed or other loan books are a financial institution (either Irish or European) they are subject to Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) which was transposed into Irish law by S.I. 158/2014 - European Union (Capital Requirements) Regulations 2014.  It is the responsibility of the relevant competent authority to ensure that any entity is meeting its obligations under CRD IV, including those related to loans held on the entity's balance sheet.</p></reply>

I have no statutory function in relation to the banking decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time and these are taken by the board and management of the relevant institution.  This includes decisions in relation to products as determined by the banks. </p><p>All viable businesses operating in Ireland should have the opportunity to access sufficient finance to meet their enterprise needs in a manner that supports growth and employment in the economy.As the Deputy will be aware, Chapter 7 (Finance for Growth) of this year's Action Plan for Jobs (APJ) sets out a range of commitments to ensure viable SME's can access appropriate finance at a reasonable cost from both bank and non-bank sources. </p><p>In line with Action 144 of the APJ, officials from my Department and the Credit Review Office continue to collate and examine data from AIB and Bank of Ireland on a monthly basis, including data pertaining to overdraft facilitates.  Furthermore, my officials meet the banks on a quarterly basis to ensure an informed understanding of the wider SME bank lending environment which assists the development and implementation of policies aimed at ensuring availability of finance and increased competition in the SME lending sector.</p><p>In relation to the restoration of overdraft facilities, both AIB and Bank of Ireland saw an increase in overdraft sanctions in 2015 compared to 2014.  It is noted, however, that overdraft utilisations have declined and this is in line with findings from the Department of Finance SME Credit Demand Survey and an indicator of increasing reliance on retained profits to meet working capital needs.

This overall trend has been driven by price developments outside of Dublin, where residential property prices have increased by 3.5 per cent over the month and by 11.3 per cent on an annual basis.  In Dublin, residential property price inflation has been more subdued, increasing by 1.6 in July and by 3.8 per cent on an annual basis.  The growth in residential property prices in July follows several months of moderation in residential property price inflation, with house price inflation of just 0.7 per cent between January and June 2016, a pattern which is likely to have been influenced by the Central Bank's macro-prudential measures.  The Deputy may wish to be aware that the IMF's latest Financial Sector Assessment Programme report published in July indicated that Irish property prices were around equilibrium levels. </p>  <p>  I wish to assure the Deputy that my Department continues to monitor developments in the property market including house prices.  The recently announced Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness outlines the Government's commitment to restore the housing market to a sustainable equilibrium.  The measures set out in the Action Plan should help to stimulate supply by streamlining the planning system, removing infrastructure blockages and supporting the delivery of affordable housing.  These measures should help make new developments economically viable in areas where supply constraints (and price pressures) are particularly acute.</p></reply>

In addition, existing schools may themselves, as a matter of routine, arrange for water testing to be carried out without recourse to my Department.  </p><p>Since 2011 to date, issues have arisen with drinking water quality in 10 schools that required remediation works.  The Department carried out testing and remediation works at 8 schools which are located in North Dublin.  A building Contractor carried out testing and remediation works in the other 2 schools which are in County Meath.</p><p>My Department is currently funding the provision of bottled water at 2 of the North Dublin Schools and the 2 Meath Schools.</p><p>Various remedial works were carried out at each of the 8 North Dublin schools.  The water has been declared safe to drink by the Local Authority at 6 of the schools.  Works at the other 2 schools are now complete and resampling and final testing is awaited before the schools can avail of drinking water.  The total cost of remediation works across the 8 schools where remediation has been completed amounted to &euro;474,000 including VAT.</p><p>In the 2 Meath schools, testing was carried out on completion of a building project which revealed exceedances of copper.  However, this was remediated and paid for by the contractor for the building project and re-testing now shows that the drinking water supply is negative for copper.  While there is no imperative for my Department to carry out further works it has arranged for additional remediation works to be undertaken to fully address the concerns of the schools and bottled drinking water is being provided pending the completion of these works.</p><p>The 8 North Dublin schools were constructed over 5 years ago and the 2 Meath schools were constructed within the last 2 years.</p><p>The average monthly cost of providing bottled water for the 2 North Dublin schools amounted to &euro;383 for the duration of the remedial works period.  The cost of the water for the 2 Meath schools is not yet available as this provision only commenced in September but it is likely to be in the same region.  </p><p>The issues uncovered in identifying the causes of these problems and specifying the necessary remedial works have been incorporated in revised School Building Technical Guidance Documents for Design Teams.</p></reply>

They are mainly statutory schemes, set up by or under Acts of the Oireachtas. Teachers in the Community School sector are members of The Secondary, Community and Comprehensive School Teachers Pension Scheme (S.I. No. 435 of 2009) while teachers in the Education and Training Boards are members of Education and Training Board Teachers Superannuation Scheme 2015 (S.I. No. 292 of 2015). </p>  <p>  There is no provision for the award of added years under the rules of Secondary, Community and Comprehensive School Teachers Pension Scheme. However, there is provision for added years under the Education and Training Boards Teachers Scheme,  where the minimum age limit specified for appointment and/or the minimum qualifications and experience specified for appointment to a professional, technical or specialist post in an Education and Training Board, would not allow a person to be appointed by age 25 and thereby acquire maximum reckonable service (40 years) by age 65. This was not seen as a requirement in the Voluntary and Community School Sector, where in general the issue did not arise. It should be noted added years are only awarded at retirement. </p>  <p>  Therefore the pension provision a teacher may be entitled to upon retirement depends not on the course they have undertaken but rather the rules of the pension scheme of which they are a member. In this regard the pension entitlements of teachers in community schools differs from Educational Training Boards and indeed Civil Servants, because they have different pension schemes. </p></reply>

Ensuring quality accommodation standards in the sector is an integral part of this process.</p><p>Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations.</p><p>Article 7 of the regulations states that each habitable room must contain a permanently fixed appliance or appliances capable of providing effective heating and that there are suitable and adequate facilities for the safe and effective removal of fumes and other products of combustion to the external air.</p><p>Article 13 provides that installations for the supply of gas shall be maintained in good repair and safe working order. There is no requirement under the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended, for landlords to carry out an annual service of home heating boilers.</p><p>Responsibility for the enforcement of the regulations rests with the relevant local authority supported by a dedicated stream of funding provided from part of the proceeds of tenancy registration fees collected by the Residential Tenancies Board (RTB).  Since the establishment of the RTB, over &euro;32 million has been paid to local authorities to assist them in the performance of their functions under the Housing Acts, including the inspection of rented accommodation.  Over 185,000 inspections have been carried out in this period.</p><p>Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, local authorities have a strengthened legislative framework available to them which provides for the issuing of Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices where landlords are in breach of their obligations.  Fines for non-compliance with the regulations were also increased; the maximum fine increased from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence increased from &euro;250 to &euro;400.</p><p>Statistics in relation to the number of inspections carried out by local authorities, the number of dwellings not meeting regulatory requirements, as well as the number of legal actions initiated can be found on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>My Department does not collate statistics in relation to the reason for enforcement procedures being taken by the relevant local authority.</p><p>To ensure that the standards reflect the requirements of a modern rental market, a review of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended, has been initiated. The dangers of carbon monoxide are among the issues being considered as part of the review, which will be concluded later in Autumn 2016.</p></reply>

The first bundle, comprising six PPP sites which is to provide over 500 units in the greater Dublin area, was announced in October 2015. The social housing is being developed at these sites in co-operation with the local authorities in each area. Two of the sites are located in Dublin City with one each in South Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and Louth.</p><p>The National Development Finance Agency is acting as the procuring authority on behalf of the Department and relevant local authorities.

All of the sites selected were assessed, having regard to considerations in respect the current provision of social housing in the irrespective areas in the context of sustainable communities, and compatibility with existing development plans.  While the units being developed are all for social housing purposes, sustainability is achieved within the wider framework of development planning for each area.</p><p>At the Scribblestown site, the design team&rsquo;s brief is for the provision of approximately 70 units of differing type and size (for example, 1 bed, 2 bed, 3 bed) together with communal open space and parking. The design team was appointed in August 2016 and the site appraisal and design development works are at an early stage. It is currently envisaged that a planning application, which will be subject to the relevant public consultation provisions, will be submitted for the site in early 2017.</p></reply>

This delivery will be achieved through collaboration between local authorities, Approved Housing Bodies, the National Treasury Management Agency and the private sector.</p><p>Prior to the publication of the new Action Plan, social housing targets and funding allocations had issued under the <i>Social Housing Strategy</i>to all local authorities in April 2015. Over &euro;1.5 billion in funding allocations was announced to support all local authorities to deliver social housing via a combination of building, buying and leasing schemes out to 2017. Those allocations and associated targets for each local authority, including Fingal, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>Following this notification of targets, announcements in respect of a substantial new set of social housing projects were made in May 2015, July 2015 and January 2016. Between these three announcements, almost &euro;680 million has been allocated for over 3,900 social housing new builds, turnkey developments and acquisitions. Details of these project approvals, including those for Fingal, are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links:</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>I am keen that local authorities advance these projects as soon as possible and have assured them that funding is available to fully support their efforts in this regard. As per the project approvals set out at the links above, I anticipate a notable ramping up in terms of both construction spend and delivery over the next year and the measures set out in <i>Rebuilding Ireland, An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>will have a direct benefit in that regard.</p><p>While social housing construction projects are being advanced, acquisitions of new and second-hand houses and apartments remains an effective means of meeting immediate social housing need. In 2015, Fingal County Council secured the purchase of 115 new social housing units. Some of these acquisitions, as well as some of the approved construction projects, were funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme whereby Approved Housing Bodies deliver social housing for those with specific needs such as elderly people, persons with intellectual or physical disability and homeless persons.  Additionally, Fingal County Council, along with all other local authorities, have received substantial support from my Department to remediate vacant social homes and make them available to those on the waiting list.</p><p>Arrangements to complete the Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016 are well advanced which will provide updated figures of national housing need, and it is expected that this will be completed by year end. Targets for social housing delivery to end 2017 have already been issued and details of these are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.</p><p>It should be noted that the allocation, by local authority area, of increased targets under the Action Plan will be linked to the Summary of Social Housing Assessments 2016.  This link will mean that the Action Plan targets will be aligned to the up-to-date, priority housing needs locally.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice Act 2006 contains provisions for civil proceedings to be taken against adults or children for anti-social behaviour.  The range of powers includes juvenile and adult cautions, fixed charge penalty notices and the bringing of prosecutions.</p>  <p>  In relation to local authority tenants, local authorities are responsible under the Housing Acts for the management and maintenance of their housing stock and the management of their estates, including taking appropriate measures to counter anti-social behaviour. </p>  <p>  Where a person is a victim of Anti-Social Behaviour from a Local Authority tenant, or from a member of their household, they should contact their local Area Housing Office to make a complaint.  In instances where there is a fear of reprisal, and the complainant wishes to have the complaint treated in confidence, his/her identity will not be disclosed to the person against whom the complaint is made. </p>  <p>  The powers of local authorities in this area were significantly enhanced with the commencement of Part 2 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 on 13 April 2015.  Part 2 provides for a revised procedure to replace section 62 of the Housing Act 1966 and strengthens the power of housing authorities to recover possession of their dwellings from households in serious breach of their tenancy agreements, including engaging in anti-social behaviour.  It also gives the local authority power to secure court orders excluding individuals engaged in anti-social behaviour from local authority housing and estates.   </p>  <p>  In the case of private rented dwellings, landlords are responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  The Act prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour. </p>  <p>  The Residential Tenancies Act also provides that a third party affected by anti-social behaviour may take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) against a landlord who has failed to enforce a tenant&rsquo;s obligation not to engage in anti-social behaviour.   </p></reply>

Pension entitlement can only be assessed on the basis of the eligibility conditions applicable on the date an individual reaches pension age.  </p><p>The first date of entry into Irish social insurance for the person concerned is recorded as January 1975, the person&rsquo;s sixteenth birthday.  Under current social welfare legislation, that is the earliest commencement point of a person&rsquo;s Irish social insurance record for state pension (contributory) eligibility purposes.  The starting age of sixteen for compulsory social insurance was introduced in the National Insurance Act, 1911 and has since remained an integral part of the Irish social insurance system.  There are no current plans to change the age of entry into insurable employment in Ireland. </p><p>It is likely that a number of significant changes will be implemented in the state pension (contributory) eligibility conditions over the coming years.  State pension age is already set to increase from 66 to 67 in 2021, and to 68 from 2028.The method by which pension entitlement is assessed will likely change to a &lsquo;total contributions based model&rsquo;, replacing the current &lsquo;yearly-average&rsquo; system. </p><p>It is important that all contributors maintain their social insurance record as fully as possible over their working life.  In the event that a person ceases insurable employment before reaching state pension age, they may wish to consider the payment of voluntary contributions in order to maintain their paid contributions insurance record.

Jobseekers are referred directly to the LES by Intreo offices.  Jobseekers may also request services from the LES on a &ldquo;walk-in&rdquo; basis.  Other groups, to whom the LES may offer services, include people who have a disability, lone parents, early school leavers, qualified adults, ex-offenders, members of the travelling community and refugees. Where these people initially present at an Intreo office they may be sent to the LES for activation services.</p><p>The following table sets out the number of LES clients at the end of 2015 and the most recent figures for 2016. <table><tr><th><div>2015</div></th><th><div>Dec-15</div></th><th><div>Aug-16</div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>13,115</div></td><td><div>10,742</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td><div>952</div></td><td><div>887</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow </td><td><div>974</div></td><td><div>315</div></td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td><div>431</div></td><td><div>443</div></td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td><div>1,728</div></td><td><div>991</div></td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td><div>1,439</div></td><td><div>849</div></td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td><div>1,077</div></td><td><div>540</div></td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td><div>2,650</div></td><td><div>1,298</div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork</td><td><div>1,373</div></td><td><div>1,028</div></td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td><div>1,233</div></td><td><div>820</div></td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td><div>2,443</div></td><td><div>797</div></td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td><div>2,906</div></td><td><div>1,157</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><div>30,321</div></td><td><div>19,867</div></td></tr></table></p><p>In line with a commitment in Pathways to Work 2016 - 2020 my Department began to reduce the number of LES clients in 2016 so as to enable the LES to provide a more intensive level of engagement to jobseekers.  LES providers were asked to engage on a more intensive basis (at least once a month) with clients to assist their progress to employment.  To facilitate this more intensive engagement, case loads were reduced during the year.  This was made possible by the additional activation capacity provided by the JobPath service which also provides activation services to the long-term unemployed.  </p><p>There are currently some 300 full-time equivalent posts in the LES and of these 170 are full-time equivalent mediator posts.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In the context of the Lansdowne Road Agreement it was agreed between management and unions that the issue of the 36 week incremental credit would be examined in relation to nurse/midwifery recruitment and retention.  On conclusion of this process and deliberations with the Department of Health my Department agreed to sanction the restoration of incremental credit for the trainees currently on placement or who would in the future be assigned a placement.  However the sanction also stated that the question of extending sanction to post 2011 nurses not in receipt of such credit may be reviewed on foot of consideration of whether the sanction granted would result in an increase in recruitment and retention rates of trainee nurses in 2016 and 2017.</p></reply>

An Post is a commercial State body that generates its income from its business operations, including through the provision of various services for Government Departments and agencies.  The company does not currently receive financial support from the Exchequer outside of the funding it receives for the provision of those services.</p><p>The postal sector has been undergoing systemic change both nationally and internationally in recent years, with the increased use of electronic communications leading to the decline in core mail volumes year on year.  In recognition of this changing business environment, the Post Office Network Business Development Group, chaired by Mr. Bobby Kerr, was established in late 2014 to examine the potential for new and existing Government services to be transacted through the post office network, and to identify new business opportunities for the network.</p><p>The final report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group, which was published in January of this year, made a number of recommendations to support the future sustainability of post offices.  These include recommendations in relation to the renewal of the post office network, the development of a basic payment account, the provision of motor tax services, and the creation of hubs around which local economic and social activity could revolve.  The report also recommended that An Post should, following appropriate consultation with postmasters and others, review and amend the five-year strategy for the post office network.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>commits to acting on the recommendations in the report of the Post Office Network Business Development Group.  A number of Working Groups have been established to progress the recommendations, including through the establishment of a Network Renewal Implementation Group, which is being independently chaired by Mr. Kerr.  This Group is examining the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.</p><p>I have separately established the Post Office Hub Working Group, to identify potential models under which the post offices could act as community hubs, especially in rural areas.  My officials are also examining the potential for the post offices to deliver services such as Motor Tax payments and a basic payment account.</p><p>The Government is therefore taking a range of measures to support the post office network to adapt to the changed business environment in which it operates. The network will, however, continue to operate within the context of An Post&rsquo;s commercial mandate.</p></reply>

In addition, a further &euro;6.158 million is provided for 2016 by way of a capital carry-over.</p>  <p>  A key driver of the increase in funding for the arts and in cultural expenditure in my Department in 2016 is the ongoing Commemorations Programme.  The allocation in 2016 is almost &euro;49 million, including &euro;31 million in capital and &euro;18 million in current expenditure.</p>  <p>  The capital allocation of almost &euro;31 million for commemorations, supplemented by &euro;6.158 million in carryover from 2015, has provided for a number of flagship projects or permanent reminders that are being progressed this year.</p>  <p>  Funding for 2016 has also supported projects which form part of the Ireland 2016 commemorative programme.  In addition, the major refurbishment of the National Gallery of Ireland continues in 2016 as well as an investment of more than &euro;39 million this year in our national cultural institutions.</p>  <p>  The important and valuable work of the Arts Council has also been recognised.  This is reflected in the 2016 current allocation of more than &euro;60 million, which is an increase of &euro;1.2 million over the 2015 allocation.  Funding of &euro;5.5 million is provided in 2016 for Culture Ireland, which includes &euro;3 million for "I am Ireland", or "Mise &Eacute;ire", the Culture Ireland international programme that forms part of the Ireland 2016 centenary programme.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government contains a very important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve.  I assure the Deputy that I am engaging with my colleagues in Government and with the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming Estimates and budgetary processes.</p>  <p>  I understand that the Deputy's reference to a figure of 0.6% of GDP is an extrapolation from a Council of Europe research project called Compendium - Cultural Policies and Trends in Europe.  Compendium collects figures on expenditure on culture in some European countries.  I understand that many European countries including ten EU member states are not included in the figures.  The data for the Compendium project are provided by independent researchers and it is not a standardised system for collection of statistics.  Apparently the Compendium itself warns that data provided by the researchers are not comparable across countries because each researcher includes different elements in the definition of culture and these elements are reflected in the figures for public expenditure.  For example, local authority expenditure on the arts, artists exemption tax relief, expenditure on public service broadcasting and the Irish language are all examples of elements not included in the Council of Europe figures for Ireland but included in the figures for some other countries.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on the arts in Ireland comes from multiple sources, both public and private.  I understand that the CSO does not produce national statistics that capture the totality of this expenditure as a percentage of GDP.</p>  <p>  As I have previously stated, I consider that further research on this issue is warranted.  The issue of a definition of culture and of capturing public expenditure on culture is an element of the draft Framework Policy &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach/Culture 2025 which I forwarded to the Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in July.</p></reply>

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include:</p>  <p>  - the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period;</p>  <p>  - the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million;</p>  <p>  - measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.</p>  <p>  The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  To date 133 people living with dementia have benefited under the funding allocated from the National Dementia Implementation Programme at an average cost of &euro;1,000 per package per week.  There are currently 85 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE will continue to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia.</p>  <p>  The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2016 provides for a target of 10.4 million Home Help Hours to support about 47,800 people.  It also provides for 15,450 Home Care Packages and 130 Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs.   A further 60 clients with dementia will be supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.  </p>  <p>  Home support services across the country are being stretched by demands from more people, and for more hours at times outside of core hours, in the evenings and at weekends, all of which cost more.  Activity in the first quarter of 2016 was ahead of the same period last year as efforts continued to alleviate pressure on the acute hospital system. </p>  <p>  The Government has been able to respond to this demand by providing an extra &euro;40m for home care in 2016.  This will ensure that the home support services provided in 2015 are maintained and that the rate of service allocation can be maintained during the summer months.  &euro;10m of this money has been ring fenced for home care as part of the new winter initiative.  The targets for 2016 will be reviewed in light of these additional resources.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government also commits to increasing provision for home care in the years ahead.  While the proposal from the Alzheimer Society will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Estimates exercise for 2017, at this stage I cannot predict what the outcome of that consideration will be.</p></reply>

Following on from the meeting I have written to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform concerning restoration of the credit to those who graduated between 2011 and 2015.</p>  <p>  Incremental Credit for the 36 week clinical placement was abolished by the then Government in December 2010. Having considered a submission made on behalf of the Nursing representative bodies, the INMO, the PNA and SIPTU Nursing and the Department of Health and the HSE, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform sanctioned recognition of the 36 week placement as qualifying for incremental credit for students on a placement in 2016 and into the future on 19   February 2016. </p>  <p>  It is recognised that recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives is a significant issue at present. This is due to a range of factors including intense competition globally and from private providers for nurses due to a world wide shortage and the international standing of public nurses trained in Ireland, working conditions and lifestyle choices. I am committed to making terms and conditions for all nurses and midwives working in the Irish public health system as attractive as possible.</p></reply>

The management of scoliosis is complex and is determined by the severity of the curvature and skeletal maturity.</p>  <p>  Long waiting times for scoliosis surgery are not acceptable, and my Department has been working closely with the HSE to address services pressures, particularly in Our Lady's Children's Hospital Crumlin (OLCHC), which is the largest provider of scoliosis surgery for children and young people. Additional funding of &euro;1.042m was allocated under the 2015 Service Plan to increase capacity at OLCHC, and an additional orthopaedic surgeon, anaesthetist, and support staff, are now in place with recruitment of a further additional orthopaedic surgeon underway. Capital funding was also provided for a new theatre on site to expand theatre capacity further, and this is currently being commissioned.  The Children's Hospital Group is proactively working on nurse recruitment to support the opening of the new theatre. </p>  <p>  The HSE Winter Initiative 2016-2017, published on 9 September, also includes &euro;2m provided specifically for scoliosis patients to treat 39 adolescent patients on the Tallaght waiting list and an additional 15-20 paediatric patients from the Crumlin waiting list by year end.</p>  <p>  I recently met with a number of scoliosis advocacy groups to discuss their concerns and my Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery.  In relation to the specific query, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

In order to address the ongoing difficulties in the Dairy markets at EU and international level, the Commission presented a further package of measures at the Agri-Fish Council on 18 July 2016.  The main component of the package is a fund of &euro;500 million, which  in turn comprises  two elements:</p>  <p>- The  first is a &euro;150 million EU-wide measure to compensate farmers for reducing their milk output in the final quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 (at a rate of 14c/kg).  The detailed rules regarding this measure were agreed at EU level on August 25 and the Commission provided the legal provisions to give effect to this measure earlier this month.  The Scheme is currently being implemented in Ireland and some 4,400 milk  producers have applied, indicating that they propose to reduce milk production by 72 million litres in the Oct &ndash; Dec 2016 period over the same period last year.</p>  <p>- The second element of the EU July 2016 package, to which the Deputy refers, is a &euro;350 million fund that will be allocated to Member States in the form of  national envelopes, which each Member State can use in accordance with domestic circumstances.  Whilst eligibility criteria will apply, Member States are afforded a large degree of flexibility in terms of the measures they might adopt.  Ireland&rsquo;s allocation from the fund will be &euro;11.09 million.  Member States will be required to notify the Commission by 1 November 2016 of the measures to be adopted.</p>  <p>  I will consider the question of additional national funding in the context of the overall budgetary process and taking into account the finite resources available and the demands from across the agri food sector.</p></reply>

The board has also indicated that it is  fully agreed that there was no intention to incorrectly inform the Minister or misrepresent its views.

It would not be appropriate to publish the expected cost of building the network or the likely cost to the State while a major public procurement process is underway . I do not intend therefore to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters. Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process.</p><p>On 29 September 2015, the Government's 6 year Capital Plan, <i>Building on Recovery</i>, was published.  It includes an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan (NBP).  This allocation provides the <i>initial</i>stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention and it is expected that further funding will be available over the lifetime of any contract(s).  Funding of &euro;75m is committed through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). </p><p>The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.  When final tenders have been submitted a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the NBP Intervention Strategy. </p><p>The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on a number of factors including the number of qualified bidders and the complexities that may be encountered during the procurement process.  It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p><p>In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be &quot;technology neutral&quot; and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear. </p><p>As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP . It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p><p>In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I  established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Task force will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the task force will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Task force's report. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and through a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.  The formal procurement process for the State Intervention commenced in December 2015.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:</p>  <p>  - The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  The Department continues to monitor the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE area to ensure that those services are delivered.</p>  <p>  - The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention.  Premises within this area will get services of at least 30mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.</p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode.  The Department also has a dedicated mailbox and anyone with a query in relation to the Map should email the Department, quoting their Eircode, to  broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.   </p>  <p>  Over 750,000 premises are the focus for the procurement process, which formally commenced in December 2015 with the publication of the Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (&lsquo;PQQ&rsquo;) and Project Information Memorandum.  On 5 July, I announced that my Department has also identified that up to an additional 170,000 premises which are currently market BLUE on the High Speed Broadband Map are unlikely to get access to services.  My Department is conducting further analysis to identify these additional premises with a view to including them in the formal procurement process.  This work will conclude in the coming months and will be reflected in a further update to the High Speed Broadband Map.</p>  <p>  The Department commenced the Invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) phase of the procurement process in July and is  engaged in the formal dialogue process with the three qualifying bidders.  Following the conclusion of the Dialogue Phase and an invitation to bidders to submit detailed draft proposals, the Department will issue final tender documentation to bidders.

It must be noted that bidders will need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at these stages of the process.</p>  <p>  In preparation for the procurement stage of the process my Department investigated how different technical solutions could be used to deliver high speed broadband.  In line with EU State Aid rules, the process must be "technology neutral" and it is not therefore possible to specify what technology should be used to build the network.  As part of the procurement process bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the NBP service requirements.  It is recognised however, that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of what technology is used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders is chosen the technology(ies) to be deployed will become clear. </p>  <p>  As part of the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated that it could take 3-5 years to roll out a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  It is however open to bidder(s) to suggest more aggressive timescales as part of their bids.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best roll-out strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and-or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network roll-out plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the roll-out of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.  The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country. </p>  <p>  In line with commitments in the Programme for Government I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Task Force with my colleague Minister Humphreys in July 2016.  The Task force will recommend practical actions that can be taken in the short-term to improve mobile phone and broadband access in Ireland, working with Government Departments, Local Authorities, ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The work of the task force will also assist Local Authorities in preparing for the roll-out of the new NBP network once contract(s) are in place.  I expect that Minister Humphreys and I will bring proposals to Government by the end of 2016, on foot of the Task force's report. </p></reply>

At that meeting Bus &Eacute;ireann management raised the issue of the loss-making in the company's commercial "Expressway" service and indicated a desire to open discussions with trade unions as regards potential options to address these losses which are significant and impacting upon the Company's overall financial performance.  Last year for example the Company lost &euro;5 million and losses this year are expected to reach approximately &euro;6million.  Clearly the losses require the Board and management of the Company to examine available options in order to restore financial stability and safeguard the interests of employees, stakeholders and the general public. </p>  <p>  The issues facing the Company have obviously informed discussions held between my Department and the Company in recent months.  On 12 September I met the Chair and CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann, who gave me a wide ranging overview of the challenges and opportunities faced by the company across all of its business units - school transport services, PSO services and the commercial Expressway service.  A number of issues were discussed including an outline for the future of the company and the need to find a reasonable way forward from its present loss-making position.  The meeting did not discuss any detailed plan and at no stage did I convey any agreement whatsoever; the meeting was a briefing on relevant issues, and was one of a series of meetings I have been having with the heads of the State entities under my aegis.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Board is concerned to address the level of losses and has been working to find a way to return the company to a sustainable position.  In this regard, I welcome the Company's statement earlier this week that it is commissioning an independent review of its plans and hope that through this, combined with open engagement with employees, a way forward can be found which will restore the Company to profitability and allow it move forward in a sustainable manner.</p></reply>

The projects that were the subject of my announcement earlier this month were all approved at this maximum 75% aid rate.</p><p>As the Deputy has indicated, the EU Guidelines provide that, in certain limited circumstances, an aid rate exceeding 75% may be justified in exceptional circumstances for airports with traffic volume below 1 million passengers per annum.  In such a scenario, the EU Commission have indicated that a business case, justifying the proposed higher aid rate, would have to be approved by them. </p><p>Clearly, the EU Commission view any support above the 75% level as an exception, rather than the norm. </p><p>I believe that having the public purse pick up the tab for three-quarters of the cost of airport investments removes a considerable financial burden from our regional airports and it is not unreasonable that these airport companies should fund the balance from their own resources.</p><p>I am aware, however, that IWAK has indicated that, even with the maximum level (75%) of capital support allowed for under the EU Guidelines, they believe that they will be unable to finance their two major upcoming projects &ndash; an apron extension and an overlay of the runway.  My Department has indicated to IWAK that we will support the making a case to the EU Commission to permit a 90% aid rate for these two planned major projects.</p><p>I should also mention that under the Public Policy Remit Capital (PPR-C) Scheme of the Regional Airports Programme, former Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe announced &euro;1.2m in funding last April for the four regional airports.  The PPR-C Scheme caters for projects and operations at the airports which are generally obligatory under national or international aviation requirements and which involve costs for the airports that generate no economic return (e.g. Air Traffic Control, fire services, security services, etc).  Exchequer support for PPR-C projects is not regarded as State aid and the support provided by my Department under this Scheme is at the 90% level.​</p></reply>

At that meeting Bus &Eacute;ireann management raised the issue of the loss-making in the company's commercial "Expressway" service and indicated a desire to open discussions with trade unions as regards potential options to address these losses which are significant and impacting upon the Company's overall financial performance.  Last year for example the Company lost &euro;5 million and losses this year are expected to reach approximately &euro;6million.  Clearly the losses require the Board and management of the Company to examine available options in order to restore financial stability and safeguard the interests of employees, stakeholders and the general public. </p>  <p>  The issues facing the Company have obviously informed discussions held between my Department and the Company in recent months.  On 12 September I met the Chair and CEO of Bus &Eacute;ireann, who gave me a wide ranging overview of the challenges and opportunities faced by the company across all of its business units - school transport services, PSO services and the commercial Expressway service.  A number of issues were discussed including an outline for the future of the company and the need to find a reasonable way forward from its present loss-making position.  The meeting did not discuss any detailed plan and at no stage did I convey any agreement whatsoever; the meeting was a briefing on relevant issues, and was one of a series of meetings I have been having with the heads of the State entities under my aegis.</p>  <p>  I am aware that the Board is concerned to address the level of losses and has been working to find a way to return the company to a sustainable position.  In this regard, I welcome the Company's statement earlier this week that it is commissioning an independent review of its plans and hope that through this, combined with open engagement with employees, a way forward can be found which will restore the Company to profitability and allow it move forward in a sustainable manner.</p></reply>

The projects that were the subject of my announcement earlier this month were all approved at this maximum 75% aid rate.</p><p>As the Deputy has indicated, the EU Guidelines provide that, in certain limited circumstances, an aid rate exceeding 75% may be justified in exceptional circumstances for airports with traffic volume below 1 million passengers per annum.  In such a scenario, the EU Commission have indicated that a business case, justifying the proposed higher aid rate, would have to be approved by them. </p><p>Clearly, the EU Commission view any support above the 75% level as an exception, rather than the norm. </p><p>I believe that having the public purse pick up the tab for three-quarters of the cost of airport investments removes a considerable financial burden from our regional airports and it is not unreasonable that these airport companies should fund the balance from their own resources.</p><p>I am aware, however, that IWAK has indicated that, even with the maximum level (75%) of capital support allowed for under the EU Guidelines, they believe that they will be unable to finance their two major upcoming projects &ndash; an apron extension and an overlay of the runway.  My Department has indicated to IWAK that we will support the making a case to the EU Commission to permit a 90% aid rate for these two planned major projects.</p><p>I should also mention that under the Public Policy Remit Capital (PPR-C) Scheme of the Regional Airports Programme, former Transport Minister Paschal Donohoe announced &euro;1.2m in funding last April for the four regional airports.  The PPR-C Scheme caters for projects and operations at the airports which are generally obligatory under national or international aviation requirements and which involve costs for the airports that generate no economic return (e.g. Air Traffic Control, fire services, security services, etc).  Exchequer support for PPR-C projects is not regarded as State aid and the support provided by my Department under this Scheme is at the 90% level.​</p></reply>

In accordance with this my Department operates an Ineligible Categories of Employment List (ICEL) which is reviewed biannually. The occupation of Stone Mason is included on the current ICEL. In addition, at the time of application the employee was in the State without current immigration permission. Also, although the employer sought this application under my Department&rsquo;s Trusted Partner initiative they were not registered as a Trusted Partner under the scheme.</p><p>The application was also refused for a number of reasons that relate specifically to the category of employment permit sought: the annual remuneration stated was less than &euro;40,000, the prescribed remuneration in respect of permits of this type;<b></b>the contractor did not made appropriate arrangements to provide board or accommodation or health insurance for the foreign national for the period they are due to be in the State; the foreign national was not employed by the contractor for at least 6 months prior to this application as required; supporting documentation indicated that the foreign national concerned may not be employed by the contractor concerned during the period for which the employment permit is to be granted. Finally, as the application was not on my Department&rsquo;s Highly Skilled Eligible Occupations List (HSEOL), as it was not supported by an Enterprise Development Agency such as IDA Ireland, or Enterprise Ireland, and as the annual salary stated was less than &euro;60,000, the employer was obliged to undertake a Labour Market Needs Test. This Test, which ensures that job opportunities are made available to Irish and EEA nationals, was not undertaken by the employer as required.</p><p>The applicant has been informed that in accordance with Section 13 of the Employment Permits Act 2006, as amended, they may seek a review of this refusal decision within twenty-eight (28) days from the date of refusal letter. To date no such request for review has been received.</p></reply>

The ABC Programme commenced in 2013 and was co-funded for the period 2013 to 2017 in the amount of &euro;29.7m, providing areas with multi annual budgets. The aim of the programme is to test and evaluate prevention and early intervention approaches in 13 areas of disadvantage in Ireland to improve outcomes for children, in particular children and families living in poverty. The focus of the work under the ABC Programme covers: Child Health &amp;amp; Development; Children&rsquo;s Learning; Parenting; and Integrated Service Delivery.  </p>  <p>  Prior to the ABC Programme, the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP) ran from 2007-2013.  PEIP funding amounted to &euro;36m and funded the following three organisations: youngballymun, Childhood Development Initiative Tallaght, and the Preparing for Life Programme Darndale. </p>  <p>  When combined with the funding provided to the PEIP programme since 2007, the total spend on both programmes will be &euro;67.1m. </p>  <p>  The Government is fully committed to ensuring that learning from all sites funded under the ABC programme will inform other services and supports for children in the area of prevention and early intervention. Such an approach would offer a greater reach, in scope and depth, which will in turn enhance outcomes for children throughout the country.  While the National evaluation of the ABC programme will not be complete until 2018, the Department is currently reviewing the emerging learning from the programme in terms of design and implementation and having regard to most recent developments in our own policy domain and in other related areas. It is acknowledged given Programme for Government commitments that some decisions will need to be made on the future of the programme in advance of the completion of all the elements of the evaluation.</p>  <p>  The Department is preparing a paper on the options for a future ABC Programme.  The paper will set out the optimum course(s) of action for the future of an area-based approach in line with Programme for Government commitments.  It is intended that the Minister will present a Memo for Government in the coming months in relation to the Programme for Government Commitments. </p></reply>

Each year, some 600 local youth clubs benefit from the scheme. </p>  <p>  The youth club in question may wish to contact Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board regarding their applying for funding in 2017. </p></reply>
