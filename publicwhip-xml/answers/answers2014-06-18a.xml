    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-18a.11.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061800067#WRA01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 12, 26 and 123 together.  </p><p>  One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the EAG was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of PDF personnel.  The EAG's report was accepted by Government in 1995. </p><p>  In an effort to alleviate the situation, the Government had already decided in 1993 to enlist personnel on a five year contract basis, following consultation with Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA).  In 1997 agreement was reached with PDFORRA on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces.  This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years, subject to meeting standards of medical and physical fitness and conduct.  Longer periods of service were envisaged for Non Commissioned Officers. </p><p>  In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the PDF after 1 January, 1994.  A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1 January 1994 while continuing to address the Government&rsquo;s objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern Defence Forces.</p><p>  The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.</p><p>  The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, up to and including the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service. </p><p>- Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years.</p><p>- Enlisted Personnel in all higher ranks may serve to the age of fifty-six.</p><p>  With the approach of 2015 the first effects of the agreement, whereby Privates and Corporals may not serve beyond 21 years, will be felt by Permanent Defence Force members in those ranks.  A claim has been received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter.  In accordance with normal procedures the Association&rsquo;s claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  I understand that discussions are taking place with the Representative Association under a special Subcommittee of Conciliation Council.  As discussions are confidential to the parties involved in accordance with the terms of the Scheme, I do not in any way want to prejudice them or impact on their outcome. </p><p>  However, I do understand the concerns it raises for enlisted personnel due to be discharged in terms of their personal circumstances and the impact on their families.  I am sure that all matters raised by PDFORRA on behalf of their members are being comprehensively examined at Conciliation Council.  I am also cognisant of the need for continuing recruitment to the Defence Forces of young and fit men and women so that the Defence Forces can discharge all the roles assigned to them by Government, both at home and overseas.  It was for this very reason that this policy was introduced in the first place. </p><p>  As the negotiation process with the Representative Association is very much ongoing, I would not like to pre-empt or second guess the outcome of current discussions at Conciliation Council, and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue publicly at this time.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-18a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061800067#WRA01300"><p>In October 2002 the Defence Forces introduced a Compulsory Random Drug Testing programme.  The primary objective of Compulsory Random Drug Testing is deterrence.  The Defence Forces policy on drug and substance abuse or misuse is based on the premise that unlawful possession, supply or use of a controlled drug is incompatible with membership of the Defence Forces.  Drug and substance abuse, because of its insidious nature, and because of the possible residual effects on the abuser, is particularly dangerous in the military environment and incompatible with military life.  Military personnel are entrusted with the responsibility of using firearms and other lethal equipment.  Drug misuse has serious implications for the safety of members of the public as well as fellow soldiers.  The nature of military service, therefore, requires that military personnel are free from the presence or influence of any controlled drug or substance.  All members of the Defence Forces are aware that they are liable for testing.  Any member who tests positive is liable to be removed from the Defence Forces.</p><p>  The compulsory random drug testing process focuses on providing a credible and robust deterrent.  The random nature of testing ensures that there is a fair system of monitoring members of the Defence Forces and involves the provision of a urine sample.  Any sample that initially tests unclear is sent to accredited drug testing laboratories for more detailed analysis.  I am advised by the military authorities that there are no issues with regard to the reliability of the testing. </p><p>  Each case involving a positive drug test is individually considered on its merits.  An effective appeals mechanism is in place.  Only in appropriate circumstances is an administrative discharge decided upon.  Because of the Defence Forces' duty of care not just to its members but also to the wider public it is not considered that the administrative discharge in appropriate cases is excessive and there are no plans to amend this option. </p></reply>

There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters.  The Defence Forces have deployed personnel to Shannon Airport, in response to requests for support from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, since 5 February 2003.  <font color="#FFFFFF">  </font></p><p>There were 32 security deployments carried out by the Defence Forces at Shannon Airport in April of this year, 35 in May and 16 up to 12 June last.  The length of each such deployment and the number of relevant aircraft that land and take off during each deployment can vary.  For example, if a single aircraft is on the ground for an extended period, perhaps overnight, or over a number of days, this would involve more than one deployment of troops as each shift is generally of 12 hours duration  . </p><p>The Defence Forces have no responsibility for searching foreign Military aircraft that land at Shannon and there is no record kept by the Military of the country of origin of each aircraft.  I understand these records are kept by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as foreign Military aircraft are provided with diplomatic clearance to land in Ireland by that Department.</p><p>With regard to inspections of aircraft being carried out by  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I would advise that this is a matter that should be addressed to the Minister for Justice and Equality  but my understanding is that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not carry out searches of foreign Military aircraft. </p></reply>

Recruitment of personnel to the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps is determined in line with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  In line with HR policy there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force.  Targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the level of 9,500 trained personnel and to ensure the ongoing deployable capacity of the Defence Forces on operations.</p><p>  To this end, a new General Service recruitment competition was launched in March 2014.  The Defence Forces plan to induct up to 400 enlisted personnel to the Permanent Defence Force in 2014 within the resource envelope allocated to Defence.</p><p>  In addition, a Cadetship Competition for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is currently under way.  It is planned to award a total of 40 Cadetships from this competition comprising of 20 Army, 9 Air Corps and 11 Naval Service Cadetships.  An Air Corps Apprentice Trainee Technician competition was also launched in May 2014, from which it is planned to recruit 20 Apprentice Trainee Technicians this year.</p><p>  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas. 				 </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-18a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061800067#WRA01900"><p>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.  While some progress has been made by the Military Authorities in addressing gaps between male and female participation in the Defence Forces, it is recognised that more work needs to be done to meet the gender target for recruitment of females of 20% which was set by the Military Authorities in 2007.  </p><p>As at 30 April 2014, the latest date for which figures are available there were 555 women out of a total strength of 9,110 serving in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF).  This represents 6.1% of the overall strength of the Defence Forces. </p><p>A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces including:</p><p>- the introduction of best practices in recruitment, such as the adjustment of physical standards for female applicants,</p><p>- special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment,</p><p>- there is balanced composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards,</p><p>- all promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit,</p><p>- a Gender Adviser has been appointed to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces. </p><p>Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and overseas.</p><p>The Defence Forces also prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment.  Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks.  The Military Authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner when it arises.<i></i>However, a key impediment in achieving the target gender balance is the lack of female applicants relative to males. </p><p>I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that not alone support increased female participation in the Defence Forces but also support increased diversity. The personnel profile of the Defence Forces should reflect the changing demographic and multicultural nature of Irish Society.  To this end, as part of the recent recruitment campaign for enlisted personnel and the Reserve, specific efforts were made to increase the number of female applicants.  This was part of a wider campaign aimed at improving gender and ethnic representation and diversity in the Defence Forces.  In the case of female participation, these efforts included school visits, media engagement including national and local radio, targeting sports clubs and use of social media.  At the closing date for this recruitment campaign on 9 April 2014 there were 755 Female applicants or 10.3% out of a total of 7,295 applicants for the Permanent Defence Force and 320 female applicants or 14.9% out of a total of 2,146 applicants for the Reserve Defence Force.  On the face of it these figures appear to be disappointing. However, I believe that a key issue in recruiting and retaining female personnel lies in societal perception and attitudes to female soldiers and officers.  Much of the solution to this lies outside the control and influence of the Defence Forces.   </p></reply>

This investment strategy was underscored by the commitment in the 2000 White Paper on Defence to ensure an eight ship flotilla.   As the Deputy may be aware, the first of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels was commissioned last month, as the L.E. Samuel Beckett, and has been deployed and is now on its maiden patrol in Irish waters. </p><p>  A second purpose built Off Shore Patrol Vessel, the L.E. James Joyce, is scheduled for delivery in early 2015.  This will be similar in design to the L.E. Samuel Beckett. </p><p>  Under the contract with Babcock International for the provision of these two new Vessels, there is an option for a further third ship to be delivered.  Following recent negotiations with the shipbuilder, an order has been placed for a third and identical Vessel at a price of &euro;54m, excluding VAT. </p><p>  By taking up this option the Department has secured that the third ship will be acquired on the basis of the actual build costs of LE Samuel Beckett.  This ensures that the vessel replacement programme is conducted in the most cost effective and timely manner.  In addition, the Department secures an added advantage of standardising the new Vessels coming into the fleet.  </p><p>  This Third ship, for delivery in mid 2016, will be identical in build to the recently commissioned L&Eacute; Samuel Beckett and the L&Eacute; James Joyce.  </p><p>  This vessel replacement strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level. </p><p>  The acquisition of these new vessels with the very latest equipment suites will ensure that the Naval Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the State&rsquo;s sovereign rights over our waters and meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection.</p><p>  The forthcoming White Paper on Defence will address the future capability requirements for the Defence Forces encompassing the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service.  </p></reply>

The Gulfstream IV was acquired in December 1991 and to date has accumulated over<font color="#FF0000"> </font>13,100 flying hours.  The Service provides the Government and the President with an independent, flexible, and effective air transport service to assist in meeting national and international obligations.The Service helps Ministers to fulfill their duties, both at home and abroad, to the greatest extent possible and with maximum efficiency.  This flexibility was particularly valuable during Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the European Union last year.  In addition, the availability of the Service for special tasks in times of crisis ensures an independent means of transport on critical occasions which, for an island nation, is very important.In the past 12 months, the Gulfstream IV aircraft has undertaken 43 missions, including long haul flights to destinations such as the United States, the Middle East and Russia.</p><p>It is important to point out that both the Gulfstream IV and Learjet 45 aircraft also perform a range of non-MATS taskings, such as humanitarian and air ambulance missions.  For example, during 2013, these aircraft were used on eight occasions to transport critically ill patients for life-saving treatment in hospitals in Ireland or the United Kingdom.</p><p>While the Gulfstream IV is now 23 years in service, there are no plans to sell the aircraft.  However, given its age, the matter is kept under review having regard to its maintenance requirements and other considerations.  Any decision to sell this aircraft will ultimately be a matter for Government.  </p></reply>

The properties in question comprise a terrace of 16 houses.  Three of the houses had previously been reconfigured by combining adjacent houses with the result that there are now 13 individual units in the terrace overall.</p><p>  The assessment indicates that, in order to be viable for military purposes as multi-occupancy Single-Living-In accommodation, adjacent properties would best be combined to give a smaller number of larger units.  The assessment also indicates that the properties are in a very poor state of repair and that the estimated cost of repairs necessary to make them suitable as accommodation is simply prohibitive.</p><p>  While the outcome of the assessment is still under consideration it is clear that any renovation would be very costly, would only deliver around half the number of viable units and would be very limited in terms of future military needs.  At this stage, this is not considered to be a cost effective solution to meeting accommodation needs in the Curragh.</p><p>  This assessment was undertaken as the block overall appeared to be structurally sound and contained a sizeable number of houses, the majority of which were vacant.  Given the outcome of the assessment in this case there appears to be little prospect that the outcome would be much different were other individual or small groups of houses assessed.  Consequently there are no plans to expand the assessment to include all residential units in the Camp.</p><p>  The Curragh Camp is a key military installation.  Among its many functions it houses the Defence Forces Training Centre and as such it operates as the main training facility for military personnel from across all formations.</p><p>  It has been Department policy since 1997 to discontinue the provision of married quarters across all military installations, as they are no longer a requirement of the modern solider.  Where personnel are now required for military purposes to be accommodated in barracks this is done on a Single-Living-In basis i.e. the military personnel but not their families are accommodated for the duration of the requirement.</p><p>  In recent years, some vacated former married quarter properties within the Camp have been retained, refurbished and reallocated for use by the military to provide short-term accommodation on a multi-occupancy basis for those military personnel who are temporarily based at the training centre. </p><p>  Expenditure from the Defence Vote can only be justified in the context of meeting the needs of the Defence Forces in accordance with Defence policy in a cost effective manner. </p><p>  It is important to remember that the Department does not have a role in providing housing assistance for military personnel on social housing lists or for members of the public in general. </p></reply>

The purpose of the pilot is to assess the level and type, if any, of a dedicated EAS service needed to support the National Ambulance Service in the west of Ireland for certain types of patient.  The pilot is focused particularly on the requirements of the HSE Clinical Care Programmes, such as Acute Coronary Syndrome and Stroke.</p><p>   In accordance with the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, the Department of Defence recoups from the HSE the costs of the Air Corps' participation in the service.  These include fixed costs, which are salaries and related personnel costs, as well as day-to-day operating costs.  The total costs arising from the second full year of the EAS pilot i.e. from June 2013 to the end of May 2014, amounted to &euro;1,719,522.</p><p>   In addition, in accordance with a long-standing agreement between the Departments of Defence and Health, the Air Corps also operates an emergency inter-hospital air ambulance service. The costs incurred by the Air Corps in providing this service are well in excess of &euro;1 million per annum and these costs are absorbed entirely by the Department of Defence without charge to the HSE. </p></reply>

Therefore, there is no way of providing this information without examining every medical record of every person discharged.  In January 2011 the Department established a working group to examine the use of Lariam and other anti-malarial drugs in the Defence Forces.  The Group comprises military and civil officials and representatives from the State Claims Agency and the Chief State Solicitors Office.  </p><p>  The purpose of this Group was to review issues arising in relation to the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of the current and potential litigation; to review and confirm the Defence Forces approach in relation to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis in the Defence Forces; and to ensure that the procedures in relation thereto continue to be appropriate and in accordance with best medical practice as promulgated by the relevant medical authorities.  The work of the Group informs the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s process of ongoing risk assessment and mitigation in the context of a proactive Risk Management Strategy.</p><p>  The Group reported back to the previous Minister in June 2013.  The Report was produced in the context of current and potential litigation and is, therefore, legally privileged.  I can confirm that the Group investigated all the various issues surrounding the use of Lariam and obtained advice from leading medical experts.  These experts concur with the practices followed by the Defence Forces in prescribing Lariam.</p><p>  The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is the statutory authority with responsibility for the quality, safety and efficacy of medicines in Ireland.  The Defence Forces Medical Corps complies with its guidelines on the prescription of medicines, including Lariam.  I am advised that Lariam is one of the most effective medications for protection against the type of malaria prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa.  It continues to be licensed by the IMB.  The Defence Forces are fully aware of the range of reported side affects attaching to all anti-malaria medications.  I am advised that protocols are in place to control the risk of side effects in individuals.</p><p>  The Defence Forces follow best international practice in prescribing Lariam.  It is the policy of the Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability, i.e. a medical risk assessment for Lariam is carried out on an individual basis.  This is intended to rule out personnel from overseas service with certain conditions, e.g. depression, anxiety, pregnancy, neurodegenerative disorders etc. which, as has been indicated by the IMB, are more likely to precipitate serious adverse reactions to Lariam.  Lariam remains licensed by the IMB and must remain in the formulary of medication prescribed by the Medical Corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions, particularly those in sub-Saharan Africa, to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by this highly dangerous disease. </p></reply>

Under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990, the Defence Forces Representative Associations are prohibited from being associated with, or affiliated to any trade unions, or any other body without the consent of the Minister. Accordingly, the Representative Association PDFORRA cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present.  </p><p>The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.   The Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties and conflicts could arise in these circumstances if the Defence Forces Representative Associations were associated with, or affiliated to ICTU, given ICTU rules in relation to such matters.  A number of mechanisms have been put in place through the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme to compensate for the prohibition on affiliation to ICTU.  These provide the Representative Associations with structures and processes, which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members. </p><p>  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level.  This parallel process was successfully operated in respect of last year's rounds of discussions, facilitated by the Labour Relations Commission, on an extension to the &lsquo;Public Service Agreement 2010 &ndash; 2014&rsquo; leading to the Haddington Road Agreement.</p><p>An Taoiseach and Minister for Defence remains satisfied with the present arrangements in place and has no plans to make any changes.</p></reply>

This was undertaken in order to enhance operational readiness and deployability whilst reducing numbers involved in administration.  This re-organisation led to a re-configuration of the Defence Forces operational processes from a garrison-based system to a more flexible, deployable system that makes more efficient use of all resources, including financial.  Units and personnel can be temporarily re-deployed across areas of operations to meet specific security taskings and framework operations as required by the military authorities.</p><p>  I have been advised by the military authorities that, for the most part, personnel are only deployed within their own Brigade area. However, on occasion personnel from Donegal for example, have been redeployed for security operations to other locations, including Dublin which is a key centre for large scale operations and ceremonial activity for the Defence Forces. It is important that military personnel have experience of the full range of duties of being part of a military force. This requires their deployment to locations where they can gain that experience.</p><p>  It is essential that the military authorities have the capacity to deploy appropriate forces to wherever required in order to meet security and other taskings and it is my intention to retain this flexibility within the Defence Forces.</p></reply>

The Strategy prioritises the further implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, and the Agreements which flowed from it, through community, academic and advocacy work.  Currently about 150 organisations per year are awarded funding for project work.  The new strategy also makes provision to develop a new multiannual funding framework for a small number of organisations who will become strategic partners of the Fund for a three-year period.  Such organisations must have already received project-level funding from the Fund.  Up to five strategic partners will be approved each year.  The criteria for selecting strategic partners are detailed in the strategy.  It is envisaged that the first tranche of multiannual funding will be implemented in 2015.  A number of support groups for victims of the conflict in this jurisdiction and in Northern Ireland have received project funding in the past.  Most recently, in May 2014, I approved an award of &euro;48,000 for the Pat Finucane Centre-Justice for the Forgotten.  Organisations working in this and other sectors may apply to become strategic partners if they meet the eligibility criteria and their applications will be assessed against the criteria outlined in the strategy.</p></reply>

Diplomatic relations were established between our two countries in 1999, and bilateral engagement has increased steadily in the period since then.In 2013, bilateral trade in goods with Cuba reached &euro;1.35 million, an increase from the figure of &euro;1.2 million in 2012.  In keeping with my wish to see relations with Cuba developed in various areas, including trade, the Ambassador of Ireland to Mexico, who is also accredited to Cuba, held a number of meetings in Cuba earlier this year. These meetings included contacts with Ministries on various trade and economic issues of interest. The Embassy will continue to engage with Cuba on these issues.</p><p>  Ireland also engages in activity in other areas with a view to enhancing our bilateral engagement.  The Irish Embassy accredited to Cuba organised a successful Irish cultural week in Havana in May 2013, focusing on Irish film and Irish traditional music. Discussions are ongoing with the Cuban authorities regarding future collaboration on cultural projects.</p><p>I am also pleased that the EU is currently in negotiations with Cuba on a Political Dialogue and Co-operation Agreement. Such an agreement would strengthen the EU-Cuba relationship and provide an improved framework for   political dialogue, economic relations and cooperation in the period ahead.</p><p>  We will continue to work with Cuba to strengthen ties and facilitate trade between our countries.</p></reply>

The company was established by the insurance companies following an Agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland. The principal role of MIBI is to compensate innocent third party victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles. This is regulated under the terms of an Agreement between the MIBI and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. </p><p>I have consulted with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, who has responsibility for motor insurance policy, on this matter.  Neither I nor the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport are aware of reports of citizens unable to get a response from the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland (MIBI) in respect of on-going issues with Setanta Insurance. </p><p>I have also consulted with MIBI and they have advised me as follows:</p><p>-  The MIBI has received hundreds of letters, enquiries and claim notifications since the news of the insolvency of Setanta Insurance on 17 April 2014.   All of these have been responded to. </p><p>-  The MIBI is responsible for compensating innocent third party victims of road traffic accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles under its 2009 Agreement with the Government.   The MIBI is funded entirely by premiums paid by insured policyholders and has a responsibility to ensure that all its payments are appropriate and fair.</p><p>-  The situation of Setanta Insurance whereby a company authorised and supervised by a regulator other than the Central Bank of Ireland, yet has conducted all its business solely in Ireland and has gone into liquidation, is believed to be unprecedented.   Given this fact and the potential impact on insurance premiums MIBI is taking legal advice as regards its role and responsibilities. </p><p>-  The MIBI is continuously reviewing all of the issues involved and is in active communication with the many stakeholders in the situation.    The MIBI will assist in any way it can to bring clarity to the matter.      </p><p>-    The MIBI can be contacted on or on 01 676 9944.</p><p>-  The arrangements put in place by MIBI for dealing with the Setanta claims is a matter for the MIBI itself under the terms of the Agreement and as such it falls outside my remit to issue instructions to MIBI.  My Department is endeavouring to clarify the position on a number of legal matters relating to policyholders' claims for compensation, including the role of MIBI in this regard. If, for legal reasons, MIBI is not in a position to accept a claim, these third party claims will be eligible to proceed for consideration by the High Court for compensation from the Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF). All ICF payments in a liquidation are subject to the limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.</p><p>-  Officials from my Department met with MIBI on 11 June 2014 to discuss the issue of Setanta and they informed us that they expect to have legal certainty in the coming weeks. </p></reply>

To promote compliance, the Central Bank provides feedback on themed inspections and publishes the main issues on its website.  </p><p>The Central Bank has conducted a number of themed inspections on the CCMA since its introduction in 2009, including:  </p><p>- 2010 inspection conducted on specific provisions of the CCMA regarding the issuing of formal demand letters, applications to the Courts to commence enforcement of legal action on repossession of a borrower's primary residence and entering arrangements.  </p><p>- 2011 inspection which examined compliance with the requirement of CCMA specifically relating to charges on mortgage accounts in arrears.</p><p>- 2012 inspection which examined compliance with the CCMA requirements relating to contact with borrowers and the appeals process required under the CCMA. </p><p>Details of all themed inspections on the CCMA and feedback can be found at the following link: </p><p>In 2013, the Central Bank undertook a review of practices by credit institutions in areas of the arrears process covered by the CCMA to inform the review of the CCMA which was conducted in 2013.   This review focused on the current and proposed use of dialler technology in respect of customer contact.  In 2013 the Central Bank also conducted independent research into the experience of borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears who are engaging in the CCMA's Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP).  Borrowers surveyed were generally positive about their overall experience when interacting with their lenders during the MARP process, with 73% of borrowers indicating that their lender had been professional in its dealing with them, and 64% noting their lender's helpfulness.  In addition, it also found:- </p><p>- 71% of borrowers were positive about the ease of completing the Standard Financial Statement ('SFS')  lenders must  use to gather financial information on a borrower's circumstances in order to inform any new arrears arrangements; </p><p>- 71% of borrowers surveyed had entered into an alternative arrangement with their lender as a result of MARP and 80% of those completing an SFS entered a revised agreement; </p><p>- of the 10% of borrowers who used the MARP's Appeals process, 60% stated that they had successfully negotiated a more suitable/sustainable arrangement; </p><p>- a third of consumers claimed that their lender did not have a discussion with them regarding other debts. </p><p>Following the introduction of the revised CCMA on 1 July 2013, the Central Bank requested all mortgage lenders to have revised CCMA implementation plans in place detailing the corporate governance arrangements surrounding the plan (including senior management oversight), changes to systems required to implement the revised CCMA and staff training required to ensure compliance with the revised CCMA by the end 2013.</p><p>The Central Bank's plan for themed inspections in 2014 includes an inspection of mortgage lenders to test compliance with the revised CCMA.  I am also informed that compliance with the CCMA is also a Central Bank enforcement priority for 2014.</p></reply>

The restructures are often complex due to multiple debt connections.  Irish banks are advancing the process of restructuring their SME loan books. I  am informed that Bank of Ireland have indicated that they had reached resolution in 90% of distressed SME cases and the AIB's results indicate a resolution level of approximately 65%.  It is also worth noting that defaulted loans for both banks have reduced year-on-year. </p><p>The Central Bank's process of assessing financial institutions in their efforts to move distressed SME borrowers onto longer term sustainable solutions is an important element in assisting SMEs to potentially transition from a distressed to a more sustainable state and will continue throughout 2014. Additionally, the Government's enactment of legislation to allow small companies (as defined by the Companies Acts) to apply to the Circuit Court for examinership and the on going work of the expanded Credit Review Office are all initiatives that will assist viable SMEs in addressing their debt situation and consequently enhance the employment prospects for the sector as a whole.</p><p>The fair resolution of problem mortgage and other personal debt is a key priority for Government and a comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem, in line with the main recommendations of the 2011 Keane Report, is being implemented.  Key elements of this strategy are:<ol type="1"><li>An intensification by the Central Bank of its engagement with mortgage lenders to require them, under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) process, to propose and conclude sustainable and durable alternative arrangements to their customers in mortgage (both primary home and buy to let) arrears of more than 90 days;</li><li>Significant reforms to personal insolvency law and practice to provide a fairer balance between the interests of creditors and insolvent debtors, including a reduction in the period of bankruptcy and the provision of new insolvency resolution frameworks to make it easier for people with unsustainable personal and mortgage debt to address their position;</li><li>Updating the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears to provide safeguards to cooperating borrowers regarding their primary home, while also promoting and encouraging efforts by both lenders and borrowers to meaningfully address mortgage arrears or pre-arrears;</li><li>The introduction of the social housing Mortgage to Rent scheme which can allow eligible people with unsustainable mortgages to remain in their home; and</li><li>The provision of an independent mortgage information and advice service.</li><li>Regarding the Central Bank's MART process, quarterly performance targets have now been set to the end of 2014 to require the banks to propose and put in place durable long term solutions to address individual cases of mortgages in difficulty. Based on the information submitted, the Central Bank has advised that the banks have indicated they have met the end 2013 targets of proposing solutions to 50% and concluding solutions for 15% of accounts in arrears greater than 90 days.</li><li>The Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender, and that long term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers in arrears. Under the CCMA, if a borrower is not satisfied with the way that their lender is dealing with them or if they think the lender is not complying with the CCMA, the borrower can make a complaint to their lender. Borrowers also have the right to appeal to the lender's Appeals Board if they are not happy with the alternative repayment arrangement offered or where a lender declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement or if they believe they have been wrongly classified as not co-operating.   If the borrower is still unhappy with the outcome of the appeal or the complaint made to the lender, they can refer the matter to the Financial Services Ombudsman. </li><li>The monthly mortgage restructures and arrears data published by my Department also provides an impetus for those MART banks to increase the pace of provision of mortgage restructures.  The latest publication, which is in respect of the end of April, shows that some progress has been made in putting permanent mortgage restructures in place.  For example, the total number of permanent restructures of principal dwelling houses (PDH) mortgages has risen from around 51,000 in December 2013 to almost 66,000 at end April 2014.  Taken together, the framework is now in place to enable banks to work with distressed homeowners to reach sustainable solutions to deal with unsustainable personal debt.  However, early and effective engagement between borrowers and lenders is key to resolving cases of mortgage difficulty.  Where there is effective and meaningful engagement by all parties regarding a mortgage difficulty, the data shows that an increasing number of durable long term mortgage restructures are being put in place.  However, it is accepted that it will be necessary for lenders and borrowers to continue to build on this.</li></ol></p></reply>

The group recognised the considerable pressures on the public finances and the need to bridge the gap between expenditure and revenue, and, for this reason, suggested that consideration be given to phasing in deductibility over a period of years. The group also considered that it was for Government, having regard to the prevailing budgetary situation, to decide on the time span for phasing-in deductibility and on what percentage of LPT to allow as a deduction from gross rents for tax purposes. The Government has agreed in principle to accept this recommendation but has not considered the manner or the timing in which this will happen.</p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.</p><p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils.</p><p>  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p><p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about her educational progress I would advise, in the first instance, that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist.</p></reply>

In fact, in December 2013, the Govenment announced it was increasing the number of SNA posts available for allocation to schools, in order to reflect demographic growth and increased demand for SNA support.  The existing provision for 10,575 SNA posts has been increased by 390 to 10,965 posts, which are being made available for allocation to the end of 2014, of which 10,656 posts are currently in place.  The increased provision will bring to almost 11,000 the number of SNA posts available to work with children who have an assessed care need requiring SNA support in primary, post primary, and special schools. This will ensure that the Department's policy of ensuring that every child who is assessed as needing SNA support will receive access to such support.</p><p>  In June 2011, my Department published a Value for Money and Policy Review of the SNA scheme.  In May 2013, the National Council for Special Education published its Policy Advice on Supporting Children with Special Educational Needs in Schools.  Both reports concluded that the SNA scheme has been highly successful in supporting the care needs of children with special needs in schools and with assisting to facilitate their integration and inclusion.  However, the reports also concluded that the intended purpose of the scheme was not always generally well understood by parents or schools and that the scope and purpose of the scheme should be clarified for schools.</p><p>  My Department accordingly prepared a new Circular for schools, which was designed to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme, in accordance with the recommendations of the reports and policy advice noted above. It should not be assumed that this will automatically lead to a reduction in SNA support for individual pupils, or for schools who have pupils who have continuing care needs.  The purpose of Circular 0030/2014 which issued on 10th April last, is therefore to clarify the scope and purpose of the SNA scheme for schools, in accordance with the recommendations of these reports.</p></reply>

In addition, there are 8 key skills which include "working with others" whereby students should realise and experience how they can "contribute to making the world an better place".</p><p>  One of the statements of learning requires that students will &quot; value what it means to be an active citizen with rights and responsibilities in local and wider context&quot;. As students will be expected to experience the principles, statements of learning and key skills, it is anticipated that education for active citizenship will continue to be an important part of the new Junior Cycle.  I recently approved a new short course in CSPE that has been developed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA). This short course will be available to schools to implement from this September, should they wish to do so, as part of their Junior Cycle programme. This programme is in fact designed for 100 hours of teaching compared to less than 70 hours for the existing CSPE syllabus.</p><p>  The CSPE short course will be complemented at Senior Cycle by the introduction of 'Politics and Society' as a new optional Leaving Certificate subject. The draft syllabus for Politics and Society, which has been developed by the NCCA, is structured around four key areas. One of these areas is 'Active Citizenship'. The Politics and Society subject will be made available to schools once the NCCA has advised my Department on a number of outstanding issues.</p><p>  In the context of the implementation of the Framework for Junior Cycle the only subjects that will be &quot;compulsory&quot; are English, Mathematics and Irish. This decision has been taken to give schools the flexibiilty to develop their Junior Cycle programme mindful of the educational needs of their own students and mindful of the principles, statements of learning and key skills as set out in the  Framework.</p></reply>

Where children have significant care needs whereby they may need additional support to be able to attend school, the NCSE may make an allocation of SNA support to the school to assist that child.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. The criteria by which SNA support is allocated to pupils is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014.</p><p>  The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.  The NCSE invited schools to make applications for SNA support for children who have assessed care needs for the coming 2014/15 school year by 26th March 2014, for their consideration.  Details of the NCSE application criteria are available at www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE intend to advise all schools of their SNA allocations for the coming school year before the end of the current school year.</p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

In the context of the sale of the National Lottery licence, I have considered it appropriate to re-appoint two of the Ministerial nominees to the An Post National Lottery Board; Mr. Miche&aacute;l &Oacute; Muircheartaigh has been re-appointed twice and Mr. Oliver Wilkinson has been re-appointed once.  Consequently, recourse to advertising the positions publicly did not arise.  </p><p>The Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 states that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (in consultation with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice and Equality) should appoint members of the Board of the Public Appointments Service.</p><p>The Public Appointments Service Board is meant to be representative of our client base.  The majority of the board are therefore civil or public servants, nominated by the relevant Minister.  There is also a union representative nominated by ICTU.  The two external members were appointed by the Minister because of their expertise in strategic change and public service recruitment respectively. </p><p>In view of these statutory procedures for the appointment of members of the Boards, there is limited scope for me to use the Publicjobs.ie website.

There are currently approximately 76,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.</p><p>  All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, particularly in urban areas, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties.</p><p>  In view of the current supply difficulties being experienced in the Dublin region, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive in conjunction with the Dublin local authorities and voluntary organisations have agreed a protocol with the Department so that families at risk of losing existing private rented accommodation can have more timely and appropriate interventions made on their behalf. It is intended that this arrangement will be reviewed in the third quarter of the year.</p><p>  While there are no plans to extend this arrangement to other local authority areas at this time, I can assure the Deputy that officers administering rent supplement throughout the country have considerable experience in dealing with customers and make every effort to ensure that the accommodation needs of families are met. Staff in the Department&rsquo;s Community Welfare Service have discretionary powers to award a supplement for rental purposes in exceptional cases where it appears that the circumstances of the case so warrant, for example, when dealing with applicants who are homeless or who are at risk of losing their tenancy.  Such cases are examined on a case by case basis having regard to the situation presented.</p><p>  Finally, I want to advise the Deputy that a new rent limit review has commenced within the Department and will feed into the budgetary process. This review will involve a comprehensive analysis of information from a range of sources including rental tenancies registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB), the Central Statistics Office rental indices and websites advertising rental properties. The Department will also be seeking the views from a number of stakeholders in this area including the local staff administering the scheme,  colleagues in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Private Residential Tenancies Board and non-Government organisations such as Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and Society of St Vincent de Paul.</p></reply>

In addition to the telephone service the Department provides a range of contact channels for customers including e-mail, SMS (text), through our website and face to face.</p><p>LoCall numbers are in operation for the Department&rsquo;s scheme areas for a number of years. This system works successfully in conjunction with Interactive Voice Response technology to facilitate customers making contact with the appropriate section of the Department, at a low cost to the caller.  A call management system is also in place across all headquarter buildings which allows managers to monitor and manage call volumes.  It provides a flexible means of managing sudden peaks in customer demand and allows for the active management of calls by way of assigning more staff to the phone lines at peak periods.</p><p>Intreo Centres and social welfare local offices also provide a telephone service to  customers and in response to increased pressures in recent years, a range of initiatives aimed at streamlining the processing of claims have been put in place. These initiatives, including a dedicated appointment service for jobseekers, aim to ensure that customers are given comprehensive information and advice at the initial stages of their claim thereby reducing the need for customers to contact the Department by phone with follow-up queries.</p><p>In order to equip staff to deal effectively with customers, the Department provides training in customer service which includes communicating effectively with customers, effective telephone techniques, active listening and the importance of understanding and empathy. Training courses also include the raising of awareness of disability, mental health and diversity issues relevant to staff and customers.</p><p>The Department has a formal comments and complaints procedure in place to allow customers give feedback on the quality of services they receive and customers can report poor customer service by email to , by calling 1890 66 22 44, online on or by writing to Customer Services, Department of Social Protection, College Road, Sligo.

As regards my own Department, in the region of sixty five staff members currently provide services to the public through the medium of Irish on a regular basis.  In addition, a significant number of staff in my Department have varying levels of competence in Irish, which they may use in their work from time to time.  This would mainly extend to an ability to comprehend verbal or written queries and to respond to verbal queries.  The Deputy should also be aware that, following a review of the Official Languages Act 2003, my Department recently published the heads of the Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2014.  It is proposed to include a new provision under section 13 of the Bill requiring public bodies to specify the posts that require an Irish language competency in their language schemes.  This amendment reflects a decision by Government to replace the policy of awarding bonus marks for Irish language proficiency in civil service recruitment and promotion competitions with a competency-based system whereby specified posts will have an Irish language proficiency requirement. </p><p>  In addition, as a result of the Government decision, the workforce plans of Departments will specify the posts/areas of work which require functional bilinguals.  Having regard to the implementation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, Departments will be asked to pay particular attention to posts located in, or serving, Gaeltacht areas.  This process will be central to ensuring that future recruitment and inter-departmental promotion competitions run by the Public Appointments Service make sufficient provision for appointments to posts requiring functional bilinguals.  In the case of Departmental recruitment and promotion competitions, an assessment will be made of the requirement for functional bilinguals and, where necessary and appropriate, a sub-panel of functional bilinguals will be put in place. </p><p>  It had been intended to pilot the new arrangements in the upcoming Executive Officer (EO) recruitment competition.  However, I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, that priority is now being given to a Clerical Officer (CO) competition and that the proposed EO competition will not take place until later in the year.  Accordingly, it has been decided that the new arrangements will be piloted in the CO competition, which will be announced in the coming weeks.  The new arrangements provide for a sub-panel of functional bilinguals comprising up to 6% of the overall CO panel and will be revised as necessary in the context of experience and progress in achieving the Government's objectives.</p></reply>

My Department was established on 2 June 2011 and the Deputy will appreciate that the information sought by him can only be provided from that date.  My Department seeks expressions of interest from the public by advertising on my Department's website.  As the Deputy will be aware, in making appointments to State Boards, I am not restricted to giving sole consideration to those who have responded to publicly advertised invitations to submit expressions of interest.  The reason for this is that it provides flexibility for me to approach candidates who may not have expressed their interest through the publicly advertised process but who have, in my view, a contribution to make and are willing to serve.  In the case of certain bodies, board appointments may also be made by the bodies themselves or on an <i>ex officio</i>basis.  </p><p>It may also be noted that appointments to the boards of Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency, being agencies of the North South Implementation Body - An Foras Teanga, are made by the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC), arising from nominations on a 50:50 basis from each jurisdiction.<table><tr><th>Board</th><th>Appointments made between 2 June 2011 and 17 June 2014</th><th>Appointments made between 2 June 2011 and 17 June 2014</th><th>Appointments made between 2 June 2011 and 17 June 2014</th><th>Appointments made between 2 June 2011 and 17 June 2014</th><th>Number of positions that were filled from the publicly advertised process.</th></tr><tr><td>-</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>National Gallery of Ireland</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>National Concert Hall</td><td>15</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>12 </td></tr><tr><td>National Library of Ireland</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>National Museum of Ireland</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Museum of Modern Art</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Irish Film Board</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Arts Council</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Heritage Council</td><td>0</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>National Archives Advisory Council</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Censorship of Publications Board</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Censorship of Publications Appeals Board</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Crawford Art Gallery</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>9</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Chester Beatty Library</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta</td><td>0</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>4  (It should be noted that 5 of the 12 appointments made were by County Councils which have Gaeltacht areas within their jurisdictions).</td></tr><tr><td>Foras na Gaeilge</td><td>15</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Ulster-Scots Agency</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Arrangements relating to the centenary of the legislation in September are in preparation.  The centenary of the World War has been acknowledged already this year by several local authorities and academic centres.  Regimental associations and ex-service organisations are arranging visits to battlefield sites.  National cultural institutions are organising special events and presentations.  Special arrangements relating to the entry into the war are being made in Ireland, Britain and abroad in late July and early August.  In this regard, I would specifically mention the dedication of a large monumental cross at Glasnevin cemetery, Dublin on 31 July.  The centenary of the Easter Rising will be the culmination of the first phase of the Decade of Centenaries programme that commenced in 2012.  A number of capital projects have been commissioned for completion to feature in the commemorative programme.  Consideration is underway of the events and activities that will complete the programme.</p><p>  The 1918 election and the 1st Dail will be addressed in due course as they arise on the centenary timeline.  The commemorative programme to date has been strengthened and enhanced by the initiatives of partners in relation to their heritage.  The consideration of the Oireachtas in relation to the Centenary of the 1st Dail would be very welcome.</p><p>  Similarly, the conclusion of the War of Independence, the Anglo-Irish treaty and the Civil War will be addressed on the Centenary timeline.  At this remove, I can only advise that the commemorative programme will seek to ensure that the arrangements are comprehensive, authentic and inclusive.</p></reply>

Applications to the value of some &euro;164 million in loans, were accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme. </p><p>  The figure of &euro;164 million includes &euro;111 million in respect of loans which were fully redeemed by local authorities with funding recouped from my Department, under the original terms of the Scheme.  The remaining &euro;53 million accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme is in the form of annuity loans, for which local authorities are making repayments to the Housing Finance Agency.  Such annuity repayments are recoupable from my Department subject to the local authority complying with terms of the Scheme. </p><p>  In 2013 as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources, and following a review of the Scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the Land Aggregation Scheme, in terms of accepting new applications into the Scheme, was no longer a sustainable option.  The review concluded with the issuance of Circular 35/2013 on 11 December, 2013, notifying Local Authorities of the discontinuance of the Scheme in respect of new applications. </p><p>  The focus of the Scheme has now shifted to the management and utilisation of the lands included in the Scheme.  The Housing Agency is developing a strategy for the utilisation of transferred lands, which will involve consultation with the relevant local authority and other appropriate parties.  The development of this strategy is being progressed in the context of the new Social Housing Strategy, a Departmental commitment under Construction Strategy 2020.</p><p>  I recognise the cessation of the Land Aggregation Scheme presents challenges for some local authorities.  However, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources.  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which includes adopting annual budgets, and are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority. </p><p>  Following the discontinuance of the Scheme, local authorities had been advised to consult with the Housing Finance Agency directly on the management of loans relating to lands not accepted into the Land Aggregation Scheme.  I understand the Housing Finance Agency has made arrangements directly with some local authorities to extend interest-only arrangements to land acquisition loans, on maturity, for a further five years, after which they will revert to normal-course annuities.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-18a.315.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061800080#WRO02500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 115 to 120, inclusive, together. </p><p>A potential problem concerning pyrite in concrete blocks was signalled to my Department in early April 2014 by the market surveillance authority (i.e. building control authority) in whose functional area the block manufacturer is located. Subsequently, some industry representatives have also contacted my Depart ment in relation to the issue.  <i>Under the European Union (Construction Products) Regulations 2013</i>, building control authorities are designated as the principal market surveillance authorities for construction products that fall within the scope of the Construction Products Regulation (CPR) and<i></i>are responsible for the market surveillance of such products. Concrete blocks are covered by a harmonised European standard ( <i>EN 771-3 -2011-Aggregate concrete masonry units (dense and light weight aggregates)</i>and therefore come within the remit of the CPR.</p><p>The European Union (Construct ion Products) Regulations 2013 provide building control authorities with   a wide   rang e of powers to ensure that constructions products placed on the market comply with the requirements set out in the Construction Products Regulation. Such powers include the issuing of a notice to require corrective actions to be taken by an economic operator within a specified period of time and, in the event of a serious risk being identified, to request the nister to prohibit or restrict a construction product from being made available on the market, to withdraw it from the market or to recall it, or to make its use subject to special conditions as deemed appropriate.</p><p>On being advised of the problem the relevant market surveillance authority took immediate and appropriate action under the applicable legislation to deal with this issue. The authorised officer of the market surveillance authority involved visited the premises of the block manufacturer and requested detailed information as to the precise nature and extent of the problem including where the blocks had been supplied, the actions taken or being taken by the block manufacturer to deal with the problem as well as necessary documentation to demonstrate compliance with the harmonised European standard for blocks and with the requirements of the CPR.</p><p>It is understood that a small number of construction sites have been supplied with the affected blocks, that t he company is co-operating with the market surveillance authority and has supplied certain information on the extent of the problem, the actions being taken to provide for a resolution and compliance documentation. Additional information has been sought from the company to provide clarity o n a number of pertinent issues.   </p><p>My Department has written to the building control/market surveillance authorities in whose functional areas the construction sites to which it is understood the blocks were supplied are located and advised them to visit the construction sites identified for the purposes of assessing whether the concrete blocks used in the construction works on these sites are &ldquo;proper materials&rdquo; within the meaning of Part D of the Building Regulations 1997, i.e. that they are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used.</p><p>One of the developments involved is a social housing development of 25 dwellings commissioned by North and East Housing Association Ltd. in Moneymore, Drogheda, County Louth. As matters stand, it would appear that six houses in the development will have to be demolished due to the incorporation of defective blocks in the construction. Testing of the blocks on the six houses involved confirmed the presence of pyrite in the blocks and the solution is for demolition and rebuild. It is understood that the contractor and the concrete block manufacturer are co-operating in order to provide a resolution to the problem through the construction contracts. Further testing of the remaining 19 houses in the development is being carried out and these results are awaited to determine what, if any, remedial action will be needed in respect of the remaining houses. On completion of a satisfactory resolution to these matters, the 25 housing units in Moneymore will be made available for social housing purposes.</p><p>From the information available at this stage, it appears that testing has also been carried out in a small number of other developments identified as having been supplied with the affected blocks which has confirmed the presence of deleterious material (sulphates/pyrite) in the blocks. My Department understands that in each case the costs of resolution are being pursued, in the first instance, with the relevant contractors and suppliers through the construction contracts. The actions taken thus far by the relevant parties involved suggest that the regulatory system is functioning effectively and that an appropriate means of redress is being pursued through those responsible for the building failure.</p><p>My Department will continue to work closely with the building control/market surveillance authorities involved in dealing with this particular matter to monitor the situation. It will continue to provide whatever advice, guidance or clarifications as are required to ensure that the necessary actions are taken to resolve the problems identified and to safeguard against defective products being placed on the market.</p></reply>

The Civil Defence Board was identified in the Public Service Reform Plan as a body to be abolished. The then Minister for Defence appointed a 14 person interim Board as a temporary measure in 2011 and in this context none of the positions were advertised. Legislation to dissolve the Board was passed by the Oireachtas in December 2012. Its functions have now transferred back to the Department of Defence. </p><p>  There were no appointments to the Board of Coiste an Asgard from 2009. In the context of settling the Estimates for the Department of Defence for 2010, the Government decided that the national sail training scheme operated by Coiste an Asgard would be discontinued as recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure. The formal wind up of the Company including voluntary strike off with the Companies Registration Office was completed in early 2013. </p><p>  The only body currently under the aegis of the Department of Defence is the Army Pensions Board. The Army Pensions Board is an independent statutory body established under the Army Pensions Act, 1927. The Act specifies that the Board shall consist of a chairman and two ordinary members. The two ordinary members must be qualified medical practitioners of whom one must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps. The chairman and the non military ordinary member are appointed by the Minister for Defence with the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. The Army Medical Corps ordinary member is appointed by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces. </p><p>  There have been two appointments to the Army Pensions Board since March 2011. A serving officer was appointed to the position of Army Medical Corps member of the Board in December 2011, and a civilian doctor was appointed as ordinary member in November 2013. </p><p>  The position of Army Medical Corps ordinary member became vacant due to retirement in 2011. The then Minister for Defence appointed Commandant Adam Lagun to the Board on the recommendation of the Chief of Staff. As the Army Pensions Act, 1927 specifies that one of the ordinary members must be an officer of the Army Medical Corps, this position was not publicly advertised. Details of Commandant Lagun&rsquo;s appointment to the Army Pensions Board were published in the Iris Oifigi&uacute;l on 13 January 2012.</p><p>  The civilian doctor vacancy was advertised on the Department of Defence website and the Public Appointments Service website. A number of expressions of interest in the position were received and an appointment to the Board was made on foot of this public advertisement process. </p></reply>

In the context of current strength numbers being below the agreed stabilised strength, a new General Service recruitment campaign for both the Permanent and the Reserve Defence Force was announced in March this year. The Defence Forces plan to induct up to 400 personnel to the Permanent Defence Force (both Army and Navy) and up to 500 personnel to the Reserve Defence Force (both Army Reserve and Naval Service Reserve) in 2014.  Additionally, a 2014 Cadetship Competition for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service is underway. It is planned to award a total of 40 cadetships from this competition comprising of twenty (20) Army, nine (9) Air Corps and eleven (11) Naval Service. I envisage that further recruitment will take place in 2015 to take account particularly of retirements.  With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p></reply>

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement attached.    Ireland&rsquo;s main deployments are the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) with 199 personnel and United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in Syria with 135 personnel.  Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the EU Training Mission in Mali (EUTM Mali) with eight (8) personnel; the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina with seven (7) personnel; the NATO-led international security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with twelve (12) personnel; and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan with seven (7) personnel, and the United Nations Mine Action Service (UNMAS) in South Sudan with five (5) personnel.  Ireland also contributes 26 observers and staff to various United Nations and OSCE missions, 3 personnel to the Nordic Battle group headquarters in Sweden and 15 other personnel to staff appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters. </p><p>  The breakdown of the 417 Irish Defence Forces personnel currently serving overseas is 376 Army, 32 Air Corps and 9 Naval Service. </p><p>  With regard to any future deployments of Defence Forces personnel overseas, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis. When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered. Due to Ireland&rsquo;s own current level of commitment in overseas peacekeeping operations, notably to the United Nations Disengagement Force in Syria and the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, we are not in a position to make any significant commitment to other missions at this time. </p><p>  The current contribution of some 417 personnel to overseas missions reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security. </p></reply>

Primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order including the protection of the internal security of the State rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, one of the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence (2000) is to provide Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice means to assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so. </p><p>  A wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies and the Defence Forces hold regular coordination and liaison meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues.</p><p>  In relation to non-security related emergencies, whilst the Defence Forces are not a Principal Response Agency as defined in the Framework for Major Emergency Management, they provide the fullest possible assistance to the appropriate Lead Department in the event of a natural disaster or emergency situation in its Aid to the Civil Authority (ATCA) role.</p><p>  At National level, representation on the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, by both my Department and the Defence Forces, ensures the fullest coordination and cooperation in the event of an emergency and that the command structure within the Defence Forces is compatible with the requirements in this area.</p><p>  The Defence Forces are also represented on the eight Regional Working Groups that have been established under the Framework and, on an ongoing basis, designated members of the Defence Forces, based around the country, act as Liaison Officers to Local Authorities.  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment, commensurate with operational requirements, is available for deployments in response to emergencies and natural disasters.  In this regard, the Defence Forces hold a wide range of engineering and transport plant and equipment for military purposes. All such plant and equipment suitable for use in emergency situations is made available as the need arises.</p><p>  In relation to the Naval Service, all vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, and Search and Rescue in support to the Irish Coast Guard, amongst other duties while on patrol. These activities assist in detecting and preventing emergency situations throughout Ireland&rsquo;s maritime jurisdiction. </p><p>  The first of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels was commissioned last month and is now on patrol in Irish waters. A second Offshore Patrol Vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2015.  Under the contract with Babcock International for the provision of these two new vessels an order has been placed for a third and identical Vessel for delivery in 2016. These modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure the Naval Service continues to meet the required operational capability.</p><p>  The role of the Air Corps includes the provision of an emergency inter-hospital Air Ambulance service in support of the HSE.  It is also supporting the HSE in a pilot emergency aero medical support service operating primarily in the West of Ireland.  The Air Corps also has a maritime surveillance function undertaken by its maritime patrol aircraft and both it and the Naval Service provide support to the Irish Coast Guard in maritime Search and Rescue operations.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that Defence Forces personnel have a modern and effective range of equipment, including telecommunications and logistical equipment, needed to fulfil all roles that are assigned to them by Government.</p></reply>

This programme has brought to fourteen the number of barracks closed during that time. To date nine of these barracks - Clancy (Dublin), Castleblaney, Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Monaghan, Cavan, Castlebar and a large portion of Longford - have been sold.  In relation to the remaining barracks agreement has been reached for the sale of Lifford barracks to Donegal County Council. Discussions had also been ongoing for a considerable period of time with the Council in relation to the sale of Rockhill House, however at a recent meeting with officials of the Department the Council was not in a position to give a firm commitment to acquiring the property at this stage. It is proposed therefore to dispose of the property by public auction within the next couple of months.</p><p>  Discussions are at an advanced stage in relation to the sale of the former barracks in Clonmel to South Tipperary County Council and I expect that the sale will be finalised over the coming weeks. The remaining part of Longford has been reserved for sale to the Office of Public Works for the local Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Magee Barracks in Kildare and Columb Barracks in Mullingar remain the property of the Department of Defence. Columb Barracks is currently used by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes and a large part of the barracks has been licensed to Westmeath GAA Board for use as a potential centre of excellence. Discussions are at an advanced stage with the Board in relation to the possible lease of the whole facility and these discussions should be completed over the coming months.</p><p>  In addition to the main barracks outlined above a number of other properties have also been identified as surplus to military requirements. A large number of these have already been disposed of whilst others are in the process of being prepared for disposal. These mainly consist of married quarters, Reserve Defence Force (RDF) premises and training lands.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-06-18a.343.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1072" speakername="Enda Kenny" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014061800082#WRQ01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 129 and 131 together.  </p><p>  I am satisfied that the level of equipment currently available to the Defence Forces enables them to carry out their roles, both at home and overseas.  The acquisition of new equipment for the Army, Air Corps and the Naval Service is a matter that is kept under constant review at a senior level in my Department and in the Defence Forces, through joint participation in the High Level Planning and Procurement Group. This Group is charged with identifying equipment requirements and agreeing on a procurement programme to provide the Defence Forces with type and quantities of equipment necessary to carry out their assigned duties. These are all issues that are also a consideration in the drafting of the new White Paper on Defence.</p><p>  However, the fact remains that in the current economic climate the budgetary situation will continue to dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and for equipment upgrades. Decisions will be made accordingly on a strictly prioritised basis in accordance with operational priorities with a view to maintaining the capability of all roles assigned by Government to the Defence Forces.  The first of two new Offshore Patrol Vessels was commissioned last month and is now on patrol in Irish waters. A second Offshore Patrol Vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2015.  Under the contract with Babcock International for the provision of these two new vessels an order has been placed for a third and identical Vessel for delivery in 2016. These modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair on the other vessels in the fleet, will ensure the Naval Service continues to meet the required operational capability.</p><p>  All Naval Service vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that, in addition to their fishery protection role, they also undertake general surveillance, security, pollution monitoring, Search and Rescue and other duties while on patrol.  The Air Corps operate a maintenance plan which endeavours to ensure that the maximum number of operational flying hours is available from aircraft when most needed. The maintenance of the Air Corps fleet falls into three broad categories: scheduled, unscheduled and routine/daily. The use of Power by the Hour / Performance Based maintenance contracts assists the Air Corps in keeping downtime of aircraft to the minimum. The provision for the Air Corps in 2014 mainly relates to these maintenance and Power by the Hour contracts set up to keep the Air Corps fleet fully operational with specific maintenance work being carried out on the CASA Maritime Patrol Aircraft related to the overhaul of engines on the aircraft.</p><p>  The question of proceeding with any replacement aircraft programme for the Air Corps will be considered in tandem with the new White Paper on Defence, the overall equipment requirements of the Defence Forces generally and the funding envelope available in the coming years.  On the transport side, the Defence Forces has a significant fleet of vehicles. In recent years, a number of vehicle purchases took place which included Minibuses, standard patrol vehicles and mid-coaches for troop transportation. In addition, funding is provided on a continuous basis for the required maintenance and servicing of vehicles in the military transport fleet.</p></reply>

These formal Council meetings are held in Brussels or Luxembourg at the invitation of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton.  Ministers of Defence also meet at their informal meetings that are held in the country holding the Presidency of the European Council and again these are held twice per year.  These meetings commence with the European Defence Agency Steering Board at which Defence Ministers are briefed on and discuss ongoing issues in the area of defence capability development.  The meetings of Defence Ministers then commence and provide an opportunity for Ministers to discuss and make decisions on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) issues.  All Member States are represented at these meetings.  However, Denmark does not participate in the decision making process under its general opt-out on decisions with defence or military implications.  In addition, EU organisations including the European External Action Service, the Council Secretariat, the European Commission, the European Defence Agency, the Chairman of the EU Military Staff and the Chairman of the EU Military Committee also attend.  Operational Commanders may also brief the Ministers on the most recent developments in the various EU missions.</p></reply>

GLAS is an environmental scheme and all measures proposed under that scheme must make a clear contribution towards better environmental management of agricultural land.  I have proposed a two tier system for awarding commonage owners prioritised access to GLAS: top priority will be given to those who can achieve 80% or more participation in the collective, but if a minimum of just 50% participation can be secured, that will guarantee second-tier access to the scheme. I believe this concession, which I introduced last month, will significantly ease the burden of securing agreements, while at the same time providing a critical mass for management of the commonage, which can be expanded upon in future years. Critical mass is the key thing to be achieved here; we need sufficient people working together to achieve the best results for these commonages, and ensure their preservation into the future in the interests of both the farming community and the environment.  Below 50% participation in the collective, I do not believe that the required critical mass is achieved.</p></reply>

I have discussed this matter extensively with other EU Agriculture Ministers and with the European Commission, and officials from my Department have raised this issue at EU level and with other Member States.  However, attempts to consider measures beyond those agreed in 2008 have been resisted and neither of the interim reports on the <i>2008 CAP Health Check Agreement,</i>in 2010 and 2012, proposed any further changes to the quota regime.</p><p>This year I have joined with my colleagues at each Agriculture Council meeting in pressing this matter and we submitted a proposal for the Commission to adjust the butterfat coefficients.  For super levy purposes, butterfat causes an adjustment to milk supply &ndash; the greater the differential between average butterfat (current levels) and reference fat levels (base fat), the greater the adjustment to milk intake levels.  The proposed solution is to reduce the positive butterfat co-efficient and increase the negative one to ensure fair distribution across MS.  Technically, this can be changed under Commission competency at Management Committee level.  The Commissioner has said they will not move on butterfat without majority support at Council, and unfortunately, there are enough countries opposed to any move on butterfat.  At Council last Monday we tried again to get agreement on a compromise but there was no qualified majority in favour.  Despite there being a blocking minority at this month&rsquo;s Council, I along with a number of Member States who share our views on soft landing succeeded in having the issue put on the agenda for the July Council, the first under the Italian Presidency.  In the meantime, we will be in contact with various countries in an attempt for an agreement which would bring about an adjustment to the fat co-efficient.  While I will continue to try and achieve measures to ensure a soft landing in the final year of the quota regime, but in the meantime dairy farmers must operate within the quota regulations until they expire in 2015.</p></reply>

Our thoughts are with the victims of the many atrocities perpetrated over the course of the troubles and their families.</p><p>  Arising from the report of the Barron Inquiry and the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women&rsquo;s Rights the Garda Commissioner appointed a dedicated liaison officer for the victims of the bombings in Dublin in 1972 and 1973 and in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974.  This dedicated liaison service has been in place since then.  It is currently provided by a Garda Superintendent based at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation in Dublin.</p><p>  It is the policy of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide effective liaison with the victims of crime and their families.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is strongly aware of the importance of victims in the criminal justice system and will continue to make efforts to ensure their needs are met, particularly in respect of making information available to them.  The Garda authorities are conscious of the need to ensure that the liaison process is operated in order to best address the needs of the individual victims while at the same time ensuring that criminal investigations would not be in any way compromised.</p><p>  In achieving this and in the interests of operational effectiveness, Garda liaison with the victims of serious crime and their families, such as those crimes related to the conflict in Northern Ireland, is provided directly to them from the Garda Division and investigation team which is investigating the case at hand.  The Garda&iacute; in the Division which is investigating a case are in possession of the detailed and up-to-date information with regard to it and are, therefore, best placed to interact with the victims and their families.  Such interaction is done directly by or under the supervision of the relevant Garda Superintendent.</p><p>  I am sure the Deputy will agree that we must always be conscious that the victims of crime are individuals with individual needs and that any approach must take into account the specific requirements of the individuals themselves.</p></reply>

The impact of the many atrocities perpetrated over the course of the troubles lives long in our memory and is felt to this very day.  Our thoughts are with the victims and their families.</p><p>  As part and parcel of addressing the legacy of conflict for victims, the Government established the Remembrance Commission.  Over the lifetime of the Remembrance Commission from 2003 to 2008 &euro;3.87 million in funding was made available to individual victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland resident in this jurisdiction to acknowledge their suffering, to address economic hardship and certain medical expenses.  A significant amount of funding was also made available directly to Justice for the Forgotten, a group which supports many of the victims.</p><p>  The exceptional payments element of the Remembrance Commission scheme provided for the possibility for payment of counselling expenses incurred prior to the establishment of the scheme, in the circumstances outlined in the scheme.  Some ongoing counselling services were provided through Justice for the Forgotten.</p><p>  Although it was not possible for my Department to continue funding Justice for the Forgotten, I am happy to inform the Deputy that the group was recently awarded funding from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under its Reconciliation and Anti-Sectarianism Funds to allow it to continue the important work it carries out for the victims it represents.</p><p>  I might add that while it is not possible to extend the nature of the schemes administered by my Department's Victims of Crime Office, I can reiterate the assurances given previously that funding for certain ongoing medical needs of the people who sustained injuries in the bombings has been and will continue to be provided through my Department&rsquo;s Victims of Crime Office.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the aim of the Bill is to safeguard the autonomy of individuals with capacity difficulties to the greatest extent possible.  To that end, the Bill explicitly references the obligations regarding deprivation of liberty outlined in Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  It limits the powers of attorneys and of decision-making representatives in this regard.</p><p>  In order to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Bill makes provision for safeguards to protect against the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of those lacking capacity who are detained for treatment for a mental disorder.  The Bill ensures that the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2001 will continue to apply to any decision to detain a person for such treatment.  It also ensures that there is no conflict between the Bill and the 2001 Act with respect to the treatment of a patient for mental disorder.  These provisions will be re-examined on completion of the review by the Department of Health of the operation of the 2001 Act.</p><p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill passed second stage in the D&aacute;il last December and is currently being prepared for Committee Stage.</p></reply>

The term State Boards is somewhat imprecise as it includes bodies with a wide and diverse range of functions many of which would not fall into the more commonly understood definition of Board which is a body with a governance oversight of an organisation.  To be of assistance to the Deputy I have interpreted his question as embracing all bodies called Boards, irrespective of their functions, as well as other bodies with a governance remit whose title does not include the term &ldquo;Board&rdquo;.</p><p><b><i>Private Security Authority</i></b></p><p>Eleven appointments were made out of which seven positions were advertised as the remaining four positions, in accordance with the relevant legislation, are to be nominated representatives from my own Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSA itself.  Following my invitation for expressions of interest, a total of 29 applications were received.  Six of the seven appointments made following public advertising were drawn from the applications received.</p><p><b><i>Private Security Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>On the 3 April, 2012 the Government made the four appointments to the Private Security Appeal Board. The appointments to the Board are for a period of four years or until the attainment of the age of 70 years, whichever is the earlier.</p><p>These posts were not advertised on this occasion.  This was not felt necessary given the small number of appointees sought, the low level of activity and remuneration of the Board and the need to put the Board, with continuity of experience, in place as soon as possible.</p><p><b><i>Legal Aid Board</i></b></p><p>Fifteen appointments were made to the Legal Aid Board, nine were civil or public servants.</p><p><b><i>National Disability Authority</i></b></p><p>One appointment was made to the National Disability Authority (NDA) Board in January 2011, which was a nominee of the Minister for Health as prescribed in the National Disability Authority Act 1999 and did not require public advertisement.</p><p>One appointment was made to the Board in 2013 for which expressions of interest were sought from the public.</p><p><b><i>Courts Service Board</i></b></p><p>The Board consists of 17 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes eight other judges, the CEO of the Courts Service, persons nominated by the Law Society, Bar Council and ICTU, an elected staff representative and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice.  There have been nineteen appointments to the Courts Service Board of which three were individuals nominated by my predecessor Alan Shatter, T.D., including a civil servant from my Department.</p><p><b><i>Judicial Appointments Advisory Board</i></b></p><p>The Board consists of 10 members, it is chaired by the Chief Justice and includes three other judges, the Attorney General, persons nominated by the Law Society and Bar Council and three persons nominated by the Minister for Justice and Equality. There have been nine appointments to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board three of which were individuals nominated by my predecessor.</p><p><b><i>Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board</i></b></p><p>Four appointments were made to the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board during the period referred to by the Deputy.</p><p><b><i>Parole Board</i></b></p><p>Thirteen appointments were made to the Parole Board in the period referred to by the Deputy.

The CRA will be formally established on the 16 October, 2014.</p><p><b><i>Children Detention Schools Board of Management</i></b></p><p>One appointment was made to the Children Detention Schools Board of Management during the period in question.  The position was not advertised as the appointment was made under Section 167(4)(a) of the Children Act, 2001 as amended, which requires at least one officer of the Minister.  The person appointed was a civil servant.</p><p>The Deputy should note that responsibility for the Children Detention Schools Board of Management moved to the Department for Children and Youth Affairs on 1 January, 2012.</p><p><b><i>Property Registration Authority</i></b></p><p>Seven appointments were made to the Property Registration Authority in the period referred to by the Deputy. Of these, four were an officer of the Minister, a staff representative, a nominee of the Bar Council and a nominee of the Law Society, respectively. Expressions of interest were sought for the remaining positions.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Regulatory Authority </i></b></p><p>In 2012 eleven appointments were made to the Board of the Property Services Regulatory Authority. Of these, one was an appointment of the Minister.  Expressions of interest were sought.  114 applications were received.  Nine of those appointed were public applicants, one is a civil servant and the Chairperson, who was a member of the Property Services Regulatory Authority Implementation Team, was appointed in order to provide continuity to the Authority which had operated on a non-statutory basis for a number of years.</p><p><b><i>Property Services Appeal Board</i></b></p><p>The Government made six appointments after seeking expressions of interest of which my Department received 41 applications.  Those appointed were public applicants.</p><p><b><i>Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (IHREC)</i></b></p><p>On 8 September 2011, the Government decided to merge the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to establish a new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to promote human rights and equality issues in a more efficient, effective and coherent way.</p><p>The 14 outgoing members of the Equality Authority accepted reappointment in September 2011 for a further term which concluded at the end of July 2012.</p><p>In the case of the Human Rights Commission three Commissioners were appointed by a Government Decision on the 20 December 2011 and their term expired on 31 May, 2012.</p><p>The Working Group established to advise on the practical issues in relation to the establishment of a new merged Commission recommended that an Independent Selection Panel be set up for the purpose of appointing new and future members of this Commission.  This is in line with a fundamental requirement of the Paris Principles that the members of the IHREC be independent and that the selection process be independent of Government.</p><p>In November 2012, advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the position of Chief Commissioner and of &quot;ordinary&quot; member appeared in the media.  The Independent Selection Panel forwarded its recommendation of fourteen names in March 2013. While the persons recommended cannot be appointed to the IHREC in advance of the required legislation being enacted and commenced, the Government has appointed fourteen individuals as member of the Human Rights Commission and subsequently they will be appointed as members of the IHREC when the legislation is enacted, on a 3 year and 5 year basis to ensure that the terms of office of all members of the new Commission will not come to an end at the same time so as to preserve institutional continuity.</p><p>On 31 May 2013, the then Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr Alan Shatter, T.D., appointed twelve of their number to the Board of the Equality Authority under the Employment Equality Act 1998, as amended, on an interim basis of 3 years, but which will otherwise expire when the Bill to establish the IHREC is enacted and commenced and the two Bodies are dissolved.</p><p>Future selection of persons to serve as members of the IHREC will be vested in the Public Appointments Service (PAS) as provided for in the IHREC Bill which is currently before the Seanad.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board</i></b></p><p>Three appointments were made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Arbitration Board on 30 June, 2011. The positions were filled as part of an industrial relations mechanism and were not advertised. The Chair was agreed by both sides as were nominations as members of the Board by both the Employer and the Employee's side.</p><p><b><i>Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board</i></b></p><p>Nine appointments were made to board on 10 April, 2012. These positions were not advertised.  Eight of the outgoing members were re-appointed as the Board, which has been replaced by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, only had a few outstanding cases on hands at that time.  The outstanding cases have now been finalised and the necessary steps to close the Board are now being put in place. The 9th appointee is a civil servant.</p><p>Finally, I wish to advise the Deputy that expressions of interest are not sought in every case from members of the public who wish to be appointed to State Boards.  Some of the reasons for this are outlined above for example, (i) no expressions of interest were sought in respect of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Complaints Board who are dealing with outstanding old cases while the remainder of their work had transferred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, (ii) some of the members appointed must be officers of the Minister for Justice and Equality (see Property Services Regulatory Authority and Courts Service Board) and (iii) the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority appointments were made on a temporary basis, for continuity reasons, in advance of the introduction of imminent new legislation.</p></reply>

However, I can tell the Deputy that in February 2014 there were approximately 900 judicial reviews involving individuals resident in Direct Provision accommodation. It should be noted that the actual number of persons residing in Direct Provision accommodation whose applications are subject to judicial review is a multiple of this figure because, for instance, as families are normally processed by ORAC, RAT and INIS together, a judicial review taken by a single member of a family will have the effect of holding up the processing of a number of persons in the system. </p><p>   With regard to the question of costs, the costs of judicial reviews and other legal costs from the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) budget amounted to &euro;8.6m in 2011, &euro;6.3m in 2012 and &euro;5.8m in 2013.   While the downward trend in costs is very welcome, I am concerned with the overall high number of judicial reviews within the system. It is clear that the multi-layered and sequential processes associated with the current protection system and the related delays in finalising protection decisions are key contributors to those high numbers.</p><p>  In that regard, legislating to establish a single protection procedure is a priority in that it will provide the legislative framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system.  I am particularly anxious, therefore, to ensure that legislation in this area is brought forward this year  .</p></reply>

The Deputy might wish to note that at EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of persons present in the State without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In Ireland's case there are also considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account<i>. </i>Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom<i>.</i>It must also be emphasised that broad regularisation programmes are problematic, in particular as they could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services. Clearly there would also be significant issues in allowing illegal immigrants access to the labour marker in the context of the very large number of people unemployed in the State. Similar issues would arise in respect of access to the housing market and its related supports, such as supplementary welfare payments, rent allowances and so forth.</p><p>It should also be noted that in very many instances the delay in finalising cases is due to applicants challenging negative decisions by initiating multiple judicial reviews at various stages of the process. Thousands of applications cannot be finalised because of these legal challenges. Moreover, many other failed protection applicants do not leave the State when subject to a Deportation Order even though the clear legal requirement is for them to leave the State.</p><p>Measures have recently been taken with a view to delivering improvements in the processing of protection applications. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union (Subsidiary Protection) Regulations 2013 (S.I. No. 426 of 2013) were signed into law by my predecessor last November. Under the new Regulations, responsibility for the processing of applications for subsidiary protection was transferred from my Department to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) with appeals to be dealt with by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  Both of these bodies are independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and they have substantial experience in the area of asylum investigations and appeals, respectively. Additional resources have been allocated to the establishment and operation of the new arrangements for the processing of these cases which include the engagement of a panel of legally qualified persons to process cases, personal interviews for each applicant at the first instance and the opportunity for an applicant to appeal a negative recommendation of the ORAC to the RAT. The ORAC, in consultation with the UNHCR, have recently published on its website details of how it will prioritise the process of scheduling persons for interview taking into account, inter-alia, dealing with applicants who are longest in the system first. The intention is to process as many of these cases to finality as soon as possible to include consideration of any leave to remain aspects arising.</p><p>The Government remains committed to immigration and protection reform as provided for under the Programme for Government and under the Government Legislation Programme. Legislating to provide the means for a single procedure and related issues to deal with all protection claims is of priority in that it will provide the framework for removing the structural delays which are a feature of our existing protection system. In that respect work by my officials on legislative reform in this area continues, including in conjunction with the Offices of the Attorney General and of the Parliamentary Counsel, with a view to bringing forward legislation this year . <b><font color="#000080"> </font></b><b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

At my request, the HSE has taken urgent action to ensure Section 38 agencies which have been found to be in breach of this policy are brought into compliance.</p><p>  Following consultation between the agencies and the HSE, a substantial number of Section 38 Agencies submitted business cases seeking retention of unapproved allowances. </p><p>An Internal HSE Review Panel communicated their decisions in April on the business cases that were made to them by the Section 38 organisations.  The vast majority of the business cases were rejected.  It is anticipated that in advance of 1 July 2014 a number of agencies will seek approval to &lsquo;red-circle&rsquo; remuneration arrangements on behalf of a number of Senior Managers on a personal to holder basis where there is explicit evidence of entitlement of the individual recipients by virtue of their employment contractual rights. On receipt of such requests the HSE will review the documentation and where appropriate seek formal approval from the Department of Health who will liaise, as appropriate, with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in accordance with Circular 11/2013.   On the completion of the compliance process, a final report detailed by agency will be provided, at which time it is expected that all agencies will have demonstrated full compliance with Government pay policy. </p></reply>

The agreements, where entered into at the behest of either party, preclude the disclosure of settlement details by either party. </p><p>Historically, medical indemnity in Ireland has been offered to medical consultants and other healthcare professionals by two private companies, the Medical Defence Union (MDU) and the Medical Protection Society. </p><p>The Clinical Indemnity Scheme (CIS) was established in 2002, in order to rationalise pre-existing medical indemnity arrangements by transferring to the State,  responsibility for managing clinical negligence claims and associated risks. Under the scheme, which is managed by the State Claims Agency (SCA), the State assumes full responsibility for the indemnification and management of all clinical negligence claims, including those which are birth-related. </p><p>One of the Medical Defence Organisations, the MDU, contended that the Irish State should take over the historic liabilities of its members in respect of claims which occurred prior to the introduction of the Clinical Indemnity Scheme, as it alleged that the establishment of the Scheme deprived it of vital income to meet its historic liabilities in Ireland.  Despite protracted negotiations between the State and the MDU, it was not possible for the parties to reach agreement on this matter. The MDU subsequently began to refuse cover to its existing and former consultant members in Ireland. </p><p>To ensure that no one  who suffered from a medical mishap would be left without compensation in all reasonable circumstances, the Department put in place arrangements in October 2004 whereby consultants, refused indemnity by the MDU, would have their cases handled to completion by IHCA and IMO nominated solicitors whereupon, at the conclusion of individual proceedings, application could be made to the Minister for ex&ndash;gratia assistance in respect of settlements/award of damages and attendant legal costs. </p><p>In September 2012 the Government decided to accept an MDU offer of &euro;45 million in full and final settlement of its historic liabilities in Ireland.  This agreement is subject to a confidentiality clause.</p><p>Other settlements which included confidentiality agreements or confidentiality clauses, of which my Department is aware, over the period 2009 to 2014 to date are as follow:<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Settlements Paid</th><th>Legal Costs Paid</th></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>&euro;95,956.86</td><td>&euro;118,336.57</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>&euro;265,000.00</td><td>&euro;261,917.09</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>&euro;146,865.32</td><td>&euro;410,426.83</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>&euro;890,456.57</td><td>&euro;436,550.25</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>&euro;1,063,250.00</td><td>&euro;142,309.56</td></tr><tr><td>2014 to date</td><td>&euro;421,250.00</td><td>&euro;282,778.69</td></tr></table></p></reply>

It increased its prices by an average of 3% on March 1, 2014 and an average of 6% on March 1, 2013.  VHI has indicated that the price increases were necessary to cover the costs of providing for the healthcare needs of their customers in an aging market and it has continuously sought to keep any price increases as low as possible.  It has minimised price increases in the past two years because of the work it has done on cost containment.  This has been achieved through a range of measures, such as targeted claims efficiency programmes, reduced fees to providers, increased activity of the special claims investigation unit and the continued transition of procedures to lower cost medically appropriate settings.  It reduced its cost of total gross claims paid in 2013 by 2.1%.</p><p>  I have consistently urged the VHI and all the private health insurers to do everything possible to keep down the cost of private health insurance.  I am determined to address costs in this sector in the interest of consumers and I  have made it clear to insurers that I believe significant savings can still be made, the effect of which can be to minimise the need for increases in premiums. </p><p>  As part of the Consultative Forum on Health Insurance, I appointed Mr. Pat McLoughlin as Independent Chair to work with insurance companies and the Department to identify effective cost management strategies to help ensure the long-term sustainability of the private health insurance market.  Mr. McLoughlin&rsquo;s first report was published on 26 December 2013 and the second phase report is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks. </p><p>  Many consumers can make large savings on their health insurance premiums by shopping around for the health insurance plan that best suits their needs.  For those who have been insured on the same plan for a number of years, it is important to review the level of cover to ensure that their needs are being met, without being over-insured. Consumers have a legal right to switch between or within insurers to get better value and to reduce their premium costs.  The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) provides information to consumers regarding their rights and also on health insurance plans and benefits.  The HIA's website www.hia.ie has a useful plan comparison tool which assists in finding suitable and competitive health insurance plans.</p></reply>

Litigation and threat of litigation is one of the forms mentioned.    These measures are often utilised as a means of delaying various legislative provisions from coming into operation and as a means of diverting resources away from other tobacco control and health promotion initiatives.  Litigation also acts as a deterrent for other countries from developing and enacting new progressive pieces of tobacco control legislation. The threat of litigation should not be an obstacle to the introduction of important public health measures.  I am of the view that standardised packaging for tobacco products is a proportionate, evidence-based public health measure which will assist, together with the other many initiatives outlined in <i>Tobacco Free Ireland</i>, in reducing the overall prevalence of smoking in Ireland.  The introduction of standardised packaging has the support of the Government and has been considered and approved by Government.</p></reply>

In line with Government Decision S180/20/10/1424 of 2011, relating to the advertising for expressions of interest in vacancies on State Boards, my Department currently advertises for board vacancies as they arise, where I, as Minister for Health, have nominating rights under relevant legislation. I also appoint members on the nomination of various bodies, again in accordance with the relevant legislation.</p><p>There were some exceptions to the advertising process in 2012 and 2013.  In 2012, the members of the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal were appointed by me, on the advice of the Attorney General, as these members carry out a very specific role in relation to assessing the quantum of awards under the Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal Act.    Another exception was in the case of some hospital boards, e.g. Beaumont and St James&rsquo;s, where the term of existing members was extended as a prudent provisional measure, to allow time for appropriate competencies required in members of these boards to be set out, given the Health Reform Programme and its impact on hospital configuration.  Appointments of the new board members were subsequently advertised.  </p><p>In 2012 existing board members of the National Paediatric Hospital Board were re-appointed for a 3 month period to allow time to consider the competencies required by board members into the future.  In January 2013 four Departmental officials and two HSE nominated officials were appointed for a number of months for the same reason.  In July 2013,  I appointed the Chairperson and 3 other members for which I had nominating rights.  </p><p>The table below sets out the number of appointments to State Boards under the remit of my Department, where I have nominating rights, in each year from 2011 to 2014 (to date), including the number that were publicly advertised.<table><tr><th>Year</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014 (to date)</th></tr><tr><td>Number of Positions Advertised</td><td>N\A</td><td>98</td><td>115</td><td>59*</td></tr><tr><td>Ministerial Appointments made where Minister has nominating rights</td><td>34</td><td>100</td><td>140</td><td>57</td></tr></table>* I am about to make appointments to the two outstanding positions which were advertised in recent weeks. </p><p>In addition to the appointments in the above table, persons have been appointed to boards where I as Minister do not have nominating rights. 16 such appointments were made in 2011; 44 such appointments were made in 2012; 65 such appointments were made in 2013 and 27 such appointments have been made to date this year. I have no role in selecting the people to fill these board vacancies. </p></reply>

Therefore, it is essential to assess all projects, other than those where existing contractual commitments are in place, on their merits to ensure that the limited capital funding available goes to those developments which are of highest national importance based on service needs. As with all capital projects acute hospital projects must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service. The method and timescale for the delivery of health care infrastructure is a dynamic process which is constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation. There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-2018 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.</p></reply>

In 2011 there were 52 appointments, 78 in 2012, 79 in 2013 and 26 in 2014 to date.  I have made 228 of those appointments (including re-appointments) since becoming Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. Of the 2011 appointments, 7 were made by my predecessors while the remaining 45 were made by me. All subsequent appointments have been made by me. </p><p>I announced new procedures for appointment to boards in April 2011 and all appointments that I have made have followed these procedures. However none of the 7 appointments made in 2011 prior to my appointment followed these procedures or were the subject of any public advertisement. As the Deputy will be aware, his party Fianna F&aacute;il was in Government at that time.  The procedures include an open invitation for expressions of  interest in serving on the board of any of the agencies under the remit of my Department.  This invitation was renewed in January 2013.</p><p>Details of all appointments and vacancies are published on and I currently have a database of more than 500 individuals who have expressed interest. However, given the importance of ensuring the right mix of skills and experience on every board, appointments are not necessarily confined to those who have made such an expression. </p><p>In every case where expressions of interest are concerned, I give close consideration to individuals who I consider appropriate to promoting good governance at board level, and with experience or qualifications in finance (including audit capability and/or project assessment), law, corporate governance, marketing, IT, or with experience relevant to the transport, tourism and sports sectors.</p><p>While over half of my appointees have come through this process, I have also re-appointed people such as Gay Byrne (Chairman of the Road Safety Authority). There is no requirement for them to reply to the advertisement just for the sake of it. I have, on occasion, approached people to sit on a board because of their particular skills or experience.  Kathryn O'Leary Higgins is an example of such a person who was approached to sit on the board of the Shannon Group. Ms O'Leary Higgins was a former member of the United States&rsquo; National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) from 2006 to 2009, she also served as Deputy Secretary of the Department of Labor from 1997 to 1999 and also served in the White House as Assistant to the President and Secretary to the Cabinet from 1995 to 1997. Another example is Michael Cawley, whom I recently appointed Chairperson of F&aacute;ilte Ireland. He was previously the deputy chief executive and chief operating officer of Ryanair. </p></reply>

The public service vehicle licence is a paper based process and consequently it is currently not possible to facilitate the taxing of these vehicles through the online motor tax service.  The Department is currently examining the feasibility of developing an electronic interface with the National Transport Authority, who are the regulatory authority for the licensing and regulation of small public service vehicles, to supply the necessary supporting evidence to enable these vehicles to be taxed online.</p></reply>

Since my predecessor took office in March 2011, 48 persons were appointed to the boards of management under the aegis of the Department.</p><p>As the Deputy may be aware, in line with the Government decision of April 2011, new arrangements were put in place for the making of appointments to State Boards and bodies.  Following this Government Decision, a notice was placed on my Department's website inviting expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis.  The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies.  My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions.  My Department's website is monitored and updated on a regular basis to reflect the number of vacancies as they arise.  </p><p>In making decisions on appointments to boards, subject to the governing legislation, the most suitable persons are considered for positions with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities.
