There is no scope to give any consideration to the provision of additional teachers in order to reduce class sizes. </p><p>  Classroom teachers are currently allocated under the published Staffing Schedule on the basis of a general average of 1 teacher for every 28 pupils with lower thresholds  for DEIS Band 1 schools. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. My Department's guidance to schools is that variations in class sizes should be kept to the minimum.</p></reply>

This is a matter that I will have to consider with my colleagues in Cabinet in the context of the next budget and meeting our obligations under the EU/IMF Programme.  The government will of course try to ensure all budget decisions are as fair and equitable as possible but I cannot give specific commitments here today.</p><p>  DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion remains my Department's policy instrument to address educational disadvantage which focuses on addressing and prioritising the educational needs of children and young people from disadvantaged communities, from pre-school through second-level education.It should be remembered that over 50% of disadvantaged students do not actually attend DEIS schools.</p><p>  A key focus of the Government's education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. Therefore it is my intention that the additional resources available to DEIS schools are utilised to optimum benefit to achieve identified outcomes for the most at risk pupils.</p></reply>

These measures have to be viewed against the backdrop of a very serious financial and budgetary situation. They reflect a position where this country has lost its economic sovereignty and no longer has full control over its economic affairs.</p><p>  Reductions in the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, date back to the last Government. More recently, this Government has made further adjustments on foot of the allowances review. </p><p>  In the case of teachers, while there has been a small decline in applications to the B.Ed for primary teaching between 2011 and 2012, the overall number of applications remains high. A similar trend obtains for the professional diploma in education (PDE), which is the main route to post-primary teaching. It is significant that successful applicants to the B.Ed courses in 2012 continue to be from the top quartile of Leaving Cert students, in terms of points.</p></reply>

They have provided me with the following information on this matter. </p><p>  There are a wide range of oral tests.  The tests in each language are recorded by examiners onto cassette tapes supplied by the State Examinations Commission.  However, the SEC does not supply examiners with the tape recording equipment; this is provided by schools.  </p><p>  The SEC must be mindful of the availability in schools of recording equipment as examiners must be provided with a recording device for the duration of their assignment in the school.  The use of cassette tape for the recording of the oral tests provides a portable and reliable recording medium which is widely available in schools and which is easy to operate. </p><p>  The SEC recognises that digital recording equipment has become more widely available and less expensive in recent years than it was in the past.  The SEC will be reviewing the options in this regard in the future, subject to a clear identification of need and resource considerations. In the interim, the State Examinations Commission assures me that there is no diminution in quality or the proper administration of the Leaving Certificate examinations through the ongoing use of cassette tapes for the recording of the oral tests. </p></reply>

This programme addresses four main areas which need to work together to build capacity in this domain: Deployment of ICT infrastructure; Professional development for teachers, in the pedagogical use of ICT; Identifying and sharing suitable online content and resources; Broadband for schools.</p><p>  Between November 2009 and November 2010, my Department distributed &euro;46m in ICT grants directly to primary schools. Schools were asked firstly to equip each classroom with a teaching computer and digital projector. Once that baseline is in place schools can use remaining funding for other educational ICT requirements. </p><p>  To help schools make the most of their investment, we have delivered some strategic national supports in tandem, including, ICT courses and elearning seminars for teachers through their local education centres, an internet safety programme and a portal for collaborative development and dissemination of curriculum-relevant digital content  - Scoilnet.ie</p></reply>

In making this decision each school should consider all the available information and in this regard the Professional Development Service for Teachers &ndash; which now incorporates the ICT in Schools function is available to advise schools. One of the main factors to be considered by schools is the cost and I would urge schools to consult with parents before they make any plans in this important area. My Department is not in a position to make new grant funding available for purchase of ebooks and associated services and devices. However, I would like to clarify that schools may choose to allocate the existing book grant provided by my Department towards purchase of electronic books if they wish.</p><p>  It is vital that all students can participate equally in our schools, and also that students can move between classes and schools, without parents being forced to incur additional costs. I believe that we must continue working with industry to develop common standards that ensure free movement within our education system, and also funding mechanisms that can ensure equality of opportunity for all students in relation to ICT equipment. To that end, I expect that these issues will be advanced through the forum consisting of education and industry that advises on these matters.</p></reply>

In the 2011-12 school year, the Inspectorate of my Department prepared draft School Self-evaluation Guidelines. These draft Guidelines were trialled in a pilot scheme in a small number of primary and post-primary schools in the school year 2011-12. Detailed feedback on the operation of the guidelines was obtained from the pilot schools. The Inspectorate then engaged in an extensive consultation process about the Guidelines and set up an advisory group with representatives of all the education partners. Over a series of meetings between May and September 2012, the views of all partners were carefully considered together with the outcomes of the pilot phase. The guidelines have been re-written and an introductory booklet on school self-evaluation has also been prepared for schools. These publications are currently with designers and printers and I expect to publish them with an accompanying circular shortly. Web-based support, seminars for school principals, and advisory visits to schools by inspectors are among the range of supports that will be offered to schools to aid the introduction of school self-evaluation.</p></reply>

Funding is also provided through the home tuition programme for children with autism aged from 2 &frac12; years to 5 who are unable to access an early intervention class.</p><p>- An extended school year is also currently available for pupils who have either a severe/profound general learning disability or who have autism. </p><p>  Finally, I wish to assure the Deputy that it is my intention that resources available to my Department are utilised to optimum benefit to ensure the best possible outcomes for students with special educational needs.

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families. Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks. I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.</p><p>  The Association has responded positively to my approaches and have agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members. The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. </p><p>  The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts in the range 10% to 17.5% so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes. </p><p>  All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.</p><p>  In May my Department published research which shows that there is a high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary school level. The research indicates that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and I want to encourage this practice across all schools. Results at second level are not as conclusive.</p><p>  My Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012. A grant of &euro;11 per pupils is provided to primary schools, with DEIS schools receiving &euro;21. At second level the grant is &euro;24, with DEIS schools receiving &euro;39 per pupil.</p></reply>

In addition to these new schools, it may be necessary to extend the capacity of many existing schools to meet the demand for increased pupil places.  My Department will consider applications by schools for funding for additional classrooms, which schools may provide on a permanent basis, where an immediate enrolment need is arising.</p><p>  The above developments are in addition to the 4 new post primary schools that have already been established in North County Dublin since 2008 i.e. Donabate Community College, Phibblestown Community College, Ardgillan Community College and Luttrellstown Community College. An additional 4,000 student places will be provided for in the area, once these schools are at full capacity. </p><p>  My priority is to ensure that there is sufficient school accommodation to meet projected pupil enrolment increases into the future. The 5 Year Construction Plan that I announced on 9 March last as part of a &euro;2 billion capital investment programme outlines the major school projects that will commence construction over the duration of the Plan.   The current status of all projects on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.</p></reply>

Central to this is the "Special Education Support Service" (SESS) which was established in September 2003. The service consolidates, co-ordinates, develops and delivers a range of professional development initiatives and support structures for school personnel working with students with special educational needs including teachers of children with ASD who teach in a variety of educational settings. These settings include mainstream primary and post-primary schools, special schools and special classes.</p><p>  SESS provides a wide range of supports and interventions in the area of Autism via online training, face-to-face training, phone advice and individualised support for schools identified with CPD needs. The approaches include Language and Communication, Managing Inclusion, Curriculum Access for Pupils with General Learning Disabilities and Autism, Sensory Integration, PECS, TEACCH, Social Stories, and Applied Behaviour Analysis. Delivery of this CPD begins prior to their entry to the units and continues following the opening of the unit with ongoing in school support as well as programmes of CPD.  Since 2008 SESS has provided over 19,400 CPD places to teachers of students with ASD which include in-school support, seminars, online courses, ABA and Asperger's Syndrome. Furthermore, teachers can now have SESS CPD in the area of ASDs accredited by St Angela's College in Sligo. </p><p>  Funding is also available through the SESS support scheme enabling teachers to identify their own CPD needs and attend appropriate and relevant courses not provided directly by the SESS. Funding of over &euro;16,000 was provided to cover these applications in the 2010/2011 school year. Further information on all supports provided by SESS to teacher of special needs students is available on the SESS website at www.sess.ie. </p><p>  In addition, my Department also funds several third level courses in teacher training colleges and universities. These include:</p><p>- Graduate Certificate in the education of students with ASDs (St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra) (18 places available annually)</p><p>- Post-Graduate Certificate/Diploma Programme of Continuing Professional Development in Special Educational Needs (ASDs) for teachers (St. Angela's College, Sligo) (25 places available annually)</p><p>- Diploma in Applied Behaviour Analysis (Trinity College, Dublin) (3 places available annually)</p></reply>

However, even with the best possible systems in place, securing equilibrium between demand and supply is not an exact science, and is subject to quite a number of variables.  Recent developments, such as the EU rules on mutual recognition of qualifications, have also meant that supply is more difficult to control and predict.</p><p>  The level of student intake to the state-funded primary Colleges of Education is determined annually by my Department and it takes account of the supply of, and demand for, primary teachers. The level of intake has decreased in recent years in light of available resources and factors impacting on demand. This situation is subject to review.  </p><p>  As education at post-primary level is on the basis of subjects, the situation is complex and therefore difficult to predict and plan for.  Post-primary teachers are generally qualified to teach more than one subject but may not be deployed to teach these in equal measures at school level.  School management authorities have the flexibility to deploy teachers to meet demands.  Schools are also responsible for deciding what subjects and programmes to offer and this can vary from school to school in accordance with local need.  This in turn, determines the type of teacher competencies/specialisms required.  While the numbers of PDE (formerly the H.Dip) places have remained fairly constant over recent years, there can be particular subjects which, over time, become more or less in demand and this can lead to a surplus or deficit of teachers of that discipline. I understand that in the present climate, there are newly qualified teachers not yet holding teaching positions in schools. The selection processes required of schools, and the imminent commencement of Section 30 of the Teaching Council Act depend on there being a supply of suitable individuals within the marketplace.  </p><p>  Measures have been taken to alleviate difficulties for new teachers. My Department has introduced regulations which oblige schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones. In addition, the JobBridge National Internship Scheme has been extended to teachers. </p><p>  I have no immediate plans to request a survey of the type the Deputy suggests. However, I intend to explore the matter of teacher supply further with the HEA, the Teaching Council, and the initial teacher education providers, as appropriate.</p></reply>

It reflects recent developments in understanding how children learn and develop in early childhood. These developments include the importance of ensuring a balance between adult-led and child-led activities, as well as the importance of play in children's learning and development from birth to six years. Aistear can help teachers to prioritise play and active learning in implementing the curriculum for infant classes in primary schools.  </p><p>  Work is already underway through a collaboration between the NCCA and the Association of Teachers' Education Centres in Ireland (ATECI) to support consistency amongst teachers in developing their use of play as a teaching and learning methodology. The NCCA is also working with a number of schools to gather examples of teaching and learning in infant classrooms. Some of these examples will become part of the revised infant curriculum.</p></reply>

While the Government has undertaken to protect education spending as much as possible, we are not operating in a vacuum. Despite the fact that there have already been significant reductions in public expenditure, further expenditure consolidation is necessary if we are to regain our economic independence. I would like to be in a position of not having to make any further savings on the Education and Skills Vote and for those savings to be secured elsewhere. However, I must also accept that all Government Departments must play their part in reducing expenditure. Identifying and securing savings on my Department's Vote in 2013 will be extremely challenging.  However, measures such as this are necessary if we are to secure the viability of our country and enable us to fund public services into the future in a sustainable manner.</p></reply>

The T&aacute;naiste and I hope to announce the name of the chairperson of the Convention shortly, and it is expected that the Convention will hold its inaugural meeting soon after that.</p><p><table><tr><th><b>Commitment</b></th><th><b>Status</b></th></tr><tr><td>We will require Departments to publish Regulatory Impact Assessments before Government decisions are taken, thereby offering a further channel to obtain the views of civil society on new rules and regulations. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Referendum on the Abolition of the Seanad</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish a Constitutional Convention to consider comprehensive constitutional reform, with a brief to consider, as a whole or in sub-groups, and report within 12 months on the following: Review of our D&aacute;il electoral system,  Reducing the Presidential term to 5 years and aligning it with the local and European elections, Provision for same-sex marriage, Amending the clause on women in the home and encourage greater participation of women in public life, Removing blasphemy from the Constitution, Possible reduction of the voting age, Other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by the Convention. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Reduce the number of committees and give key committees constitutional standing: the D&aacute;il needs fewer but stronger committees, resourced properly.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a role for the Ceann Comhairle in deciding whether a Minister has failed to provide reasonable information in response to a question</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The chief executive of every state funded body will be required to attend the relevant Oireachtas committee on a regular basis to answer oral parliamentary questions that can be submitted by any member, on a similar basis to the attendance of Ministers before the full D&aacute;il. </td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>We will amend D&aacute;il standing orders to ensure that replies to written questions are furnished within a specified number of days, even during D&aacute;il recess.</td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>To make the oral question process more effective, we propose to increase the time allocated to oral questions. To provide balance, there will be a reduction in the number of oral questions being submitted to one per member.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>A member must be present in the chamber when his or her question is reached, although they may defer to another member the right to ask a supplementary question</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate on the issue of cabinet confidentiality.</td><td>Cabinet confidentiality is provided for in Constitution</td></tr><tr><td>We propose an Investigations, Oversight and Petitions Committee of the Oireachtas. It would be a powerful committee, constructed on the lines of the Public Accounts Committee, bi-partisan in structure and chaired by a senior member of the opposition.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Committee would receive parliamentary petitions from individuals and groups in the community seeking the redress of grievances connected with the public services of the State and with the public administration generally. Its functions would be to act as a &quot;clearing house&quot;, directing complaints to those bodies most competent to act on them: the Ombudsman, the Data Protection Commissioner, the Local Government Auditor, the Oireachtas committee that has oversight of the relevant Department, and so on.  </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will refer to the Constitutional Convention, the issue of reducing the Voting Age to 17 and giving citizens the right to vote at Irish Embassies in the Presidential election.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will ask the Constitutional Convention, which is examining electoral reform, to make recommendations as to how the number of women in politics can be increased.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a new code of practice for the use of the government jet, ensuring transparent and cost effective travel.</td><td>Use of jet much reduced</td></tr><tr><td>We will give committees the power to introduce legislation, while a new 10 Minute Rule will allow backbench TDs to introduce their own Bills. We will also tackle the huge over-use of guillotines to ram through non-emergency legislation</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a package of changes that will bring about a 50 per cent increase in D&aacute;il sitting days. D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann will in future meet four days a week. There will be a summer recess of just six weeks and significantly reduced breaks at Christmas and Easter. We will abandon the practice of providing a &#8220;mid-term break&#8221; &#8211; a full week off at St Patrick&#8217;s Day and Hallowe&#8217;en.  When the D&aacute;il is not in session the Committees shall agree by roster that a particular Committee shall meet in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We propose to break the Government monopoly on legislation and the stranglehold over the business of the D&aacute;il, by providing that the new Friday sittings will be given over exclusively to committee reports and private members business except where urgent government business must be taken.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will enhance the democratic process by involving public representatives at an earlier stage of the legislative process, particularly before Bills are published. We will amend cabinet procedure instructions so as to allow government to publish the general scheme of a Bill so that Oireachtas Committees can debate and hold hearings at an early stage.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>While recognising that there may be exceptional circumstances in which debate may need to be concluded by a given deadline, we will restrict the use of guillotine motions and other procedural devices that prevent Bills from being fully debated, so that guillotining is not a matter of routine as it has become at present, particularly at the end of a session. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will also deal with the related problem of legislation being shunted through at high speed and will ensure that D&aacute;il standing orders provide a minimum of two weeks between each stage of a Bill, except in exceptional circumstances.</td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>In order to enhance the role of the legislative committees, we will organise a committee week every fourth sitting week. The D&aacute;il plenary will sit only for questions, including Leaders&#8217; Questions and the order of business and the remainder of the day will be taken up in committee.</td><td>Action Required</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish a petition system to the D&aacute;il, similar to that operating in the European Parliament, to be managed by a specific D&aacute;il committee that will investigate and report on petitions which raise issues warranting attention.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will enhance the parliamentary relationship with the European Parliament in conjunction with Ireland&#8217;s MEPs. These arrangements will include regular attendance by MEPs at relevant D&aacute;il committees. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will significantly revamp the adjournment debate format. It will be renamed the topical issue debate. There will be a minimum of 5 topical issues. These will be taken in the middle of the day and there will be provision for questions at the end. A Minister or Minister of State from the relevant Department will be present and there will be an end to the practice of one junior Minister reading out scripts on behalf of a number of Departments about a range of issues of which he or she knows nothing.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The standing orders on urgent issues are used regularly to attempt to raise issues that are not urgent and such requests are almost invariably refused. We will make the D&aacute;il rules for raising urgent issues more meaningful by requiring a minimum number of signatories for such a request. In future, Standing Order 32 requests will not be read out.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Taoiseach will be obliged to brief the Oireachtas prior to attending European Council meetings and to engage with the Oireachtas in debate on EU issues of national significance and concern.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will devote a full week each year to debating major EU issues of concern to Ireland such as the Draft Annual Work Programme, Green and White Papers and proposals for EU budget co-ordination.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>The Oireachtas will be linked up with the Irish offices of the European Commission and the European Parliament in communicating Europe to the Irish people. Outreach programmes, meetings and competitions particularly in schools will be organised and TDs and Senators invited to participate.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Under the Lisbon Treaty provisions the Oireachtas is entitled to receive all documents produced by the EU Commission at the same time as the EU institutions and the Irish Government receive them. We will ensure all EU documents are forwarded to the Oireachtas through the Ceann Comhairle and the Cathaoirleach. They will transmit them to the Oireachtas library and the relevant Committees. Every TD and Senator will be informed of the documents as they arrive, so that they can engage in EU matters that concern or interest them.</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We propose that Oireachtas Committees will play the major role in scrutinising the EU in the coming years.  Greater emphasis will be placed on deepening the involvement in EU matters of the Oireachtas committees that shadow the work of each Government Department. We will oblige all sectoral committees to deal with EU matters that come within their remit within a defined period of time.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Committees will be supplemented by a system of subcommittees and a system of rapporteurs who have a particular interest in an area of policy or scrutiny and who volunteer to carry out an in-depth study for the relevant committee.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>The Regulatory Impact Assessments prepared for Ministers on all EU Directives and significant Regulations will be forwarded automatically to the relevant sectoral Oireachtas Committees. These Committees should advise the Minister and the Joint Committee on European Affairs as to whether the transposition should take place by Statutory Instrument or by primary legislation. Where primary legislation is recommended the full Oireachtas plenary process should be followed.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>All Ministers will be obliged to appear before their respective Committees or before the Committee on European Affairs prior to travelling to Brussels for meetings of the Council where decisions are made.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will reduce the size of the Department of the Taoiseach, transforming it into the equivalent of a Cabinet Office that oversees the delivery of a new Programme for Government. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Require Departments to carry out and publish Regulatory Impact Assessments before Government decisions are taken. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Prioritise a programme of law reform arising out of the recommendations made by the Law Reform Commission.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We are fully committed to the EU2020 strategy and its creation of employment and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will commission an independent audit into the transposition and implementation of EU legislation, placing priority on laws and regulations that caused concern or deemed burdensome to Irish business. We will put in place a mechanism across Government to accelerate implementation of directives, involving relevant Departments and the Attorney&#8217;s Office. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will rationalise regulators to strengthen consumer regulation and promote the consumer interest. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr></table></p></reply>

In particular, applicants through the <i>Passport Express</i> postal service which is available at all Post Offices can normally expect to receive their new passports within ten days.  The Passport Service also currently provides emergency out-of-hours passport services in Dublin and Cork.  The Department also operates an out of hours Duty Officer arrangement to deal with consular and other non-passport emergencies.  The need to assess all services with a view to achieving cost savings has given rise to a full review of the Department&#8217;s duty officer services in Ireland.  This has resulted in a proposal for a new integrated duty officer service based in Dublin which will deal with all emergencies, including emergency passport services to the country as a whole.  The cost of maintaining emergency passport duty officer services in Dublin and Cork separate from the diplomatic duty officer is no longer seen as justified from a cost/benefit perspective.  For example, the emergency service in Cork costs &#8364;575 per week and has issued approximately 1.3 passports per week in the year to date.  Departmental management and the Staff Side unions are working together to finalise the operational aspects of the proposed new integrated duty officer service.  The sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for certain aspects will also be required.  It is hoped that the new service will be operational from late November, yielding savings of in excess of &#8364;67,000 per annum.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-09a.229.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100900055#WRD03000"><p>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) is a withholding tax system that operates in the construction, forestry and meat processing sectors.  Principal contractors are defined in the legislation (section 530A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997) as including &#8220;any board or body established by or under statute &#8230; and funded wholly or mainly out of funds provided by the Oireachtas&#8221;.  As such, school Boards of Management are principal contractors for the purposes of RCT.  Under VAT law, where a principal contractor (generally as defined for RCT purposes) receives services consisting of construction operations (again generally as defined for RCT purposes) the principal is an accountable person and is liable to pay the VAT chargeable on those services on a reverse charge basis.  In this regard, where a school Board of Management receives services consisting of construction operations the Board must register for VAT and account for VAT on the received services.</p><p>  I am also informed that Finance Act 2011 did not introduce any change in terms of the obligations of Boards of Management to operate RCT or VAT.  Nor did the Revenue Commissioners issue a directive in this regard.  Principal contractors, including school Boards of Management are, and always were, required to deduct tax from the payments made to subcontractors and pay it over to Revenue.  As it is recognised that it would be undesirable to deduct tax from compliant subcontractors, provision is made for compliant subcontractors to receive payments without deduction of tax.  The need to ensure tax compliance by subcontractors is particularly important where the Exchequer is the ultimate source of the funds being paid out by school Boards of Management and other principal contractors.  RCT and the VAT reverse charge system play an important role in ensuring tax compliance by subcontractors in these sectors.</p><p>  From 1 January 2012, the Revenue Commissioners have substantially modernised the operation of RCT following the introduction of a dedicated online facility which offers principal contractors a fast, efficient and paper free system.  This has streamlined the process for the submission of information and payments to Revenue and has had the effect of significantly reducing the administrative burden associated with RCT.</p><p>  I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware of the difficulty some school Boards of Management may be having in fulfilling their obligations under the RCT and VAT systems.  Revenue has met with the Department of Education and Skills regarding the obligations of Boards of Management under the RCT and VAT systems and has also met with representatives of some Boards of Management.  In addition, Revenue has participated in a series of seminars throughout the country during September/October 2012 organised by the<font color="#5F5F5F"> </font>Joint Managerial Board in conjunction with the Catholic Primary School Management Association.  These seminars are aimed at school Principals, members of boards of management, bursars and secretarial/accounts personnel who are likely to be in receipt of State funding for construction projects with a view to assisting them with their RCT and VAT responsibilities.  Detailed guidance notes specifically tailored for school Boards of Management regarding the operation of RCT and VAT were made available by Revenue in July and the availability of these notes has been highlighted to the Boards of Management representative bodies.  They have been published on the Revenue website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>.</p><p>  Finally, having regard to the pressures on the public finances, it is important that the RCT and VAT systems are implemented correctly in order to minimise tax evasion in the construction sector particularly where the project involves substantial State funding.  The new online system introduced by Revenue has significantly simplified the RCT process for principal contractors, including school Boards of Management.</p></reply>

They attach a high priority to this area, and they continuously review their response to the problem and their effectiveness in tackling the illicit tobacco trade.  In 2010, Revenue established a high-level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level, to examine the risks related to tobacco products tax evasion and to oversee and optimise the detection of contraband and counterfeit tobacco products.  This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco.  These include the adoption of a comprehensive tobacco strategy, which is underpinned by annual action plans.  This 3-year (2011-2013) strategy, which is published on Revenue&#8217;s website <i>www.revenue.ie</i>, includes a series of programmes which are designed to complement each other in targeting the supply and demand sides of the market for contraband tobacco in Ireland.</p><p>  Revenue&#8217;s strategic-level plans include ensuring that the legitimate trade remains compliant; delivering more effective and visible interventions through enhanced capability and better deployment of resources; further development of cooperation and intelligence sharing at organisational, national and international level; a commitment to prosecute all serious cases of tobacco tax evasion and a focus, in partnership with other Government agencies, on reducing the demand for contraband tobacco.</p><p>  With regard to the activity referred to in the question, I am informed that Revenue regularly carries out covert and overt intelligence led operations in an effort to deter and detect these individuals.

The Act and the Statute guarantee the independence of the Governor in carrying out his ESCB related functions and control over pay and conditions is seen as a necessary part of that independence.</p><p>  Salary reductions and pension-related reductions were applied in the Central Bank under the provisions of the Financial Measures in the Public Interest Acts as was the case in the wider public service.  Furthermore, my Department wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank in 2011 outlining the Government&rsquo;s approach to pay levels to senior public servants, in particular those whose remuneration exceeds &euro;200,000 per annum.  It was suggested that the Central Bank would provide for disclosure where employees are in receipt of remuneration exceeding the &euro;200,000 per annum threshold.  The Governor responded positively saying that the Central Bank have greatly increased the amount of information regarding senior staff remuneration in recent years and sees advantage in continuing this trend and making disclosures in respect of all employees where total remuneration exceeds &euro;200,000 per annum.</p><p>  In that respect the Central Bank publishes information related to remuneration of executive and non-executive directors in its annual report.  In 2011 the Governor of the Central Bank waived &euro;41,740 of his total remuneration for that year and has indicated that he will waive &euro;63,324 of his total remuneration in 2012.</p></reply>

Earlier recapitalisation in advance of publication of the stress tests will not contribute to market stability and confidence. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We remain committed to a smaller banking system that reduces its reliance on funding from the Irish and European Central Banks and volatile market sources. In order, however, to limit further calls on the State to cover bank losses from distressed asset sales, bank de-leveraging must be paced to match the return of more normal market conditions and demand for bank assets. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>As an interim measure, we will seek to replace emergency lending to our banks with medium-term, affordable, official financing in a way that can restore confidence among other potential lenders in the liquidity position of our banks. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will end further asset transfers to NAMA, which are unlikely to improve market confidence in either the banks or the State. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund small and medium-sized businesses in the real economy during the re-structuring and down-sizing programme. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce a comprehensive special resolution regime for dealing with bank insolvencies. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>The Government accepts that enabling provisions in legislation may be necessary to extend the scope of bank liability restructuring to include unsecured, unguaranteed senior bonds. </td><td>Review</td></tr><tr><td>The new Government will seek to dispose of the public stakes in the banks as soon as possible at the best possible return to the taxpayer. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will create an integrated decision making structure among all relevant State Departments and Agencies to replace the current fragmented approach of State bodies in dealing with the financial crisis. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>The new Government will re-structure bank boards and replace directors who presided over failed lending practices. We will ensure that the regulator has sufficient powers of pre-approval of bank directors and senior executives. To expedite this change-over we will openly construct a pool of globally experienced financial services managers and directors to be inserted into key executive and non-executive positions in banks receiving taxpayer support. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will insist on the highest standards of transparency in the operation of NAMA, on reduction in the costs associated with the operation of NAMA, and that decision-making in NAMA does not delay the restoration of the Irish property market. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>Once the banking sector has been restored and is functioning effectively, we will introduce a bank levy based on the size of a bank&#8217;s liabilities (other than shareholder capital). </td><td>Review </td></tr><tr><td>We will establish a Strategic Investment Bank </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We recognise the important role of Credit Unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions. In Government, we will establish a Commission to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for Credit Unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We support the future development of the IFSC as a source of future employment growth, subject to appropriate regulation. We will establish a taskforce on the future of the financial services sector to maximise employment opportunities in financial services for staff leaving employment as a result of downsizing. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that the investigations into failures in the banking system are adequately resourced.</td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>All remuneration schemes at banks subject to state support will undergo a fundamental review to ensure an alignment of interest between banks, their staff and the taxpayer. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>Cut the 13.5% rate of VAT to 12% up to end 2013</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will exempt from VAT service companies that export more than 90% of their output.</td><td>Not being pursued in line with legal advice</td></tr><tr><td>Subject to a cost benefit analysis, we will amend the RD tax credit regime to make it more attractive and accessible to smaller businesses, in the following ways: companies with RD expenditures of under &#8364;100,000 will be entitled to full tax credit on those entire expenditures as opposed to just the increment over the base year, with marginal relief for companies with expenditure just over &#8364;100,000, we will allow companies to offset the RD credit against employers. PRSI as an alternative to corporation tax, to cut down on red tape in the applications process, companies in receipt of a Research, Technology and Innovation (RTI) grant from one of the development agencies will be automatically deemed as entitled to the RD tax credit. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will direct the Revenue Commissioners to examine the feasibility of introducing &#8211; on a revenue neutral basis &#8211; a Single Business Tax for micro enterprises (with a turnover of less than &#8364;75,000 per annum) to replace all the existing taxes on sole traders and small businesses to cut compliance costs and make starting a business much less daunting. </td><td>Review </td></tr><tr><td>We will create a Strategic Investment Bank that will become a provider of finance to large capital projects, a conduit for venture capital and a lender to SMEs. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>The Government will put in place a parallel, commercially-financed investment programme in key networks of the economy to support demand and employment in the short-term, and to provide the basis for sustainable, export-led jobs and growth for the next generation.  Streamlined and restructured semi-States will make significant additional investments, over and above current plans, over the next four years in &quot;next generation&quot; infrastructures in energy, broadband, forestry and water. These investments &#8211; and the accompanying semi-state restructuring process &#8211; will be financed and pro-actively managed by a New Economy and Recovery Authority (NewERA), which will absorb the National Pension Reserve Commission.</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We believe it is appropriate, in order to enhance international credibility, to stick to the aggregate adjustment as set out in the National Recovery Plan for the combined period 20112012. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>In preparation for Budget 2013, we will review progress on deficit reduction, and draw up a plan which will achieve the objective of reaching the 3% of GDP target for the General Government Deficit by the target date of 2015. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Should Ireland succeed in obtaining a lower interest rate on its loans, this should be offset against the aggregate adjustment required over the term of the programme. </td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We believe that achieving the 3% of GDP deficit target should be seen as an intermediate step in the process of restoring the public finances, and that further reductions in the general government deficit as a share of national income will be required thereafter</td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>As part of our fiscal strategy the new Government will: Keep the corporate tax rate at 12.5%</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Maintain the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits. We will not increase the top marginal rates of taxes on income. </td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We will reduce, cap or abolish property tax reliefs and other tax shelters which benefit very high income earners. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will also ensure the implementation of a minimum effective tax rate of 30% for very high earners.</td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>Consider, arising from the previous Government&#8217;s deal with the IMF, various options for a site valuation tax. Any site valuation tax must take into account the significant number of households in mortgage distress and provide local government with a reliable stream of revenue</td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will limit the top rate of VAT to 23%</td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We will review the Universal Social Charge  </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that tax exiles make a fair contribution to the Exchequer</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish an independent Fiscal Advisory Council (FAC), separated from fiscal decision-makers in government, that would undertake official fiscal macroeconomic projections and monitoring.  Its functions would include identifying and advising on cyclical and counter-cyclical fiscal policies and structural deficits; the cyclical or temporary nature of particular revenues; and the need to maintain an appropriate and effective tax base. The Fiscal Advisory Council will be independent of Government and will report to the D&aacute;il and the public. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>The modelling assumptions and inputs of the Fiscal Advisory Council will, as far as possible, be open to public scrutiny and its outputs would be freely available to external bodies, including in particular, the opposition parties. </td><td>Matter for the Fiscal Council following their establishment</td></tr><tr><td>We will open up the Budget process to the full glare of public scrutiny in a way that restores confidence and stability by exposing and cutting failing programmes and pork barrel politics. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will reform the Department of Finance by bringing in new leadership and skills to restore its capacity and credibility in financial and macroeconomic management. Specifically, we will make an external appointment of an economist of international repute to head up the Department&#8217;s Budget and Economic Policy division.   </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will bring new talent and skills into the Department of Finance. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>Tax incentives for private hospital developments will cease. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Increasing mortgage interest relief to 30% for First Time Buyers in 2004-08 (from the current sliding scale of 20% to 25% depending on the year the mortgage was taken out), financed in part by bringing forward the abolition of relief for new buyers from June 2011. </td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>Directing any mortgage provider in receipt of State support to present Government with a plan of how intends to cut its costs, over and above existing plans, in a fair manner by a sufficient amount to forego a 25 basis point increase on their variable rate mortgage. </td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Introducing a two year moratorium on repossessions of modest family homes where a family makes an honest effort to pay their mortgage. </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will ensure that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator supervise credit institutions' mortgage lending practices comprehensively and intensively.</td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>Where credit institutions fail to adequately control mortgage lending risks, the Central Bank will impose loan-to-value ceilings on mortgages, caps on loan-to income multiples, limits on the term of new mortgages, and more rigorous procedures for verifying borrowers' incomes.</td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>Increase the penalty for tobacco smuggling for commercial purposes and provide robust detection measures to counteract such smuggling.</td><td>Achieved</td></tr><tr><td>Seek to combat drug supplies at source by providing x-ray scanners at major ports; greater patrols along coastline and increasing presence of Customs officers at smaller airports.</td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>Tightly regulate moneylenders.</td><td>Achieved </td></tr><tr><td>We will accelerate Capital Allowances on software purchases against income tax and corporation profits tax from 8 to 3 years subject to a cost benefit analysis.  </td><td>On track</td></tr><tr><td>We will exempt farm diesel from further increases in the carbon tax.</td><td>Achieved</td></tr></table></p></reply>

While I regret the closure of any bank branches, the Deputy will no doubt appreciate that the provision of services by banks, including the location of branches, is a commercial decision for the banks.  Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder in some banks, it is imperative that the banks are run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State.  The Deputy might wish to note that there is a provision in the Central Bank&#8217;s &quot;Consumer Protection Code&quot; which imposes certain obligations on banks that have decided to close, merge or move a branch in a different location.  The relevant provision states:<blockquote><i>Where a credit institution plans to close, merge or move a branch it must notify the Central Bank immediately and provide at least two months notice to affected consumers to enable them to make alternative arrangements.  The credit institution must ensure all business of the branch is properly completed prior to the closure, merger or move, or alternatively inform the consumer of how continuity of service will be provided.  The wider community must be informed, in advance, through notification in the local press.</i></blockquote>  The advance notification requirement is designed to give existing consumers the necessary time to choose another credit institution.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that it is an inevitable, but unfortunate, consequence of the necessary restructuring of the banking system &#8211; and return to viability - that branches in certain towns and villages will be closed.  I appreciate that the branch closures will have an impact on certain towns and villages, but I do expect that any bank involved will work with their customers to ensure that they minimise the impact of the closures.</p></reply>

The Central Bank, both from a consumer protection and prudential regulation perspective, has a very significant role to play in addressing the problem of mortgage arrears.  With regard to consumers in arrears or in danger of going into financial difficulty and/or concerned about going into mortgage arrears, the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) offers increased protections to these consumers.  This revised code builds on the provisions of the previous version, but includes more detailed requirements, not least the establishment of a formal Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) and also that pre-arrears cases must be treated in accordance with the MARP. </p><p>  The Central Bank has also published a guide for consumers on mortgage arrears 'Mortgage Arrears &#8211; A Consumer Guide to Dealing with your Lender' and this is available on the Central Bank website. </p><p>  In addition, the Report of the Inter-Departmental Working Group on Mortgage Arrears (the 'Keane Report') was published late last year and the Government is now actively implementing the main recommendations contained in that report.  </p><p>  In that context, a number of significant milestones have now been achieved:-</p><p>The Personal Insolvency Bill was approved by Government and published last June and the Committee stage of the Bill was passed by the D&aacute;il last month; The Minister for Housing and Planning has formally launched the &quot;mortgage to rent&quot; scheme on a nationwide basis; Lenders have now provided details to the Central Bank on their proposed for bearance and loan modification options and some forbearance measures have been introduced on a pilot basis with a further roll out later in the year; Also an extensive independent mortgage advice framework has now been put in place by the Minister of Social Protection comprising (i) an enhanced website <i><font color="#0000FF">www.keepingyourhome.ie</font></i> (ii) a Mortgage Arrears information helpline, and (iii) the provision of free independent 'one-to-one' professional financial advice to borrowers when considering a long term forbearance/resolution offer from their lender.  The list of accountants providing this service is located on the www.keepingyourhome.ie website.</p><p>  It should be noted that the vast majority of home owners continue to meet their mortgage obligations.  However the Government remains very committed to progress measures to assist genuine mortgage holders in difficulty or who may go into difficulty with their mortgage commitments.  The Government committee on mortgage arrears, which is chaired by An Taoiseach, continues to meet and it is the intention of Government to ensure that those mortgage holders in genuine difficulty will receive appropriate assistance and a high priority has been assigned by Government to the implementation of this broad range of measures to assist those experiencing difficulty on their mortgage across the relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

The 30% rate of mortgage interest relief, applicable to people who took out their first qualifying home loan between 2004 and 2008, came into effect with the enactment of the Finance Act 2012. The regulations provide for the granting of the relief due to the borrower by the lender within the tax year.  Mortgage interest relief is provided to the relevant mortgage holders via on-going electronic data file transfers between Revenue and each of the 132 individual qualifying lenders. To apply the new 30% rate, specific technology developments were required to Revenue&rsquo;s and to each of the lenders computer systems. Revenue's systems were upgraded to implement the 30% rate in December 2011, but the speed of upgrading has not been uniform across all of the lenders. Revenue has been in continuous communication with the various lenders in regard to finalising their IT enhancements and to date the upgrades required to give effect to the 30% rate have been completed by all but one of the lenders. At this point all of these lenders have either implemented the rate or will do so with effect from November.</p><p>  Revenue is currently in direct contact with the remaining lender to ensure that the 30% rate is paid to borrowers within the current year and applied retrospectively. Revenue has received commitment from the lender that its IT system will be upgraded and the new rate will be implemented within the current tax year.</p><p>  In January of this year Revenue advised lenders to continue to grant tax relief at the rate of 25% to those entitled to the new 30% rate while IT upgrades were being completed. The 25% rate was applied in all cases while the IT systems were being upgraded. In all instances the additional relief either has or will be applied automatically to borrowers once the necessary IT changes are implemented.</p></reply>

The dates that the existing public interest directors were appointed are shown in the table below.</p><p>The legal position is that any director appointed to the board of the covered institutions whether under the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme 2008 or otherwise is subject to the requirements of company law in relation to the discharge of their responsibilities as a company director. As such, the director is legally bound to act in what he or she believes are the interests of the separate legal entity that is the institution itself. These are the directors so called fiduciary responsibilities. To address the scope for actual and perceived conflicts between the fiduciary duties of the directors of financial institutions under company law and the wider public interest in circumstances where those institutions have received huge financial support from the State, legal clarity, not just to the role of the public interest director but to that of the entire boards of those institutions, was provided under Section 48 of the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010. It provides that the overriding duty of directors of the covered institutions relates to the public interest as set out in the Act.</p><p>Accordingly, public interest directors do not have a formal reporting relationship to the Minister or to the Department of Finance.  As Minister for Finance, I am strongly committed to ensuring that the boards of the covered institutions act at all times in a manner fully consistent with key public interest objectives for the banking sector.</p><p>The following table sets out the current public interest directors at each of the covered banks.</p><p><table><tr><th>Bank</th><th>Public Interest Directors</th><th>Date of Appointment</th></tr><tr><td>AIB</td><td>Mr Dick Spring</td><td>January 2009</td></tr><tr><td>BOI</td><td>Mr Tom Considine<br />Mr Joe Walsh</td><td>January 2009<br />January 2009</td></tr><tr><td>PTSB</td><td>Ms Margaret Hayes<br />Mr Ray MacSharry</td><td>December 2008<br />December 2008</td></tr></table></p><p>Dr Michael Somers is a Government Nominee (not a Public Interest Director) appointed to the AIB board on 14 January 2010 under the terms of NPRFC&rsquo;s investment of &euro;3.5bn in AIB of May 2009.</p></reply>

Notwithstanding the fact that the State is a significant shareholder, I must ensure that the bank is run on a commercial, cost effective and independent basis to ensure the value of the bank as an asset to the State, as set out in the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies agreed with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF.  A Relationship Framework has been specified that defines the nature of the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the bank. This Framework was published on 30 March 2012 and can be found on my department&rsquo;s website (http://banking.finance.gov.ie/presentations-and-latest-documents/).  Ultimately the pricing of financial products, including standard variable mortgage interest rates, is a commercial decision for the management team and board of the bank, having due regard to their customers and the impact on profitability, particularly where the cost of funding to the bank, including deposit pricing, is under pressure. Neither the Central Bank nor the Department of Finance has a statutory function in relation to interest rate decisions made by individual lending institutions at any particular time. </p><p>  The Government and BOI are acutely aware of the social and economic impacts that any lending rate increases may have in the current environment. However, the bank has informed me that the majority of its lending products are currently priced on a par with their peers, with interest rate increases required in order to return the Bank to profitability and long term viability.</p></reply>

It is the number of people who are non-resident for tax purposes, and who file a tax return to Revenue because they may have tax liabilities for the reasons set out above. </p><p>  It is important to note that the circumstances of individuals who are non-resident for tax purposes but who file tax returns can vary widely.  They include, for example,</p><p>*Irish nationals who have moved abroad for work reasons but who retain their home here (their tax return is generally only in respect of rental income on their Irish home);</p><p>*foreign nationals who never resided here but who have investments (including property) here;</p><p>*foreign nationals who worked here for a period and who may have acquired Irish tax residence for that period (for example, individuals who worked here on a temporary assignment) may retain an Irish tax liability, after ceasing to be resident, in respect of investments made in Ireland during their period of residence.</p></reply>

Furthermore and as the Deputy will be aware, any bank accessing standard or non-standard liquidity assistance from the European Central Bank is required to pledge collateral in return for funding.  In any event AIB has an important mandate to supply credit and essential banking services across the country. It is important that its business model remain intact so that it can eventually regain access to international funding markets in a meaningful way and eliminate its dependence on the Irish state.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that when this Government took office it attempted to enforce burden sharing with senior unguaranteed bondholders in particular institutions that were no longer core elements of the Irish financial system. Intensive discussions were held with our European partners and particularly President Trichet of the ECB in the run-up to the announcement of our stress tests on 31st March last year. At that time the President believed that such action was not in the interests of Ireland or the Euro Area. This matter was discussed again with President Trichet on a number of occasions including the Ecofin meeting in Poland in September 2011. </p><p>  Nevertheless, I would like to again reiterate that this Government is currently in discussions with our European colleagues in relation to securing a deal on the Irish bank debt and further detailed work will continue to ensure that the positive moves in Europe are harnessed to maximise the benefit to the Irish taxpayer.</p></reply>

This involved the radical restructuring of the domestic banking system which was announced last year and recalibrated the banking system by introducing the two pillar banks structure thereby creating a banking sector more proportionate to the size of the economy. Other domestic and foreign players remain important competitive instruments in the sector. With the recovery of the economy their role in providing choice in domestic banking services will be important enhancements to the competitive framework.  Separately the Deputy should also be aware that in the European Commission&rsquo;s December 2011 approval of the Bank of Ireland revised restructuring plan under state aid rules, the State has committed to undertake a number of market opening measures in order to enhance competition in the Irish banking market. Measures included amending Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in order that price regulation and fees will not be applicable to new entrants in their first three years of commencing business in Ireland and other changes to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make it easier for new entrants to provide the option of electronic banking. The state aid approval also provides for specific market entry opportunities facilitated by Bank of Ireland to ensure access to the domestic market for interested international competitors should such circumstances arise. As I have previously stated, I would welcome interest that foreign entities may have in entering into or expanding in the Irish market.</p></reply>

This report was circulated to Oireachtas Members and published by me in July.  Given the wide variation in the estimated revenue yield from an FTT when different factors are taken into account and the uncertainty as to the form the tax would take, the report states that more detail would be needed on the final shape and scope of the tax before a definitive conclusion could be reached about its impact on the Irish financial system and taxation revenue.  The report indicates that the &#8220;net revenue gain for Ireland from the introduction of an FTT &#8230; is likely to be modest&#8221;. Based on assumptions used by the Commission, including their proposed rates (the proposed rate on the exchanges of shares and bonds was 0.1% and the proposed rate of derivative contracts was 0.01%), the report estimates the potential yield from the FTT to be between &#8364;490m and &#8364;730m.  Under the Commission&#8217;s proposal, 2/3rd of this yield would have gone directly to the EU to fund its Budget.  Based on the report&#8217;s estimate, the net yield to Ireland from an FTT where we retained only 1/3 of the total collected here would be in the region of &#8364;163m to &#8364;243m &#8211; not dissimilar to the current yield from Stamp Duty on share transfers (&#8364;195m in 2011) which would have been abolished had we accepted the Commission proposal.  </p><p>  The Commission&#8217;s rates, on which the ESRI/Central Bank report&#8217;s estimate is based, vary from the rates suggested in the Deputy&#8217;s question.  </p><p>  The report identified the following downsides and potential downsides to the introduction of an FTT:<i>  Financial sector impact</i>  : An FTT could displace financial sector activity, especially when alternative locations are readily available &#8211; in this case the UK. This would pose a real risk to Ireland given the financial services sector accounts for 10% of GDP; <i>Macro-economic impact</i>: An FTT would likely lead to a lower level of economic activity in the financial sector, which might also result in lower receipts from income tax and corporation tax; <i>Exchequer impact: </i>A 1% stamp duty applies on transfers of shares in Irish companies. As indicated above, the Commission&#8217;s proposal would involve the abolition of this tax and the loss of existing Stamp Duty revenue, c. &#8364;180 m in 2010 and &#8364;195m in 2011. </p><p>  I have stated from the outset of discussions on the FTT that any such tax would have to apply on a wide international basis and at a minimum on an EU-wide basis to avoid distortionary and behavioural impacts.  Such impacts should be taken into account in considering any estimates of the potential yield from such a tax.</p></reply>

The current rates of stamp duty on the transfer of property are:</p><p>*For non-residential property, 2% of the purchase price </p><p>*For residential property, 1% on the amount of the purchase price up to &euro;1m and 2% on the excess over &euro;1million.</p><p>The rate of stamp duty on the transfer of shares is 1%.  Shares in a foreign company are not Irish situated assets. Accordingly, a charge to stamp duty does not generally arise on the transfer of such shares. Where property is held on trust, a liability to stamp duty can arise where there is a change in the underlying beneficial ownership of the property on the documentation executed in connection with the change of ownership. </p><p>  It cannot be assumed that a decision to hold property through a company, rather than directly, is intended to facilitate the avoidance of stamp duty. In general, such decisions are taken primarily for commercial reasons.</p><p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as the purchase and sale of shares are chargeable with stamp duty at a uniform rate of 1% without regard to the nature of the underlying assets in the companies in question, it is not possible to separately identify the stamp duty paid on shares in companies whose value derives wholly or partly from property.</p></reply>

It provides for the establishment by the Euro Area member states of the ESM as an intergovernmental organisation under public international law.  Legislation is required for Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty. The ESM Act passed all stages of the Oireachtas, and was signed into law by the President on 3rd July. </p><p>  The ESM Treaty and the underlying legislation in the ESM Act, as well as the European Council Decision from March 2011 proposing an amendment to Article 136 TFEU concerning stability mechanisms, was the subject of an extensive legal challenge in the High Court in June, and a subsequent comprehensive appeal in the Supreme Court in July, relating to its compatibility with the Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and also with the EU Treaties and the validity of the European Council Decision.  The challenge in relation to Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann was unsuccessful, as was a request for an injunction to restrain Ireland&rsquo;s ratification.  A number of questions of EU law were referred by the Irish Supreme Court to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland ratified the treaty on August 1st by lodging the instrument of ratification with the Depositary.</p><p>  The ESM Treaty, at article 48.1 provides that the ESM will enter into force when instruments of ratification, approval or acceptance have been deposited by signatories whose initial subscriptions represent no less than 90% of the total subscription.  The ESM Treaty accordingly entered into force on 27th September 2012 following its ratification by 16 of the 17 Euro area member states, representing over 99.8% of its subscribed capital base.  All 17 Euro Area Member States have now ratified the ESM Treaty. </p><p>  The ESM Treaty provides that it shall have a capital base of &euro;700 billion of which &euro;80 billion is paid in capital. Ireland&rsquo;s share of this paid in capital is &euro;1.27 billion, based on the contribution key of 1.5922% set out in annex 1 of the ESM Treaty.  The Treaty provides that this contribution is to be paid in five equal tranches. The Euro Group Finance Ministers agreed in March 2012 that two of the five equal tranches would be paid this year, and subsequently agreed, in September 2012, that both of these tranches should be paid in October 2012.  For Ireland, these two tranches will amount to &euro;509.508 million in accordance with our contribution key %, and this amount will be paid this week, in accordance with our obligations following our ratification of the ESM Treaty and its entry into force.</p></reply>

A precondition for a resumption of balanced economic growth is sustainable public finances. As such, the Government is committed to cutting the deficit and maintaining debt at sustainable levels. However, the objective of Government has been to ensure that any consolidation necessary is implemented in a credible manner, while seeking to minimise the impact on the economy and the labour market. In line with the economic literature and the broad consensus amongst various economic agencies - including the IMF, the ESRI and the Fiscal Advisory Council - we believe the most effective and growth friendly way to implement such consolidation measures is by concentrating the majority of the adjustments on the expenditure side.</p><p>  Looking forward to Budget 2013, the Government believes a continuation of this focus on expenditure cuts is necessary to limit the negative impact on the economy and the labour market. Consequently, two-thirds of the forthcoming adjustment is expected to be realised from the expenditure side.</p><p>  It should be acknowledged that while restoring the public finances to a sound footing is crucial for Ireland&rsquo;s future, consolidation will have a negative short-run impact on the economy. However, it is the framing of this consolidation which is important and I want to assure the Deputy that the Government is conscious of the need to minimise the impact of consolidation on the labour market.</p><p>  In the wake of Ireland&rsquo;s recent return to the bond markets it may be easy to forget the considerable progress that has been made in getting to this point. It is imperative now that the hard yards gained in the recent past are not in vain and that those measures are followed through in order to restore confidence in the Irish economy and successfully navigate Ireland&rsquo;s exit from the current EU/IMF programme.</p></reply>

Last week I launched my Junior Cycle Framework.  One of the eight principles underpinning the new Framework is "creativity and innovation".  In the delivery of the new junior cycle programme in schools, curriculum, assessment, teaching and learning must provide opportunities for students to be creative and innovative.  The learning outcomes for students at the core of the Framework for Junior Cycle are described in twenty-four statements of learning.   One of these states that the student "takes initiative, is innovative and develops entrepreneurial skills".  There is, therefore, a clear underpinning for innovative and entrepreneurial skills in the  Framework.  Innovation and entrepreneurial skills can be addressed either through the existing subjects or through short courses. A number of short courses are being prepared by the NCCA but in addition short courses can be developed at school level, meeting agreed criteria, which will address the individual needs and local contexts of schools and their students.</p><p>  In senior cycle students taking the Transition Year option, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied are provided with specific opportunities to acquire enterprise skills. These programmes place a strong focus on active learning, community-based approaches, personal development and teamwork. Students also engage in work experience.  In addition, enterprise is part of the Business syllabus in second level schools.  The Sean Lemass Award for Student Enterprise is an annual award which is presented to the top 3 winners from both the Transition Year Mini-company Get up and Go Competition and the County/City Enterprise Board Student Enterprise Competition.  In 2012, there were some 17,000 young people involved in these competitions.</p></reply>

Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families. Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks. I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.  The Association has responded positively to my approaches and have agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members. The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts in the range 10% to 17.5% so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes.  All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments.</p><p>  My Department published research last May which shows that there is a high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary school level. The research indicates that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and I want to encourage this practice across all schools. Results at second level are not as conclusive.</p><p>  Given the scale of our economic crisis, I have no scope to introduce new or additional funding measures generally or for specific purposes, such as that referred to by the Deputy.</p></reply>

Some 73 small primary schools were originally due to lose a classroom teacher in September 2012 as a result of the budget measure to increase the relevant pupil thresholds. The Primary Staffing Appeals Board considered appeals from any of the 73 schools that could show that their projected enrolments for September 2012 were sufficient to allow them retain their classroom teacher over the longer term.</p><p>  Some 38 small schools had their appeals provisionally upheld by the Appeals Board subject to confirmation that their actual enrolments in September 2012 reach the required level. My officials are currently liaising with these schools to ascertain actual enrolments at 30 September. When this process is completed the overall position for the 2012/13 school year will be known.  In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.</p></reply>

Reductions in the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, date back to the last Government. More recently, this Government has made further adjustments on foot of the allowances review. In the case of teachers, while there has been a small decline in applications to the B.Ed for primary teaching between 2011 and 2012, the overall number of applications remains high. A similar trend obtains for the professional diploma in education (PDE), which is the main route to post-primary teaching. It is significant that successful applicants to the B.Ed courses in 2012 continue to be from the top quartile of Leaving Cert students, in terms of points.</p></reply>

These changes are being applied equitably on a national basis.  Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme children are eligible for transport where they reside not less than 4.8 kms from and are attending their nearest education centre as determined by the Department/Bus &Eacute;ireann, having regard to ethos and language.</p><p>  Children from the area in question are not attending their nearest school and are therefore not eligible for school transport under the terms of the scheme.  However, children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only in accordance with the terms of the Post Primary School Transport Scheme. Bus Eireann has advised that 18 first year pupils from this area have been issued with tickets on this basis.  There is no scope for reversing these changes as under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of &euro;17 million on the school transport budget and all these measures, including the ceasing of the catchment boundary system, are an integral part of this. It makes economic sense that when fully implemented, the provision of school transport to the nearest school will reduce the cost of those school transport services. </p></reply>

My Department has committed to the development of such a database in it's Data Strategy 2008-2010. As part of the development of the Data Strategy consultations were carried out with many of my Department's agencies to discuss how data could best be collected and shared in a manner which reduces the overall administrative burden for the school and allows for the most efficient operation and provision of services to the pupil. </p><p>  There have been a number of developments in recent years in the area of pupil data collection from post-primary schools. My Department is currently in the process of streamlining the post-primary returns process to allow for a live online system allowing for easy exchange of information that reflects the up-to-date situation in regard to enrolment at any one time and to cut down on administrative burden and the scale of paper-based information flows across the Department and its associated agencies. It is intended to pilot this development in the 2012\2013 academic year.</p><p>  My Department intends to proceed, as soon as timing and resources permit, to extend this development to primary level schools. Once this is done, my Department will have access to an integrated live Learners database covering primary and post-primary level, which will allow for the effective monitoring of progression, and for enhanced policy planning using real-time data. </p></reply>

My Department is very focussed on improving its systems and requirements to ensure that the administrative burden for schools and for the Department itself is minimised as far as possible. To this end, a range of initiatives have been and continue to be undertaken by my Department.</p><p>  One such example is the introduction of electronic submission of primary schools' annual enrolment returns resulting in significant administrative efficiencies to this annual process for both schools and my Department. Another example is the recently introduced reforms to the teacher allocation process.  At primary level this involved combining the separate learning support (GAM) and language support allocation processes into a single and simplified allocation process thus reducing administrative workload.  A similar approach was also implemented at post-primary level.</p><p>  Developments in recent years in the Department's payroll area have included the introduction of an Online Claims System (OLCS) for teacher payroll and the payment of part-time teachers through the Department's payroll. The latter ended the previously burdensome system under which each school, funded by grant payments, was required to make its own arrangements to pay part-time teachers.  Across all areas of my Department, we are continuously seeking to identify opportunities, ranging from small administrative changes to the more significant and major reforms, to streamline our processes, achieve better value for money and ultimately improve the education provided to our students. My officials will continue to work, in consultation with stakeholders as appropriate, on addressing this issue on an on-going basis.</p></reply>

School building projects in architectural planning were also considered by my Department in the context of that programme, taking into account the funding available, the availability of sites in the case of new schools and when projects are technically ready to proceed to tender and construction. The individual school projects to be included in the Plan were recommended by my Department,  and I approved the Plan in accordance with their recommendations.</p></reply>

I am very conscious that the cost of textbooks is a considerable burden on families. Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have attempted to take steps to reduce the burden on families. Shortly after coming into office I met with members of the Irish Educational Publishers' Association and impressed on them the need to limit the cost of textbooks. I have also stressed to them the real need to avoid placing schools and families in a position where textbooks are altered unnecessarily.</p><p>  The Association has responded positively to my approaches and have agreed a voluntary Code of Practice among their members. The Code commits the publishers to limit the publication of new editions and to maintaining editions of books in print unchanged for at least six years. The publishers have also given assurances to me that they will sell textbooks to schools at discounts in the range 10% to 17.5% so that schools can purchase textbooks in bulk to stock textbook rental schemes. All these developments are welcome, and I look forward to seeing the members of the Association implement these commitments. In May my Department published research which shows that there is a high level of book rental schemes in operation at primary school level. The research indicates that 76% of primary schools operate a book rental scheme and I want to encourage this practice across all schools. Results at second level are not as conclusive.</p><p>  My Department provided approximately &euro;15m in total to first and second level schools by way of book grants in 2012. A grant of &euro;11 per pupils is provided to primary schools, with DEIS schools receiving &euro;21. At second level the grant is &euro;24, with DEIS schools receiving &euro;39 per pupil.</p></reply>

This document contains details of my plans to reform the junior cycle in post-primary schools. One element of the plan relates to assessment.  We know that under the current system in third year, the Junior Certificate examination dominates the experiences of students; the focus of learning narrows, the emphasis is on rote learning and for many students, the examination does not lead to positive learning experiences and outcomes. The reality is that the Junior Certificate is no longer a high stakes examination. That is why I believe it no longer serves the eduational needs of every young person.</p><p>  It is also the case that current assessment practice at the end of junior cycle (or lower secondary education) in Ireland is out of line with best practice in many countries with high-performing educational systems.   It is my intention that the terminal Junior Certificate Examinations will be replaced with a school-based model of assessment where the emphasis will be on the quality of students' learning experiences and outcomes.  This replacement will happen, taking a phased approach, with English being the first subject to be introduced to First Year students in 2014.  Short courses will also be available. The new Junior Cycle will include on-going classroom assessment for learning where high quality feedback will be provided to students and their parents during the junior cycle.  It will also include a school work component for all subjects reflective of students' work over the course of the final two years for the purposes of certification.  All the evidence indicates that this will give students a better learning experience and outcomes at Junior Cycle. </p></reply>

Local school managements are responsible for organising their class numbers, year on year, to achieve the optimum local efficiencies. In March of this year I announced a new initiative to replace rented prefabs in both primary and post-primary schools. Over 170 schools have been approved to replace rented prefabs with permanent accommodation. A total of &euro;41.8 million has been allocated for this initiative which will result in approximately 6,000 pupils moving from prefabs into permanent classrooms and resource rooms when building works are completed in all schools.</p></reply>

Schools that do not currently have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS. In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a student be referred for individual psychological assessment/intervention. Such intervention address both learning needs and/or needs in relation to the area of social &amp; emotional competence.This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more students indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that students are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p><p>  In addition NEPS has provided guidance to all schools and school communities in relation to structures and processes to be put in place in the event of critical incidents. Upon request by school authorities NEPS psychologists provide direct on-site assistance to schools in coping with the aftermath of such traumatic events.</p><p>  NEPS currently directly employs some 168 psychologists sited in 22 local and Regional offices countrywide and assigned to schools in their respective catchment areas. I can inform the Deputy that my Department is currently engaging with 10 additional candidates with a view to their recruitment to NEPS in the current academic year bringing the total staffing complement to its highest level ever. I am satisfied that the NEPS service is responding adequately to the needs of schools. </p><p>  I acknowledge that the reduction in resources to second level schools is challenging for schools. However, the budget measure that requires schools to manage the provision of guidance and counselling from within their standard staffing allocation, the alternative to which was to make an adjustment to the standard staffing schedule, must be seen in the context of our very difficult budgetary constraints. As part of the budgetary measure my Department helped shelter the impact for DEIS post-primary schools by improving their standard staffing allocations. It is established policy that guidance is a whole school activity and under existing arrangements each school develops a school guidance plan as a means of supporting the needs of its students. I am confident schools will act in the best interest of students.</p></reply>

Last year I launched Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life which is the national strategy to improve literacy and numeracy in schools.  We know both from domestic evidence and international comparisons through PISA that the literacy and numeracy standards of some of our students are not up to the standard which we would wish.  I have moved swiftly to bring in measures through the Strategy which are aimed at improving literacy and numeracy. </p><p>  Last week I announced a root and branch reform of Junior Cycle drawing from best practice at international level.  The Framework for Junior Cycle responds to compelling international evidence that shows more students will perform better by moving away from terminal high stakes exams at this point in their education. A number of the principles in my Framework acknowledge the importance of &quot;continuity and development&quot; and of &quot;Learning to learn&quot; from one sector of education to another so as to meet the challenges of life beyond school and, in particular, of working life. Students as they experience the new Junior Cycle programme, will be provided with opportunities to take initiative, to be innovative and to develop entrepreneurial skills. My Framework has been warmly welcomed by IBEC which commented that business needs employees with the capacity to analyse, communicate, be creative, manage information and work with others. IBEC believes that the new Junior Cycle should provide an opportunity to develop these types of attributes and skills from an early age. The change at junior cycle in turn presents an opportunity for a refocusing of efforts at senior cycle towards more varied forms of assessment across all examinations subjects. </p><p>  At third level, one of the core missions of the higher education system is to ensure the continued alignment of graduate output with the evolving skills needs of the economy and to provide the research infrastructure and graduates to support innovation, and foster enterprise development.  To ensure relevance of higher education provision, it is standard practice for institutions to establish content advisory panels with industry input for programme development. It is also common practice for institutions to develop bespoke programmes in collaboration with individual enterprises.   Engagement with enterprise is one of the core pillars of the National Strategy for Higher Education and a detailed framework and range of recommendations to ensure the system continues to provide graduates that are equipped to take their place in the modern workplace are being implemented.  Our high numbers of young skilled graduates has led Ireland to be ranked 1st for the availability of skilled labour in this year's IMD World Competitiveness Survey. This was backed up by the 2012 Talent Shortage Survey conducted annually by the Manpower Group, which ranked Ireland as the global leader for the availability of skills and the least difficult location, globally, in which to find talent. </p></reply>

Implementation of strategy recommendations is underway and a progress report is available on www.education.ie.<br /><i>Full Time Student Enrolments </i></p><p><table><tr><th>2010/11</th><th>2011/12*</th></tr><tr><td>161,647</td><td>162,786</td></tr></table></p><p>*provisional enrolment figures</p></reply>

The categorisation of each ETB, including the Board encompassing Counties Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, is based on a proposal set out by the Labour Relations Commission (LRC). It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on the criteria used by the LRC in formulating its proposal, or on how such criteria may have been applied in the case of the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB.  However, I am also aware of a perception that suggests these categorisations are an attempt to 'downgrade' some ETBs.  I can confirm unequivocally that this categorisation relates only to determining the salary scale applicable to the Chief Executive Officer of each of the new ETBs.  The categorisation laid out in the Circular has no role whatsoever in determining staffing numbers or structures in individual ETBs.</p></reply>

The position is that the Valuation Act, 2001 provides for the exemption from rates of land that is developed for sport such as playing pitches. There is also provision for the exemption of community halls which are not licensed to sell alcohol and where the facilities are not used for profit and involve participation by inhabitants of the locality generally and are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.</p><p>  However, the Act provides that where an organisation or club is registered under the Registration of Clubs (Ireland) Act, 1904 and is licensed to sell alcohol, all the club buildings, wherever located, are rateable in their entirety. The legislation is unambiguous in this regard and the Valuation Office has no option but to consider all such premises to be rateable. The sale of alcohol is a commercial activity and the club is competing with other commercial licensed premises in their locality, all of which are rateable.  The apportionment of club premises between areas used for the sale of alcohol and those areas used for other activities could be operationally problematic and lead to anomalies in the rateability of premises licensed to sell alcohol. Therefore, in equity, exemption from rates can only be achieved by the cessation of the liquor licence. There are no plans to provide for special treatment of licensed clubs under the Valuation Act, 2001 which maintains the long-standing principle that all commercial activities are valued in a fair and equitable manner. </p><p>  It is not proposed to provide for special treatment of licensed sports clubs under the Valuation (Amendment) (No.2) Bill, 2012 as to do so would result in demands for similar preferential treatment from other interests.</p></reply>

Strategic priorities will be translated into high level goals for all Departments, on a &#8216;whole of government&#8217; basis, and in consultation with Ministers. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Performance indicators will be identified to monitor progress on high level priorities. Annual reports of departments and agencies will include output statements and audited financial accounts prepared on generally accepted accounting principles. The performance information provided in output and outcome-focused measurement will feed into the decision making process for future plans at political and senior management level. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>The reform process will provide for increased delegation of budgets, subject to detailed plans, relevant performance reporting and audited accounts compiled in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Detailed business cases will be required for major projects, with review and reporting requirements built in to the plan. Sanctions will be imposed at an early stage for significant overruns. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will change the current emphasis on performance reporting to performance management. All medium to long-term projects that involve significant public spending will be subject to cost benefit analysis, and to on-going evaluation. The results of programme evaluations will be published and programmes not meeting their objectives will be wound down. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Performance and progress will be published in a new, audited annual Public Service Delivery Reports. Oireachtas Committees will expose any failure to hit milestones and targets. Each sectoral Committee will take on new powers, similar to those wielded by Public Accounts Committee, to hold Ministers and public servants to account for value for money. This will feed into Oireachtas consideration of the next Budget. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Where appropriate, agency boards will be scrapped and agency managers will be accountable directly to Ministers.</td><td>Action Required </td></tr><tr><td>We will bring forward the annual Estimates cycle, so that it becomes more timely and relevant. It will in future start at the beginning of the preceding year and conclude by the summer. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The annual Estimates will in future distinguish between monies being allocated to maintaining the existing level of service for existing programmes and money to support new programmes or policy decisions. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>The Book of Estimates will be accompanied by a detailed performance report on what the previous year&#8217;s spending had achieved. It will also give details of the level of performance achieved by agencies under service delivery agreements with Government. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Oireachtas members will be given, from within existing resources, dedicated resources for the proper scrutiny of the Estimates.   </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes.</td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>We will publish cost-benefit analyses for major infrastructure proposals and &#8220;tax expenditures&#8221; in advance of Government approval. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Public sector bodies will be required to publish balance sheets and to move to accruals from cash-flow accounting. </td><td>In Progress</td></tr><tr><td>Every Purchase Order by a Government Department or agency for more than &#8364;20,000 will be published online. We will give the Comptroller and Auditor General and Oireachtas Committees the extra powers needed to carry out value-for-money audits of State programmes. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>Public bodies will be required to openly compete for budget resources by publishing pre-budget spending requests, and what they would deliver in return for such allocations to help deliver Programme for Government. </td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>We will conduct a Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) to examine all areas of public spending, based on the Canadian model, and to develop multi-annual budget plans with a three-year time horizon. This plan will be presented to the D&aacute;il for debate. It will assess effectiveness in achieving desired outcomes, and value for money</td><td>Completed</td></tr><tr><td>The CSR will examine the number, range and activities of bodies funded significantly from public purse, including at local government level, and reduce numbers where appropriate. In future, when proposing a new agency, it will be necessary to prove that the proposed new functions cannot be carried out within the existing framework. </td><td>Completed </td></tr><tr><td>We will, subject to there being no compulsory redundancies and to the protection of front line services: Reduce the total number of public sector employees by between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014, compared to the total number at the end of 2010.

Dismissals in other areas of the Public Sector are a matter for the relevant sector.</p><p>Prior to 2006, disciplinary and dismissal procedures were for the civil service as set out in Circular 1/1992. Under these procedures, it was the responsibility of the Government to decide whether a civil servant should be dismissed.  Under these procedures my Department submitted each case to Government and so had an overview of the number of dismissals in the Civil Service.  During the period 2002 to 2009, there were sixteen dismissals under these procedures (see attached table).  (Where disciplinary proceedings had already commenced prior to July 2006 the case continued to be dealt with under the disciplinary procedures in Circular 1/1992).</p><p>Under the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, each Secretary General/Head of Office,  has the authority, responsibility and accountability for carrying out a range of duties in their Departments/Offices.  Among these are the management of all matters pertaining to the appointment, performance, discipline and dismissals of staff below the grade of Principal.  The Disciplinary Code was revised in July 2006 to reflect the legislative changes and procedures for discipline and dismissals are now detailed in Circular 14/2006.  Therefore, my Department is not generally consulted about discipline and dismissals cases as it had been in the past under the previous Code (Circular 1/1992).   Accordingly my Department does not have any details in relation to dismissals under the revised procedures introduced in 2006. It is a matter for each Head of Department having taken the appropriate legal advice to decide whether a case for unfair dismissal is defended or not.</p><p><b>Dismissal Cases from 2002 &ndash; 2009</b></p><p><table><tr><th>Department</th><th><div>No of Cases</div></th></tr><tr><td>Houses of the Oireachtas</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Department of Agriculture &amp; Food</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td>Prisons Service</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Department of Social and Family Affairs</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Department of Finance </td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Department of Defence</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Courts Service</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Land registry </td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td>Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Revenue <br />Commissioners</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-09a.678.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1016" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100900060#WRN00600"><p>The Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day to day operations.  It is long established practice that Ministers do not get involved with its adjudication function.  However, having made enquiries, I understand that the EAT received a redundancy claim from the person concerned on 31 July, 2012 under the Redundancy Payment Acts.</p><p>  I wish to point out that the payment of statutory redundancy lump sums is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance.  However, where an employer genuinely cannot afford to pay an employee their entitlement, the employer and employee can apply directly to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) for a Redundancy Lump Sum using form RP50.  Proof of inability to pay must be submitted with the RP 50.  The Redundancy Payments Section in the Department of Social Protection (Block C, Earlsfort Centre, Lower Hatch Street, Dublin 2) has responsibility for the administration of statutory redundancy payments from the SIF.  Where an employer refuses to pay an employee their statutory redundancy entitlement or there is a dispute regarding an employees&rsquo; entitlement to a statutory redundancy payment, the employee must apply to the EAT for a hearing under the Redundancy Payments Acts.</p><p>  In the present case, I would suggest that this person may also wish to contact the Redundancy Payments Section within the Department of Social Protection to establish if she can satisfy the legislative requirements which would allow her claim for a statutory redundancy payment to be processed directly from the SIF without the requirement to have the appeal adjudicated upon EAT.  The EAT has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn.  The current waiting period for a hearing in respect of redundancy claims in Limerick, is approximately 90 weeks from the date of application.  All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the efforts of the EAT to reduce its existing backlogs, I believe the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies. The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.  I fully expect the work that I have initiated with regard to the reform of the Workplace Relations Bodies, including the EAT, to significantly improve the quality of service to users.</p></reply>

Details of the progress to date for each of the Programme for Government commitments for which my Department is responsible are set out in the table below.</p><p><pcenter>Progress on the Department of Jobs, Enterprise &amp; Innovation Commitments in the Programme for Government</pcenter></p><p><table><tr><th>Commitment</th><th>Current Status</th></tr><tr><td>Commitment</td><td>Current Status</td></tr><tr><td>Reverse the cut in the minimum wage</td><td>National Minimum Wage restored to &#8364;8.65 per hour with effect from 1 July 2011.</td></tr><tr><td>Implement a number of sectoral initiatives in areas that will create employment in the domestic economy</td><td>The Department and its Agencies are implementing measures to support the domestic economy, including for example ensuring SME access to public procurement, developing the green economy, and supporting the development of the manufacturing sector, as outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs.<br /><br />The Government&#8217;s Action Plan for Jobs sets out a range of actions across Government Departments and Agencies which aim to create a vibrant environment where enterprises can start up and flourish. My Department is working with the Department of Environment, Community &amp; Local Government, in specifically seeking to improve the operating environment for businesses at local level. <br /><br />Action 2.2 of the Action Plan for Jobs to dissolve the existing County &amp; City Enterprise Board (CEB) structure, transfer their functions, assets and liabilities to Enterprise Ireland (EI), and establish Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) within Local Authorities, has been approved by the Government.  <br /><br />A high level Implementation Working Group (IWG) chaired by my Department is currently progressing the range of issues involved. A project plan is in preparation which will set out clear milestones and timelines for implementation. <br /><br />My Department is also engaged with the Office of the Attorney General regarding the detailed primary legislation that will be necessary to implement the new arrangements. <br /><br />It is the intention to give administrative effect to the new structures as soon as possible, in advance of the formal enactment of legislation. Development of the Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities to cover the full range of services and targets to be delivered by the LEOs is planned by year end. It is hoped to have details of the legislative path to underpin these reforms completed by Quarter 2 of 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>We will create a new &#8216;Home to Export&#8217; programme to share the expertise of exporting companies with firms currently reliant on domestic markets. </td><td>Enterprise Ireland has an ongoing range of services to encourage new exporters, including online support and mentoring.  In March 2012, Enterprise Ireland established the Potential Exporters Division.  Its role is to stimulate greater activity within companies across all regions and to reorient those demonstrating real growth potential from the domestic to the international marketplace.</td></tr><tr><td>A &#8216;Source Ireland&#8217; portal will be developed to market Irish goods and services abroad.</td><td>Enterprise Ireland now has in place a website service for sourcing queries from international buyers or procurement managers, who are looking to source world-class products, services and technologies from Irish-based companies.  That Agency also has experienced advisers in place, both in Ireland and in overseas locations, who work directly with Irish companies.</td></tr><tr><td>We will support our indigenous digital game industry by reforming R&amp;D supports available to the industry, setting aside funding from Innovation Fund Ireland for a seed capital scheme for Irish digital gaming start-ups, introduce a digital media component to Transition Year programmes and promote Ireland as digital gaming hub. </td><td>Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) has built up and supports 15 top-class research centres that operate in the ICT area, many of which are involved in developing technologies to underpin digital gaming, e-learning, and other internet-based technologies. SFI works actively with industry groups to promote industry-academic collaborations in these sectors.</td></tr><tr><td>We will develop a National Intellectual Property (IP) protocol to give predictability about the terms on which business can access IP created in Higher Education Institutions and the wider digital sector. </td><td>The new IP Protocol, which sets out a new national policy and guidelines for the management of intellectual property (IP) associated with State funded research, was launched on 8 June 2012.  The IP Protocol sets out a new system that is designed to make it easier and faster for entrepreneurs and companies to negotiate a commercial arrangement with publicly funded research performing organisations.<br /><br />It sets out the Government&#8217;s policies to encourage industry &#8211; from start-ups and small and medium enterprises to multinational corporations &#8211; to benefit from State funded research and describes the practical arrangements for this to happen.</td></tr><tr><td>We will promote and support investment in technology research, development and commercialisation beyond basic research supported by Science Foundation Ireland, as well as removing barriers to innovation and accelerate exploitation of new technologies. </td><td>Since 2000 SFI has, along with programmes like the Programme for Research in Third Level institutions (PRTLI), helped to transform Ireland&#8217;s research ecosystem. Ireland&#8217;s research landscape and much of the SFI investment has now reached a stage of maturity ready for exploitation, and the extensive SFI linkages with industry &amp; academia represent great opportunities for further development. The process of extending SFI&#8217;s legislative remit to enable expansion into applied research is well under way and this will assist in the commercialisation of new technologies. The extended SFI legislation is anticipated to be enacted in Q1, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>We will target key technology areas and sectors where innovation can be applied including but not limited to high value manufacturing, advanced materials, nanotechnology, bioscience, electronics, photonics and electrical systems and information and communication technology. </td><td>These identified technology areas have been the subject of specific focus for Innovation Programmes and a considerable amount of work is on-going through STI Programmes delivered by IDA Ireland Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland and work at the Tyndall Institute.<br /><br />In addition, implementation of the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group (launched 1 March 2012) has been underway since late March through the Research Prioritisation Action Group (RPAG). Essentially, the report recommends 14 areas of application which should be prioritised for public STI investment because of the potential of those areas to deliver economic and societal impact in particular, jobs.<br /><br />SFI played a key role in the Research Prioritisation Exercise and has reorganised for better capability to effectively implement the relevant elements of the research prioritisation recommendations. SFI supports many research teams and top-class centres in most of the areas mentioned across.</td></tr><tr><td>We will also focus on the application of technological innovation in established sectors of the economy like energy generation and supply, transport, creative industries, high-value services and architecture and construction by identifying challenges, establishing priorities and developing strategies which specify necessary actions to transition to more innovative approach.</td><td>Significant funding from the enterprise agencies is directed at the application of leading edge technology and innovation in established sectors. In addition, implementation of the Report of the Research Prioritisation Steering Group (launched 1 March 2012) has been underway since late March through the Research Prioritisation Action Group. Essentially the report recommends 14 areas of application which should be prioritised for public STI investment because of the potential of those areas to deliver economic and societal impact in particular, jobs.<br /><br />The sectoral opportunities in the Action Plan for Jobs also reflect this focus.<br /><br />Operating in the areas of Bio, ICT and Energy, the work of the SFI-funded centres and research teams touches on virtually all of the 14 recommended research priority areas and 6 underpinning areas (see commitment above), thereby ensuring that SFI is ideally placed to fully contribute towards the achievement of the research prioritisation goals. Many sectors of the economy encompass areas of research strength built up by SFI over the past decade.  <br /></td></tr><tr><td>We will promote Ireland&#8217;s full engagement with the &#8216;Innovative Union&#8217; proposals issued by the European Commission in October 2010 as one of the seven flagship initiatives under EU2020 Strategy, with the specific aim of refocusing R&amp;D and innovation policy on major challenges and at turning inventions into products.</td><td>Ireland continues to support the Innovation Union proposals and is seeking to maximise the participation of researchers from business and academia in the EU&#8217;s Framework Programme for Research and Innovation.</td></tr><tr><td>We will establish a network of Technology Research Centres focused on applied technological research in specific areas, to be linked to appropriate higher-education institutions. The centres will accelerate exploitation of new technologies by providing infrastructure that bridges gap between research and technology commercialisation. We will initially establish 3 additional centres focusing on biotechnology, nanotechnology and high value manufacturing. Further centres from a number of other areas will be selected at a later time. </td><td>The establishment of a network of Technology Research Centres builds on the existing infrastructure of relevant SFI Centres for Science Engineering and Technology (the CSETs), SFI Strategic Research Clusters and EI/IDA Technology Centres. <br /><br />The EI/IDA Technology Centres are collaborative entities established and led by industry. They are focused on research with a direct impact on industry. <br /><br />11 Technology Centres have been established to date in microelectronics, nanotechnology, composites, bio-energy, IT innovation, manufacturing technology, energy efficiency, food,  the International Energy Research Centre at Tyndall National Institute and new centres launched in 2012 in learning technologies and cloud computing.<br /><br />A further five centres are in various stages of development, one of which, the Financial Services Governance Risk and Compliance centre will be established before year end.<br /><br />Preparatory actions for Technology Centres linked to the priority areas (based on the Research Prioritisation Exercise) are well advanced in the areas of:  <br />Data Analytics <br />Pharmaceuticals <br />Connected Health <br />Medical Devices technology</td></tr><tr><td>We will support the development of an International Content Services Centre to make Ireland world leader in managing intellectual property.</td><td>Following an open competitive tender process at the end of last year, consultants were selected to undertake a feasibility study to examine what structures and policies could be developed to make Ireland a world centre for managing and trading in intellectual property (IP). The objectives of the study were:<br />to identify and describe the emerging trends in IP Portfolio Management in corporations globally; and taking account of such global emerging trends, to identify options and models for Ireland to leverage its existing strengths to become an internationally attractive centre for managing and trading in IP, such that this could realise an economic and jobs potential.<br /><br />The study was overseen by a Steering Group, chaired by my Department with representatives from Forf&aacute;s, IDA, Science Foundation Ireland and Enterprise Ireland. The draft final report was submitted to my Department at the end of June 2012 and is being considered by the Department and its Agencies.</td></tr><tr><td>We will pioneer within the EU a model of &#8216;fair use&#8217; in European Copyright Law, like in the USA, which effectively permits the use of portions of a copyrighted work so long as the normal economic exploitation of the originating work is not undermined. This will allow internet companies and other digital innovators to bring their services to market. </td><td>An independent Copyright Review Committee was established in May 2011 to examine the Irish copyright framework to identify areas that might be deemed to create barriers to innovation and to make recommendations to resolve any problems identified. An examination of the &#8216;fair use&#8217; doctrine to see if it would be appropriate in an Irish/EU context was part of the Terms of Reference of the Committee.<br /><br />The Committee published a comprehensive Consultation Paper in February 2012 based on submissions received and it requested more information on the issues raised including fair use. In the region of 180 submissions were received in relation to the Consultation Paper in which many complex and substantial matters, including fair use, were advanced and these are currently being appraised by the Committee.<br /><br />The Committee has indicted that it expects to present its final Report before March 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>We will reform the Joint Labour Committee structure, beginning with the appointment of independent chairpersons to JLCs, who will retain a casting vote. Reform options will examine the rate of pay for atypical hours. </td><td>Independent Review of JLC/REA mechanisms published in April 2011. Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 giving effect to reforms enacted with effect from 1 August 2012.</td></tr><tr><td>We will reduce the cost of Government imposed red-tape on business, in part by streamlining regulatory enforcement activities out of a merger and rationalisation of existing structures. We will create a Business Inspection and Licensing Authority that absorbs the existing business inspection activities of the Health and Safety Authority, and the National Consumer Agency. </td><td>In relation to this commitment, please note that my Department is responsible only for reducing &#8220;Government imposed red tape&#8221; not for merging existing structures.<br /><br />Significant progress has been made by my Department, with a reduction in administrative burdens of 24.8% already achieved in the areas of Employment Law, Company Law and Health &amp; Safety Law; this amounts to annual savings for business of almost &#8364;207 million.<br /><br />My Department also coordinates the cross-Government measurement and reduction of administrative burdens towards the 25% target by the end of 2012. A project to measure the burden imposed by regulation under the responsibility of seven Departments and Revenue was initiated in September 2011.  Following completion of its measurement exercise, each participating Department must then set out how it will achieve the remaining reductions necessary to reach the target and report to Government with its Simplification Plan. The current estimated overall reduction is just over 15% which includes the 24.8% achieved by my Department, 25% achieved by Revenue and 30% achieved by the Central Statistics Office. <br /><br />The reform of the State's Workplace Relations Services will deliver a simplified two-tiered structure comprising a single body of first instance, the Workplace Relations Commission, and a single body of appeal, in effect an enhanced Labour Court.</td></tr><tr><td>We will develop a Unique Business Identifier for use by all government departments and agencies that will facilitate the sharing of information within Government and reduce repetitive information requests from businesses. </td><td>Legislative proposals to facilitate data sharing currently being considered. </td></tr><tr><td>We will introduce new legally binding voluntary commercial debt plan structures to allow small businesses to restructure debts without recourse to expensive court procedures.</td><td>I asked the Company Law Review Group (CLRG) to examine the feasibility of introducing such a scheme. The CLRG reported back at the end of September and I am considering that report. </td></tr><tr><td>We will implement a temporary, partial credit guarantee scheme that will provide a level of insurance to banks against losses on qualifying loans to job-creating firms to get banks lending again to industry and entrepreneurs. </td><td>The launch of the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme is imminent. </td></tr><tr><td>We will construct a &#8364;100 million Microfinance Start-Up Fund that will provide start-up loans and equity that draws funding from the NPRF and private institutional funds. </td><td>The Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme was launched on the 27th September 2012.</td></tr><tr><td>We will support the development of a more dynamic, venture capital industry in Ireland by seeking to attract top tier venture financing and investment companies to Ireland, such as Silicon Valley Bank. </td><td>Given how close the current funding cycle is to completion, work is being progressed on delivering policy clarity on the future of the VC Schemes</td></tr><tr><td>We will work to promote a greater appreciation of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation, ensure a level playing field between co-operatives and the other legal options for structuring enterprise activities, and provide a conductive framework for the full potential of the co-operative model to be realised, including in areas such as childcare, education, housing, energy retrofitting, environmental protection, transport and healthcare. </td><td>My Department&#8217;s role is to provide the legislative framework within which business entities can operate, and a number of legal options are available to those considering establishing themselves in business. It is up to each individual operation to choose the model that best suits the nature of the business and the desired ethos of the entity. My Department does not promote one corporate form over another.  <br /><br />In June 2011, I secured the agreement of Government to draft legislation to ease the regulatory burden on co-operative societies and to make it easier to start up and run a co-operative as an alternative form of enterprise organisation, and a draft Bill is now with the OPC for drafting. In this way, my Department plays its part in facilitating the development of co-operatives in the International Year of Co-operatives (2012).   Individual Departments will engage directly with the promotion or development of co-operatives in a particular field where they consider the co-operative model may bring particular benefit.<br /></td></tr><tr><td>We will legislate to ban a number of unfair trading practices in the retail sector, such as &#8216;hello money&#8217; from food suppliers. </td><td>Building on the Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 which bans certain anti-competitive practices in the grocery goods sector, an enabling provision which will allow me as Minister to promulgate Regulations to establish a code of practice to regulate particular trading practices in the grocery goods sector, will be included in the Consumer and Competition Bill.  The Bill, the draft heads of which were approved by Government in July 2011, is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and it is expected that the Bill will be published later this year.  The promulgation of any Regulations is expected to follow shortly after the enactment of the primary legislation.</td></tr><tr><td>We will seek to establish Ireland as a renewable manufacturing hub to attract international and domestic investment. </td><td>Enterprise Ireland provides support to companies in the cleantech sector and is continuously assisting companies to find new export opportunities for energy-efficient and related products.  The Government&#8217;s plan for the development of the Green Economy will also support this commitment.</td></tr><tr><td>The Government will promote the development of a vibrant and effective social enterprise sector. We will instruct agencies to view social enterprises as important stakeholders in rejuvenating local economies. We will continue support for social innovation projects for young people through education, community and voluntary structures. </td><td>Forf&aacute;s carried out a review of the social enterprise sector and will be reporting to the Minister before the year end.</td></tr><tr><td>We will make good corporate governance the law, not an optional extra, and enact legislation to provide for binding code of practice for corporate governance, which will be obligatory for companies wishing to be listed on Irish stock exchange.</td><td>Any company that wishes to list on the Irish Stock Exchange&#8217;s main market must implement the UK Corporate Governance Code and its Irish annex. This Code is subject to regular review and update, with the most recent amendments being made in September of this year. While the legal obligation to implement the Code only applies to companies listed on the main market, the Irish Stock Exchange&#8217;s own Listing Rules require companies on the secondary market to report on how they have applied the principles of the Code or, where they have not, to explain why. <br /><br />Meanwhile, work is progressing on the Companies Bill, which will consolidate and reform the existing canon of company law. One novel feature of the Bill is that it will bring together into one statutory provision all the existing fiduciary duties of directors, to make them more accessible and comprehensive to all. <br /><br />At the same time, the European Commission is examining the need for EU wide company law and governance measures and this is expected to yield proposals later this year. Where these are for legislation, we will be implementing them into Irish Law.  </td></tr><tr><td>We will strengthen corporate governance legislation and enforcement. </td><td>Please see commitment above.</td></tr></table></p></reply>

I have made, with the consent of my colleagues the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, a necessary scheme under section 5 of the Act.  The Scheme, which is Statutory Instrument number 343 of 2012, sets out the terms and conditions, and was laid before the Oireachtas on 13th September.</p><p>  The Scheme is intended to address two distinct barriers to lending: inadequacy of collateral (Pillar 1) and inadequacy of understanding of the novelty of a business model, market, sector or technology (Pillar 2).  It will be exclusively targeted to address these particular market inefficiencies.  Commercially viable, well performing micro, small and medium enterprises that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan is the target of the scheme.  </p><p>  Decision making on commercial viability of the SME and all credit assessments will be fully devolved to the accredited lenders.  The individual loan transaction between Lender and Borrower is delivered in an almost identical fashion to any other comparable commercial lending transaction between the parties, with the only difference being the supplementary arrangements necessary for payment of the 2% premium charge by the borrower to the State.  Term loans, other instruments with term loan-like structures, and performance bonds will be covered by the Scheme.  The minimum permissible loan value will be &euro;10,000 and the maximum will be &euro;1,000,000. Use of the Scheme is focussed on facilitating additional new lending, with refinancing of existing debt explicitly excluded.</p></reply>

The Reform Programme, which I announced in July, 2011, will among other matters, address a number of criticisms levelled over the years at the existing system.  These include:</p><p>- Five organisations with overlapping, but completely separate, objectives and operations.</p><p>- Claims are often referred to the wrong forum or under the wrong statute.</p><p>- Lack of consistency between the bodies regarding degree of formality of hearings, rules of evidence and use of adversarial or inquisitorial procedures.</p><p>- Overly legalistic and so complex that experienced practitioners find it difficult to comprehend.</p><p>- Excessive delays.</p><p>- Duplication of functions between the bodies results in &ldquo;forum shopping&rdquo;.</p><p>- Poor value for money.</p><p>  My objective is to establish a world-class Workplace Relations Service.  I am happy to report that substantial progress has been made to date and a number of important priority actions have been successfully delivered within the target timescale. These include:</p><p>- A new single contact portal called &ldquo;Workplace Relations Customer Services&rdquo; has replaced the five separate entry points. </p><p>- Complaints are now acknowledged, on average, within a week of receipt. This was previously taking up to eight months in some cases.</p><p>- The employer is also notified, on average, within a week of the complaint being lodged thus increasing the possibility of a resolution being reached without the need for a hearing.</p><p>- There are now no backlogs for Rights Commissioner hearings.</p><p>- A Single Complaint Form that deals with over 100 first instance complaints has replaced the 30 forms previously in use.</p><p>- A new workplace relations interim website is in place.</p><p>- A pilot Early Resolution Service is now seeking to resolve disputes at an early stage without the need for adjudication.</p><p>- A major Business Process Review is at an advanced stage. This will identify the procedures, processes and systems which will underpin the new structures. </p><p>  My intention is to continue to progress the reform programme. The next major step is to establish a two-tier Workplace Relations structure. This will involve two statutorily independent bodies replacing the current five. We will have a new single body of first instance to be called the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) and a separate appeals body, which will effectively be an expanded Labour Court. The WRC will replace the LRC, NERA, the Equality Tribunal and undertake the first instance functions of the EAT. The labour Court will take on the appellate functions of the EAT.  While considerable progress has been achieved to date on an administrative basis, completing the proposed reform requires the enactment of detailed legislation. This is necessary in order to provide the statutory basis for the new structures and processes.</p><p>  Last year I undertook a public consultation process that concluded in September 2011. The responses, overall, demonstrated a strong consensus around the need for reform and the shape that reform should take. The many positive suggestions that emerged from that process have helped to inform the design and delivery of the reform to date. They also influenced the proposals set out in the Blueprint to Deliver a World-Class Workplace Relations Service (Blueprint) which I published in April of this year.</p><p>  The Blueprint document set out, in considerable detail, how I propose to reform the workplace relations structures and processes. I published the Blueprint in order to provide a further opportunity for consultation. I am happy to have received 32 responses to the document. They include many supportive, useful and constructive suggestions and comments. All contributions made have received careful consideration and helped inform the preparation of the Policy Document &ndash; Legislating for a World-Class Workplace Relations Service which I submitted to the Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in order to give the Committee an early opportunity to shape the legislation.  I had a constructive dialogue with the Committee on the basis of the document. </p><p>  Work has commenced on the legislative programme and detailed design to deliver the reform.  A significant amount of work has been completed on the legislative programme and the General Scheme of Bill was approved by Government for priority drafting at the Cabinet meeting on 24th July, 2012. I expect publication before the end of quarter one of next year. This would enable the proposed new structures to be put in place by early 2013.   </p><p>  In the meantime, I intend to continue to progress the reform on an administrative basis.  I am now proceeding to introduce a further tranche of specific projects and initiatives which can be progressed and implemented in advance of the enabling legislation. These include:   </p><p>- Transfer responsibility for the Equality Tribunal from the Minister for Justice and Equality to myself </p><p>- Publish the permanent  Workplace Relations Website to replace the six sites currently in place</p><p>- Establish a Single Hearings Management and Scheduling Unit</p><p>- Establish a Single/Shared Corporate Services Unit for the Workplace Relations Bodies.</p><p>- Provide a version of Workplace Relations Complaint Form that can be submitted online (e-Complaint Form)</p><p>- Enhance  Adjudication Arrangements and reduction of backlogs in the Equality Tribunal</p><p>- Develop and deliver an accredited training programme for adjudicators</p><p>- Implement new business processes in the Workplace Relations Bodies</p><p>- Implement a Code of Practice and Conduct for adjudicators</p><p>- Introduce standard templates for Rights Commissioners&rsquo; decisions/Equality Tribunal and EAT Determinations</p><p>- Review and revise, as necessary, existing statutory instruments (SIs) </p><p>- Rationalise hearings venues</p><p>- Develop a Single Determinations Database</p><p>- Put in place a Single Complaints Management System</p><p>  I am determined to progress the next phase of the reform and the enactment of the legislation with the same determination and priority that has delivered excellent results to date.</p></reply>

Current Government policy is to issue employment permits for the employment of non-EEA nationals for specific vacancies and in response to employer demand for strategic skills/labour shortages in designated occupations in key economic sectors such as healthcare, information technology and financial services. </p><p>  ICT is a key sector for Ireland due to the importance of its on-going levels of employment and exports and its future potential. As such, the availability of high-level ICT skills for the ICT sector is of strategic economic importance to Ireland in terms of continued growth in investments from foreign companies.  </p><p>  However, recruitment challenges have emerged for high-level ICT skills and it is estimated that there are in excess of 1,500 job vacancies in the ICT sector.  While increasing the supply of high-level skills from domestic sources is the most sustainable way forward in the long term, in the short term, companies will continue to rely on inward migration for sourcing ICT personnel.  A range of employment permits initiatives have been put in place to address this skills issue. The <b>Green Card Employment Permit Scheme</b>   is used by Ireland to meet labour market requirements where skills shortages have been identified by reference to analyses undertaken by the ESGFN. It is designed to attract highly skilled and highly paid individuals into the labour market with the aim of encouraging them to take up permanent residence in the State. Cognisance is also given to the strategic imperative of the missions of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, with priority being afforded to their clients.</p><p>  The <b>Intra-Company Transfer Employment Permit Scheme</b>, introduced in 2007, facilitates the transfer of trans-national senior personnel between related companies.<b></b>State agencies, including the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, consider this scheme to be very important in the context of foreign direct investment.  Also, the <b>Work Permits Employment Permit Scheme</b>   provides for a further channel for employers and prospective employees to source ICT skills.</p><p>  Over 1,100 employment permits were issued in 2011 and just over 1,000 to-date in 2012, in respect of ICT skills with nearly 93% of applications being successful.  In an effort to bridge the gap that currently exists, DJEI is at present reviewing its employment permits schemes in the context of simplifying employment permit applications and streamlining the application process for the ICT sector.</p></reply>

The scheme permits customers to travel for free on most CIE public transport services, LUAS and a range of services offered by up to 90 private operators in various parts of the country. Customers of the scheme who are married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership receive a pass that allows their spouse/civil partner/cohabitant to travel with them for free. Certain incapacitated customers can get a companion pass which allows any person over age 16 years to accompany them for free.</p><p>  There are currently in excess of 740,000 customers eligible for free travel and when spousal and companion passes are taken into account, there are over 1.1 million customers with some free travel eligibility.  The cost of the scheme has risen substantially over the last 10 years from almost &euro;46 million for almost 608,000 customers in 2001 to over &euro;75 million for 726,000 customers in 2011.  In line with the Government decision, expenditure on this scheme has been frozen since 2010. </p><p>  In addition, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme the Department of Social Protection may award a travel supplement to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client&rsquo;s own resources and are deemed to be necessary. Where the travel costs are non-recurring, the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides for exceptional needs payments to be made to assist with essential, once-off expenditure in exceptional circumstances. Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p><p>  I am not in a position to consider any improvements to the Free Travel Scheme at this time. There are considerable challenges ahead to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports provided by my Department which impact in some way on the lives of almost every person in the State.  To help ensure the future sustainability of the free travel scheme, a review is being carried out by officials from my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority.   The review is in the early stages.</p></reply>

It is worth noting that 346 of these placements are in the education sector</p><p>  Our records indicate that a significant proportion of the participants who have finished their JobBridge internship placement have immediately progressed into employment. These progression rates compare favourably with European averages in this area. Further information on outcomes will be ascertained as a result of the independent evaluation of the Scheme which is currently being undertaken by Indecon</p><p>  Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of Labour Market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of &euro;50 get an opportunity to engage in the workplace. </p><p>  It is widely accepted that internship opportunities provide a participant with the opportunity to gain valuable experience, relevant knowledge, enhance their skills and learn new ones within a working environment. JobBridge endeavours to provide every single person on an internship placement with a positive experience, building their confidence through work experience thus allowing them access to networking opportunities, a possible career path and enhanced career prospects. Accordingly JobBridge can assist individuals in breaking the unemployment cycle and be in a better position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.  It is a matter for each potential Host Organisation to manage and control applications from within their organisation. As a consequence it would therefore not be appropriate for JobBridge to comment on any external directives that may be issued to organisations.</p></reply>

Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory).   Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 4.25%). </p><p>  The third Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, as at 31 December 2010, was completed by consultants KPMG in June 2012 and laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 24 August 2012.   The Review covers a 55 year period from 2011&ndash;2066 and builds on the findings of the 2000 and 2005 Actuarial Reviews of the Fund.  One of the issues examined in the 2010 Review was the long-term cost implications to the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) and the break-even contributions rates required to provide invalidity pensions to the self-employed and to provide jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit for self-employed workers.  The report found that the effective annual rate of contribution, or the required contribution as a percentage of salary, needed to provide the core full-rate State pension (contributory), which is the benefit currently available to self-employed contributors, is approximately 15%.  This compares favourably with the 4% rate currently paid by the self-employed.  An incremental increase in contribution rates from approximately 15% to 16% would be required if jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit in addition to core State pension (contributory) is provided.</p><p>  The average contribution rate required for the core State pension (contributory) plus jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the invalidity pension is estimated to be in the region of 17.3%.  The scope of the review did not extend to costing of these benefits on a voluntary or optional basis.</p><p>  Any proposals to extend additional cover to the self-employed will have to be considered in a budgetary context, taking account of the finding of the Actuarial Review that the self-employed achieve very good value for money compared with the employed &ndash; when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  Last year I established the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare to meet the commitment made in the Programme for Government.   The Advisory Group will, inter alia, examine and report on issues involved in providing social insurance cover for self-employed persons in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable.</p><p>  The Advisory Group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the Terms of Reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support.  The Group has been considering the issue of social insurance coverage for the self-employed and will submit its report once its examination of the various questions has been completed.</p><p>  Self-employed workers may establish eligibility to assistance-based payments such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and disability allowance.  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance they can apply for the means-tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or if they are on low income as a result of a downturn in demand for their services.  In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year and, in the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p></reply>

As part of the contract, the CE Sponsoring organisation is given an advance payment at the project commencement (called the Initial Grant) equivalent to 8 weeks estimated wages to cover the initial wages for the Supervisor and participants (paid on a current week basis) and other set-up costs (insurance costs, start-up materials, training etc.).   The CE project year is divided into 13 four-week pay cycles. The Sponsor can claim the actual wages paid out in each 4-week cycle at the end of that cycle.  The advance payment/Initial Grant is clawed back in tranches over 8 cycles and the 13th Cycle payment is withheld pending the audit/final reconciliation being carried out of the project finances at the end of the 12th   cycle. On completion and sign-off of the audit, a final payment is issued to cover Cycle 13 taking account of any net over/under payment up to Cycle 12.</p><p>  The speed with which the final payment is processed is dependent on how quickly the sponsor presents a satisfactory completed audit. Sponsors are aware of this and should plan to avoid any unnecessary delays. The Department has recently revised the rules regarding the bank account used for the CE project to take account of the difficulties experienced. Previously a new bank account was required for each project year. Now a single bank account can be used on a rolling basis, greatly simplifying the process and maintaining better cashflow, as the next project year&rsquo;s advance will be lodged to the single account minimising the overdraft exposure of the Sponsor.</p></reply>

Many of the Medical Assessors have specialist post-graduate qualifications and all have experience/training in Human Disability Evaluation.</p><p>  The delay in processing medical assessments is due to a number of factors such as the increase in volume of customer claims to particular schemes, the time involved in assessing cases where there is lengthy medical evidence to be assessed and the recent retirement of 4 of the Medical Assessors. The Department is addressing this issue and is currently in the process of recruiting the first 3 Medical Assessors from a panel of 14 which was set up following a competition as arranged by the Public Appointments Service.

The approach differentiates between mortgage information and mortgage advice. The first two involve the enhancement of the website    and the establishment of a Mortgage Arrears Information Helpline within the Citizens Information Board both of which focus on the provision of comprehensive mortgage arrears information in particular to people in arrears or pre-arrears.  The third element of the service is the provision of independent financial advice to mortgage holders who are being presented with long term mortgage resolution proposals by their lenders. This advice will be provided by a panel of accountants drawn from members of the main accountancy institutes in Ireland who have agreed to participate and support this independent service.</p><p>  When a lender is proposing longer-term mortgage resolutions, the lender will advise the borrower to obtain independent financial advice on the proposed arrangement and that, if the borrower wishes to avail of this option, that the lender will pay &#8364;250 to an accountant of the borrower&#8217;s choosing for the provision of this advice.  An operating protocol for the provision of this advice has been agreed between the main accountancy bodies and the lenders. The general scope of the advice will be limited to the borrower&#8217;s principal private residence. </p><p>  The advisory framework has commenced with practicing accountants because they already operate within a regulatory regime which includes qualitative oversight by their regulating bodies and in these circumstances it was possible to establish the advisory framework for people with mortgage distress within a relatively short timeframe.  </p><p>  There is nothing to inhibit other financial intermediaries from continuing to give advice on mortgages as requested by borrowers. While the advisory framework will be monitored on an on-going basis, it is not intended to conduct a full review of the service before the due date of June 2013. The review will be undertaken to ensure that it is meeting its objectives and will encompass all aspects of the service including if participation is extended to other interested parties, the criteria that would be required in terms of relevant qualifications, experience, independence, professional indemnity insurance, etc.   The accountancy bodies have notified their members about the new service and a panel is available on a county by county basis on the website <i><font color="#0000FF">.</font></i></p></reply>

My Department also provides some funding for the rural transport programme.  In line with the Government decision, expenditure on this scheme has been frozen since 2010. </p><p>  There are considerable challenges ahead to protect, as far as possible, the key income supports provided by my Department which impact in some way on the lives of almost every person in the State.  As part of the deliberative process for the budget, my Department will analyse all schemes, and in so far as possible, the distributive and poverty impact of possible welfare changes.  These impacts will be taken into account in arriving at the final decisions on the Budget to ensure that the scarce resources are targeted at those most in need.</p><p>  To help ensure the future sustainability of the free travel scheme, a review is being carried out by officials from my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority.   The review is in the early stages.</p></reply>

It is essential that our tax and social protection systems play their part in addressing these challenges.  To this end, and in line with commitments contained in the programme for Government, I established an advisory group on tax and social welfare last year, with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to examine a number of specific issues.  These include making cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes, particularly child poverty outcomes. </p><p>  The group&rsquo;s overall method of working is based on producing modular reports on the priority areas identified in the terms of reference.  Where possible, the aim is to provide recommendations that can be acted upon in time for the annual budget, estimates and legislative cycle and to allow the Government to best address its commitments under the EU-IMF programme of financial support.  Decisions in respect of publishing reports of the group will be made at the appropriate time.  The group&rsquo;s terms of reference provide for a range of issues to be considered.</p><p>  The group commenced its work programme by prioritising the area of family and child income supports taking into account the considerable level of analysis that has already taken place in relation to family and child income supports.  I am currently considering the report of the group&rsquo;s examination of this issue and intended to publish this report in due course.  The report is therefore not yet in the public domain.</p></reply>

The project involved the development of IT functionality which was fully deployment in June 2012.</p><p>  Following the completion of the modernisation project, an in-depth business process improvement (BPI) project commenced for the carer&rsquo;s allowance scheme.  This BPI project is focused on optimising output and customer service and the reduction of backlogs.  Initial focus was placed on clearing the backlog of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims awaiting scanning and registration.  Over July and August 2012, 4,414 claims were scanned and registered -clearing the backlog completely.  Claims are now scanned within a day or two of being received.</p><p>  The focus has now moved to the processing of new claims.  Processing of claims has been divided into two streams. One concentrates on dealing with new claim intake and processing these without delay.   The second stream works on the backlog which is ring-fenced with a clear and targeted plan for its elimination.  Implementation of the plan commenced on Monday 3 September and progress after 5 weeks of operation is very encouraging.</p><p>  During the month of September 2012 1,147 carer&rsquo;s allowance claims were received, while 1,317 claims were decided. This performance level will continue to improve and the number of claims pending decision and the average processing times will continue to reduce. However, it will take a number of months before the backlog is cleared. The allocation and management of available resources to this task continues to be closely monitored to ensure optimum effectiveness.</p></reply>

Two fundamental principles apply:</p><p>- The contributory principle whereby there is a direct link between contributions paid and entitlement to a varying range of benefits and pensions that are payable as a right if and when particular contingencies arise; and</p><p>- The solidarity principle whereby contributions paid by insured persons are not actuarially linked to benefits but are instead redistributed to support contributors who are more vulnerable. It is an expression of solidarity between both earning groups and generations. The non-contributory pension falls into this category.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, Budget 2012 announced changes to State pension provision including new rate bands for claimants who become eligible for State pension after 1st September 2012.</p><p>Prior to the September 1st changes this year, a person with an average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions per year over their working life received a weekly State pension of only &euro;4.50 less than a person with a yearly average of 48 or more PRSI contributions. This is not equitable.</p><p>The reform introduced additional rate bands for new customers who become eligible for State pension (transition) and State pension (contributory), and associated increases for qualified adults from 1st September 2012.  This affects those who have smaller yearly average of social insurance contributions as they spent fewer years at work.</p><p>The maximum rate remains unchanged and the rate payable to people with an average of between 40 and 47 contributions per year also remains unchanged.  However, those who have fewer than 40 contributions per year will receive a lower rate of pension. If claimants have an income need they may, following a means test, qualify for a higher rate on the State pension (non-contributory).</p><p>People who qualify for the State pension (contributory) based on either of the top two rate bands i.e. a yearly average of 48 PRSI contributions or more and a yearly average of between 40 and 47 PRSI contributions qualify for a weekly personal payment of &euro;230.30 and &euro;225.80 respectively, both of which are greater than the maximum rate of the State pension (non-contributory) pension which is &euro;219.00 per week.</p><p>Similarly, those who qualified for the State pension (contributory) before 1st September based on either of the top two rate bands qualified for a personal payment of &euro;230.30 per week and &euro;225.80 per week.  These were based on yearly average of 48 PRSI or more contributions and a yearly average of between 20 and 47 PRSI contributions respectively.  The maximum personal rate of the State pension (non-contributory) is &euro;219.00 per week and is paid to people who have a weekly means of &euro;30 or less.  The weekly rate of payment is reduced by &euro;2.50 for every &euro;2.50 means assessment over &euro;30.00.  The minimum personal rate payable is &euro;4.00 per week which is paid to people whose weekly means amounts to over &euro;242.50 and up to &euro;245.00.</p><p>The Deputy will be aware that the State pension is a very valuable benefit and the change to State pension rate bands means that pension payments will be more closely related to PRSI payments made over a working life.  This ensures that those who contribute more during their working life will benefit more in retirement, thereby ensuring equity in the social welfare system.</p><p>It is also important to note the significant long term challenges facing the Irish pension system.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to less than two to one by 2050.  People aged 65 years and over will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion of working age is expected to decline.  People are living longer with healthier lives and growing numbers of people want to work, or may need to work beyond State Pension age.   While this is a welcome development it does have obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.  Therefore, the task of financing increasing pensions will fall to a diminishing share of the population.  The State pension is the bedrock of the Irish pension system, and these reforms are essential to address the challenges of increasing life expectancy and to ensure its sustainability.</p><p><table><tr><th colspan="3"><b>Rates of payment from January &#8211; August 2012</b></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>Personal Rate</td><td>State Pension <br />(Non-contributory)</td><td>Personal Rate</td></tr><tr><td>48 cons or over </td><td>&#8364;230.30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>20 - 47</td><td>&#8364;225.80</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19</td><td>&#8364;172.70</td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00</td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)</td></tr><tr><td>10 &#8211; 14</td><td>&#8364;115.20</td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;30.00 &amp; up to &#8364;32.50 </td><td>&#8364;216.50</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td></td><td>State Pension<br />(Non Contributory)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>48 cons or over</td><td>&#8364;230.30</td><td>N/A</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>24 &#8211; 47</td><td>&#8364;225.80</td><td>N/A</td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3"><b>Rates of Payment from 1st September 2012</b></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>Personal Rate</td><td>State Pension <br />(Non-contributory)</td><td>Personal Rate</td></tr><tr><td>48 cons or over </td><td>&#8364;230.30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>40 - 47</td><td>&#8364;225.80</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>30 - 39</td><td>&#8364;207.00</td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00</td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)</td></tr><tr><td>20 - 29</td><td>&#8364;196.00</td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;30.00 &amp; up to &#8364;32.50 </td><td>&#8364;216.50</td></tr><tr><td>15 &#8211; 19</td><td>&#8364;150.00</td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;32.50 &amp; up to &#8364;35.00</td><td>&#8364;214.00</td></tr><tr><td>10 - 14</td><td>&#8364;92.00</td><td>Weekly Means of over &#8364;35.00 &amp; up to &#8364;37.50 </td><td>&#8364;211.50</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td></td><td>State Pension<br />(Non Contributory)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>48 cons or over</td><td>&#8364;230.30</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>40 &#8211; 47</td><td>&#8364;225.80</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>30 &#8211; 39</td><td>&#8364;207.00</td><td>Weekly Means up to &#8364;30.00</td><td>&#8364;219.00 (maximum rate)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Capital includes monies on hands or deposited in financial institutions while property includes the value of other assets such as bonds and equities as well as houses and other premises. Property such as the family home or a premises used by a person in carrying out a business are not liable for assessment. </p><p>  In the case of other property, the current market value of the property is established as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages on that property. The current market value of a property is the best estimate of what would be achievable if the property was offered for sale. Such an estimate will have regard to reductions in prices over recent years. The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is then assessed. Where the current market value is less than the outstanding mortgage, no assessment is made. </p><p>  In the case of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, the first &euro;20,000 of the value of capital/property is not assessed and the value of the balance is assessed by reference to a formula set out in legislation. The income, if any, derived by the person from the use of any capital or property is not taken into account. There are no plans at present to change the method of assessment of property/capital for social assistance schemes.</p></reply>

The Department's objective in this area is to raise educational and skills level among the long term unemployed in order to help them to meet the requirements of the modern labour market. Included in the supports available is the back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme which is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education.  The scheme is open to those on certain social welfare payments for a specified time and who otherwise meet the conditions of the scheme. These other conditions include, the nature of the course being pursued and the qualification sought, and progression by reference to the level of education previously held.  The scheme covers a wide range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines. </p><p>  BTEA guidelines are, in the main, in line with the mechanisms in place for similar student supports administered by the Department of Education and Skills and require student progression from one qualification level to a higher one.  This is necessary to ensure displacement does not occur, in that courses could be offered to students who are not progressing at the cost of students progressing from a lower education level.  </p><p>  It is important to note that the BTEA scheme is not intended to be an alternative form of funding for those wishing to enter or re-enter the education system. It is not possible, within the scope of the scheme, to authorise an application for payment where the basic qualifying conditions have not been satisfied and progression is not evident.</p><p>  If a person wishes to pursue a part time education course they may be able to do so while still obtaining their jobseekers payment.  They must apply at their local social welfare office and verify that participation on the course does not reduce their availability for work.  In the case of jobseekers benefit, participation on a course does not grant any extension to the normal period for which jobseekers benefit is paid.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short-term assistance and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 90,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement, for which the Government has provided &euro;436m in 2012.</p><p>  Historically rent supplements have been administered at a local level by the Community Welfare Service directly to the customer. As a result of the large increase in claims being made in recent years, with the number of persons in receipt of the allowance increasing by 62% during the period from 2007 to 2011, it was considered that the processing of rent supplement claims could be delivered more efficiently through centralised units. Departmental officers who were formerly community welfare officers continue to assess applications for rent supplement within the centralised units. The establishment of rent units also supports front line staff to focus in the delivery of basic payments and exceptional and urgent needs payments. </p><p>  Customers living in one of the areas covered by a rent unit can obtain a rent pack from their local departmental representative. This pack contains detailed information and all the relevant application forms. This rent pack can also be requested by phone from the relevant unit. Information on the areas covered by rents units throughout the country is available on the Department&rsquo;s website. </p><p>  The timescale for determining individual applications for rent supplement is dependant, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as details of the applicant&rsquo;s income, bank statements, information from landlords, etc. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required. Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information. The Deputy&rsquo;s particular concern is probably referring to the Bishop&rsquo;s Square Central Unit which did experience an increase in application waiting times over the last number of weeks. This is in part due to the on-going process of rationalising rent and mortgage interest supplements services for the greater Dublin area with a few to improving efficiency in service delivery. The temporary issue of waiting times in the Bishop's Square office has since been resolved.</p><p>  A key objective of the transfer of the Community Welfare Service from the Health Service Executive to my Department on 1 October 2011 is to provide a streamlined, consistent and enhanced service to the customer. The process of integration is on-going and significant progress has already been made with a unified service, the National Employment and Entitlements Service, is now in the process of being delivered in four offices. The delivery of services in relation to processing rent supplement applications is also subject to on-going review. However, I have no plans at this time to reverse the establishment of some centralised rent units.</p><p>  I am satisfied that staff makes every effort to decide rent supplement claims in an efficient, effective and timely manner. </p></reply>

Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, a payment for rent in advance can be made as an exceptional needs payment. An exceptional needs payment may be made to help meet an essential once-off cost, which the applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  There is no automatic entitlement to this payment and each application is determined by the officer administering the SWA scheme based on the particular circumstances of the case taking account of the nature and extent of the need.  Such payments are confined to occurrences which are considered to be unexpected, unforeseen or exceptional.</p><p>  This flexibility ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.  </p></reply>

The Department relies on the knowledge and expertise of its staff to deliver these services and, in view of their crucial role, the numbers of staff required to deliver a quality customer service is kept under constant review.  </p><p>  In the period since May 2008, some 1,045 staff have been redeployed to the Department to fill critical vacancies in scheme areas, local offices, central support units and the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate to deal with the increased volume of claims due to the downturn in the economy.  The Department also makes judicious use of overtime and employs temporary staff as appropriate to address particular service issues as they arise.</p><p>  In general across departmental schemes delays are kept to an absolute minimum.  In August 2012, for instance, 96% of domestic State Pension Contributory claims being decided by the date of entitlement and 98% of illness benefit claims were decided within 1 week.   However, customers for some other Departmental schemes such as family income supplement and carer&rsquo;s allowance are experiencing lengthy delays at present. </p><p>  Processing times vary across schemes, depending on the differing qualification criteria for the scheme involved.  In order to meet the dual challenges of increased claim volumes and the demand for shorter processing times, the Department has embarked on a major programme of process redesign and modernisation involving the development and roll-out of new computer systems and streamlined work practices.  In addition, a programme of business improvement process projects is underway in the Department&rsquo;s Longford Headquarters, which deals with long-term disability, carer&rsquo;s and family income supplement schemes.  This programme is aimed at eliminating excessive delays and began with invalidity pension.  A significant reduction in the number of new invalidity pension claims awaiting decision has been achieved with numbers reducing from 7,007 at the start of June 2012 to 5,372 at the end of September 2012.  Similar projects are currently underway in the carer&rsquo;s allowance and family income supplement areas.</p><p>  I should also point out that in order to offer a more streamlined, efficient and integrated service to customers, the Department is undergoing a process of intensive planning and organisational change in establishing the new National Employment and Entitlements Service (NEES).  This service brings together the Community Welfare Service (CWS), the Employment Services and Community Employment Programmes of F&Aacute;S, the Rural Social Scheme and Community Services Programme from the former Department of Community, Equality and the Gaeltacht and the Redundancy and Insolvency schemes from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.</p><p>  The new NEES model will integrate all employment and benefit support services in a single delivery unit and will provide a coherent integrated and more personalised service to customers. It will also serve to eliminate the duplication of work that characterised services which were provided separately in the past.</p></reply>

Meath, is protected by a Preservation Order made under the National Monuments Acts.  The effect of the preservation order is that it is unlawful for any person to demolish or remove wholly or in part or to disfigure, deface, alter or in any manner injure or interfere with the national monument without my consent.  It is also unlawful for any person to excavate, dig, plough or otherwise disturb the ground within, around or in proximity to the national monument without consent.  The designation of a Special Protection Area (SPA) for birds does not affect or rescind any Preservation Order made under the National Monuments Acts.</p><p>  Notification of a proposal to designate the River Nanny Estuary and Shore SPA, further to Ireland&#8217;s obligations under the Birds Directive, was publicly advertised by my Department in January 2008.  The designation process permits landowners and other interested parties to appeal the inclusion of specific areas within the Special Protection Area.  An appeal was lodged by Drogheda Port Company against the inclusion of certain areas within the SPA.  By law, such appeals are considered purely on the ornithological merits of the case.  A review by my Department of available bird-usage data for the site justified a revision of the boundary to exclude from the SPA part of the land that was subject to the appeal.  The Port Company&#8217;s request to have another area excluded from the SPA was unsuccessful. </p><p>  The designation process for this SPA is now finalised and the SPA is  protected by Statutory Instrument (S.I. 140/2012).  The revised boundary for the site is reflected in the Statutory Instrument.  The new boundary may be viewed on my Department&#8217;s National Parks and Wildlife Service website at <i>.</i></p></reply>

This is in addition to &#8364;750,000 which had previously been committed. A further &#8364;125,000 has been allocated to artists and organisations to assist with their advance touring plans for 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>We will work with stakeholders in the arts community to develop new proposals aimed at building private support of the arts in Ireland exploring philanthropic, sponsorship or endowment fund opportunities.</td><td>In May 2012, the Philanthropic Leverage Initiative was launched, on a pilot basis, with funding of &#8364;230,000. Following a policy direction from me, the Arts Council has also developed a capacity building programme - RAISE - to further encourage philanthropy in arts organisations. I will host an important conference on Philanthropy and the Arts on 18 October next at Smock Alley Theatre. </td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>We will make the Culture Night Initiative a twice yearly event, and introduce a National Lottery Funding Anniversary Day, whereby all facilities which have received funding from the National Lottery will open their doors to the public free of charge</td><td>Culture Night 2012 took place on 21 September 2012 throughout the island of Ireland, showcasing the best of our artistic and cultural heritage and facilities with record visitors in attendance. This was financially supported by my Department in the amount of &#8364;200,000. Arising from discussions, most notably at Global Irish Economic Forum, as to the most appropriate way to build on the success and popularity of Culture Night for 2012 and beyond, it is proposed to develop the week of St Patrick's Day as the International Day of Irish Culture, thereby building on solid foundations already in place. </td></tr><tr><td>5.</td><td>We will also review the opening times of our national cultural institutions.</td><td>The National Cultural Institutions have been asked to carry out a formal review of their opening hours, notwithstanding the fact that this issue is a matter which is kept routinely under review by all of the institutions.</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>We will develop a cultural plan for future commemorative events such as the Centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016.</td><td>Work has commenced on a programme of commemorative events in the context of the Decade of Centenaries 2012-2022, including the centenary of the Easter Rising in 2016. </td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>We will promote genealogical tourism by updating the National Cultural Institutions Act in relation to the Genealogical Office to put it on a proper statutory footing, modernise its operations and to enable publication of the 1926 census to stimulate genealogy tourism</td><td>My Department continues to liaise with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the amendment of the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, in order to address issues in relation to the Genealogical Office and to facilitate the backdating of grants of Coats of Arms.  <br /><br />There are potential data protection issues associated with the publication of the 1926 Census and my Department is progressing this matter in consultation with the Central Statistics Office</td></tr><tr><td>8.</td><td>We will also explore philanthropic opportunities for the development of a  national  archives and genealogy quarter, providing easy access to archives and tapping into an area of cultural tourism which is of huge interest to the vast Irish Diaspora.</td><td>My Department continues to engage with, and participate in, the Philanthropy Forum. <br /><br />Other initiatives in relation to philanthropy are outlined at point 5 above.</td></tr><tr><td>9.</td><td>We will encourage greater cooperation between local authorities to provide assistance where possible for local authorities currently lacking a local authority Arts Officer due to recruitment restrictions and to cooperate in developing cultural tourism opportunities.</td><td>Arts Officers are in place in all local authority areas. I have held meetings with Arts Officers&#8217; Groups on a regular basis to encourage improved cooperation and development of arts strategies in each local authority area.</td></tr><tr><td>10.</td><td>We will seek to capture some public good from NAMA by identifying buildings that have no commercial potential and which might be suitable as local facilities for art and culture</td><td>Engagement is ongoing with NAMA in relation to assets of interest from a cultural perspective.  The re-opening of the Lighthouse Cinema in Smithfield is a case in point. The purchase by the Abbey Theatre is also an example of progress in this area. <br /><br />My Department has met with and written to representatives of NAMA in terms of the responsibilities of owners and occupiers of protected structures under Part IV (Architectural Heritage) of the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010.  My Department will continue to liaise with NAMA in this regard and on issues of advice/appropriate reuse, where applicable. </td></tr><tr><td>11.</td><td>Responsibility for policy-making will revert to the Department, while agencies will be accountable for implementing policy, assessing outcomes and value for money.</td><td>My Department continues to set and develop policy in respect of the functions that are its direct responsibility and will ensure that the agencies implementing policy are accountable, transparent and fit for purpose. </td></tr><tr><td>12.</td><td>We will support the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 and will deliver on the achievable goals and targets proposed.   </td><td>Progress has been made in implementing the 20-Year Strategy, in particular with the enactment of the Gaeltacht Act 2012. This Act provides for a new language planning process in the Gaeltacht, for the recognition of Gaeltacht Service Towns and Irish Language Networks outside the existing statutory Gaeltacht and for changes to the governance and functions of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta. <br /><br />The Government has also re-established the Cabinet Committee on the Irish Language and the Gaeltacht to bring a greater strategic focus to Irish language policy development and implementation. </td></tr><tr><td>13.</td><td>Gaeltacht regions will benefit from the jobs action plan outlined in this document. Under our proposals, we will deliver new job creation prospects to Gaeltacht regions. We will invest in energy, broadband and water infrastructure, creating the modern infrastructure needed to attract and support new businesses and jobs.  We will also strongly support the potential for jobs in tourism and marine activities.  We will continue to support the Irish language broadcasting and arts sector. </td><td>&Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta continues to work towards achieving its job creation target of 400 jobs in the Gaeltacht in 2012. <br /><br />Following the recent enactment of the Gaeltacht Act 2012, the newly configured board for &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is expected to be in place in October. </td></tr><tr><td>14.</td><td>We will review the Official Languages Act to ensure expenditure on the language is best targeted towards the development of the language and that obligations are imposed appropriately in response to demand from citizens</td><td>A public consultation has been completed in respect of the review of the Official Languages Act, with over 1,400 survey responses and 240 submissions received. It is envisaged that the review will be completed and submitted to Government by end year. </td></tr><tr><td>15.</td><td>We will review current investment and funding programmes that benefit Irish language organisations in order to achieve visible value for money for citizens and tangible outcomes on a transparent basis.  </td><td>Foras na Gaeilge is undertaking a review of its 19 core funded Irish language organisations, in accordance with a decision taken by the North South Ministerial Council (NSMC). It is expected that the matter will be considered formally at the next NSMC language sectoral meeting in December 2012. <br /><br />It is envisaged that the review will result in a reconfiguration of the Irish language sector. </td></tr><tr><td>16.</td><td>We will allow an exemption for domestic turf cutting on 75 natural heritage area sites subject to the introduction of an agreed national code of environmental practices</td><td>The Peatlands Council was established by Government to put in place a mediation body to respond to the commitments in the Programme for Government in relation to turf cutting on SACs and NHAs. Much progress has been made in this regard including in relation to the development of an overall national strategy on peatlands. As part of the ongoing processes, it is intended to carry out a specific review of the 75 NHA raised bogs in advance of the 2014 turf cutting season. This review will commence later this year.</td></tr><tr><td>17.</td><td>We will establish an independent mediation between all relevant stakeholders with specific objective of facilitating resolution to 55 special area of conservation designated bogs.</td><td>The Government established a Peatlands Council, with representatives of all interested parties to this issue. Earlier this year, the Government also convened a Peatlands Forum, under the Chairmanship of Judge John Quirke. The Peatlands Forum involved all parties impacted by the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog SACs and issued a report of findings and recommendations. <br /><br />An enhanced compensation scheme for turf cutters - the Cessation of Turf Cutting Compensation Scheme - has also been put in place, and to date almost &#8364;2.3 million has been issued through this compensation scheme. Following a meeting with the European Commissioner for Environment in April 2012, the Government has agreed with the Commission on the development of a National Plan for the Management of Special Area of Conservation Raised Bogs. Work on the development of this plan is underway. <br /><br />There is ongoing dialogue with stakeholders in relation to relocation, the payment of compensation, and the development of the national plan. </td></tr><tr><td>18.</td><td>We will establish an independent mediation to resolve outstanding issues associated with turf cutting on blanket bogs.</td><td>The Peatland Council provides for effective engagement and mediation between interested parties, as set out in the Programme for Government. </td></tr></table></p></reply>

The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  The second Action Plan, which I will be bringing to Government shortly, provides a progress report on delivery of the national energy efficiency objectives and shows that Ireland is on track to deliver the 20% energy savings target by 2020.  The Plan will also set out a range of energy saving actions in the public sector, which will be prioritised between now and 2020.</p><p>  My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) have established a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  Last month I wrote to the head of each of the public bodies, reminding them of their obligation to report annually their energy usage to SEAI.  Enclosed with each letter was the SEAI report: &lsquo;Energy Use in the Public Sector&rsquo;, which outlines savings achieved to date across the public sector to end-2010 amount to 650 GWh.</p><p>  The public sector is estimated to spend more than &euro;500 million per annum on energy.  Achieving our 33% savings target for the public sector would save &euro;150 million each year in expenditure.  This Government remains firmly committed to meeting this target.  This year SEAI has targeted the top 135 public bodies, which account for over 95% of public sector energy consumption.  These organisations will submit detailed energy and activity data to SEAI.  From this data detailed progress scorecards will be produced for each organisation.  From 2013 on, an SEAI online energy data system will facilitate all public bodies and schools to report detailed energy data and allow SEAI to prepare detailed scorecards for all public bodies.</p><p>  Since 2009, my Department through SEAI has supported over 140 public sector retrofit projects.  This year the Better Energy Workplaces 2012 Fund has offered support to 145 projects &ndash; 44 of which are in the public sector.  This scheme has developed public sector and market competence and capacity for pay-as-you-save type models.  I recently approved the formation of an action group to develop a framework for energy performance contracting, which will stimulate mass scale retrofitting projects across the public sector.  This has been complemented by the Government decision to require all public sector bodies to go out to the market for energy services if their energy spend is more than &euro;500,000 per year.  The energy performance contracting framework will allow public bodies to implement projects whilst not relying on additional public expenditure to do so, thus not impacting on their capital budgets whilst also reducing their operating costs.</p><p>  Through all of the measures outlined, the exemplary role of the public sector will stimulate investment in energy efficient technologies and the development of a market for energy services and products.</p></reply>

This involved the radical restructuring of the domestic banking system which was announced last year and recalibrated the banking system by introducing the two pillar banks structure thereby creating a banking sector more proportionate to the size of the economy.  Other domestic and foreign players remain important competitive instruments in the sector.  With the recovery of the economy their role in providing choice in domestic banking services will be important enhancements to the competitive framework.  Separately the Deputy should also be aware that in the European Commission&rsquo;s December 2011 approval of the Bank of Ireland revised restructuring plan under state aid rules, the State has committed to undertake a number of market opening measures in order to enhance competition in the Irish banking market.  Measures included amending Section 149 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 in order that price regulation and fees will not be applicable to new entrants in their first three years of commencing business in Ireland and other changes to the Consumer Credit Act 1995 to make it easier for new entrants to provide the option of electronic banking.  The state aid approval also provides for specific market entry opportunities facilitated by Bank of Ireland to ensure access to the domestic market for interested international competitors should such circumstances arise.  As I have previously stated, I would welcome interest that foreign entities may have in entering into or expanding in the Irish market.</p></reply>

The Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and the services include cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, draught proofing, cylinder lagging jacket and CFLs.  The measures are installed as appropriate, following a survey of eligible households, by installers drawn from a panel of Community Based Organisations (CBOs) and private contractors.  These measures were selected for inclusion in the Scheme as they were deemed most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners, and would thereby optimise the use of Exchequer funds while at the same time maximising the number of homes addressed.</p><p>  In certain instances, the home may not be suitable either for the measures funded or the manner in which they are typically achieved.  This is not to say that there are not technical solutions to all scenarios but some may not be eligible to be funded through this scheme.  In the case of low pitch ceilings, as in the home of the applicant, the difficulty of access makes it difficult or impossible to use traditional rolled mineral fibre installation.  Such a situation presents similar technical challenges to the installation of blown fibre solutions, particularly in achieving the proper levels of coverage across the ceiling while maintaining the necessary ventilation provisions. In low pitch ceiling scenarios these are particularly demanding and therefore expensive.  Thus, on the basis of the principles stated earlier, the Warmer Homes Scheme does not currently support such solutions.</p><p>  Queries in relation to individual applications are an operational matter for the SEAI and a dedicated hot line can be reached at 1800 250 204.  In addition, the SEAI has established a specific email address for queries from Oireachtas members, which can be sent to  and will be dealt with promptly.</p></reply>

These are purely matters for RT&Eacute; management.  </p><p>  The borrowing referred to in the question, was integral to RT&Eacute;&rsquo;s funding the &euro;70m capital cost of the new Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) platform, with the remainder coming from its own resources.  This investment will greatly improve the quality of TV reception whilst enabling more channels to be broadcast free-to-air.  It will also release valuable spectrum to be auctioned to the benefit of the Exchequer thereby facilitating faster mobile broadband speeds especially in rural areas.  RT&Eacute; are to be commended on their investment in this regard.  In regard to the mix of funding used, the manner in which RT&Eacute; approached this reflects standard practice in the commercial world and demonstrates prudent financial management, in line with the company&rsquo;s obligations under the legislation.</p><p>  In this regard, RT&Eacute; has a direct obligation under Section 105 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 to ensure that its revenue is at the earliest possible date at least sufficient to meet all sums properly chargeable to its current account and to make suitable provisions with respect to capital expenditure.  I am satisfied that RT&Eacute; management is fully cognisant of this obligation and are taking all the necessary steps to ensure that the company continues to be in compliance with the terms of the provision.  In this regard, I can confirm that I have engaged with the Director-General of RT&Eacute; on a number of occasions since my appointment as Minister and I have made my view clear that a continuing deficit position is not tenable.  I believe that RT&Eacute; management fully concur with this and are taking the remedial action necessary to address the situation and to deliver on the commitment to return to a breakeven position by the end of 2013.</p><p>  In regard to the question of State Aid requirements, I would also like to assure the Deputy that the Broadcaster is fully compliant with State Aid rules and in this regard, I can confirm that the Directorate General for Competition in the E.U. are being kept fully informed of developments in Irish television broadcasting.</p><p>  On the question of the future funding of broadcasting, the Deputy should be aware that Section 124(8) of the Broadcasting Act 2009 charges the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland with carrying out a review of the adequacy or otherwise of the public funding of the Public Service Broadcasters to meet their public service objects.  In addition, Section 158(1) of the Act provides that the Authority shall review the operation, effectiveness and impact of the broadcasting funding scheme.  I look forward to receiving these reviews before the end of the year and they will serve to inform my views on the need for any reform of the public funding of broadcasting.</p></reply>

Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity market is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body.  Since 4 April 2011 prices in the electricity retail market have been fully deregulated and business and domestic customers can as a result avail of competitive offerings from a number of electricity supply companies.  Price setting by electricity suppliers is a commercial and operational matter for the companies concerned.</p><p>  Global gas and oil prices have risen sharply since the start of 2011 driven by events in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan and demand from the emerging economies of China and India.  There are clear indications that international oil and gas prices will rise further over the coming months. </p><p>  The Government is most concerned at the impact of higher electricity prices on residential and commercial consumers.  As indicated above, it is the case that in the main Ireland is at the mercy of international fossil fuel prices which dictate the retail price of electricity.  My focus is on those elements of energy costs over which policy can exercise some control.</p><p>  Total grant funding of &euro;109.267 million has been spent to date under the Better Energy programme on energy efficiency measures in 2011 and 2012.  This includes funding for over 198,000 measures in households under the Better Energy: Homes scheme.  Under, the Better Energy: Warmer Homes Scheme, which provides grant assistance for low income families, &euro;45 million has been specifically allocated to energy poor homes by directly retrofitting through the use of Community-Based Organisations (CBOs), private contractors and a new area-based pilot that is being undertaken this year.  In addition the Government is actively supporting the rollout of renewable resources of electricity which has grown from an estimated 9.3% of electricity consumed in 2007 to an estimated 17.6% in 2011.</p><p>  There are a number of avenues open to consumers to try to mitigate rising on electricity prices, and measures are also in place to assist them.  Accordingly, consumers can shop around to get the best possible price and service deal from suppliers bearing in mind that other suppliers can and do offer competitive prices and products.  Consumers can also take steps to improve the efficiency of their electricity usage which delivers demonstrable savings.  The CER is also working with energy suppliers to ensure that vulnerable customers are protected through, inter alia, the installation of Pay As You Go meters.</p><p>  The long term policy responses for Ireland to combat vulnerability to high and volatile gas prices continue to be increasing the use of renewables, better energy efficiencies and reducing the reliance on gas in the fuel mix.  Implementation of the measures set out in the Government&rsquo;s Affordable Energy Strategy is also key to protecting the interests of vulnerable customers.</p><p>  The Affordable Energy Strategy was published in November 2011 and developed by the Inter-Departmental/Agency Group on Affordable Energy (IDGAE) as part of the Departments commitment in the Programme for Government to help mitigate energy poverty.  The Affordable Energy Strategy provides a framework for building upon the many measures already in place to protect households at risk from the effects of energy poverty, which include the thermal efficiency-based measures delivered through the Better Energy: Warmer Homes programme.</p><p>  There are forty-eight actions identified in the strategy to be implemented over the life-time of the report (3 years).  Five priority measures are identified including a commitment to review the National Fuel Scheme in the context of examining the feasibility of aligning income supports with the energy efficiency and income of the home, the phased introduction of minimal thermal efficiency standards for rental accommodation, ensuring greater access to energy efficiency measures, reforming the eligibility criteria for energy efficiency schemes and the introduction of an area based approach.</p><p>  I have allocated &euro;23.647 million in 2012 to the alleviation of energy poverty which will be disbursed through a combination of community based organisations, private contractors and via an area-based approach.</p></reply>

The purpose of closed periods is to protect ground and surface water bodies, including drinking water sources, by prohibiting the application of fertilisers when such application poses an unacceptable risk to water courses.</p><p>  The closed periods in Ireland were decided following an extensive consultation and were discussed with farming bodies and the European Commission at the time.</p><p>  Good agricultural practice involves the application of fertilisers as early as practicable in the growing season in order to maximise the uptake of nutrients by crops and to minimise pollution risks to water.  The application of fertilisers in the months of November and December is not considered good farming practice and this has been the case long before the Nitrates Regulations came into force in Ireland.</p></reply>

Irish Water will take account of the Local Development Plans and Regional Planning Guidelines in assessing its investment priorities. </p><p>  A phased transition is proposed to ensure continuity of service and the building of a fit for purpose organisation within a reasonable timescale, and it is also proposed that Irish Water will maintain a strong regional and local focus for operational delivery.</p><p>  In the initial phase (following the enacting of primary legislation in 2013), Irish Water will work largely through service level agreements with local authorities, and these arrangements will not end until 2017 at the earliest.  The skills within the Bord G&aacute;is Group will be paired with the experience and commitment to service in local authorities and the specific water and wastewater capabilities and expertise that exist in local government to build the new organisation and ensure its successful establishment and operation.</p><p>  Work is now focused on the finalisation of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning in more detail.  This strategy will provide the platform for dealing with a broad range of implementation issues during the transitional phase, including dealing with matters which cross the boundaries between Irish Water functions in relation to water services and those functions which will remain the responsibility of local authorities.</p></reply>

Earlier in 2012 I allocated a total of &euro;338,360 to Kilkenny County Council for spending on remedial and retrofitting works on a county-at-large basis.

Bodies must initially apply for Certified Borrower status. To date, 17 bodies have applied, 4 have gained Certified Borrower status, 8 applications have been declined, and further information is awaited in respect of the other 5 applicants. Only after obtaining Certified Borrower status can a body make an application for loan finance. A number of such applications have now been processed. </p><p>  All applications, whether for certified borrower status or in respect of loan finance, are subjected to rigorous assessment by the Agency&rsquo;s credit committee.

In determining these rates, the Board of the Agency gives careful consideration to the fluctuating relationship between the rates at which it can borrow and its lending rates. The HFA is required to operate on a break-even basis and continues to provide extremely good value to local authority customers.</p><p>  I am acutely conscious that a considerable number of local authority borrowers are facing difficulties in meeting their mortgage payments. However, local authority borrowers have benefited from very significant easing of mortgage costs in recent years. The effective rate for local authority borrowers is 2.75%. This has resulted in a differential of almost 1.5% between the rate charged to local authority borrowers and the average variable rate available from private lending institutions.</p></reply>

Under the Act, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver. The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the household charge.  The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) administers the household charge system on a shared service/agency basis for all county and city councils. The option to pay by instalments was available by direct debit only where a person had registered their details with the LGMA before 1 March 2012. This deadline was necessary in order to meet banking requirements for direct debit arrangements.</p><p>  The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 places the collection of the charge under the care and management of the local authority concerned and specifically provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge. I am examining the possibility of introducing guidance, similar to that applying to the NPPR, under the care and management provision of the legislation.</p></reply>

Sections of road have been identified where a significant proportion of collisions occurred whereby speed was deemed the primary contributory factor.

An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na utilises these zones in order to direct speed enforcement activity, in a proportionate and targeted manner.</p><p>  I am further informed that safety cameras only operate on sections of road which have a history of collisions occurring where speed was a contributory factor.

In recent years, because of the steep downturn in the property market, it has been difficult to get accurate on property prices.  This uncertainty has led to a lack of investor confidence and has contributed to stagnation in the property market.  The publication of the Register should help to remove some of this uncertainty, restore some confidence in the property market and provide transparency in residential property sale prices.</p><p>  The Register is not intended as a Property Price Index.  The details made available on the register are limited to price, address and date of sale and do not include such details as property size or number of rooms.

That office is an office of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (I.N.I.S.) and it handles all aspects of visa applications including appeals.  In general business visas are processed within two to five working days of receipt and visit visa applications for Chinese nationals within one to three weeks.  This time frame is dependent on all the required documentation being provided with no queries remaining outstanding.  It should also be noted that the approval rate for Irish visa applications lodged in China is in excess of 90%.</p><p>  Guidelines on the visa application process for nationals of China, including details of the required supporting documentation can be found on the website www.embassyofireland.cn.    I would also draw the Deputy's attention the following initiatives which are in operation in the Visa Office in China currently:</p><p>- The Short-stay Visa Waiver Programme, which allows tourists or business people who have lawfully entered the UK, including Northern Ireland, on a valid UK visa to travel on to Ireland without the requirement to obtain an Irish visa.  The Government decided on 12 March to extend the Programme for a further period of four years i.e. to end October 2016, in light, particularly, of the positive response from tourism agencies and operators.  The Visa Waiver Programme covers nationals of a total of sixteen countries, including China, where  it has been a particular success.  For example, I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, that since the introduction of the Programme, 36 new tour operator itineraries to Ireland from China have been established, while existing itineraries have also experienced growth.</p><p>- With effect from 1 August, 2012, a more liberal multi-entry visa regime for business travellers and other visitors was implemented in the Irish Visa Office in Beijing.  The regime allows for the issue of scaled term multi-entry visas of up to three years duration depending on the applicant's previous international visa history.</p><p>- In recognition of the growing number of independent tourists from China, a scheme was introduced in the Beijing Visa Office earlier this year under which independent travellers who had no connection with Ireland could apply for a visa, whereas previously they had to have an invite or be a member of an official Approved Destination Status (ADS) tour.  The requirements for such a visa have been simplified and I am informed that Tourism Ireland has welcomed this initiative.</p><p>- For several years now, the Embassy in Beijing has been operating a scheme for Approved Destination Status (ADS) tourists.  ADS group tourism visas were the main tourist visa obtained by Chinese citizens to travel worldwide - the approval to travel for their citizens must come from the Chinese authorities.  Several measures were introduced to encourage this type of tourist to Ireland resulting in an ADS visa being one of the most straightforward and quickest Irish visa to obtain with processing times being less than three working days normally.  The success of the Visa Waiver Programme has, to a large extent, eliminated the use of ADS visas for travel to Ireland alone.</p><p>  My Department is constantly seeking ways in which the visa system can facilitate increased business and tourist visas from growing markets such as China and, in this regard, meets regularly with tourism and business promotion agencies to discuss initiatives in this area.</p></reply>

A child born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 is entitled to Irish citizenship if they have a British parent or a parent who is entitled to live in Northern Ireland or the Irish State without restriction on their residency.  Other foreign national parents of children born in the island of Ireland on or after 1 January 2005 must prove that they have a genuine link to Ireland.  This will be evidenced by their having three out of the previous four years reckonable residence in the island of Ireland immediately before the birth of the child.  (Time spent in Ireland as an asylum seeker does not constitute reckonable residence under Irish law).  On proof of a genuine link to Ireland their child will be entitled to Irish citizenship and can apply for a certificate of nationality.</p></reply>

As regards existing ground rents, as the Deputy is aware, Part III of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 contains a statutory scheme whereby a person may, at reasonable cost, acquire the fee simple in their dwelling.  To date, over 80,000 applicants have acquired freehold title to their property under this scheme.  In the case of property other than dwellings, the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act 1967 contains provisions which facilitate acquisition of the fee simple subject to agreed terms or on terms set out in an arbitration carried out by the County Registrar.</p><p>  As regards the possibility of future legislation, the position is that abolition of ground rents was considered by the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution in their 2004 Report 'Private Property'.  The Committee took the view that a ground landlord's ground rent is a form of property right which is constitutionally protected and that abolition of such rents would be unconstitutional in the absence of adequate monetary compensation.  The Committee also noted in this regard that where leases were approaching expiry, any further legislation providing for the abolition of ground rents would have to provide for the payment of enhanced compensation by the ground tenant.  In light of the foregoing, I have no immediate plans to introduce further legislation in this area.  Operation of the existing law will, however, be kept under review by my Department.</p></reply>

The Direct Provision system provides asylum seekers with full board accommodation, free of utility or other costs.  Currently, there are 36 asylum accommodation centres in the State accommodating just under 5,000 persons.  Seven of the centres are State owned and the remainder are owned by private companies.  All centres are managed, under contract to RIA, by private companies employing their own staff.  All companies are contractually required to comply with legal requirements in relation to health and safety, food safety and so on.  As is normal, companies have their own management rules and practices and once these do not conflict with RIA requirements, RIA does not seek to interfere.</p><p>  Plainly, how a centre is managed is determined by a number of factors, not least the profile of persons being accommodated and the physical layout of the centre.  Of the current 36 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers i.e. were 'system built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from this original use.  This being the case, a number of centres have developed their own rules which complement and act in tandem with the RIA requirements, as explained below, and these are generally geared towards providing information on the routine in the specific centre concerned.</p><p>  The following RIA-produced documents - all available on its website <i>www.ria.gov.ie</i> - set out the basic requirements which must be satisfied by a contractor:</p><p>(i) The contract itself.  The basic standard provisions of a RIA contract are set out in a sample contained in RIA's 2011 Annual Report which is available on its website.</p><p>(ii) RIA's House Rules and Procedures.  These set out the entitlements and obligations placed on centre management and on residents and, in the event that these are not being met, a complaints procedures to be invoked by either party.  </p><p>(iii) RIA Code of Practice.  This describes the standards of professional practice required of persons working in accommodation centres as they go about their daily work.  The Code ensures that workers know what standards of practice employers, colleagues, service users and the public expect of them.  </p><p>(iv) Child Protection Policy / Garda Vetting.  RIA takes the issue of child protection very seriously and all staff in centres must be Garda vetted and comply with RIA's Children First policy.</p></reply>

Some 721 applications were returned because either the declaration on the application form was unsigned or the appropriate fee was not tendered.  Many of these applications were subsequently resubmitted and at present the Authority has 5,107 applications on hand.</p><p>  Section 99 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides that persons, who were lawfully providing a property service prior to the coming into effect of the new licensing system on 6 July 2012, could continue to provide such property service pending a determination of their licence application by the Authority.  Consequently, before undertaking the detailed examination of the licence applications it was necessary for the Authority to carry out an initial examination to determine which applicants came within the remit of section 99 of the Act.  On completion of this examination all applicants were written to and informed whether or not they were covered by the provisions of section 99.  Of the 5,107 licence applicants, 301 were informed that they could not avail of section 99 as they had not provided sufficient evidence of their having been lawfully providing property services prior to 6 July 2012.</p><p>  All applications have now been input into the database, the application details have been verified and the process of detailed vetting of the applications is underway.  To date it has been necessary to write to over 60% of applicants due to the fact that applications have either been incorrectly completed or relevant documentation has not been supplied.  The reasons why applications have not been accepted are myriad including the failure of applicants to provide: sufficient evidence of qualifications; evidence of being tax compliant; appropriate Accountant's Report; appropriate Professional Indemnity Insurance; Certificate of Incorporation in the case of companies; Business Registration Certificate; Appropriate answers to certain questions relating to criminal convictions, etc.  In a number of instances applicants failed to indicate the licence type being applied for and furnish photographs.  Because it has been necessary to write to so many applicants the licensing process has taken much longer than originally anticipated.  However, to date letters have issued to over 350 applicants informing them of the Authority's intention to grant a licence.  It is hoped to have the process complete in the next 8 to 10 weeks.</p><p>  Great care must be exercised in this, the first year of licensing to ensure that only those who fully meet the new licensing requirements are approved.  As a consequence the process is time consuming.  While it is recognised that this time of change involves more input from the industry, the greater care taken in these initial stages will ensure that in future years the process will be more streamlined and simpler for applicants.</p></reply>

In this regard it should be borne in mind that the technology sector spans a broad range of skills with differing levels of supply and demand.

As the Deputy may be aware, the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 provides for the establishment of a single protection application procedure and a new appeals body.  Work on the details of the Bill is ongoing at my Department pursuant to current Government policy which is committed, under the Programme for National Recovery, to &quot;introduce comprehensive reforms of the immigration, residency and asylum systems, which will include a statutory appeals system and set out rights and obligations in a transparent way&quot;.</p><p>  As I have outlined previously to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality and Defence, several hundred amendments to the Bill are anticipated, the majority of a technical nature.  At the Joint Committee I also expressed the considered view that instead of engaging in an extremely cumbersome process of tabling hundreds of amendments to the 2010 Bill it would be much more efficient to publish a new and enhanced one that would incorporate the anticipated amendments while addressing key outstanding issues several of which have been of previous concern to Members.  This proposition was broadly welcomed by the Joint Committee which I very much appreciate given the protracted history of this piece of legislation.  Work on the Bill will continue therefore, including in cooperation with the Offices of Parliamentary Counsel and of the Attorney General.  It remains my objective under this new approach, and mindful of the competing legislative demands of our EU/IMF/ECB Programme commitments, to be in a position to bring the new Bill to Government for approval and publication later this year.</p><p>  Finally, and not wishing to go into the details of the Report in question, I would point out, for example, that the independence of the appeals procedure has been upheld by the High Court and subsequently in a recent opinion of the Advocate-General of the Court of Justice of the European Union<b></b>(Case C-175/11).</p></reply>

At that time there was approximately 22,000 citizenship applications awaiting decision, approximately 17,000 of which had been awaiting decision for in excess of 6 months with an average waiting time of 26 months.  </p><p>  The series of measures I introduced have resulted in a major improvement in the position with decisions having being made on some 33,000 applications since coming into office.   Over a comparable period, between March 2009 and October 2010 a total of 18,500 cases were decided representing an almost 80% increase in throughput.  Moreover, approximately 4,000 of the 2009 case-load related to ineligible minors that involved minimal processing.   </p><p>  Almost 30,000 of these applications were approved after due process, while around 3,000 were deemed ineligible or were refused because they did not comply with the statutory criteria such as being of good character, lawful residence and so forth. It is important to note that the grant of citizenship is not a right; indeed it is a privilege and is given in accordance with the law.</p><p>  In considering the volume of cases currently in hand a number of factors have to be taken into account including, as detailed above, the volume of cases processed as well as new cases coming on hand. Also to be taken into account is the peaks and troughs of decision making which is linked to the timing of our citizen ceremonies.  Accordingly, there are wide variations in the statistics of cases on hand from one week to the next.  For example, next week will see the 56th, 57th and 58th citizenship ceremonies being held with a further series of ceremonies planned for early December. </p><p>  As the Deputy will appreciate there has been a major improvement on what hitherto had been unacceptable delays in the system.  We are still on course to meet the very ambitious target of processing 70% of all standard non-complex cases within six months of receipt of applications.   I am determined that we achieve that target and go on to build on the excellent progress to date.   Considerable resources continue to be deployed to process applications and huge credit is due to the staff in the area for taking on the challenge. </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that alongside the improvements in processing, in June 2011, I introduced formal citizenship ceremonies for the first time since the foundation of the State. The ceremonies, which are being met with universal approval, allow candidates for citizenship make their declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State and receive their certificate of naturalisation in a meaningful and dignified manner which befits the importance and solemnity of the occasion. I was pleased to note that the Citizenship Division of the Immigration Service was this summer awarded one of the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Public Service Excellence awards of 2012 for their work over the past year and for their enthusiastic embracing of the reforms that have taken place. </p></reply>

This scheme provides work experience placements for interns for a 6 or 9 month period.  The aim is to assist in breaking the cycle where jobseekers are unable to get a job without experience, either as new entrants to the labour market after education or training or as unemployed workers wishing to learn new skills. </p><p>  The Department has already advertised some 40 separate internship opportunities across a range of vocational areas including the legislative area, statistics, procurement, customer relations and general administration.  A total of 60 placements have been made to date. There are currently 35 individuals on placements across the Department. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the Department cannot offer full-time employment at the end of an internship period, as where exceptions to the moratorium on recruitment are permitted, recruitment to the Civil Service is typically governed by a process of open public competition organised under the aegis of the Public Appointments Service. JobBridge does, however, provide significant and in some cases challenging job experience opportunities to persons in need of such opportunities and better prepares them for either re-entry to the jobs market or a change in job direction. </p></reply>

The new rosters are designed to better match the availability of Garda&iacute; with policing demands at national and local level, while also safeguarding the welfare of members. This and other reforming measures seek to maximise the efficiency of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na so that, even with reduced strength, an effective policing service will continue to be delivered across the country.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The Refugee Applications Commissioner refused her a declaration of refugee status.  This decision was subsequently upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  The decision to refuse by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was notified to the person concerned on 27 September, 2004. On 18 January, 2005 the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the person concerned that it was proposed to make a Deportation Order in her case and she was invited to make representations as to why a Deportation Order should not issue. This notification was subsequently re-issued on 16 February 2005.</p><p>  Representations in support of the person concerned were made by her  solicitors by letter dated 3 February, 2005.  Having considered the representations made the Minister signed a Deportation Order on 13 May, 2005.  Having considered further representations, made by letter dated 1 June, 2005, the Deportation Order signed in respect of the person concerned was affirmed on 8 June, 2005. By letter dated the 12 January, 2006 the person concerned made further representations on the basis that she had become the parent of a child born on 1 October, 2005.  Having considered representations the Deportation Order signed in respect of the person concerned was once again affirmed, and this was notified to the person concerned by letter dated 27 June, 2006.</p><p>  On 10 June, 2005, Judicial Review proceedings were lodged in the High Court challenging the Deportation Order made in respect of the person concerned.  These proceedings were heard before the High Court on 8 and 9 May, 2007 and in his judgment of 24<sup></sup>  May, 2007 Mr. Justice Feeney upheld the validity of the deportation order. By letter dated 16 February, 2007 an application was made on behalf of the person concerned for subsidiary protection.  The then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the person concerned that such an application was not validly made and notified the person concerned of this by letter dated 19 February, 2007.</p><p>  Subsequent to the decision of the High Court in <i>Hila v. Minister for Justice,</i>  the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform wrote to the solicitors acting on behalf of the person concerned, by letter dated 5 November, 2007 and informed them that if the person concerned wished to invoke the Minister's discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 she should make representations setting out any new facts or circumstances, relevant to her or to her country of origin which had arisen since the original decision to deport was made. By letter dated 23 November, 2007 solicitors acting on behalf of the person concerned replied to that letter and applied for the discretion to be exercised.  Having considered all representations made, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform decided that there were no grounds which would enable him to exercise his discretion under Regulation 4(2) of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006. On 4 April, 2008 Judicial Review proceedings were lodged in the High Court challenging the refusal decision.  On 3 January, 2011 these proceedings were struck out.</p><p>  The person concerned has three children who were born in the State, a daughter born on 28 April, 2008, another daughter born on 14 October, 2006, and a son born on 1 October, 2005.  Deportation Orders were signed in respect of all three children on 24 November, 2010. On 14 December, 2010 Judicial Review proceedings were lodged in the High Court challenging the Deportation Order made in respect of one of the daughters of the person concerned.  Accordingly, as the matter is <i>sub judice</i>  , I do not propose to comment further.</p><p>   I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Authority was established under the Private Security Services Act 2004 (as amended) and is responsible for the regulation of the private security industry in the State.  The Authority has adopted a phased approach to the licensing of the sector and commenced the licensing of door supervisor and security guard employees in 2007. There are currently in the region of 10,300 door supervisor licences and 21,000 security guard licences in circulation. Some, 4,230 individuals hold licences in both sectors.</p><p>  I am informed by the Authority that the regulations governing door supervisors and security guards require all those working in the sectors, whether employed by a licensed contractor or directly by a business as in-house security personnel, to hold a licence. Licences are backed by a recognised qualification which ensures that all those working in the industry have been trained to a high standard. In addition, all applicants are vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before any licence is issued.   I understand from the Authority that individuals who have resided outside of Ireland for a period of six months or more are also required to provide the Authority with a criminal record certificate from the relevant jurisdiction.</p><p>  The draft regulations to enable the licensing of event security contractors are with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and it is the intention of the Authority to adopt a phased approach to the licensing of the area, with contractors scheduled for licensing in the first instance and the licensing of individuals to follow thereafter. </p></reply>

All accommodation costs, together with the costs of meals, heat, light, laundry and maintenance are paid directly by the State. Asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation also receive a weekly cash allowance which takes account of board and lodgings and other ancillary benefits provided through the direct provision system. Asylum seekers can also apply to Community Welfare Officers for assistance to meet a particular once-off need by way of an exceptional needs payment under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme. Payments under this category cover once-off costs such as back-to-school clothing and footwear.</p><p>  Overall demand for RIA services is declining. At the beginning of 2009, RIA was accommodating an overall number of 7,002 asylum seekers. Currently, it is accommodating just under 5,000 persons, a reduction of almost 29% during this period.  </p><p>  In essence, RIA accommodates all those who make a claim for protection and seek accommodation until such time as they:</p><p>(i) leave voluntarily; (ii) are removed &ndash; either by way of deportation or Dublin II transfer; (iii) are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection; or (iv) are granted leave to remain, either through the process set out in the Immigration Act, 1999 or by way of a special scheme such as the 2005 IBC scheme.   It is not possible to specify exactly how long each person has resided in RIA accommodation.  Protection applicants i.e. asylum seekers or other applicants under the immigration acts are not required to live in RIA accommodation and in many cases, may move in and out of the direct provision system as their circumstances change. </p><p>  On the matter of application processing times and consequent length of time spent in the direct provision system, some cases can take significantly longer to complete owing to, for example, delays arising from medical issues or because of judicial review proceedings. All asylum applications and appeals are processed in accordance with the Refugee Act 1996 and high quality and fair decision-making in all cases continues to be a key priority at all stages of the asylum process.</p><p>  For the sake of completeness, it is necessary to point out that persons who are refused a declaration under section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, enter what is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;leave to remain&rdquo; process which generally has two elements to it: an application for subsidiary protection and further consideration to be given under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. This is separate from the asylum or refugee status determination process. The processing of cases at this point is also complex and extremely resource intensive and there are no quick or easy decisions to make. Given the life changing consequences for the persons involved, these are decisions which must be taken with the most scrupulous care and attention.</p><p>  I have taken steps to speed up the processing of applications, primarily by redeploying staff from the refugee determination bodies. The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010 which I intend to republish in the near future provides for the introduction of a single procedure to determine applications for protection and other reasons to remain in the State. This should substantially simplify and streamline the existing arrangements. This reorganisation of the protection application processing framework will remove the current multi-layered processes and provide applicants with a final decision on their applications in a more straightforward and timely fashion.</p></reply>

The Government intends to publish a further report next March which will set out specific progress on implementation during the second year.</p><p>The current status of implementation of the commitments relating to Defence are set out in the following table.</p><p><table><tr><th><div><b>Commitment</b></div></th><th><div><b>Status</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>The implementation of the Defence Forces Medical Services Review as resources allow</td><td>The recommendations of the PA Consultants Report on the restructuring of the Medical Corps have been designed to meet the demands and needs of the Defence Forces and implementation is progressing.  <br /><br />A competition for the appointment of doctors to the Medical Corps remains open and further applications will be accepted on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately there has been and remains a limited response to this competition and therefore, it is accepted that it will take some time before the current target of 32 doctors in the Defence Forces can be achieved, if indeed it proves possible to reach this figure. <br /><br />Against this background, it has been necessary to identify alternative options for the provision of medical services to the Defence Forces, including the consideration of the outsourcing of some or all Defence Forces domestic medical services. In this regard an integrated model for the provision of the required medical services, involving both the Medical Corps and outsourced service provision is being progressed. A Request for Information (RFI) from prospective providers was issued in June to assist in evaluating options. A total of 15 proposals were received and these are currently being evaluated. </td></tr><tr><td>The initiation of a detailed legal review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross in Ireland to improve its functioning in the light of changing circumstances.</td><td>The review of the basis, structures and governance of the Red Cross in Ireland is in progress.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-09a.1217.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100900060#WRW02300"><p>The negotiations to determine the budget for the Common Agricultural Policy from 2014 to 2020 are part of wider negotiations that will decide the multi-annual financial framework, or MFF, for the EU budget for the period from 2014 to 2020. These negotiations are being conducted under the auspices of the EU General Affairs Council, attended by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Ultimately decisions on the MFF will be taken by EU Heads of State and Government.  A special meeting of the European Council has been scheduled for November 2012 for this purpose.</p><p>  The overriding national priority is to safeguard CAP funding to the maximum extent possible, having regard to the reality that CAP accounts for over 80% of Ireland&rsquo;s total receipts of EU funding, equivalent to about &euro;12 billion over the 2007-2013 period.  This is a whole of Government position. </p><p>  The CAP is the only Heading of the Commission proposal which has been already reduced in real terms in the Commission proposal. There is pressure from some Member States to reduce CAP spending further.  The Irish Government&rsquo;s view is that the amounts proposed are the minimum acceptable and we will strongly resist pressure for further cuts.  </p><p>  In addition to determining the overall CAP budget, these negotiations will determine the mechanisms for distribution of CAP funds between Member States, co-financing rates, capping of payments and greening of the pillar 1 direct payments.</p><p>  The key priority for Ireland is to retain our current levels of funding for both direct payments and for rural development. </p><p>  The current Commission proposals for Pillar 1 direct payments take a pragmatic approach to redistribution and are broadly satisfactory, albeit with a small loss to Ireland. However there is no guarantee that this proposal will be the final outcome, and therefore we will continue to strongly defend our proposed allocation in the negotiations. </p><p>  In addition we have serious concerns in relation to the distribution of rural development (Pillar 2) funds between Member States.  The Commission has yet to table a specific proposal in respect of rural development funding, but the envisaged use of a combination of past performance and objective criteria could reduce our allocation. We are strongly resisting any such reduction. Ireland has said that the distribution of rural development funding between Member States should be based on past performance over the whole period 2007 &ndash; 2013.  We take the view that any further movement from this point should: use the same methodology as the Commission has proposed for Pillar 1, i.e. adjustment of support levels per hectare of potentially eligible area, and   ensure that no Member State with below-average Pillar 2 payments per hectare loses in any redistribution, and no Member state loses under both pillars. </p></reply>

However, I am aware of the importance of improving land mobility and of encouraging greater transfer of land, and of the existing challenges in this regard.  In order to assist meeting the ambitious targets set out in Food Harvest 2020, new taxation measures were introduced in last year&rsquo;s budget aimed at improving land mobility and farm consolidation, and encouraging transfers to younger, more progressive farmers.  Stamp duty on agricultural land was reduced from 6% to 2%.  In addition, half the rate (1%) is now applicable on transfers to close relatives until the end of 2014. This change substantially reduced the stamp duty payable on transfers of farm land by gift or by sale. The measure promotes inter-generational transfer, as the cost of lifetime transfer to transferees who do not qualify for the young trained farmer stamp duty relief has been reduced considerably.</p><p>  Budget 2012 also restructured the retirement relief available on Capital Gains Tax in order to incentivise the earlier transfer of farm assets to the next generation, and to encourage the sale of land by those farmers with no successors. </p><p>  Retirement relief was restructured in order to encourage farmers around the normal retirement age, who have successors, to transfer their land and holdings to young, innovative, ambitious, prospective farmers. This measure encourages an improvement in the age profile of farmers, and should ensure that farmland is put to more productive use.</p><p>  It should be noted that there has been no change to the very important 90% agricultural relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT). This means that farms worth up to &euro;2.5 million will continue to be fully exempt from CAT with regard to transfers to a child.</p></reply>

Eligibility checks must be carried out on 5% of applicants, to verify that the actual area claimed in the application form corresponds to the area farmed and to ensure that any ineligible land/features are deducted. Up to two-thirds of these inspections are carried out in the first instance without a farm visit, as the information is verified using the technique of remote sensing via satellite.</p><p>  The rate of inspection for cross compliance is 1% of applicants to whom the Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) applies. However 3% of farmers must be inspected under the bovine identification and registration requirements, while 3% of sheep/goat owners must be inspected covering 5% of the flock.   </p><p>  In 2010, in an effort to minimise duplication of farm inspections between the two Departments, my Department agreed to carry out some 1,600 nitrates inspections under the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) regulations on behalf of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. This arrangement was retained for both 2011 and 2012.  My Department is committed to ensuring the maximum level of integration of inspections and will continue to review inspection programmes in all areas with the aim of increasing integration where this is a feasible option.</p><p>  In relation to the 2011 Single Payment Scheme and Disadvantaged Areas Scheme (the two main direct payment schemes, with annual expenditure in excess of &euro;1.5bn), a total of 9 farmers, whose payment was less than &euro;1,000, were subject to more than one inspection type. This equates to 0.09% of the total number of farmers in receipt of payments of less than &euro;1,000 under these 2011 schemes.  As payments and inspections processes in respect of the 2012 Schemes are ongoing, it is not possible to provide the information on the current year at this time.</p></reply>

In order to leverage cost savings whilst maintaining the highest level of services to our stakeholders, I have decided to merge my Department&rsquo;s Clonakilty activities in the Clogheen complex. Administrative staff located at Darrara will, on their transfer to Clogheen, take up duties in the Marine Divisions of the Department and their former duties will be absorbed by the existing staff in the Cork city Regional Office.</p><p>  These arrangements will enable the Department to maintain service levels across the county with the result of leaner staffing levels into the future.  It is important to point out that these changes will not negatively impact upon local access and services for local customers and front-line services will be fully maintained and public access for all of the Departments stakeholders will be available at Park Road. The Department vets, inspectors and technical officers will remain in place at Clonakilty to service our clients across all of the schemes that are provided from our Regional Offices. In Cork city, current services will continue as before.</p><p>  The future use of the vacated building at Darrara is a matter for the Office of Public Works  .</p></reply>

The Government has further decided, in relation to Coillte, that a concession for the harvesting rights to Coillte&#8217;s forests will be put forward for possible sale. Coillte Board and management have been actively engaged in recent months with NewERA, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and my Department to examine the financial and other implications of developing the potential of Coillte&#8217;s forest assets.</p><p>  The process is at a preliminary stage and, aside from the valuation of the forestry assets, a number of issues have been identified in relation to the possible harvesting rights concession. These include, <i>inter alia</i>, the possible impact to the timber industry, environmental and social impacts, consequential implications for the company and its human resources, the future extent and nature of Coillte Group&#8217;s liabilities, and the replanting obligation.  These issues each require detailed consideration. I wish to assure the Deputy that these issues and others form part of the ongoing analysis.  As some of the issues identified, and the possible ways in which they may be addressed, have the potential of impacting on investor interest, my preference is to await the outcome of that analysis.</p><p>  As regards the use of the proceeds from any sale of timber harvesting rights, I wish to remind the Deputy that the use to which the proceeds of such asset sales may be put is a matter this is provided for under the EU/IMF Programme. As agreed with the Troika, half of the proceeds will be available to the Government to fund employment enhancing projects of a commercial nature, with the other half, while destined eventually to pay-down debt, also being available in the first instance to constitution a fund to underpin additional lending into Ireland.</p></reply>

Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses. Parents who are in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance are eligible for subvention under the CCS programme.  </p><p>  Parents who consider they are eligible for support under the CCS programme and are seeking childcare support in the current school year should enrol with a participating community childcare service.  The service provider will advise of the procedures to be followed to establish entitlement and the level of  support available under the programme.</p><p>  My Department also implements the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which was introduced in September 2010.  The eligibility criteria under which trainees and students qualify for the programme is determined by F&Aacute;S and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs).  The CETS<b></b>programme provides &#8364;145 towards the weekly cost of full time childcare places to participating childcare services for trainees and students who are deemed qualified by F&Aacute;S or the VEC.    Students on part-time courses are funded on a pro rata basis.    </p><p>  Local City/County Childcare Committees can advise further in relation to these programmes.</p></reply>

The CCS is implemented under the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP).  The NCIP programme succeeded the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP) which was a joint EU/Exchequer funded childcare programme introduced in 2000.</p><p>  The key elements of the EOCP included the provision of capital assistance to community based not-for-profit childcare facilities and the provision of grant assistance towards the staffing costs for community facilities, which were identified as being in areas of significant disadvantage.  The increase in childcare places, which this investment provided for, ensured that parents who were disadvantaged or on low incomes had access to affordable and quality childcare which otherwise they would not have been in a position to avail of. </p><p>  The NCIP, which is Exchequer funded only and which was introduced in 2006, built on the success of the EOCP and continued to support the development and maintenance of community childcare facilities. The CCS provides targeted funding towards disadvantaged parents and in the region of &euro;40 million annually is provided by my Department to support this programme.  </p><p>  As already stated funding is also provided to support the ECCE programme and CETS programme to which all childcare services, both community and commercial, have access.  Almost &euro;200 million is provided annually to support these programmes and in excess of 4,300 childcare services, which includes private and commercial providers, throughout the country are participating.  The capitation provided under these programmes, which is paid to participating services in advance of each school term or commencement of training courses, is a guaranteed source of income and is a very beneficial support for the private childcare sector at this time.</p><p>  The Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining all three childcare support programmes despite the current budgetary situation.  The challenge for my Department at this time is to ensure that childcare services in which considerable funding has been invested are in position to continue to deliver quality services and are accessible to the large number of parents who need to avail on them.</p><p>  Future developments relating to early years care and education including the design of schemes and eligibility of providers, will be considered during the preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy which is currently being developed by my Department.</p></reply>

Funding of some &euro;56.806m is available from my Department in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes throughout the country through a number of schemes.  These include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People&rsquo;s Facilities and Services Fund and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, the European Youth in Action Programme (administered by L&eacute;argas &ndash; the Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce &ndash; the President&rsquo;s Award. </p><p>  These funding schemes support national and local youth work provision and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  To support this significant infrastructure, my Department provides funding for 24.25 (WTE) Youth Officers posts in VECs throughout the country. Youth Officers have an important role in the delivery of the services funded by my Department.  They have a specific function in supporting the implementation of the National Quality Standards Framework (NQSF) for staff-led youth work throughout the country.  Their work includes: providing briefing/familiarisation sessions on the NQSF to youth work services and projects; supporting the establishment of NQSF implementation teams and the development of continuous improvement plans in projects; and undertaking external assessments of projects in implementing the NQSF and providing reports to my Department on projects.</p><p>  Youth Officers will also have an instrumental role in the implementation of the forthcoming National Quality Standards for Local Volunteer-led Youth Groups.</p><p>  Youth Officers assist my Department in administering grant-aid allocations to the local youth services/clubs in their respective areas under Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Special Projects for Youth Scheme, Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, Youth Information Centres and the Local Drug Task Force funding scheme.</p><p>  My Department is developing a new Youth Policy Framework for publication in 2013.  The framework is intended to enhance coordination and delivery of youth services throughout the country. The framework will have a particular focus on further supporting and developing the youth work infrastructure to enhance the collective contribution of Youth Officers, youth organisations, youth services and volunteers to enhance youth services provision.  The Youth Policy Framework will set out the priorities to be achieved for effective and responsive services for young people in the years ahead.</p></reply>

It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and is the safest and most cost effective method of protecting the oral health of the population. </p><p>  Water fluoridation is supported by reputable international authorities including, among others, the World Health Organisation.  There are a number of authoritative international reviews of the the evidence available, the most recent of which was carried out by the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER).  It concluded in 2011 that the available evidence did not support a clear link between fluoride and osteosarcoma and cancer in general.  Since then, a major study from Harvard University 'An Assessment of Bone Fluoride and Osteosarcoma'(Kim et al 2011) has concluded that there is no evidence of a link between fluoride and osteosarcoma.  The results of 'Drinking water fluoridation and osteosarcoma incidence on the island of Ireland' (Comber et al 2011) do not support the hypothesis that osteosarcoma incidence on the the island of Ireland is related to public water fluoridation.</p></reply>

In addition, the IMB, the Custom Services and the Garda&iacute; work within electronic payment processors and others to target the online purchase of illegal and counterfeit medicines.  Under the current legislation banks and credit card companies are obliged to cooperate fully in relation to investigations.  </p><p>  The Deputy may be aware of the recent Operation Pangea V, an international week of action which took place from 25th September to 2nd October 2012 targeting the online sale of counterfeit and illegal medicines.  Operation Pangea annually involves national medicines agencies, international police and customs authorities working closely with electronic payment providers to identify the sale of illegal and counterfeit medicines.  The Operation was supported by companies such as Legitscript, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal and resulted in the shutdown of 18,000 websites worldwide which are linked to illicit online pharmacies.</p></reply>

Approximately 2,200 new cases are diagnosed each year, and it is cause of death in around 950 people each year. Colorectal screening works on two fronts: it provides early detection and therefore earlier and more effective treatment, and it helps to prevent cancer in the first place by detecting pre-cancerous growths such as polyps. It is therefore imperative that the programme commences and continues on a sustainable basis. </p><p>  Plans for the implementation of a national colorectal screening programme are at an advanced stage within the HSE-National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) and the programme will be introduced on a phased basis in quarter four 2012, as stated in the HSE Service Plan 2012.  When fully implemented the programme will offer free screening to men and women aged 55-74 every two years.  As 50% of cancers within this age group are found in people aged 60-69 the programme will begin with this age cohort (a population of approximately 500,000). </p><p>  The screening programme is the first call/ recall screening programme in Ireland to be offered to men as well as women.  Organised population-based call, re-call screening for colorectal cancer is complex and to ensure quality and safety it is imperative that it is introduced in a carefully managed and monitored way to ensure that risks to patients are minimised and best clinical outcomes are maximised.  Over time the phasing of the programme will allow development of colonoscopy capacity to cater for the full 55-74 year old population.</p><p>  The HSE-NCSS and the Special Delivery Unit in my Department have been working together to develop the appropriate capacity in colonoscopy services nationwide to support the introduction, sustainability and growth of the screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the capability of the symptomatic endoscopy service.  The focus is on improving quality and access at all publicly-funded screening colonoscopy units, not just for those referred for colonoscopy as part of the screening programme, but for all men and women who require a colonoscopy or any other diagnostic endoscopic procedure.  This will be achieved by building sufficient capacity in endoscopy services nationwide to sustain the implementation of the national screening programme, while maintaining and enhancing the symptomatic service.</p><p>  Fifteen candidate colonoscopy units have been identified around the country to support the screening programme and these must achieve accreditation in order to provide colonoscopy services on behalf of the programme.    </p></reply>

This standard is in line with the recently published HIQA National Standards for Safer Better Healthcare, which set out the principles for timely and clinically appropriate responses. </p><p>  The NAS and the Irish Ambulance Representative Council (IARC) are currently engaged in discussions, under the Croke Park Agreement, to develop a national agreement on practitioner deployment.The aim is that the right skill mix is available to the right patient in the right place at the right time. The NAS and IARC have agreed a number of measures to date on changes to service delivery. In this context, the NAS has developed a performance improvement plan to provide for a consistent approach to implementation, so that the maximum number of patients will benefit. </p><p>  The Performance Improvement Implementation Plan is progressing across the NAS, against a backdrop of available resources, leading to real improvements in patient care. In relation to advanced paramedics, it identifies the requirements to: re-arrange rosters so that advanced paramedics are not rostered together; ensure that advanced paramedics are not routinely dispatched to lower acuity calls; ensure, where possible, that available advanced paramedic capacity is spread across the roster to provide the maximum cover possible.</p><p>  Advanced paramedic capacity in Limerick City and County is being deployed in accordance with these developments. The HSE recognises the requirement to continue the development of advanced paramedic capacity and, on the basis of current numbers in training, will increase the numbers of advanced paramedics within the NAS by 30% over the next year.</p><p>  The NAS has undergone significant change in order to ensure quality, safety and value for money. In line with other clinical areas, this process is ongoing as clinical needs and standards develop.

Every individual will have a choice of health insurer and will have equal access to a comprehensive range of curative services.   </p><p>  In February, I established an Implementation Group on Universal Health Insurance which will assist in developing detailed implementation plans for universal health insurance and driving implementation of various elements of the health reform programme. </p><p>  In designing the model of care on which universal health insurance will be based, we must ensure that it meets the needs of  Irish citizens and that it achieves the best outcomes for patients.  This requires that we carefully plan and sequence the reform programme and that we give detailed consideration to the most appropriate structures for delivery of different services.  Ultimately, this Government is committed to introducing an Irish model of universal health insurance that best fits the Irish system. </p><p>  It is also important that we look to other countries that have developed health insurance-based funding models and that we build on best international experience.  This is reflected in the membership of the UHI Implementation Group.  The UHI Implementation Group comprises a mix of those with executive responsibilities within our health services and external expertise, including international experts working with the World Health Organisation and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.  In addition, officials in my Department have been examining the experience of health reforms in a range of countries, including the Netherlands and Germany.  This analysis is vital to enhancing our knowledge and informing policy. </p><p>	The reform programme is a complex and major undertaking that requires careful sequencing over a number of years. The Implementation Group will continue in existence throughout the health reform process and will oversee different elements of the reforms as they are being put in place. It is also intended that it will consult widely as part of the reform implementation process.    </p></reply>

The role of the National Office is to oversee the implementation of Reach Out and to coordinate suicide prevention initiatives around the country.  The National Office is advised and guided by an advisory group comprising individuals with considerable knowledge and expertise in the areas of suicide prevention, mental health promotion and bereavement support.  Its work is centred around evidence-based interventions and involves the funding of new research or pilot projects.  I am happy that the advisory group brings an independent voice to the table.  In addition the National Office for Suicide Prevention publishes an Annual Report outlining its activities and work each year so it is fully accountable.  I believe that a commitment to evidence-based programmes and partnerships with a common purpose is what is required to address the issue of suicide and this role is being carried out at present by the National Office.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2012-10-09a.1561.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2012100900060#WRDD01600"><p>Government policy is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. This objective, as reflected in the HSE Service Plan 2012, is realised through various community based services such as Mainstream Home Help, enhanced Home Care Packages, Meals-on-Wheels and Day or Respite Care. These services not only meet the preferred wishes of many vulnerable older people, but also are intended to reduce pressures elsewhere on the wider care system. The demand for these services will continue to increase as the demographics, and complex needs, of older people change.</p><p>  It has long been the case that the HSE has worked in partnership with the Not-for-Profit and Private sectors to augment its valuable services to older people at  local level where, for whatever reason, the Executive is not in a position to do so itself. This may include, for example, where there are  resource limitations locally or in order to ensure care in the evenings or weekends.  The HSE has been developing various operational initiatives to improve nationally its approach to all relevant aspects of its Home Supports services. These include various new guidelines for Home Care, and a new Procurement Framework for approved agencies providing services on its behalf. While on-going developments have been designed to standardise and maximise the use of limited resources in the face of increasing demand, they are also intended to enhance quality, safety and other relevant aspects of service for both providers and care recipients alike.   This has obviously been a challenging year for the health services overall, including maintaining services in line with evolving resource pressures.The overall provision of home support services is therefore regularly reviewed at national and local levels, in the context of client need and resource availability.    </p><p>  Notwithstanding the recently announced reduction in HSE Home Support provision for the remainder of 2012, investment in these services remains significant with expenditure of around &euro;330 million expected for Home Help and Home Care Packages this year.  All measures are being taken by Local Health Offices to ensure that as many people as possible receive a prioritised service, in line with assessed individual needs. The HSE partnership approach, working with both non-profit and private companies, has not changed, and there is no concerted effort to privatise this service.</p></reply>

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies - mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p><p>  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU is continuing to support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.</p></reply>

It should be noted that the Disability Act does not create an office which exists independently of the person who holds office and, accordingly, the ODAO is not a corporate body.  Since 2007, the ODAO has successfully supported the DAO in providing the appeals service envisaged under the Disability Act.  From 2007 staff from the Department of Health were assigned to the ODAO to assist the DAO in the performance of her functions.</p><p>  Following the decision in October 2008 to defer further roll-out of Part 2 of the Disability Act for other cohorts, it became apparent that the ODAO did not have the volume of work originally envisaged and by 2011 there was an insufficient quantum of work to justify a full-time DAO position.  The former Disability Appeals Officer resigned her position with effect from 31/12/2011 and my Department has been in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the filling of this post.  As an interim measure, a Principal Officer on my Department&rsquo;s staff has been designated to discharge the duties of the DAO and is independent in the performance of this function.  This is a temporary measure only and a longer term arrangement will be put in place as soon as possible.</p><p>  The provisions for parents wishing to make an appeal have not changed and appeals will continue to be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Disability Act.</p></reply>

The outcome of the negotiations with the consultant representative bodies is that detailed proposals have been agreed between the parties.  Amongst the key provisions of this agreement are: Consultants' co-operation with measures to improve patient flow through the hospital system with the potential to deliver a saving of 220,000 bed days per annum; Consultants' availability for rostering for any five days out of seven as opposed to weekdays as at present; Rostering of consultants where required on a 16/7 (8 a.m. to midnight) or 24/7 basis in services where this is required; Clinical Directors will have a much strengthened management role in respect of consultants; Consultants commit to expeditious processing and signing of claims for submission to private health insurers; More cost-effective arrangements for funding of continuing medical education.</p><p>  These flexibilities are centred on enhancing productivity and efficiency on an ongoing basis and on maximising the availability of consultants, as key clinical decision makers.  A range of other measures is being pursued to address the HSE's budgetary issues.  Separate from the negotiations with the consultant representative organisations, I have announced that new consultants will be appointed at a significantly reduced rate, involving a 30% reduction in salary for future appointees.  The relevant pay scales have been issued to the HSE.</p><p>  I believe that the proposals which have been agreed between the parties, when implemented, will allow for very significant reforms in how health services are delivered and ultimately will lead to improved outcomes for users of the services. Health service management is now proceeding with implementation in the coming weeks, having regard to the relevant provisions in the Public Sector Agreement.</p></reply>

An assessment of deprivation &#8211; The Deprivation Index for the catchment population of the centre; 2. The service priority identified by each Integrated Service Area / Local Health Office; 3. An Accommodation Assessment which assessed accommodation available for the primary care team within the catchment area, the quality of the accommodation, and whether or not the accommodation was spread over more than one building.</p><p>  Other factors were considered when selecting centres for inclusion in the PPP list.  New criteria were added; it was evident, for example, that consideration needed to be given to Existing health facilities; Pressures on services, particularly acute services; GP cooperation, GP to population ratio, and cost effective GP buy-in; Implementability of a PPP (size, site and scale) and Funding options including lease or HSE build.</p><p>  35 potential locations for the PPP programme were identified.

This Programme is being implemented nationally over the period 2012 to 2015 to improve the provision of Outpatient Services to patients in acute hospitals. The programme will be delivered in a phased manner and a series of Technical Guidance documents will issue to all hospitals covering amongst others (a) Governance and Accountability structures (b) the Management of Referrals (c) the Management of Waiting Lists, Booking and Scheduling (d) the Management and Delivery of Outpatient Clinics (e) the Management of DNAs (f) Clinical Outcome Management and (g) Discharging Patients from Outpatient Services. The first Technical Guidance Document issued on August 20th, 2012, with the key focus on putting governance and accountability structures in place, minimising risk and beginning the process of making robust the manner in which patient referrals are handled and triaged. This document also sets a requirement of a minimum of 6 weeks notification of leave for all outpatient staff.</p><p>With regard to the specific question regarding DNA numbers, Table 1 sets out a yearly sum of patients who missed scheduled appointments (did not attend) from 2008 to 2010, along with those who attended and total number of appointments booked (supplied by the HSE Business Intelligence Unit). The DNA rate is calculated by taking the number of missed appointments (DNAs) as a percentage of the total number of attendances and missed appointments combined. While hospitals returned activity, including DNA data across 2011, this data was not compiled / processed by BIU due to the roll out of the Outpatient Data Quality Programme.</p><p><b>Table 1.

In 2010, almost 600,000 appointments were missed by patients on hospital waiting lists.  Current outpatient waiting lists do not exceed 400,000 patients.  It is clear, therefore, that the already limited capacity for the system to attend to all patients on the waiting list in a timely manner is being impacted further by these missed (and therefore wasted) appointment slots which prevents this slot being utilised by another patient still waiting for his/her appointment.</p><p>I am determined to do all that is possible to minimise this waste and reduce waiting lists.  If a patient finds they cannot attend the appointment they have been  given I would appeal to all such patients to inform the clinic concerned as soon as they know they cannot attend.</p></reply>

Therefore your question has been  referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p><p><i>The following information was provided under Standing Order 40A</i></p><p>I should point out that Rowlagh/North Clondalkin was never included in a Capital Plan and was not, indeed, included on the 2012 Capital Plan submitted to the Department.  Approval has recently issued for the 2012 Plan and details will be posted on the HSE's website as soon as is practicable.</p><p>  It is understood that the Deputy, in asserting that a PCC was to be delivered in Rowlagh by way of the HSE's capital programme may be referring to lists reported in the media.  It is important to state that these lists related to work that was ongoing; that they were work in progress.  The prioritisation exercise was a dynamic process, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances, including the feasibility of implementation.</p><p>  An assessment/evaluation of each proposed primary care centre location was undertaken with the infrastructural requirement evaluated under three headings: 1) accommodation assessment; 2) service priority; and 3) deprivation index.  The selection of a delivery mechanism was not, however, solely dependent on the resultant priority or ranking.  The delivery mechanism selected for each location was based on suitability and the availability of funding (insofar as it is known at any point in time). The following considerations were taken into account:</p><p>- agreements for lease in place - where there were good prospects of the leased centre being delivered - these locations remained as lease strategy;</p><p>- The size of the centre - the larger centres are more attractive to PPP bidders;</p><p>- Extensions to existing facilities or refurbishment of existing buildings are not suitable projects for PPP.</p><p>  The delivery method for a potential PCC in Rowlagh/North Clondalkin changed in the lists reported in the media and published by the Department as part of the Government's Infrastructure Stimulus Package.  This change was on the advice of the Head of Estates in the HSE as PPP was considered to be the method by which progress in this development could potentially commence quickest.  However, as mentioned above, the method and timescale for delivery of PCCs is dependent on a number of factors and the list will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary.</p></reply>

The HSE's Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) maintains a record of prescriptions dispensed under the Community Drugs Schemes.  This data does not record the age of the person for whom the prescription was reimbursed nor the condition for which the medicine was prescribed.  The PCRS is collating data on the number of prescriptions for these medicines dispensed under the Community Drugs Schemes in 2011 and it will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is received.</p><p>  In the approved prescribing information, it is stated that the drugs Ritalin and Prozac can be licensed to be prescribed for the indications set out as follows.  Prozac (fluoxetine) is indicated in children and adolescents aged 8 years and above for moderate to severe major depressive episode, if depression is unresponsive to psychological therapy after 4&ndash;6 sessions.  Fluoxetine should be offered to a child or young person with moderate to severe depression only in combination with a concurrent psychological therapy.  In children and adolescents aged 8 years and above treatment should be initiated and monitored under specialist supervision.  For paediatric patients who respond to treatment, the need for continued treatment after 6 months should be reviewed. If no clinical benefit is achieved within 9 weeks, treatment should be reconsidered.</p><p>  Ritalin (methylphenidate) is indicated as part of a comprehensive treatment programme for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children aged 6 years of age and over when remedial measures alone prove insufficient.  The prescribing information sets out specific criteria for diagnosis.  Treatment must be initiated under the supervision of a specialist in childhood and/or adolescent behavioural disorders.  Methylphenidate treatment is not indicated in all children with ADHD and the decision to use the drug must be based on a very thorough assessment of the severity and chronicity of the child&rsquo;s symptoms in relation to the child&rsquo;s age.  The clinical indications also address the issue of long term (more than 12 months) use in children and adolescents, pre-treatment screening and on-going monitoring.  In addition, methylphenidate is tightly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs legislation in recognition of its potential for abuse.  These controls include that prescriptions must be handwritten, must be retained by the pharmacist who dispenses it and no instalment may be supplied later than two months after the date of the prescription.</p></reply>

The women concerned must meet the carefully established medical and other criteria set out in the Memorandum.  Apart from this Scheme, the Clinical Indemnity Scheme does not provide indemnity to health care professionals who are providing private services in the community (i.e. those who are not providing services on behalf of the HSE).  Healthcare professionals operating in a private capacity must purchase indemnity cover from commercial insurers and I have no plans to extend the Clinical Indemnity Scheme to these healthcare professionals.

Almost all companies in the State are regulated or licensed by the State or a State agency or body and this fact does not confer liability on the State for the debts incurred by the companies.</p></reply>
