As of 22nd January 2017, the HSE advises that there are 128 acute beds closed, with 20 closed owing to infection prevention and control, 3 for refurbishment, and 105 due to staffing constraints.  </p>  <p>  In order to enable the reopening of acute beds, recruitment of additional nurses, non-consultant hospital doctors and consultants is ongoing.  By the end of November 2016, an additional 118 consultants, 267 hospital doctors and 466 nurses were employed in our health services, in comparison with November 2015.  Also, a recruitment fair for nurses was held over the Christmas holiday period.  The HSE reports that, since early January, an additional 57 nurses have taken up employment in the acute hospital sector. </p>  <p>  Further, to increase acute bed capacity under the Winter Initiative, 98 beds additional beds are being opened.  Of these, 57 acute beds and 18 step-down beds have already opened, with the remaining 23 to open across three hospitals shortly. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a national bed capacity review, which will be undertaken this year.  In addition to acute bed capacity, this review will examine capacity in the primary and community care sectors, as the availability of non-acute beds and services can mitigate the need for acute hospital admission, or facilitate earlier discharge.  The review will also consider how reforms to the model of care will impact on future capacity requirements.</p></reply>

Along with other member states, Ireland's Health Products Regulatory Authority will actively participate in the assessment of this application.  The European Medicines Agency assessment process generally takes around one year. </p>  <p>  Should Nusinersen receive European marketing authorisation, the manufacturer would then be open to make an application to the HSE to have the product reimbursed under the community drug schemes.</p>  <p>  The HSE assessment process is undertaken within the 180 day timeline as set out in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013.  This Act allows for a temporary suspension of the timeline where companies are required to provide additional data.  The assessment process requires the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics to conduct a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of the treatment.  Once this assessment is completed, a summary report will be published on the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics website. </p>  <p>  The HSE then examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision to reimburse the drug, including the assessment by the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics.</p>  <p>  While the authorisation process is on-going early access to this medicine has been granted to two Irish families.  I understand that following an application from a consultant paediatric neurologist at Temple Street hospital, the company has extended their early access programme to two of his patients with SMA Type 1.  The patients' families have been informed.</p></reply>

For example, the HSE has advised that to the end of September, there was a sustained increase in referrals for outpatient appointments, each month in the order of 10%, in comparison with the same period in 2015.</p>  <p>  In November, the HSE launched the Strategy for the design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.  It seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services by enhancing patient referral pathways and utilising technology to enable better planning.  In the context of rolling out this Strategy, the HSE is currently developing an Outpatient Waiting List Action Plan for 2017.  The plan will focus on ensuring that no patient is waiting more than 15 months on this list by the end of October 2017. </p>  <p>  In relation specifically to Beaumont Hospital which has a high number of patients waiting 18 months or more for an outpatient appointment, the RCSI Hospital Group is currently finalising its Operational Plan for 2017.  This Plan will set out the specific actions to be implemented this year to address waiting lists, including outpatient waiting lists.  These specific actions will form part of the HSE&rsquo;s Outpatient Waiting List Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  I expect to make known the details of this plan in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Discussions between the INMO, SIPTU, my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE have been ongoing over the past week and are continuing.</p>  <p>  Issues relating to staffing, recruitment and retention of nursing and midwifery staff are being considered.  The HSE, Department of Health and Department of Public Expenditure and Reform supplied a joint proposal document setting out a number of specific measures to attract and retain nursing staff, in addition to a funded workforce plan. </p>  <p>  As part of the engagement, management are committed to maximising the number of additional nursing posts that can be provided in 2017 within the funding made available in the 2017 Estimates.  Management is also committed to addressing recruitment and retention issues, while recognising that remuneration, including the global competitiveness of nursing salaries and allowances, is subject to a process under the auspices of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-01a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020100074#WRA01800"><p>The State Claims Agency which manages clinical negligence claims against consultants, including maternity claims occurring on or after 1st February 2004, on behalf of the State has advised me that the growth in maternity-related claims against consultants from 2006 onwards is in line with the actuarial predictions made by the Agency.  It has also advised that there are three complicating factors that have impacted on the payments of damages figures. </p>  <p>  Firstly, maternity-related cases involving infants, including cerebal palsy cases, often involve timelines of several years from the date of incident to the date of claim and ultimate settlement.  This, therefore, greatly complicates the payments of damages picture as several claims arising from payment of damages in any particular year invariably relate to prior years.</p>  <p>  Secondly, thirteen cerebal palsy cases in which Periodic Payment Orders (PPOs) were agreed between 2010 and 2013 were returned to Court on subsequent returnable Court dates.  This means that there is double counting of payments of damages in these years. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Symphysiotomy litigation has also had an effect on the payments of damages picture even though events giving rise to these cases occurred decades earlier.</p>  <p>  There does not appear to be any direct evidence linking staff and resource levels to the payment of damages in the period referred to by the Deputy.  The number of cases arising for payment of damages in the period 2007 to 2015 is very much in line with the State Claims Agency's actuarial model which indicated that the payment of damages over these years would continue to increase over these years, plateauing in or about 2020.</p></reply>

Every hospital in that Group, large and small, has a vital role to play within the Group, with smaller hospitals managing routine, urgent or planned care locally and more complex care managed in the larger hospitals.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Hospital Group is engaged in a programme of re-design work to further integrate and enhance the role of Navan hospital within the Group and to ensure that it will provide more services safely and appropriately.  A key development has been efforts to promote better integration between the Mater and Navan hospitals, in relation to day surgical activity in Navan, with surgeons from the Mater carrying out surgery in Navan.  Recent capital investments include upgrade of general theatres and the Sterile Services Unit and refurbishment of the Emergency Department.</p>  <p>  The Hospital Redesign Working Group includes representation from local GPs, the National Ambulance Service, the Mater and Navan Hospitals and from the Ireland East Hospital Group.  It is intended that the Hospital Group will continue to engage closely with all interested parties to ensure that the needs of patients, staff, the local and wider community are addressed.</p>  <p>  I can  assure the Deputy that there are no immediate plans to change Emergency Department services at Navan.  Any proposed changes to Emergency Department services will only  take place after stakeholder consultation in the context of overall service reorganisation in the Hospital Group and will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner.</p></reply>

However, as I have made clear, before any changes are made to how a service is delivered, I want to establish how services are improved for the patients using that service.  Therefore, the implications of ceasing primary PCI services at UHW will be addressed by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access on a 24/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  The review is expected to be completed by the end of July 2017.</p>  <p>  I should also mention that while Dr Herity found that the needs of the effective catchment population of UHW can be accommodated in a single cath lab, he recommended increased investment in cardiology services at the hospital.  I am therefore pleased to confirm that an additional &euro;5m funding has been provided to UHW in 2017 which will enable the hospital to provide 2 additional cath lab sessions (8 hours) per week.   The UHW cath lab will now be funded to provide 12 sessions  i.e. 48 hours activity per week. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that I have recently written to the HSE Director General requesting that consideration be given to a targeted Cardiology Waiting List initiative.  Such an initiative would, I envisage, incorporate a range of measures including the sharing of facilities and resources within and between Hospital Groups, the use of any appropriate facilities in the private hospital sector, as well as the deployment of a mobile cath lab.  I look forward to receiving the Director General's proposals in this regard.</p></reply>

To deal with this increased demand, the Health Service Executive (HSE) launched the &quot;Winter Initiative Plan 2016 - 2017&quot;, in September 2016, which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness.  On 5th of January, in response to significant pressures in our EDs in the New Year, a series of enhanced measures were added to this initiative.</p><p>A key target of this Initiative is to reduce delayed discharges nationally in order to ensure that patients who have been waiting in acute hospitals, including those people who require neuro-rehabilitation services, are getting the support they need to go home or to an alternative suitable community setting which meets their needs.  Since the start of the Initiative, delayed discharges have reduced nationally from a high of 659 earlier in 2016 to 469, as of 24th of January.  The data available would indicate that cases relating to neuro-rehabilitation services are a relatively small proportion of the overall total.</p><p>In addition, the Initiative has delivered 75 additional acute beds opened in the Mercy Hospital Cork, Galway, the Mater, Beaumont and Mullingar.  Over 3,900 patients have availed of aids and appliances, over 780 additional homecare packages have been made available and 410 additional transitional care beds have been approved since early October, enabling patients to be discharged from hospital sooner.</p><p>I wish to assure the Deputy that my colleague, Minister Harris, and my Department, meet every week with senior officials from the HSE, including the Director General, to monitor progress on the Winter Initiative and ED Performance.</p><p>With regard to neuro-rehabilitation services, the Programme for Partnership Government includes a commitment to publish a &quot;plan for advancing neuro-rehabilitation services in the community.&quot;  The HSE's National Service Plan 2017 contains a priority to finalise and progress implementation of the framework for the Neuro-rehabilitation Strategy.  A National Steering Group, chaired by the Head of the Health Service Executive's (HSE's) Disability Reform Team, has completed an implementation framework in respect of the recommendations from the <i>&quot;National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2011&quot;</i>.  The Group is currently considering feedback on the framework, which was circulated to wider stakeholder interest groups.  The National Service Plan also contains a priority action to establish an innovative pilot day service aimed at supporting people with severe acquired brain injuries, which is being explored by the HSE.</p><p>The Deputy may be aware of the new development of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which will deliver a 120 bed ward block, including support therapies to paediatrics, acquired brain injury wards, a hydrotherapy unit and a sports hall.  Planning permission is already in place and it is expected that tenders from contractors for the main works will be returned in February, 2017.</p></reply>

A Programme Manager has been appointed to oversee the Clinical Programme.  In addition, a Clinical Lead has been identified at interview and will be seconded pending discussions with the local Addictions Service.</p>  <p>  The Primary Care Division has already appointed a National Clinical Lead for the Addiction Services to improve its response to drug and alcohol abuse at primary care level and this Clinical Lead will work with the Mental Health Clinical Lead to develop a programme for those with a dual diagnosis.</p>  <p>  The aim of this Programme is to develop a standardised evidence-based approach to the identification, assessment and treatment of comorbid mental illness and substance misuse.  These include increasing awareness of the frequent coexistence of mental illness and substance misuse; ensuring there is a clear clinical pathway for management of people with such a dual diagnosis including when they present to Emergency Departments; ensuring a standardised service is provided throughout the country; and ensuring adolescents are also included within the scope of this Clinical Programme.</p>  <p>  An integral part of the Dual Diagnosis Programme will be to devise a model of care that will ensure that all adolescents and adults suspected of having a moderate to severe mental illness coexisting with significant substance misuse have access to a timely mental health service delivered on a regional basis.  The service will be provided in an integrated manner across the Primary Care Division and the Mental Health Service.  There will also be close working relationships with the relevant specialities in Acute Hospitals to deal with any medical comorbidities that may occur, particularly in those with alcohol misuse.</p></reply>

Peer Support Workers are people who have lived experience of mental distress and recovery.  The Peer Support Worker role will use expertise gained through lived experience to promote recovery, share information to promote choice, self-determination and opportunities for connection with local communities.  In addition to working with other mental health multidisciplinary professionals, it is envisaged that the Peer Support Worker will work alongside an agreed number of service users on a one to one and/or group basis.</p>  <p>  Following a national competitive process for all HSE Mental Health Service areas, an initial funding allocation to develop the national Peer Support Initiative was allocated as part of a pilot initiative to a small number of Multidisciplinary Teams in the Carlow/Kilkenny/South Tipperary area.  The pilot initiative is set to commence in early 2017.  The pilot sites will be evaluated after a defined period of time and following this, it is anticipated that the Peer Support Worker will be developed (subject to additional resources) across the extended catchment area.</p>  <p>  As yet, Peer Support Workers are not in place.  They have been selected with training due to start on 20th February 2017.  Plans for evaluations are in process but not yet completed.  The Mental Health Engagement Office for the Division is leading on this initiative and is collaborating with all stakeholders to progress plans for this evaluation.</p>  <p>  Additionally, a commitment to Peer Support is outlined in the 2017 HSE National Service Plan, with a stated aim of recruitment and training of 20 whole time equivalent (WTE) peer support workers.</p></reply>

In this regard, the newly-appointed Programme Director has advised that clinical guidance on routine 20 week anomaly scans will be developed as a priority.</p>  <p>  In the interim, the Programme will continue to work with the six hospital groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.

In addition, early January 2017 saw continued significant pressure on our EDs due to high demand, increased incidence of flu mainly affecting older people, as well as on-going bed capacity constraints due to staff shortages.</p>  <p>  In September 2016, the HSE launched the &lsquo;Winter Initiative Plan 2016-2017&rsquo; which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness and to assist hospitals to deal with increased demand.  In January 2017, in response to significant pressures in our EDs in the early New Year, a series of enhanced measures were added to this Initiative.</p>  <p>  So far, the Initiative has delivered 75 newly-opened additional beds.  Also, as of 24 January, delayed discharges have reduced nationally to 469, freeing up hospitals beds to alleviate ED pressures.  In addition under the Initiative, since October: over 3,900 patients have availed of aids and appliances; over 780 additional homecare packages and 410 additional transitional care beds have been provided, enabling patients to be discharged from hospital sooner.  Along with my Department, every week, I meet with senior officials from the HSE, including the Director General, to monitor progress on the Winter Initiative and ED Performance.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific sites identified in this composite PQ response, I can confirm that both Cork University Hospital and the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore have been identified as focus sites under the Winter Initiative experiencing the greatest challenges in terms of ED pressures, and consequently needing specific support measures in order to be able to respond more effectively to expected surges in demand for emergency care over the busy winter period.  Under the Initiative, 18 new step-down beds have opened in the Mercy University Hospital Cork, and the Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore will also receive 12 new acute beds, which are expected to open by mid-February.</p>  <p>  While all hospitals have experienced ED pressures this winter and increased demand for ED services, Sligo University Hospital, Kerry General Hospital and Mayo University Hospital have been performing better than the national average in terms of patient experience times and trolley numbers.  Under the current HSE Service Plan 2017, additional funding is provided to facilitate the opening of the new medical assessment unit at the the Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise.  The performance of all of these hospitals is monitored on a daily basis by the HSE&rsquo;s Special Delivery Unit and support is given as needed to facilitate alleviating ED pressures.</p></reply>

In order to respond to surges in ED demand, under the Framework, hospital managers may, in consultation with the relevant clinical leads, review and cancel non-urgent planned electives, where appropriate.  This allows both beds and staff to be redeployed to alleviate pressure in the ED.</p>  <p>  The HSE intends to undertake a review of the Escalation Framework in the coming months to ensure its effectiveness.  It is essential that hospitals continue to improve how they manage, and balance, the demand for emergency care with the planning of elective procedures, to minimise the impact on patients.</p>  <p>  In addition, it is important that the HSE continues to improve its processes to minimise the number of sessions lost when patients cancel or do not attend for their procedures.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

Controlling the substances in the Act was part one of a two-step process and Regulations and various Orders are also required to allow legitimate users (e.g. patients with a prescription, health professionals) to possess the substances.</p>  <p>  Drafting of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations and Orders is complex and technical in nature and involved consultation with a number of State Agencies.  However, since Autumn 2016 significant resources in the Medicines, Controlled Drugs and Pharmacy Unit within the Department have had to be allocated to drafting of the Misuse of Drugs (Supervised Injecting Facilities) Bill and also dealing with various issues in relation to the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes.</p>  <p>  In December 2016, the Early Warning Emerging Trends Group, of which the Department of Justice is a member, were updated on the progress in relation to the Regulations.</p>  <p>  Once the Regulations are finalised, under the Technical Standards Directive, Member States are required to inform the Commission of any new regulations or standards which may create a barrier to the free movement of goods.  Since these draft Regulations have the potential to affect trade, in particular because of the introduction of a requirement for import licences, they must be notified to the EU whilst they are in draft and before they are adopted in national law.</p>  <p>  Notified regulations are usually subject to a 3-month standstill period - to enable the Commission and the other Member States to examine the notified text and to respond appropriately.  The Department intends to invoke an urgency procedure which can shorten the notification period to 10 days as the matter is considered to be related to the protection of public health or safety.  If the Commission does not raise any objections the Regulations will be in order to be signed.</p></reply>

To date under this initiative 78 patients have been reviewed, 54 have been treated, and 4 have received appointments for treatment in February.</p>  <p>  The construction of a new orthopaedic theatre in Crumlin is complete and will provide capacity for additional scoliosis activity in 2017.  However, the use of this theatre is dependent on the recruitment of additional theatre nurses.  The Children's Hospital Group is exhausting every recruitment and retention avenue available to them, including international recruitment, to support the opening of the new theatre.</p>  <p>  I have met with a number of scoliosis advocacy groups to discuss their concerns and the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group has begun a process of engagement with advocacy groups on developing a partnership approach to the design and planning of services for children with scoliosis.  Therefore, an independent clinical review of scoliosis services is not required at this time.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plan for inpatient/daycase procedures to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October.  My Department will continue to work with the HSE and the relevant hospitals in this context to ensure improvements in access to spinal surgery.</p></reply>

Anomaly scans are currently available in the following Hospital Groups:</p><p>-<b>Ireland East Hospital Group</b><b>- </b>The National Maternity Hospital</p><p>-<b>Dublin Midlands Hospital Group</b>- The Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital</p><p>-<b>RCSI Hospital Group</b><b>- </b>The Rotunda Hospital</p><p>-<b>Saolta Hospital Group</b><b>- </b>University Hospital Galway</p><p>-<b>South/South West Hospital Group</b><b>- </b>Cork University Maternity Hospital</p><p>University Maternity Hospital Limerick offers two routine scans during pregnancy (at booking and at 31-32 weeks).  Additional anomaly scans at 20-22 weeks are offered if clinically indicated.</p><p>The hospitals/maternity units currently providing anomaly scans accept referrals from other maternity units, if requested.  This occurs where the medical team in the referring maternity unit consider that an anomaly scan is clinically indicated.</p><p>The issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the newly established HSE National Women and Infant&rsquo;s Health Programme (NWIHP).  A Programme Director was seconded into position on the 3<sup>rd</sup>January last.  A Clinical Director has recently been appointed and takes up position on the 1<sup>st</sup>March 2017.  An early priority for the Programme will be to develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans at 20 weeks.  In the meantime, the NWIHP will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability.</p><p>One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultra-sonographers.  In this context it is expected that the establishment of maternity networks across hospital groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each hospital group can access anomaly scans.</p><p>In relation to the query concerning the number of pregnant women who have been offered or provided with an anomaly scan, as this is an operational matter, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly.</p></reply>

However, the issue of pricing and reimbursement of medicines and patient access to affordable medicines has been addressed at European level.  </p>  <p>  In June 2016 the EU Council adopted conclusions on strengthening the balance in the pharmaceutical systems in the EU and its Member States.  Those conclusions invited Member States to explore opportunities for cooperation on pricing and reimbursement of medicines and to identify areas for cooperation which could contribute to higher affordability and better access to medicines.  I have indicated my support for these measures and I welcome the opportunity for Member States to cooperate by sharing information so that we can achieve affordable and sustainable access to medicines.</p>  <p>  I and my officials have been actively engaged with our international colleagues on the issue of drug pricing.  As the Deputy will be aware I have engaged with the Health Ministers in England, Scotland, Canada and Australia regarding the pricing of the medicine Orkambi, and I have also spoken with the Dutch Health Minister on that issue.  Collaboration on this issue is now being progressed at official level and I will also be meeting with Ms Shona Robison MSP, Health Minister for Scotland later this month to discuss Orkambi.  </p>  <p>  On the cost of new medicines generally, I used the opportunity at the second Round Table meeting for European Health Ministers and CEO&rsquo;s/Heads of Europe-based pharmaceutical companies in Portugal last December and the recent OECD meeting in January to engage with Ministers from other countries on how to address the challenge of securing access to new medicines for citizens at an affordable price.</p>  <p>  At the OECD meeting all Ministers agreed that they faced similar challenges and that international collaboration should be explored to enable patients to benefit from these new medicines. I intend to follow up further with the OECD and I am pleased that they are examining this very important issue.</p></reply>

This response on the digital challenge for waiting lists includes an overview of innovations and suggested approaches from over 49 suppliers, some of which have deployed successfully in other countries. The HSE has also reviewed a number of international models which will continue to be sources of information and guidance to ensure the project is well designed and delivered.  The HSE has been advised to progress this issue during 2017, in conjunction with relevant business units. </p>  <p>  The HSE is of the view that significant progress could be achieved from investing around &euro;1.0m in technology supports. Exact expenditure would only be known following clarity on requirements, developing a business case and following the necessary public procurements. </p>  <p>  The success of any digital solutions is predicated on high quality data flowing through the health system. The completion of the national rollout of electronic referrals (eReferrals) and its continued growth, will provide a solid data source and foundation for managing the waiting lists at individual hospital level. Also, the rollout of the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) commencing in 2017, will be important in facilitating the management of national or hospital group waiting lists, as the IHI will support the identification of patients who may be on several waiting lists for the same condition. </p></reply>

While there are significant challenges at present in recruiting consultants, nurses and midwives and doctors, due primarily to worldwide shortages and international competition, progress has been made in recent years in growing the consultant and NCHD workforce in particular.</p>  <p>  Since the establishment of the HSE, the number of consultants has increased from 1,905 in December 2004 to 2,861 Whole Time Equivalents at the end of 2016.  There are some specialties in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill. Shortages in specialties such as emergency medicine, anaesthesia and psychiatry are a worldwide phenomenon and not specific to the Irish health services. The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly in the past decade, reflecting service demands and ongoing efforts to achieve full compliance with the requirements of the European Working Time Directive. From December 2006 to December 2016 the number increased from 4,679 to 6,060, an increase of 1,381 Whole Time Equivalents. </p>  <p>  There are particular difficulties recruiting nurses and midwives at present, notwithstanding an increase of 1,650 Whole Time Equivalents between December 2013 and December 2016.

Last year saw the launch of the first Action Plan for Education by the Department of Education.  This included a section on Mental Health and Wellbeing.  The aims in this section were set to roll out a national programme to support the implementation of Wellbeing Guidelines to all primary and post-primary schools; to implement Wellbeing at Junior Cycle; and to publish the 2015 Lifeskills survey, providing information on how schools cater for the wellbeing of their students.  This plan outlines hundreds of actions and sub-actions to be implemented across 2016-2019, with timelines and lead responsibility assigned.  I will be working closely with my colleague the Minister for Education on this issue to ensure these actions are implemented.  With this in mind, for further details on school-based mental health and well-being, the Department of Education would be better placed to answer such queries.</p>  <p>  However, the Department of Health and the Department of Education do have a strong history of working together to support youth mental health.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, and the Department of Health jointly developed Well-Being in Post Primary Schools Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention.  This was followed in 2015 by the publication of Guidelines setting out a framework for mental health promotion in primary schools.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, the Government launched Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide with the aim of reducing suicide and self-harm over 2015-2020.  The Strategy sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being.  It will provide community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention. </p>  <p>  One of the main goals in Connecting for Life is to target approaches to reduce suicidal behaviour and improve mental health among priority groups, including young people.  Several key actions have been identified to further this goal in the Education sector, including:</p>  <p>  -  Support the implementation of the relevant guidelines for mental health promotion and suicide prevention across primary and post-primary schools;</p>  <p>  -  Guide and encourage the implementation of the relevant policies and plans in schools, including support for Student Support Teams and for critical incident management;</p>  <p>  -  Work with the HSE to develop national guidance for higher education institutions in relation to suicide risk and critical incident response;</p>  <p>  -  Implement the National Anti-bullying Action Plan including online and homophobic bullying;</p>  <p>  -  Support all junior and senior schools to implement a new Wellbeing programme; and</p>  <p>  -  Deliver early intervention and psychological support service for young people at primary care level. </p>  <p>  These actions are part of the overall policy objectives of the Department of Education and Skills.  They are supported by my Department and the HSE through the inter-agency implementation arrangements provided for in Connecting for Life and overseen by the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy and Public Service Reform.</p></reply>

The number of nursing and midwifery staff increased by 1,650 whole time equivalents between December 2013 and December 2016, notwithstanding intense global competition for our nurses and midwives.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts.  The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  Its National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.  The Acute Hospital Groups have advertised a number of Emergency Department nursing posts and are currently in the recruitment process. </p>  <p>  The HSE ran a 3 day open recruitment event over the Christmas holiday period in Dr Steevens&rsquo; Hospital for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish Public Health Service.  220 attended the event.  115 nursing and midwifery candidates were deemed successful and panelled following interview.  The files for successful candidates have passed to the contracting unit within National Recruitment Service, Manorhamilton.  This event will be followed by a series of careers events for nurses throughout 2017 with the next one scheduled for 31 March 2017.  A relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas. </p>  <p>  Discussions between the INMO, SIPTU, my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the HSE have been ongoing over the past week in relation to nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention and the talks are continuing.  The management side supplied a joint proposal document setting out a number of specific measures to attract and retain nursing staff, in addition to a funded workforce plan.  The Government are already committed to 1,000 nursing posts in 2017 as part of the Programme for Partnership Government.  These are fully funded and approved posts.  As part of the engagement management are committed to maximising the number of additional posts that can be provided in 2017.</p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out-of-hours cooperatives as a means of meeting this contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services helping to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting and I welcome this.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently undertaking a review of the existing GP out-of-hours services.

In 2016, typically in a month, there were approximately 53,084 admissions to acute hospitals hospitals on a daycase and an inpatient basis.</p>  <p>  The National ED Escalation Framework sets out procedures to be followed in hospitals during periods of high demand for emergency care, to ensure that safe care is provided to all patients. In order to respond to surges in ED demand, under the Framework, hospital managers may, in consultation with the relevant clinical leads, review and cancel non-urgent planned electives, where appropriate. This allows both beds and staff to be redeployed to alleviate pressure in the ED.</p>  <p>  The HSE intends to undertake a review of the Escalation Framework in the coming months to ensure its effectiveness.  It is essential that hospitals continue to improve how they manage, and balance, the demand for emergency care with the planning of elective procedures, to minimise the impact on patients.</p>  <p>  In addition, it is important that the HSE continues to improve its processes to minimise the number sessions lost when patients cancel or do not attend for their procedures. </p>  <p>  The following tabular statement sets out details of the number of elective surgeries cancelled from January 2016 to January 2017, broken down by month.</p></reply>

For example, the HSE has advised that to the end of September, there was a sustained increase in referrals for outpatient appointments, each month in the order of 10%, in comparison with the same period in 2015.</p>  <p>  In November, the HSE launched the Strategy for the design of Integrated Outpatient Services 2016-2020.  It seeks to improve waiting times for outpatient services by enhancing patient referral pathways and utilising technology to enable better planning.  In the context of rolling out this Strategy, the HSE is currently developing an Outpatient Waiting List Action Plan for 2017.  The plan will focus on ensuring that no patient is waiting more than 15 months on this list by the end of October 2017. </p>  <p>  Each of the Hospital Groups is currently finalising its Operational Plan for 2017.  These Plans will set out the specific actions to be implemented this year to address waiting lists, including outpatient waiting lists.  These specific actions will form part of the HSE&rsquo;s Outpatient Waiting List Action Plan.  </p>  <p>  I expect to make known the details of the HSE Outpatient Waiting List Action Plan in the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places  and the HSE's 2017 National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.  I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.</p><p>Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practising for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p><p>In addition, I am cognisant of the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way and initial meetings with GP representative bodies have been held in January.  The GP contracts review process will, <i>inter alia</i>, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

The bed capacity figures per 1,000 population recorded by the OECD for the Republic of Ireland, and for the UK, do not include capacity in private hospitals, unlike figures recorded in many other EU countries.  In 2007, the PA Consulting Bed Capacity Report recorded private hospital capacity as 1,926; recent unpublished reports would indicate that private capacity would add approximately 2,100 beds.  Inclusion of private capacity would give a figure of approximately 3.1 hospital beds per 1,000 population. </p>  <p>  It is important to note that our population is younger than those of European nations with high hospital bed numbers, although numbers of over 65s are increasing at the rate of almost 20,000 per year.  This population cohort uses 53% of acute hospital capacity. </p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a national bed capacity review, which will be undertaken this year. In addition to acute bed capacity, this review will examine bed capacity in the primary and community care sectors, as the availability of non-acute beds and services can mitigate the need for hospital admission, or facilitate earlier discharge.  The review will also consider how reforms to the model of care will impact on future capacity requirements, in terms of how our health services are delivered. </p>  <p>  With regard to the number of doctors in Ireland per 1,000 population, the November 2016 OECD report is based on data from 2014.  </p>  <p>  There are currently 2914 GPs contracted to the HSE in Ireland.  In terms of staffing in public hospitals, consultant numbers have increased from 2,474 in 2011 to 2,861 Whole Time Equivalents in December 2016, while the number of NCHDs increased from 4,937 to 6,060 from 2011 to 31 December, 2016.  These increases are in line with Government policy to move to a consultant-delivered service and also to meet service demands and ongoing efforts to achieve full compliance with the requirements of the European Working Time Directive.  </p>  <p>  In order to continue to address medical staffing levels in our hospitals, recruitment of additional consultants and non-consultant hospital doctors is ongoing.  By the end of November 2016, an additional 118 consultants and 267 hospital doctors were employed in our health services, in comparison with November 2015.  </p></reply>

The Acute Hospital Groups have advertised a number of Emergency Department nursing posts and are currently in the recruitment process. </p>  <p>  The HSE ran a 3 day open recruitment event over the Christmas holiday period in Dr. Steevens&rsquo; Hospital for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish Public Health Service. 220 attended the event. 115 nursing and midwifery candidates were deemed successful and panelled following interview. The files for successful candidates have passed to the contracting unit within National Recruitment Service, Manorhamilton. This event will be followed by a series of careers events for nurses throughout 2017 with the next one scheduled for 31 March 2017. A relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas.</p>  <p>  I wish to reassure the Deputy that all efforts are being taken to reach an agreement and to put in place arrangements that will maximise nursing and midwifery recruitment and retention.</p></reply>

In addition there has also been a call that family involvement in the care and treatment of such patients should be made compulsory.</p><p>The Expert Group which reviewed the Mental Health Act 2001 and published its report in 2015, looked at the former and recommended &lsquo;<i>proactive encouragement for the patient at all stages to involve his/her family/carer and/or chosen advocate in the admission process and in the development of the care and treatment plan with the patient&rsquo;s consent&rsquo;</i>.  Outcomes tend to be better when family are involved and the recommendation of the Expert Group in this regard is seen as important and is accepted by all key stakeholders.  The vast bulk of patients are satisfied to allow families to be involved.</p><p>However, there are other considerations which must be taken into account where a patient reserves the right to withhold consent to share confidential information with his or her family.</p><p>Firstly, it should be clearly stated that the Medical Council&rsquo;s Ethical Guide already specifically allows a doctor to ethically breach confidentiality if, for example, he/she believes that the patient is at risk of harming himself/herself or others.  Doctors therefore have existing powers in exceptional circumstances and do use them where they consider it necessary.  That is not to say, of course, that the prediction of risk is easy.</p><p>While encouraging family involvement in the care and treatment of mental health patients was recommended by the Expert Group, there was no recommendation that such involvement should be made compulsory against the wishes of the patient.</p><p>There may be potentially serious downsides to an absolute approach where those with mental illness may decide not to confide in their Doctor/medical team at all if they are strongly against involving family members involved for whatever reason.</p><p>I am also referring this question to the HSE for response.</p></reply>

I would like to assure the Deputies that this is a priority action for me and my Department.</p>  <p>  Systematic analysis of the capacity requirements of the health service is an obvious requirement of proper planning and management.  Such reviews should ideally be undertaken on a periodic basis and have a medium to long term focus.  Given the changes in population, epidemiological trends and fiscal environment since the last report in 2007, a review at this stage is appropriate. </p>  <p>  Assessing capacity requirements, however, is a complex task and cannot be divorced from considerations on the underlying model of care we want to develop for the Irish health service.  It is widely acknowledged that primary care can provide more appropriate and effective management and treatment of some illnesses and conditions, especially chronic diseases.  Similarly, the availability of non-acute beds and services in the community can mitigate the need for acute hospital admission, or facilitate earlier discharge.  These factors directly contribute to the demands on the acute hospital system.</p>  <p>  For this reason, I have confirmed that the review will have a wider scope than previous exercises and will examine key elements of primary and community care infrastructure in addition to hospital facilities.</p>  <p>  The review will:</p>  <p>  -  consider current capacity in the health system and benchmark with international comparators;</p>  <p>  -  determine drivers of future demand for healthcare including demographic and epidemiological trends;</p>  <p>  -  analyse how reforms to the model of care will impact on future capacity requirements across the system; and</p>  <p>  -  provide an overall assessment of current and future capacity requirements for each year for the period 2017 &ndash; 2030.</p>  <p>  The review is being undertaken by my Department and will be overseen by a steering group and an international expert advisory group.  The steering group will include representatives from the Departments of Health, the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE and a number of experts.  This will be complemented by an independent peer group of international health experts who will be charged with reviewing and validating the review methodology and findings.  Membership of both groups is being finalised, and I have asked my Department to forward details to the Deputies when representation has been confirmed.</p>  <p>  External expert inputs will be commissioned to provide independent and impartial analysis of capacity needs.  My Department will undertake a procurement process in this regard.  </p>  <p>  Given the current pressures being experienced within our hospital services, the process must also have a short-term focus and determine how capital investment over the coming years can be best targeted.  I can confirm that the review will be advanced sufficiently to enable it to inform considerations around the mid-term review of the capital programme.  It will be finalised for publication later in the year.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  All NTPF initiatives include procedures to report on the type, nature and cost of treatments commissioned, including controls to ensure quality patient treatment, value for money and efficient processes.  My Department will also implement a robust monitoring framework in this regard.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  Around 3,000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.  </p>  <p>  In addition to this day case initiative, the NTPF will be working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach to the remaining 2017 allocation as well as planning the approach for the significant increase in the allocation to address long waiting in 2018.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plan for inpatient/daycase procedures to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October.  This Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017.  A similar plan is being developed for outpatient appointments.  I expect to make known the details of both plans in the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  In August, following a briefing on electronic referrals, I tasked the HSE's Chief Information Officer with producing a report into how digital solutions could change the way in which waiting lists are managed. </p>  <p>  The HSE has responded providing my Department with a detailed set of options that could be explored.  This response on the digital challenge for waiting lists includes an overview of innovations and suggested approaches from over 49 suppliers, some of which have deployed successfully in other countries.  The HSE has also reviewed a number of international models which will continue to be sources of information and guidance to ensure the project is well designed and delivered.  The HSE has been advised to progress this issue during 2017, in conjunction with relevant business units.</p>  <p>  The HSE is of the view that significant progress could be achieved from investing around &euro;1.0m in technology supports.  Exact expenditure would only be known following clarity on requirements, developing a business case and following the necessary public procurements. </p>  <p>  The success of any digital solutions is predicated on high quality data flowing through the health system.  The completion of the national rollout of electronic referrals (eReferrals) and its continued growth, will provide a solid data source and foundation for managing the waiting lists at individual hospital level.  Also, the rollout of the Individual Health Identifier (IHI) commencing in 2017, will be important in facilitating the management of national or hospital group waiting lists, as the IHI will support the identification of patients who may be on several waiting lists for the same condition. </p></reply>

The key purpose of the Regulations is to ensure the continued availability of the type of broad hospital cover traditionally held as a minimum by the insured population and to ensure that individuals do not significantly under-insure. </p>  <p>  The regulations protect consumers by requiring insurers to offer a minimum set of benefits to every insured person.  By way of example, the regulations include provision for such medical treatments as a prostatectomy or testicular biopsy (in the case of men) and cervical biopsy or maternity services (in the case of women).  Insurers are free to design and sell private health insurance plans, providing the plans comply with the minimum benefit regulations.

This includes additional funding for home care services which is aimed at allowing people to continue to live in their own homes and at facilitating discharge of older people from acute hospitals.  </p><p>The HSE&rsquo;s National Service Plan for 2017 provides for a target of:</p><p>-  10.57 million Home Help Hours to support about 49,000 people;</p><p>-  16,750<b></b>Home Care Packages and</p><p>-  190<b></b>Intensive Home Care Packages for clients with complex needs including 60 clients with dementia supported with co-funding from Atlantic Philanthropies under the Irish National Dementia Strategy.</p><p>This represents an increase on home care in comparison to last year&rsquo;s Service Plan, which had a target of 10.4 million hours home help and 15,450 Home Care Packages.</p><p>Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for Home Care continues to grow. It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home care across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available. The level of activity and associated costs must be managed in each of the nine Community Healthcare Organisations in a way that ensures that those with the greatest needs are supported and that the overall expenditure on home care services by the HSE does not exceed the available funding. </p><p>The development of a new home care scheme is a priority for me, as Minister. The Department has commenced an examination of options to bring greater national consistency to the regulation and financing of home care. This work began in 2016 with a review by the Health Research Board of how home care is regulated and funded in comparable jurisdictions, commissioned by the Department. The review will be finalised and published shortly and will be used to inform the development of policy proposals for the regulation and funding of these services.  In addition, a public consultation process will be launched in the coming months to allow stakeholders, including older people, their families and healthcare workers to express their views regarding a new home care scheme.  </p></reply>

As of the 23rd of December there were four confirmed suicides in this region over the previous two months. The HSE has confirmed that the following has taken place since late November and is planned for the coming weeks:</p>  <p>  -  A multiagency meeting took place in Cork City Hall on the 5th of December. The HSE Head of Mental Health CHO Cork/Kerry presented on behalf of the HSE outlining the co-ordinated multi-organisation response to suicides put in place in Cork city since October 2016 in response to the rise in suicides;</p>  <p>  -  The group involved in the co-ordinated response to date continue to provide tailored support to communities and individuals affected by these suicides, responding to the needs identified by the community/individual themselves. This has included talks in GAA clubs, provision of SafeTalk training in community centres, meeting with school principals, a Resource Officer for Suicide Prevention meeting with individual families and with childcare services, and the fast tracking of adolescents identified as being at risk to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services;</p>  <p>  -  Led by the Communications Manager in CHO Cork /Kerry there has been continued monitoring of media reporting of suicide and issuing statements to address any inaccurate reporting. Media reporting is now much more aligned with the responsible reporting guidelines on suicide and is including details of helpline numbers and access to crisis services;</p>  <p>  -  The HSE Head of Service for Mental Health CHO Cork/Kerry has arranged a "lessons learned" session for all those involved in the multi-organisation co-ordinated response to date to review what has been done since October, which is due to take place on the 7 of March. </p>  <p>  This response is reflective of how the current state-wide framework in place across the country operates. The National Office for Suicide Prevention is responsible for the coordination of suicide prevention initiatives around the country, as well as the implementation of the national suicide prevention strategy. This national suicide prevention strategy, &lsquo;Connecting for Life&rsquo;, sets out a vision where fewer lives are lost through suicide, and where communities and individuals are empowered to improve their mental health and well-being. This includes a greater focus on the important area of support for families and communities in suicide prevention, and providing community-based organisations with guidelines, protocols and training on effective suicide prevention. </p></reply>

Recent unpublished reports would indicate that private capacity is approximately 2,100.</p>  <p>  I recently met with the Private Hospitals Association to discuss how private hospitals can contribute to meeting urgent health priorities, including demand for emergency care and waiting list management.  There is considerable experience of private hospitals assisting in addressing lengthy waiting times for scheduled care.  Acknowledging the challenges in scheduled care provision, Budget 2017 makes specific provision for the treatment of longest-waiting patients. Funding of &euro;20 m is being allocated to the NTPF in 2017, rising to &euro;55 m in 2018 and I am aware that the NTPF has been engaging with private hospitals in this regard.</p>  <p>  In addition, in response to significant pressures in EDs in the early New Year, the HSE introduced a series of enhanced measures under the Winter Initiative.

Around 3,000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.  In addition to this day case initiative, the NTPF will be working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach regarding utilisation of the remaining 2017 allocation.</p>  <p>  During 2017 the HSE will continue to work with the NTPF and the Department to ensure the best use of public hospital capacity and the private hospital system to meet the needs of patients waiting for inpatient, daycase and outpatient services.</p></reply>

This group was established by my Department in 2015 and it has met on a number of occasions.</p>  <p>  One of the principal recommendations in the Plan was the establishment of a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases. This programme was to be responsible, over time and among other functions, to facilitate timely access to centres of expertise &ndash; nationally and internationally; and to assist with developing care pathways with European Reference Centres for those ultra-rare disorders where there may not be sufficient expertise in Ireland.</p>  <p>  In line with this recommendation, a National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases was established in 2013 under the National Clinical Strategy and Programmes Division of the HSE. The programme is a joint initiative between the HSE and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland. This clinical programme is a channel for assisting with the advancement of a number of other recommendations in the plan, such as those on National Centres of Expertise for rare diseases.  In this vein, the programme assisted the HSE Acute Hospitals Division with development of a framework for the designation of Irish Centres of Expertise in line with the recommendations stipulated in the national plan.</p>  <p>  The Rare Diseases National Plan also recommended that &lsquo;the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases through a National Office for Rare Diseases develop the clinical and organisational governance framework that would underpin care pathways and access to treatment for rare disease patients, particularly in the context of transition from paediatric to adult care'.</p>  <p>  As such the National Clinical Programme has developed a draft transition model of care which is currently in the consultation stage.</p>  <p>  The National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases and the Department of Health encouraged designated Centres of Expertise to participate in European Reference Networks (ERNs) for Rare Diseases in line with the national plan. ERNs are European networks connecting health care providers and centres of expertise so that international expertise on specific rare diseases may be pooled together for the benefit of patients. Any centre applying for membership of an ERN must have strategies in place to ensure that care is patient-centred; that patients' rights and preferences are respected; and must show a research component to their work.</p>  <p>  Hence, the recommendations in the national plan that related to empowering and protecting patients and carers, and research on rare diseases will be fulfilled in part through this process. It is expected that ERNs will have a major structuring effect by linking thematic expert centres across the EU.</p>  <p>  With the encouragement of the National Clinical Programme for Rare Diseases, Acute Hospital Divisions in the HSE and the Department of Health, five centres of expertise were designated last June during the first round of calls from the European Commission for participation in European Reference Networks. Two of these designated centres applied for membership of ERNs for the first round of calls.</p>  <p>  In 2014, the Minister for Health announced &euro;850,000 for investment into charity-led research priorities, which particularly benefits rare disease research. Five charities were to provide matching funding bringing the total investment to &euro;1.9 million. They were to share &euro;850,000 in State funding to take part in international research into rare medical conditions. In 2016, the next cohort of projects was funded by the State with &euro;1.686 million, matched by charity funding of &euro;1.224 million.  The total funding of &euro;2.91 million is shared between 14 charities. The next round of this joint funding initiative will open this year. The EU commission now intends to explore the possibility to further strengthen the collaboration between Member States and the Commission in the area of research on rare diseases.</p>  <p>  The establishment of a National Rare Disease Office (NRDO) featured prominently in the recommendations of the Rare Disease plan. The national office was established by the HSE in June 2015. Its work is currently led by the NCPRD Clinical Lead, supported by an Information Scientist, part-time Administrative Officer, part-time Genetic Counsellor and by a 0.2 FTE Consultant Geneticist. It is, among other functions, providing up-to-date information regarding new treatment and management options, including clinical trials. In addition, the post of Information Scientist for the office is being funded jointly by the HSE and the EU Commission.</p>  <p>  The NRDO has already performed a preliminary situation analysis of the existing rare disease registries and is in the process of assigning these known registries on our national Orphanet site, which is the international rare disease reference and information portal funded by the EU. The EU Commission has started the development of a European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration. Its principal goal is to enable sharing and use of rare diseases' patient data across Europe, among the multitude of existing patient registries, within and across rare diseases.</p>  <p>  The national plan for Rare Diseases recommended that the Health Identifiers Bill and the Health &amp;amp; Patient Safety Bill be published. The former was published in 2013 and enacted in 2014.  It is now being implemented by the HSE.  A revised and much expanded General Scheme of a Health Information and Patient Safety Bill was approved by the government in November 2015 and published on the Department's website.</p>  <p>  Two recommendations referred to training in rare diseases for healthcare professionals. The Department of Health has contacted formally the various healthcare representative and professional bodies about implementing these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Finally, rare diseases have already been tabled on the agenda for North-South meetings. Therefore, future work to deepen cooperation between both jurisdictions on rare diseases is anticipated.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.</p>  <p>  Embedded in all NTPF initiatives are procedures to report on the type, nature and cost of treatments commissioned, including controls to ensure quality patient treatment, value for money and efficient processes.  My Department will also implement a robust monitoring framework in this regard.</p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5 m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  Around 3,000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly.</p>  <p>  In addition to this daycase initiative, the NTPF will be working closely with my Department and the HSE to agree an approach to the remaining 2017 allocation as well as planning the approach for the significant increase in the allocation to address long waiting in 2018.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plan for inpatient/daycase procedures to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October. This Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of its remaining &euro;10 m funding for patient treatment in 2017.  A similar plan is being developed for outpatient appointments. I expect to make known the details of both plans in the coming weeks.</p></reply>

Currently EDs in private hospitals do not offer a 24 hour service and only a minority provide services at weekends.  </p>  <p>  I recently met with the Private Hospitals Association to discuss how private hospitals can contribute to meeting urgent health priorities, including demand for emergency care and waiting list management.  There is significant experience of private hospitals assisting in addressing lengthy waiting times for scheduled care.  Funding of &euro;20 million has been allocated to NTPF in Budget 2017 rising to &euro;55 million in 2018 and I am aware that the NTPF has been engaging with private hospitals in this regard.</p>  <p>  In September 2016 the HSE launched the &lsquo;Winter Initiative Plan 2016-2017&rsquo; which provided &euro;40 million of additional funding for winter preparedness. Last month, in response to significant pressures in EDs, a series of enhanced measures were added to this Initiative.  One such measure has involved availing of additional capacity in certain private hospitals to support the public hospital system.  </p>  <p>  So far, the Winter Initiative has delivered 75 newly-opened additional acute hospital beds. Also, as of 24 January, delayed discharges have reduced nationally to 469, freeing up hospitals beds to alleviate ED pressures.  In addition under the Initiative: over 3,900 patients have availed of aids and appliances; over 780 additional homecare packages and 410 additional transitional care beds have been provided, enabling patients to be discharged from hospital sooner  .</p>  <p>  Every week, with my Department, I meet with senior HSE officials to monitor the Winter Initiative and ED performance.  I can assure the Deputy that this is a very strong focus on reducing Emergency Department overcrowding in all my interactions with the HSE, hospitals and other interested parties.  </p></reply>

Two of these GPs, who form one practice in Waterville, are due to retire in the near future.  The HSE is currently undertaking a recruitment process to replace these upcoming retirements.  In relation to the GP service in Rathmore, the HSE is continuing its efforts to revert to a full-time GP service in the area.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the continued development of GP capacity to ensure that patients across the country continue to have access to GP services.  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places and the HSE's 2017 National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.  I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.</p>  <p>  Further efforts undertaken in recent years to increase the number of practising GPs include changes to the entry provisions to the GMS scheme to accommodate more flexible/shared GMS/GP contracts, and to the retirement provisions for GPs under the GMS scheme, allowing GPs to hold GMS contracts until their 72nd birthday, as well as the introduction of an enhanced supports package for rural GP practices.  These steps should help to address the future demand for GPs by enticing GPs who may have ceased practicing for family or other reasons back into the workforce, facilitating GPs to work past the standard retirement age and encouraging more GPs to work in rural areas.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have emphasised the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way and initial meetings with GP representative bodies have been held in January.  The GP contracts review process will, among other things, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p></reply>

The result of the Brexit vote has caused considerable uncertainty for the Agency and its staff as it will have to be relocated to a country remaining within the European Union.  This scenario creates real risks for the EMA and its stakeholders &ndash; foremost, European citizens and the industries which the Agency regulates.  </p>  <p>  The Government believes that it will be important to address the question of the Agency's future location relatively early in the Brexit process.  It is important that the selection of a new host country is informed by clear and careful consideration of the requirements which will need to be met in order to ensure continuity of the EMA's activities and a sustainable future for the Agency.  It will be particularly important to maximise the retention of the EMA staff whose expertise and skills have been key to Agency's development over the last 20 years and to the standing which it enjoys as a regulator at a global level.</p>  <p>  In October the Government decided to propose Dublin as a new home for the EMA.  An interdepartmental/interagency working group led by my Department was established to prepare a proposal. </p>  <p>  Last week I visited the EMA in London in order to better understand the workings of the Agency and the challenges it will face as a result of Brexit.  I met the Executive Director, Professor Guido Rasi, and key members of his team.  It was agreed that we would not speak publicly about the content of those discussions.</p>  <p>  Work is continuing on Ireland's proposal to host the EMA and I will travel to Brussels next week for discussions with a range of stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Ultimately the decision on the new location for the EMA will be made by the European Council at heads of state or government level.  I have not discussed Ireland's bid for the EMA with fellow health ministers, many of whom are also actively campaigning to host the Agency.</p></reply>

In this context, I am bringing a renewed focus to the development of primary care and my Department's Statement of Strategy 2016-2019 sets out a range of actions aimed at improving health outcomes and the health services over the next three years.  Amongst the key areas to be addressed in this context are:</p><p>- Further development of multidisciplinary primary care teamworking;</p><p>- Planning and resourcing the primary care workforce;</p><p>- Promoting the provision of necessary infrastructural capacity;</p><p>- Development of chronic disease management in primary care; and</p><p>- Negotiation of a modernised GP contract.</p><p>My Department will work with a range of stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, service users and the HSE to advance the work in these areas.</p><p>My Department has also commenced work on an overall model of care which will inform the assessment of future capacity requirements across the different parts of the health sector.  This model of care will be informed by international best practice and the work underway has included engagement with experts from the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies.</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare was established by order of the D&aacute;il to agree an all-party 10 year plan for the future of the health service and will consider issues such as the direction of health policy.  I look forward to the outcome of the Committee's work as a further contribution to the development of the direction of travel over the years ahead.</p><p>The HSE's annual National Service Plans detail the expenditure limits for the HSE and provide details on priorities, actions and the type and volume of service that will be provided from the annual funding allocated.  In addition, they list the performance indicators against which performance is measured.  The Performance and Accountability Framework provides for the HSE to closely monitor the delivery of services in accordance with the agreed targets and within the agreed financial allocation and to take appropriate steps in terms of support and/or intervention as and when the need arises.</p></reply>

It would be the case, too, that the question relating to any physical aspects of mental health would be open to interpretation, particularly in light of evolving clinical judgement or knowledge both nationally or internationally.  </p><p>The terms 'mental disorder' and 'mental illness' are currently defined in section 3 of the Mental Health Act 2001.  The Report of the Expert Group which reviewed the Mental Health Act 2001 was published in 2015 and the Group recommended that the term 'mental disorder' should be removed from the Act and replaced by a definition of the term 'mental illness'.  The definition of mental illness proposed by the Group is: 'mental illness means a complex and changeable condition where the state of mind of a person affects the person's thinking, perceiving, emotion or judgment and seriously impairs the mental function of the person to the extent that he or she requires treatment.  Work is underway in the Department to prepare the General Scheme of a Bill which will reflect the recommendations of the Expert Group in revised mental health legislation.</p><p>It is generally accepted in this country that certain serious mental health conditions would be regarded as involving, or potentially involving, the type of issue raised by the Deputy.  This, for example, is reflected in the HSE National Clinical and Integrated Care Programmes being developed under the annual HSE Mental Health Operational Plans, and which are published on the HSE website.  These cover areas such as Self-Harm, Eating Disorders, Early Intervention for Psychosis, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and Co-Morbid Dual Diagnosis for Mental Health and Substance Abuse, and may be relevant to varying degrees in the context overall mental policy and professional care delivery.</p><p>If the Deputy has further queries he wishes me to consider on this matter, I will be happy to do so if he supplies me with detailed information.</p></reply>

The National Therapy Service Review Group was established to agree a revised national model of Speech and Language Therapy provision that would be standardised across all Community Healthcare Organisations.  This would cover referral criteria, assessment and treatment arrangements, models of care and standardisation of a prioritisation system for Speech and Language Therapy.  It is anticipated that the group will have completed its work by the end of March 2017. </p>  <p>  In addition, in 2016, &euro;4 million was provided under the HSE's National Service Plan to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in Primary Care and Social Care for children up to 18 years old.  This funding is enabling the HSE to fill 83 new full-time and recurring posts to address waiting lists, prioritising the longest-waiting children and recruitment is ongoing.  I understand that there was a 9.3% reduction in the overall 0-18 year old waiting lists for the period 31 July 2016-31 December 2016.  </p>  <p>  The HSE National Service Plan has a target that, at end 2017, no one will wait more than one year for Speech and Language Therapy.  For further details on the particular targets for speech and language therapy in 2017, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.</p></reply>

In March 2006, in line with the recommendation in <i>'A Vision for Change'</i>, the First Independent Monitoring Group was established for a three-year period to monitor progress on the implementation of the report recommendations.  The term of the first group ceased in April 2009 and in June 2009 a Second Independent Monitoring Group was appointed for a further three-year period.  The Second group finished its work, delivering its final report in 2011.</p><p><i>'A Vision for Change' </i>came to the end of its 10-year term in 2016. <i></i>The increased investment in mental health services over the last number of years has helped to facilitate an increase in the number and staffing levels of both Adult, and Children &amp;amp; Adolescent Community Mental Health Teams.  Of the additional 1,550 new mental health posts approved since 2012, some 1,150 have been, or are in the process of being, recruited, notwithstanding the generally challenging recruitment market in which the HSE is operating.  </p><p>Increased investment has also funded the development of specialist services recommended in <i>A Vision for Change</i>, including Forensic, Eating Disorders, Psychiatry of Later Life, and Mental Health Intellectual Disability services.  There has also been continued development of community mental health teams, improved 7-day responses and liaison services, Peri-natal Mental Health and two new clinical programmes &ndash; specifically for ADHD in Adults and Children, and for Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  </p><p>The Department of Health has now commenced the process of updating <i>A Vision for Change</i>.  An evidence-based expert review which will focus on the progress made to date in the implementation of <i>A Vision for Change</i>, including a review of current delivery of services in Ireland, was commissioned in November 2016.  The review will also take account of international best practice and will inform the next steps in the development of our mental health policy, having regard to both human rights and health and wellbeing objectives.  This will provide a solid evidence base to determine the policy direction for a revision of <i>A Vision for Change</i>and is expected to be completed in February 2017.</p><p>An oversight committee will be established within three months of the review being finalised to oversee the development of a new policy for mental health based on the outcome of the expert review.</p></reply>

This funding will also provide for the costs associated with the restoration of payments to staff under the Lansdowne Road Agreement.  In addition, &euro;9m has been allocated to expand existing, or develop new acute hospital services in 2017. </p>  <p>  The 2017 National Service Plan emphasises the HSE's need during 2017 to continue to pursue increased efficiency, value for money and budgetary control in delivering safe and effective healthcare services within its budget allocation. </p>  <p>  My Department continues to engage with a wide range of stakeholders including the HSE, the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF), Hospital Groups, Community Health Organisations, both public and private hospitals, and healthcare professionals on a range of issues regarding the provision safe and clinically appropriate unscheduled and scheduled care services to patients in acute hospitals. </p>  <p>  As part of measures to alleviate winter pressures on Emergency Departments, this Government approved the allocation of &euro;40m of additional funding for a Winter Initiative in 2016 - 2017.  So far, the Initiative has delivered 75 newly-opened additional beds in the Mercy University Hospital Cork, University Hospital Galway, the Mater, Beaumont and Midlands Regional Hospital, Mullingar.  Also, as of 24 January, delayed discharges have reduced nationally to 469, freeing up hospitals beds to alleviate ED pressures.  In addition under the Initiative, since October: over 3,900 patients have availed of aids and appliances; over 780 additional homecare packages and 410 additional transitional care beds have been provided, enabling patients to be discharged from hospital sooner. </p>  <p>  With regard to reducing waiting times for elective care, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017.  Around 3,000 daycases will be managed through this process and outsourcing of treatment will commence shortly. </p>  <p>  The HSE is currently developing a 2017 Waiting List Action Plan for inpatient/daycase procedures to ensure that no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October.  This Plan is being developed in conjunction with the NTPF's proposal for utilisation of its remaining &euro;10m funding for patient treatment in 2017. </p>  <p>  Along with my Department, I meet every week with senior officials from the HSE, including the Director General, to monitor progress on the Winter Initiative and ED performance, as well as waiting list performance.</p></reply>

This Initiative was developed to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care in an integrated way across Primary, Acute and Social Care.  On 5 January, in response to significant pressures in our EDs in the New Year, a series of enhanced measures were added to this initiative. </p>  <p>  As part of the measures detailed in the Winter Initiative, the Smithfield Clinic which provides minor injury care in the catchment area of the Mater University Hospital was funded to expand its service with the aim of treating up to an additional 100 patients each week.  This has been in place since 1st November 2016. A review of the five day week expanded service and determination of inclusion of weekend service will be undertaken shortly. </p>  <p>  There are currently 11 Minor Injury Clinics operating nationwide, and as the Deputy will be aware, Minor Injury Units are for the treatment of broken bones, dislocations, sprains, strains, wounds, scalds and minor burns that are unlikely to need admission to hospital.  In cases where an injury is more serious than originally thought, the patient is transferred to the hub ED linked to the Clinic for further assessment and treatment. </p>  <p>  The HSE has recently launched an information campaign, including social media, to promote and further inform the public of the services available through these clinics and their locations.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government commits to a review of Medical Assessment Units, Urgent Care Centres and Minor Injury Clinics.  Preliminary scoping work on this review is being carried out.</p></reply>

The new EIB (European Investment Bank) office I opened in Dublin in December should also provide further complementary support for project development in Ireland, building from the experience it has gained in tackling investment bottlenecks across Europe.  </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to support effective Irish engagement with EFSI, including through the work of relevant Cabinet Committees.  By increasing EIB risk-taking capacity, we should expect to see EFSI enabling a stronger EIB footprint in areas such as direct lending to mid-size corporates, sharing of credit risk on SME innovation finance, and infrastructure projects that do not benefit from a sovereign guarantee.</p>  <p>  However my Department was not directly involved in the work of the EU Task Force on Investment that reported in December 2014 as part of EFSI preparations.  The Irish contribution to the Task Force was coordinated by the Department of Finance, working closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and other Government Departments having policy responsibility for specific investment projects.</p></reply>

These are companies registered under the Companies Act, the members of which are the owners of residential units within the development, which are established for the purposes of ownership and management of such areas.  The 2011 Act contains provisions relating to matters such as:</p><p>- the transfer of common areas to the OMCs (sections 4 and 5);</p><p>- voting rights of members of OMCs (sections 14 and 15);</p><p>- the provision of annual reports by OMCs to members (section 17);</p><p>- arrangements for the holding of annual meetings to approve annual service charges (section 18);</p><p>- establishment of a sinking fund to cover refurbishment outlays (section 19);</p><p>- arrangements for the making of House Rules (section 23); and</p><p>- establishment of a court-based dispute resolution process (section 24).</p><p>The Act also contains provisions which encourage the resolution of disputes that may arise between parties by means of mediation rather than recourse to court proceedings.</p><p>While I have no plans at present to amend the Act, I can assure the Deputy that its operation is being kept under ongoing review by my Department.</p></reply>

A breakdown of the form of status as required by the Deputy is not readily available. This number fluctuates based on the numbers of status grants and the movement of such persons into private accommodation over time. </p>  <p>  The Reception &amp;amp; Integration Agency (RIA), its centre managers, the Community Welfare Service (by way of provision of Rent Allowance), Citizens Information and those City and County Councils operating the Housing Assistance Payments link with such persons in accessing the appropriate supports and services, including in respect of sourcing and securing private accommodation.</p>  <p>  Following on from the McMahon Working Group Report, the Department of Justice and Equality developed a guide to independent living for persons with status to provide practical assistance for them. The guide is available in all centres and has been published on the RIA website (www.ria.gov.ie) in a number of different languages. This was published in parallel with information sessions coordinated by the Citizens Information Bureau in accommodation centres which gave an opportunity for such persons to seek assistance and clarification on the services provided.</p>  <p>  Once some form of status is granted, residents cease to be ordinarily entitled to the accommodation supports provided through RIA.  Notwithstanding this fact, RIA have always continued to provide such persons with continued accommodation until they secure their own private accommodation.  RIA are particularly mindful of the reality of the housing situation in the State and the pressures on the Community Welfare Service in respect of Rent Supplement or the City and County Councils in respect of Housing Assistance Payments and Housing Lists.  The Government is committed to ensuring that persons who are availing of State provided accommodation, including those who have come to Ireland under the Irish Refugee Protection Programme, are supported in sourcing and securing private accommodation. In that regard, my officials work closely with those of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, as is evidenced by the incorporation into the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness of the provision of housing for refugees and the establishment under that Plan of an operational group co-chaired by the two Departments which is focused on this process.</p></reply>

The Evaluation Committee recommended that the investment requirement under the IIP be restored to its original level of &euro;1.0m. This recommendation was with the knowledge of the very significant increase, 500%, in applications received in 2016 compared to 2015 and the expected numbers for 2017.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that for the next evaluation process the value of applications received, since the restoration of the investment requirement to &euro;1.0m, has exceeded the investments committed in any previous call for applications to the Programme.

However, these powers are exercised in circumstances where a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has a reasonable suspicion that an offence has occurred supported by some evidence.  The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the public is clearly insufficient in this regard.</p>  <p>  Each request to search an aircraft is assessed on an individual basis and is based on the specific information and detail available regarding that particular aircraft.  The information is examined and a decision is then made as to whether sufficient grounds exist which would allow the Garda&iacute; to invoke a particular statutory power to search the aircraft.

The Task Force was constituted by the EU as an input to the development of the legislative proposal for the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), subsequently launched in November of that year.  </p><p>Ireland, along with all other Member States, submitted a list of potential projects for inclusion in the Task Force's final report. That list which includes both public and private projects  was compiled by my Department in very close coordination with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform given their responsibility for controlling  public capital expenditure. The list was based on submissions from Departments with responsibility for particular sectors requiring investment, both public and private. The list, as noted by Government before submission, did not have any overall assessment or prioritisation of the projects and was not a national set of project applications. It was more accurately a contribution to an EU-wide scoping exercise to gauge the level of potential projects, during the 2015-2017 period, should investment resources become available. </p><p>The Task Force's final report was published in December 2014 and is available at <i>. </i></p><p>Since EFSI's enactment in July 2015, it has been possible for any project promoter, either public or private, to engage with the EIB regarding the possibility of receiving loans or guarantees under EFSI for particular projects. In general, Government Departments have existing relationships with the EIB so it has been a matter for each Department concerned to advance the projects in coordination with the Government's Capital Plan as  coordinated by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. My Department has no role in assessing projects either public or private which may be the subject of applications for EFSI loans/guarantees.</p><p>Since inception, Ireland has seen the main potential beneficiaries of EFSI as being in the private sector including entities such as PPP companies. In this regard, I am pleased that the Department of Health's Primary Health Care Centres PPP has successfully drawn down EFSI funds.  In addition, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) has successfully engaged with European Financial Instruments such as the COSME and the InnovFin Guarantee Programme, both of which are made available under the EFSI SME Window. These support the financing needs of SMEs and ensure that there is an adequate supply of affordable and appropriate credit to meet their needs.</p><p>In this way, EFSI is providing an important additional funding possibility alongside other possibilities such as the EIB's normal lending, the State's borrowings through the NTMA and other mechanisms such as PPPs and off-balance sheet vehicles. It should be remembered that each EFSI loan entered into by the State pre-commits funding for the repayment of such loans, and has to be considered in the context of the expenditure benchmark under the EU's fiscal rules.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that there is a publicly available list of projects which have been approved for EFSI support by the EIB in the State which is available on the EIB website at: <i></i>.</p><p>However, I would ask the Deputy to be aware that this list may not reflect Irish private sector project promoters participating in a project that could receive funding from EFSI loans/guarantees but which is led or based in another EU Member State.</p></reply>

For the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 the rate was 0.60% of the scheme assets. For the year 2014 the rate was 0.75% of the assets and for the year 2015, the final year of the levy, the rate was 0.15%. Under the legislation, the payment of the levy is treated as a necessary expense of a pension scheme and the trustees or insurer, as appropriate, are entitled where needed to adjust current or prospective benefits payable under a scheme to take account of the levy. It is up to the trustees or insurer to decide whether, when and how the levy should be passed on and to what extent, given the particular circumstances of the pension schemes for which they are responsible. </p>  <p>  The position is that the equivalent value of all of the money raised from the stamp duty levy has been used to fund the wide range of measures introduced in the Jobs Initiative to protect existing jobs and to help create new jobs and the Initiative has been a success in this regard.  The measures introduced include expenditure measures such as the Jobbridge and Springboard schemes, as well as a number of tax and PRSI incentives such as the reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% for the tourism and hospitality sectors and the halving of the lower employer PRSI rate.  </p>  <p>  While the pension fund levies have ceased, I have no plans to repay the pension fund levy collected. The value of the funds raised by way of the levy have been used to protect and create jobs and this has helped to create the improved financial and economic position of the State. Taxpayers to whom the impact of the levy may have been passed on by the chargeable persons responsible for the payment of the levy (the pension scheme trustees etc.) will benefit from the changes which I began in Budget 2015 and which will continue in future Budgets to reduce the tax burden on low and middle income earners.</p></reply>

In line with its statutory mandate, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is examining opportunities to make, on a commercial basis, investments that have the potential to support increased supply of housing. </p>  <p>  The Fund is already involved in a number of important initiatives which cumulatively can make a contribution to increased housing output. This includes its investments in: </p>  <p> - Activate Capital   - which is an innovative non-bank financing platform that has the potential to provide funding for substantial numbers of new homes in Dublin and the other major urban centres in which demand is most pronounced;</p>  <p> - Ardstone Residential Partnership   - which is a residential equity investment fund that is focused on delivering residential units to the market over the short-to medium-term; and</p>  <p> - WLR Cardinal Commercial Real Estate Mezzanine Debt Fund   - which has funded a number of residential developments in recent months. </p>  <p>  Activate Capital, which has the potential to fund the delivery of up to 11,000 new housing units over the medium term, has already advanced funding for the construction of 1,200 new houses in the greater Dublin area and has advised a healthy pipeline. The Ardstone Fund has to date acquired sites with the potential to deliver up to 1,800 new housing units which will be delivered over a 5-7 year time frame and has commenced construction on 165 units, it is targeting a total delivery of up to 3,000 new units. The WLR Cardinal Fund, which invests in multiple real estate sectors providing both pure finance and development capital, has already advanced funding for 1,700 new residential units. </p>  <p>  ISIF invests through the various platforms described above and does not fund developers directly. Activate and the WLR Cardinal Fund both provide debt to developers at rates which vary according to the risk involved. Experience to date suggests there is significant demand for these products. Ardstone is an equity investor that takes development risk and as such is not a lender. It contracts house-building work to third party builders with the required capabilities. </p>  <p>  In relation to interest rates charged by ISIF, ISIF invests on a risk adjusted basis. In this context, the interest rates applied by ISIF to any given investment relates to the level of risk and other investment criteria, including pricing, and reflects its mandate to act commercially and in a way that contributes to the local economy.</p>  <p>  To give an example in the context of ISIF's investments in support of the residential sector the Activate base lending rate ranges from circa 6% to 10%, depending on the extent of leverage advanced and the risk characteristics of each specific project. As would be expected for projects of this nature, there may be a small participation in equity upside if projects are successful so that Activate, and by extension taxpayers, share in any gains alongside the project promoter.  </p>  <p>  In addition to the foregoing, ISIF has committed to investing in over 3,000 student accommodation units to be built in DCU as part of the Campus Development Programme that has primarily been funded by ISIF and the European Investment Bank.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-01a.398.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020100086#WRN01500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 170 to 172, inclusive, 180 to 182, inclusive, and 197 to 199, inclusive, together.</p><p>My Department has overall responsibility for policy development for education and training provision across the economy including the hospitality and tourism sector.  There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.</p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015.  The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020.  The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth.  The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. </p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings.  The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  </p><p>Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.</p><p>Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, the Irish Hospitality Institute, the Licenced Vintners Association, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Social Protection, the Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. </p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for ongoing collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.  </p><p>The Group plans to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the <i>Tourism Insight</i>online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention. </p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.</p><p>Last week, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how State agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.  Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. </p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board.  It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.  The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.  </p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice.  Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job.  The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.</p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision.  However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves.  The following table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016.  As yet, final 2016 figures are not available. </p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers who served on both a full and part-time basis are also included in the table.  </p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the following table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.</p><p>In 2015 the total number of students in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4million and in 2016 the total number of students for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees.  The student numbers are calculated as full-time equivalents (FTE) which includes part-time and full-time student counts.  </p><p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:</p><p>- Tourism/Hotel/Leisure/Event</p><p>- Hospitality &amp;amp; Culinary</p><p>- Heritage &amp;amp; Cultural </p><p>I also<font color="#1F497D"> </font>understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.  However, I have no role or responsibility in relation to F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Matters relating to that agency and its training and business supports are matters for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p></reply>

The matter was discussed by the Oireachtas Committee for Children and Youth Affairs on 25th January 2017.  My Department will of course consider any findings or recommendations the Committee may make on this matter.</p><p>My Department issued circulars to all primary and post-primary schools in 2005 to highlight the potential health hazard of overweight schoolbags and to outline a range of local measures that could be put in place to help alleviate the problem.</p><p>The report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags, commissioned by then Minister Miche&aacute;l Martin, recognised that many of the solutions to this issue belong at local school level and made various recommendations in this regard, such as optimum use of storage facilities, developing pupil organisation skills and timetabling. </p><p>My Department is aware that positive action has been taken by many schools on these issues. Actions consist of a range of measures, including the provision of lockers and in the case of second level school the arrangement of the timetable into double class periods, active liaison with parents and the co-ordination of homework by subject teachers.</p><p>Ultimately it is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning.</p><p>The use of digital resources by teachers and students in schools is increasing.  While conventional textbooks are still widely used, a number of schools have introduced or are considering introducing e-books and other digital resources to enhance students' work in school and at home. Schools can use the book grant scheme to purchase a range of digital resources relevant to the curriculum.</p><p>It should be also be noted that Scoilnet.ie, the Department funded website, supports Primary and Post-Primary teachers in sharing and finding useful resources for the classroom, including the Britannica School website, and other valuable online content and resources to assist in teaching and learning.</p><p>On 5 December 2016, I published the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016.  The Government have approved the draft outline of a new law, which will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.</p><p>The publication of this draft legislation will fulfil a key commitment in the Action Plan for Education to improve information and complaint procedures for parents and students relating schools.</p><p>The draft legislation defines the principles that will guide how schools will engage with students and parents.

The SCPA is utilised, in the main, where as yet unfilled vacancies exist in the NEPS staffing provision locally or where staffing resource is lost through extended leave (maternity, sick or carer&rsquo;s leave).</p>  <p>  I provide for the Deputy&rsquo;s information a list of schools in Co. Louth which do not currently have access to a NEPS Psychologist for the purposes of carrying out an assessment in Co. Louth and which derive this service through the abovementioned SCPA scheme.</p>  <p>  Co. Louth is part of the NEPS North-East region comprising three offices (Navan, Cavan and Drogheda) providing service to schools in Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  The Region currently has four vacancies.  The Drogheda office providing service in the main to Co. Louth schools has a staffing complement of 7 psychologists (6.2 whole-time equivalents).  Currently 4 of these staff (3.4 w.t.e) are on extended leave and three of these who are on maternity leave are not scheduled to return much before the end of the current academic year.</p>  <p>  A new national recruitment competition has been put in place by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) to fill vacancies within all the NEPS Regions.  The resulting interview process associated with this competition will be completed in the current week immediately following which recruitment panels for each NEPS region will be formed.  The PAS will then finalise the processing of the candidates, including Garda vetting, and propose each candidate in series to my Department's  Human Resources Section for contract negotiations and formal job offer.</p>  <p>  It is envisaged that the process will produce the four new NEPS psychologists required by the North East Region during this academic year which will improve the coverage of schools including those in Co. Louth.  The return of Drogheda Office staff from maternity leave will have further effect in this regard from the start of the next academic year. </p>  <p>  However it is important to point out that in cases where the NEPS service is not available through a staffing vacancy or temporary absence of staff, as described above, the schools affected continue to have access to a psychologist through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments to undertake pupil assessment work.</p>  <p>  I would also confirm that all schools continue to be able to  access full NEP supports in the event of a critical incident irrespective of whether they have ongoing access to an assigned a NEPS psychologist.</p><p>List of Co.

Following authorisation in October last to proceed to tender, the Design Team sought advice from the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) to mitigate against any potentially legal challenges in relation to this pre-qualification which might further delay the project. The advice given to the Design Team by the OGP was that it would be prudent to run the pre-qualification process again. My Department concurred with this advice and authorised the Design Team to run a new pre-qualification exercise.</p><p>The Design Team has recently conducted this pre-qualification exercise of suitable contractors and is currently finalising a shortlist of ten contractors who will be requested to tender for the project. Once the shortlist has been finalised, tenders will issue to those contractors for the construction of the new permanent school extension.</p><p>Subject to no issues arising it is anticipated that construction will commence in the summer of 2017 and the project will take approximately 18 months to complete.</p><p>In relation to the question of a meeting with members of the school&rsquo;s Parents&rsquo; Association, I do not think that would serve any practical purpose at this time. My Department will keep Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board fully informed of all developments and it is a matter for the ETB, in the first instance, to ensure that the school community is kept fully informed.</p></reply>

It is envisaged that the document will be a renewable document with yearly updates.</p>  <p>  A plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland over the period 2016-2020 was published recently.  The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships and also set out the timing and nature of a new call for proposals.  The plan sets out specific annual targets as well as bringing forward a range of specific actions to enable and support the development of new apprenticeships and traineeships.  The plan also sets out annual targets, and associated actions, to extend the traineeship model over the period to 2020.  A new Career Traineeship initiative, instigated by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise was initiated, to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice. </p>  <p>  Recognising that the &lsquo;war for talent&rsquo; is now one of the most important factors for job-creation, the Action Plan for Education which I launched last September sets out ambitious plans that will be developed and implemented including a total of 100 apprenticeship schemes and 50 traineeship schemes delivering 50,000 registrations between now and 2020; a 25% increase access to work experience at higher level; 25% increase in flexible learning; and an entrepreneurship education plan.  An integral part of the Action Plan is a comprehensive building programme &ndash; aimed at delivering over 60,000 additional permanent school places, over 300 extensions to existing schools and build 14 new schools by 2021.</p></reply>

Lands held by local authorities in rent pressure zones are to be brought to market on a competitive tendering basis, with a view to leveraging the value of the land to deliver the optimum number of units for rent, targeting middle income households, in mixed tenure developments.  The cost of providing rental units is to be permanently reduced by lowering the initial investment and development costs for providers - AHB or private - allowing the rental units to be made available at below market prices without the need for ongoing rental subsidies.</p>  <p>  The local authorities concerned will identify a number of sites with the potential for up to 1,000 units of accommodation and will move forward, as soon as possible, to issue calls for proposals from parties interested in developing projects.  As speed of delivery will be critically important, appropriate licence arrangements, incorporating clear timescales for delivery, will be a key feature of the process.</p>  <p>  This programme is being co-ordinated with the dedicated measures in Rebuilding Ireland to accelerate housing output from the Major Urban Housing Delivery Sites, including support from the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) where necessary.</p>  <p>  In 2016, &euro;10 million was provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote in order to support the implementation of the affordable rental pilot scheme.  As the scheme was in preparation and under consideration during 2016, the available funding was redirected and used to support additional activity under other housing programmes.</p></reply>

The focus of this pilot remains the transitioning of qualified households from emergency accommodation, including hotels, into private rented tenancies.  To qualify for HAP under the homeless pilot scheme, a household must generally be accepted as homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988 by one of the four Dublin local authorities.  The Homeless HAP support has also been used to prevent households from entering homelessness and homeless services.  While eligible homeless households may source accommodation for themselves, a dedicated placement team, the Dublin Place-Finder Service, has also been established to engage directly with property-owners and support qualified households to find suitable tenancies and to ensure that any additional supports that may be needed are put in place.  This is a particularly important service for households currently residing in emergency accommodation in the Dublin region.</p>  <p>  The Rebuilding Ireland target set for the Homeless HAP scheme was to support 550 households by the end of 2016, and this was exceeded with the setting up of a total of 810 new tenancies at year end. Rebuilding Ireland has set a target of 1,200 additional households to be supported through the Homeless HAP pilot scheme for 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition, HAP has been effective in meeting the long-term housing needs of a further 236 homeless households in local authorities operating HAP outside the Dublin region.  While I am confident that HAP can and will continue to deliver for homeless households across the country, I have asked my Department to continue to monitor the operation of the scheme, including Homeless HAP pilot in Dublin, closely. </p></reply>

The objective of these Guidelines is to ensure local authorities bring about high quality and sustainable urban development using their development planning and management functions to deliver:   </p>  <p>- quality homes and neighbourhoods;   </p>  <p>- places where people want to live, work and raise families; and   </p>  <p>- places that work in relation to the provision of infrastructure.   </p>  <p>The Guidelines set out a broad and accepted policy context for achieving sustainable development by balancing the need to ensure the highest standards of residential design which encompasses building lay-out, design and heights and the need to ensure efficient use of scarce land and infrastructural resources and the avoidance of urban sprawl.</p>  <p>  In particular, the Guidelines out line a range of densities appropriate to different location types, from lower densities in the range of 15 to 20 dwellings per hectare at the edges of smaller towns and villages for private site-type developments to densities in the range of 20 to 40 dwellings per hectare in more central or edge-of-centre sites in smaller towns, through to densities in the range of a minimum of 50 dwellings per hectare in larger urban areas along public transport corridors.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines also place a heavy emphasis on the importance of public infrastructure, such as public transport, community and sports facilities, as densities increase towards more central urban locations, and of the development plan process in securing effective sustainable urban development outcomes.</p>  <p>  However, the Guidelines do not set out specific policy advice in relation to height of buildings alone, in isolation from broader location, design and layout considerations nor would it be appropriate to do so, given variability in urban contexts and the inappropriateness of a &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; height policy for urban areas that can range from small villages to towns and cities and from suburban to city centre settings.  Rather, it is a matter for local authorities to ensure the appropriate application of the Guidelines in their statutory development plan and development management   processes.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Planning Framework, for which an initial public consultation process will be launched this week, will further develop the policy in this area, for example in relation to identifying potential to build up the population and economic vitality of city and town centre areas that in many cases have witnessed a sustained movement of people outwards to suburban and wider settings.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Office of the Planning Regulator, for which statutory underpinning will be provided later this year, it is intended that the Office will be able to evaluate and carry out assessments relating to planning policy matters and provide observations and recommendations in relation to those matters, to conduct reviews and examinations of local authority systems and procedures and to conduct education and training programmes, and research in relation to planning matters more broadly.  It is proposed that the Regulator may make recommendations to the Minister in relation to directing local authorities, as provided for under Section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, in respect of the development plan decisions of local authority elected members but the power to issue a direct ion should continue to be held by the Minister who is accountable to the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  I therefore consider existing national level policy on residential density and efficient use of urban land to be clear and that, through the National Planning Framework, a concerted effort must be made to achieve more effective translation and implementation of that policy in local authority areas through the existing planning processes.  </p></reply>

The scheme is part of the overall suite of social housing options and is an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.  Up to the end of December 2016, a total of 3,575 cases have been submitted under the MTR scheme.  Of these, 2,723 were ineligible or terminated during the process, 217 have been completed with 635 applications being actively progressed.  The reasons why a case has not progressed are varied and can depend on the lender, the property, the household and the ability of the Approved Housing Body sector to increase their involvement in the scheme.  Statistical information relating to the Mortgage to Rent Scheme since its inception is available on the Housing Agency&rsquo;s website at the following weblink: . </p><p>A number of amendments were made to the MTR Scheme in July 2015 to enable more properties to qualify for the scheme and to make the scheme more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  Notwithstanding the amendments already made, the Government is committed to supporting households in long-term mortgage arrears to remain in their homes and included a review of the MTR Scheme as an action in Rebuilding Ireland: An Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The review of the Mortgage to Rent scheme is now being finalised and I expect it will recommend a number of changes to the current scheme to make it work better for borrowers.</p></reply>

For an area to be designated a Rent Pressure Zone, it must satisfy the following criteria set out in section 24A(4) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended by section 36 of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016):</p><p>(i) The annual rate of rent inflation in the area must have been 7% or more in four of the last six quarters; and</p><p>(ii) The average rent for tenancies registered in the area with the RTB in the last quarter must be above the average national rent (the National Indicative Rent in the RTB s Rent Index Report) in the last quarter.</p><p>Following the enactment of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016, the Housing Agency reviewed the rental markets in certain counties nationally and identified nine housing authorities containing electoral areas that could potentially be Rent Pressure Zones.  The Housing Agency consulted with the relevant housing authorities regarding their views on the rental markets, including housing demand and supply, and their experiences in relation to the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), trends in relation to both general housing needs and homelessness and other relevant issues.</p><p>On the basis of this analysis, five housing authority areas were examined in more detail by the Housing Agency to identify local electoral area s with significant rental pressures.  The areas of Galway County, Limerick City and County, Louth and Waterford City and County were excluded by the Housing Agency from this more detailed analysis, as the preliminary analysis had indicated that these areas would not currently meet the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>On 24 January 2017 the Housing Agency proposed that 15 Local Electoral Areas in  the following five housing authority areas should be considered for designation: Cork County, Galway City, Kildare,  Meath and Wicklow. On foot of the proposal from the Housing Agency, and i n accordance with section 24A(2) of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004 (as amended), I requested the Director of the RTB to make a report to me as to whether these areas met the criteria for designation as Rent Pressure Zones. </p><p>On 26 January 2017, I received a report from the RTB confirming that 12 out of the 15 Local Electoral Areas examined met the criteria. As required by section 24A(5) of the Act, I made Orders designating the 12 Rent Pressure Zones on 26 January 2017. The Orders came into effect on 27 January 2017. Details of the areas that met the criteria and have been designated as Rent Pressure Zones are available on my Department s website at the following link:.</p><p>The Local Electoral Areas of Cobh, Maynooth and Greystones were found not to meet the criteria.</p><p>Under the Act, I have no further role or discretion in proposing areas for designation as Rent Pressure Zones or in deciding whether they should be designated. The designation process is independent and based on clear objective criteria and quantifiable evidence. </p><p>The Housing Agency will continue to monitor the rental market and may recommend further areas for designation. Where, following the procedures set out in the Act, it is found at a future date that additional areas meet the criteria, they will be designated as Rent Pressure Zones.</p></reply>

While communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.</p>  <p>  In recognition of the significant work undertaken in rural communities under the RSS, I announced, as part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, an additional 500 places for the scheme.  These places are available with effect from 1st February 2017 which brings the total overall number on RSS to 3,100 participants.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation on the scheme will continue to be limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must also be actively engaged in farming or fishing.  In future, all participants commencing on the RSS will have to be over 25 years of age.  I believe this is appropriate as it will give younger people an opportunity to explore other training or education options before entering a long-term work programme such as the RSS.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that almost 50% of the current participants have been on the RSS for over 10 years.  As a result, opportunities for new people to go on the scheme are very limited.  It is in this context that I have introduced a maximum six year participation limit on the scheme for participants commencing on or after 1st February 2017.  The six years can be continuous provided the participant remains eligible for the underlying payment.  The six year limit will ensure that there will be a throughput of places available.  In addition income support will still be available to eligible farmers and fishermen who are not on RSS in the form of Farm or Fish Assist. </p>  <p>  Existing RSS participants will remain on the scheme as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions of the scheme. The new conditions outlined above will only apply to RSS participants who commence on the scheme on or after 1st February 2017.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

That programme provides services to people whose travel needs are not met by existing bus or train services.  The Programme aims to enhance and sustain nationwide accessibility, through community based participation, particularly for those at risk of social exclusion.</p>  <p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) my Department may award a travel supplement in any case where the circumstances of the case so warrant.  The supplement is intended to assist with ongoing or recurring travel costs that cannot be met from the client s own resources and are deemed to be necessary.  Every decision is based on consideration of the circumstances of the case, taking account of the nature and extent of the need and of the resources of the person concerned.</p>  <p>  The Government decided that the detailed preparatory work required for a new Transport Support Scheme and associated statutory provisions should be progressed by the Minister for Health.  I am informed that the Minister for Health is seeking a solution which would best meet the aim of supporting people with severe disabilities who require additional income to contribute towards the cost of their mobility needs, while remaining within the available budget and satisfying all legal and equality concerns.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.

An initial report from the Commission is expected in Q2 2017.  Once this report is available, the Government intends to initiate negotiations on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement ahead of Budget 2018 considerations. These negotiations will be between the Government as employer and the public service trade unions and representative associations on behalf of public service workers. In that employer-employee negotiation context, the issue of pensioner representation in the talks does not arise.</p>  <p>  The interests and concerns of public service pensioners on public service pension issues have been regularly articulated in meetings between the Alliance of Retired Public Servants and my Department. This engagement has also included meetings between the Alliance and I and my predecessor as Minister. On that basis I believe the Alliance have had, and continue to be afforded, a meaningful and direct means of articulating their concerns in relation to pensions and related issues.</p>  <p>  This engagement by the Alliance  over several years past has been reflected in  legislated pension improvements for many public service pensioners. Specifically, many such pensioners are benefitting significantly from the substantial reversal of the Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR) based cuts to public service pensions imposed by way of the FEMPI legislation. This reversal, which will incur a cost estimated at &euro;90 million on a full-year basis in 2018, is happening in three stages under FEMPI 2015, with PSPR-affected pensioners getting pension increases via PSPR amelioration on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018. </p>  <p>  As I have previously indicated, it will be for Government in due course to consider the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages, as we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR restoration towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service.</p>  <p>  In addition, I would also point out that public service pensions payable to persons who retired before March 2012, although acknowledged to be based on higher salaries payable before the 2010 public service pay reductions, are subject to a more onerous PSPR treatment than that applying to later retirees.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2017, I have secured funding of &euro;12 million for an enhanced Town and Village Renewal scheme this year.  This represents a trebling of the original 2016 baseline allocation of &euro;4 million for the scheme.  The Town and Village Renewal Scheme for 2017 will be launched shortly and towns and villages to be included in the scheme will be selected through an application and assessment process.  The scheme will be funded by my Department and administered by the Local Authorities.  Details of the successful applicants will be published following the assessment process.  </p>  <p>  As part of the scheme, I intend to launch a pilot project separately, later in the year, to encourage residential occupancy in rural towns and villages.  This pilot will be launched in the second half of the year, when details of the scheme have been finalised in consultation with relevant Departments.  The pilot will examine ways in which properties that are currently not in use in town centres can be renovated to allow them to be used for residential purposes. </p>  <p>  My Department will also provide funding through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings, including the Built Heritage Investment Scheme, the Structures at Risk Fund and other initiatives operated by the Heritage Council.  These schemes will also contribute to the rejuvenation of towns and villages across the country.  </p></reply>

The HSE advises that a number of hospitals use parking revenue solely for maintenance and re-investment in parking facilities, including repayment of loans obtained for upgrading such facilities and investment in security. The remainder of hospitals use parking revenue to cover the cost of parking services, with any additional income being used to contribute to the general hospital budget, or to fund research or specific patient facilities. </p>  <p>  As demand for parking services at our hospitals increases, so too do the associated costs such as the initial capital costs of purchasing or renting parking areas; the cost of developing extra parking spaces; the need to provide and upgrade security systems in hospital car parks; staffing and general maintenance of parking services.  </p>  <p>  Obviously the costs in providing these services need to be recouped; provision of these services to visitors, staff and patients should not impact on hospital budgets intended to provide healthcare services to patients.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised that it does not have one single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals. Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances. Some hospitals do not provide public car parks while a minority of others do not charge a car parking fee.</p>  <p>  Hospitals which charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families particularly those with long-term illnesses. Consequently hospitals have introduced a maximum daily fixed parking charge, thus capping this expense. While there is no national HSE policy governing car park charges, the HSE advises that it keeps hospital parking charges under review.  </p>  <p>  In terms of the future development of our hospital system, we must take account of public transport services. This is evident in relation to the planned development of a new Children's Hospital. By supporting the expansion of public transport facilities, we continue to provide more transportation choices to the public when visiting their loved ones in our hospitals.

A 5 year deferral of people who have had a notifiable sexually transmitted infection has also been introduced.  In line with this, those who have had an STI such as chlamydia or genital herpes are deferred for five years after completion of treatment - persons who have had syphilis, gonorrhoea, lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) or granuloma inguinale are already permanently excluded from donating.  </p>  <p>  Persons who have taken medication to prevent HIV infection, i.e. pre or post exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP), are also deferred for a 5 year period.  A study published in the US in 2016 showed a sharp rise in STIs in men on PrEP and associated the use of PrEP with a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with an STI. </p></reply>

In 2006, the McKinsey report, Children's Health First, recommended that the population of Ireland and projected demand could support only one world-class tertiary paediatric centre, that this should be in Dublin and that it should ideally be co-located with a leading adult academic hospital, to ensure relevant sub-specialty and academic linkages.  The McKinsey report recognised the importance for quality of healthcare of having a critical mass of sub-specialist skills in a tertiary centre and stated this could be achieved firstly, by serving a large enough population to support a full complement of sub-specialists and secondly, by co-locating with an adult teaching hospital thus enabling access to specialties that encompass both adult and paediatric patients, facilitating clinical and academic &ldquo;cross fertilisation&rdquo;, and attracting the top staff.</p><p>Reviews since 2006 have reaffirmed the importance of co-location with a major adult academic teaching hospital.  In 2011, Minister Reilly established an Independent Review Group to examine the project at the Mater.  The clinical aspect of this review was carried out by a team of four Chief Executive Officers drawn from the National Association of Children's Hospitals (NACHRI) and the Children's Hospitals International Executive Forum (CHIEF).  Their report stated that <i>&ldquo;co-locating with tertiary adult and maternity hospitals is essential to the development of an excellent paediatric service.  This has become best practice internationally and was recognised in the McKinsey report.&rdquo;</i></p><p>In 2012, following the refusal of planning permission for the project at the Mater campus, Minister Reilly established the Dolphin Review Group to advise on next steps.  Their report stated that <i>&ldquo;Having reviewed the reports already prepared and considered their analysis and opinions, and having also consulted with a wide range of professionals in the field, we are also of the view that co-location is essential and tri-location optimal.  We recommend that the Minister remains on this path.</i>&quot;  Co-location with an adult hospital is the norm internationally, driven by four major advantages, namely access to adult specialists; access to expensive equipment (such as PET, MRI scanners); research and educational synergies; and facilitation of continuity in the care of the adolescent/young adult with chronic disease.  A clinicians' sub-group of the Dolphin Group examined issues relating to clinical specialties and sub-specialties, transitional care for adolescents, and the integration of paediatric health research and education in the new children's hospital.  From a clinical and academic perspective, the Dolphin Group identified St James's Hospital as the existing Dublin Academic Teaching Hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult partner in co-location because it has the broadest range of national specialties and excellent research and education infrastructure.</p><p>The Government decision to co-locate the hospital with St James's was announced on 6 November 2012.  In identifying the location, the Government considered the report of the Dolphin Group, and detailed supplementary information on cost, time and planning which was subsequently sought from those members of the Group with the relevant technical expertise.  The decision was made in the best interests of children, with clinical considerations paramount in the decision.</p><p>As announced in June 2015, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, which are readily accessible for paediatric and maternity patients on the shared campus.  Also, tri-location that delivers the most significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site will enhance the potential of research to drive best clinical outcomes.</p><p>Furthermore, excellence in modern paediatric practice cannot be achieved without an embedded culture of, and focus on, research, education and innovation.  More than a hospital, the new children's hospital and satellite centres will be a research-intensive academic healthcare institution.  To deliver this vision, the main facilities for research and innovation will be located at the Children's Research and Innovation Centre (CRIC) on the St James's campus.  The CRIC facility will be located adjacent to the Institute of Molecular Medicine, a cross university facility which delivers both undergraduate and postgraduate education and has a strong research platform in cancer, infection and immunity and neurosciences.  This direct adjacency reflects one of the many and significant opportunities being leveraged by co-locating on the campus with St James's Hospital, with its rich history in clinical research.

That decision is unequivocally supported by this Government and by me as Minister.  The planned new facilities will provide us with the means to deliver on improved health outcomes for children, especially the sickest children in Ireland.</p>  <p>  As announced in June 2015, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate in time to the St James's campus, achieving tri-location of adult, paediatric and maternity services.  The National Maternity Strategy, published in January 2016, reaffirms the delivery of tri-located maternity services on the campus with the new children's hospital and St James's Hospital.  A site for the proposed maternity hospital is identified in the Site Master Plan for the St James's campus, and the new children's hospital design has incorporated the required operational links with both maternity and adult hospitals.   </p>  <p>  The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the statutory body responsible for planning, designing, building and equipping the new children's hospital.  The granting of planning permission in April 2016 for the hospital, satellite centres and related buildings was a huge and very welcome milestone for the project. Enabling works (site clearance and demolition), which began this summer on the campus of St. James's, are advancing well.  </p>  <p>  The Children's Hospital Group Board is bringing together the three existing children's hospitals, with a focus on integrating into one organisation well before transitioning to the new children's hospital.  A General Scheme of a Bill is at an advanced stated to merge the three existing children's hospitals into a single hospital body in advance of the move to the new facilities, which will plan for the transition of services, integrate the existing services, and in due course run the new unified hospital.  </p>  <p>  The NPHDB has recently completed evaluation of the tenders, received at the end of October 2016, for the main and specialist contractors for the new children's hospital and for the two Paediatric OPD and Urgent Care Satellite Centres at Tallaght and Connolly Hospitals.  My priority is to make progress on the new hospital as soon as possible this year so we can ensure children, young people and their families have the facilities they need and deserve.</p></reply>

As part of this process the manufacturer must submit the price at which it is seeking reimbursement for its product. </p><p>Under Clause 6.2.1 of the Framework Agreement the maximum supplier proposed<b></b>price shall be no greater than the average of the currency-adjusted relevant price (being the ex- factory price or equivalent thereof and using the applicable exchange rate) applicable in such of the nominated states in which the medicine is available on the date of application.  Under Clause 6.2.3 medicines are also subject to an annual price realignment so as to ensure that prices in Ireland fall in line with prices in other basket countries.</p><p>Once submitted to the NCPE the product will then be assessed in terms of its safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at the price submitted.  The cost-effectiveness of the drug at the price submitted is factored into the NCPE's recommendation on whether or not the product should be reimbursed.</p><p>Following a recommendation from the NCPE the HSE enters into negotiations with manufacturers often seeking price reductions.  The HSE frequently seeks to address what it may regard as excessive pricing demands around new medicines so as to bring those medicines within the range of affordability.  </p><p>It is important to point out however that the HSE does not select the prices of patented medicines, that is determined by the pharmaceutical industry.  Therefore I would urge all pharmaceutical companies to submit pricing proposals which are affordable and sustainable and which represent value for money for the Irish health service, patients and the taxpayer.</p><p>Last December I also used the opportunity of the second Round Table meeting for European Health Ministers and CEO's/Heads of Europe-based pharmaceutical companies in Portugal to engage directly with the industry on drug pricing.  I stated the need for the pricing model adopted by industry to be both sustainable and affordable and noted that many companies need to fundamentally reassess their pricing model so that innovative medicines are available to patients with unmet needs.</p></reply>

When an emergency occurs it is the responsibility of the relevant Lead Government Department (LGD) to chair the National Emergency Co-ordination Group (NECG) which deals with the relevant emergency.  The Department of Health is currently LGD for two emergencies - Pandemic Influenza and Other Infectious Diseases, and Other Biological Incidents.</p>  <p>  The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is the forum for managing the interface between the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive and will manage the planning and response phases of public health response to any influenza pandemic.  The management of a pandemic influenza epidemic will be carried out in the context of the existing international framework, including the WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR's) which sets out an international system of preparedness and response for dealing with public health emergencies of international concern.  EU Decision No 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health also provides a coherent framework for tackling all serious cross-border public health threats at an EU level.  The EU Health Security Committee, which includes representatives from all EU Member States, is responsible for coordinating the response at EU level.  All responses will take into account the advice of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which provides rapid risk assessments of infectious disease outbreaks, advises actions to be taken to prevent or control their spread and provides support for dealing with outbreaks.</p>  <p>  As part of this process the HSE and hospitals should have their own National Emergency Plans in place to order to ensure a structured and timely response to a major emergency.</p></reply>

The Programme for Partnership Government commits to increasing the number of GP training places to 259 places annually.  In July 2016, the GP training intake increased from 157 to 172 places and the HSE's 2017 National Service Plan envisages a further increase, to 187 places this year.  I am anxious to achieve further increases in future years in order to ensure that the future manpower needs of general practice can be met.  In addition, I am cognisant of the need for a new GP services contract which will help modernise our health service and develop a strengthened primary care sector, and health service management have already progressed a number of significant measures through engagement with GP representatives in recent years.  The next phase of engagement on a new GP contract is under way and initial meetings with GP representative bodies have been held in January.  The GP contracts review process will, inter alia, seek to introduce further measures aimed at making general practice a fulfilling and rewarding career option into the future.</p>  <p>  There are many initiatives currently under way to improve nursing and midwifery staffing levels throughout the country.  The number of nursing and midwifery staff increased by 1,650 between December 2013 and December 2016.  The HSE is offering permanent posts to 2016 degree programme graduates, and full time permanent contracts to those in temporary posts. The HSE is also focused on converting agency staffing to permanent posts.  Its National Recruitment Service is actively operating rolling nursing recruitment campaigns.  The campaigns encompass General, Mental Health, Intellectual Disability and Registered Children's Nurses, and also Midwives.  The Acute Hospital Groups have advertised a number of Emergency Department nursing posts and are currently in the recruitment process.  The HSE ran a 3 day open recruitment event over the Christmas holiday period in Dr Steevens' Hospital for nurses and midwives from all disciplines who are interested in working in the Irish Public Health Service.  220 attended the event. 115 nursing and midwifery candidates were deemed successful and panelled following interview.  The files for successful candidates have passed to the contracting unit within National Recruitment Service, Manorhamilton.  This event will be followed by a series of careers events for nurses throughout 2017 with the next one scheduled for 31 March 2017.  A relocation package of up to &euro;1,500 continues to be available to nurses who return from overseas. </p>  <p>  The report of the Emergency Department Expert Group identified a need to take on additional nurses to care for boarded patients awaiting admission from Emergency Departments.  This is particularly where the number of patients awaiting admission occupy over 50% of the Emergency Department cubicle capacity for the hospital concerned. Having regard to the formula set out in the Report for calculating the required nursing compliment an additional 107 nursing and midwifery posts are to be created and filled to look after all admitted patients in Emergency Departments.  The Group also recommended that nursing numbers in Emergency Departments are brought to their full agreed staffing levels.  Of the 144 related posts that were vacant approximately half have been filled to date.  The current recruitment campaigns and others that are in the process of being developed will be used to fill the vacant Emergency Department posts and the additional 107 posts.</p>  <p>  It is Government policy to move to a consultant delivered service.  While the ratio of consultants to patients is lower in Ireland than in other countries, reflecting a historical low base, significant progress has been achieved.  There has been a large increase in the number of consultants since the establishment of the HSE, the number having increased by 956 from December 2004 to the end of 2016 (1,905 to 2,861 - Whole Time Equivalents).  There are some specialties in which there are international shortages and which have been traditionally difficult to fill.  This means that progress in improving the ratios is more difficult.  Shortages in specialties such as emergency medicine, anaesthesia and psychiatry are a worldwide phenomenon and not specific to the Irish health services.  The number of NCHDs has also increased significantly in the past decade, reflecting service demands and ongoing efforts to achieve full compliance with the requirements of the European Working Time Directive.  From 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2016 the number increased from 4,679 to 6,060 an increase of 1,381.</p></reply>

As a general principle, these processes and initiatives are informed by national and international best practice. </p><p>As the Deputy will appreciate, there are a range of initiatives under way across the health service in this regard.  I have sought to highlight some of these in this response.</p><p>My Department publishes the National Healthcare Quality Reporting System annually on its website.  This reports on the performance indicators that reflect on the quality of the healthcare provided at national, regional and hospital level, and allows for the comparison of the quality of healthcare and variation across our country and at international level.</p><p>As part of our suite of clinical effectiveness processes, National Clinical Guidelines, National Clinical Audit and Standards for Clinical Practice Guidance provide a robust evidence-based framework for improving and standardising service design and delivery.  These processes are informed by and benchmarked against international standards. To date, 14 National Clinical Guidelines in the areas of clinical deterioration, cancer and palliative care, hospital acquired infections and chronic diseases have been published by the National Clinical Effectiveness Committee (NCEC).  <font color="#212100">These are evidence based guidelines developed to international standards.</font></p><p>The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) undertakes health technology assessments which evaluates the clinical and cost effectiveness of health technologies such as drugs, equipment, diagnostic techniques and health promotion activities.  These assessments take account of international best practice and provide the basis for informing national policy, service decisions and National Clinical Guidelines. </p><p>There are a number of other efficiency and effectiveness tools in use, for example Activity Based Funding, and Value for Money reviews.</p><p>Activity Based Funding (ABF) is a new model for funding public hospital care.  It involves moving away from block grant budgets to a new system where hospitals are paid for the volume and quality of care provided.  Key benefits that are expected from the introduction of ABF include increased fairness in resource allocation, improved efficiency and increased transparency.</p><p>Under the current public spending code, the Department is required to work with the HSE on the rolling value for money (VFM) assessment of spending programmes.  This will be in the form of VFM and Policy Reviews and smaller Focused Policy Assessments.  As outlined in the my Department's new Statement of Strategy, the next VFM assessment will be a review of the costs of long-term residential facilities for older people within the public sector. </p><p>More generally, my Department and its agencies actively collaborate with international organisations conducting work in the area of health including the European Union, the World Health Organisation, the OECD and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK.  This includes participation in data collection initiatives.  International collaboration and engagement presents a useful opportunity for sharing research, best practice and expertise and provides an important input to national policy development.</p></reply>

I am advised that the practice of pair trawling in inshore waters and estuaries around Ireland is confined to fishing for sprat.  The Irish Wildlife Trust also identifies sprat as the target species for this activity.</p>  <p>  Sprat in Irish waters is not a species subject to fishing quotas or Total Allowable Catches established under EU regulation.  The International Council of the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) considers sprat to be a data limited stock which means that more detailed data is required in order to form a full understanding of the state of the stock. In order to address that paucity of accurate information in respect of sprat stocks in the waters around Ireland, a three year research project, partially funded by industry, began in October 2014 under the auspices of the Marine Institute in cooperation with Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.  </p>  <p>  This project aims to develop an accurate and detailed understanding of the stock structure of sprat around Ireland.  It will determine whether the sprat in Irish coastal waters is one stock or several separate stocks and it aims to increase our understanding of their role in the broader marine ecosystem. This data will in turn contribute to the ICES assessment of the vulnerability or otherwise of sprat in the waters around Ireland.  </p>  <p>  The central objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term through the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and the management of fisheries and fleets exploiting such resources.  </p>  <p>  Available scientific information is that sprat in Ireland spawn from January to June with a fishery normally taking place from October to Christmas.  This is a fortuitous situation, allowing some degree of reproductive output as the fishery takes place after the fish have been able to spawn.  The Marine Institute advise that there is no evidence that spawning sprat are or ever have been targeted in Irish fisheries nor is there evidence that sprat actually spawn inshore.  That of course is not to deny that they are easily targeted inshore when they occur there. </p>  <p>  I have also been informed  that the Marine Institute is actively pursuing the addition of sprat to the species covered under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund Marine Biodiversity Scheme, in 2017.  This would allow for more intensive data collection to enhance scientific knowledge and underpin any future efforts at management.</p></reply>

This provided additional time to these industries to comply with the limits set down for phosphorus applications.  This provision was included in the Nitrates Regulations, with the agreement of the Commission, as it was recognised that these industries faced a significant challenge in securing additional lands to comply in the first instance with the Nitrogen limits set down but more critically, to fully comply with the more limiting element for these sectors i.e. phosphorus. </p>  <p>  This provision was due to end at the end of 2010 but during the review of Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme in 2010, the difficulties faced by the industry as a result of (a) the dioxin crisis and (b) escalating feed costs was recognised and the transitional arrangement was further extended.</p>  <p>  The 2010 Regulations provided for a 2 year extension to the full transitional arrangement followed by the graduated reductions in 2013 (5kg/ha) and 2015 (3kg/ha) and full compliance with the Phosphorus limits by 2017.</p>  <p>  Since the introduction of the regulations, a number of measures have been introduced by my own Department which benefitted pig and poultry producers, such as access to grant aids schemes such as the current TAMS scheme, supporting the industry in achieving compliance. </p>  <p>  My Department also facilitated the streamlining of the submission of records for the movement of pig slurry and poultry manure.  Prior to the introduction of the Nitrates regulations records of movements of pig slurry and poultry manure were submitted to the EPA and there was also a requirement for a nutrient management plan to be prepared for a farmer importing pig slurry/poultry manure.  This is no longer the case and records are now submitted directly to my Department and a nutrient management plan is no longer required.  This has helped to remove a barrier to the use of these valuable fertilisers. </p>  <p>  I understand the concerns within the pig and poultry sectors to the ending of these transitional provisions and in particular the requirement of more lands for the recycling of these manures.  My Department has been in discussion with the IFA and has been following up on this matter, and has also been liaising with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government which is the lead Department with respect to these regulations. </p>  <p>  In order to assist the sector the following immediate action has been taken.</p>  <p>  - Pig slurry imported during the closed period of 2017 will count towards 2018, 170kg and nutrient limits.  This will provide a valve to allow slurry to be carried over to the following year from 2017.</p>  <p>  - In addition my Department has contacted Teagasc who will continue to promote the use of these manures as valuable fertilisers.</p>  <p>  GLAS pays farmers to apply slurry using low emission technologies.  The use of pig slurry to avail of this measure has been encouraged and my Dept. will continue to encourage its use.</p>  <p>  To conclude, the transitional provisions ended on 31 December 2016. However, through the implementation of the activities and measures as detailed above it is expected that the impact will be minimised.  I can assure you that my Department will continue to work to facilitate proposals brought forward by the sector to assist them in ensuring these valuable fertilisers are efficiently used on Irish farms. </p>  <p>  A full review of the regulations will commence shortly, including these specific provisions, led by the Department of Housing, Planning and local Government and assisted by my Department.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.</p><p>Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:  </p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,  </p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p><p>The map currently indicates that Dundrum falls within a BLUE area and is therefore expected to be covered by commercial operators and that Knockavilla falls within an AMBER area and will therefore will be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP. Individuals can check whether their premise is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.</p><p>The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. </p><p>My Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services. In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at , quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area. The Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, along with new industry investments and concrete, commitments by industry for further new investments within the proposed State Intervention Area.</p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides for a future proofed solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-02-01a.777.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1234" speakername="Denis Naughten" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017020100099#WRAA01400"><p>The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century.  The strategy for broadband rollout, the National Broadband Plan (NBP), aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State Intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.  </p>  <p>  It is the combination of the rollout of high speed broadband by commercial operators, on a commercial basis, and the State Intervention that will result in 100% broadband rollout.  </p>  <p>  A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services. </p>  <p>  Currently, approximately 1.4m premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband from commercial service providers and investment by the telecoms sector is continuing to expand this footprint. The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:  </p>  <p>  - The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services;</p>  <p>  - The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process. It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. The map provides information on a county by county basis with a breakdown of coverage across the townlands in every county. </p>  <p>  My Department is actively monitoring the commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all premises can get access to services. In this regard, direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in these areas cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at broadband@dccae.gov.ie, quoting their address and Eircode and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services. </p>  <p>  A formal procurement process is now in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area including over 41,000 premises in Co. Tipperary, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map and finalise this Intervention Area for bidders, taking into account any industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, along with new industry investments and concrete, commitments by industry for further new investments within the proposed State Intervention Area.</p>  <p>  The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution. This provides for a future proofed solution for the  25 years of the contract and beyond.  A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.  </p>  <p>  The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process. During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded. In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p>  <p>  In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage. The Taskforce report is available at the following link:http://www.dccae.gov.ie/communications/en-ie/Pages/Publication/Report-of-the-Mobile-Phone-and-Broadband-Taskforce.aspx.  </p>  <p>  I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 auction of the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band, to provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. </p>  <p>  These investments should assist in significantly improving the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country.</p></reply>

In the UK market, Enterprise Ireland is particularly working with companies who are most exposed in areas such as engineering, food, construction and timber to maintain their market share.</p>  <p>  EI will be implementing a UK Market Development plan which focusses on sustaining exports in key sectors such as construction, agritech, aerospace and engineering and also identifying new growth opportunities in financial services, infrastructure/public sector, as well as a renewed focus on Scotland.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland's Irish based team will also be enhanced with additional staff to provide various targeted supports and programmes to assist companies before they enter the market.  Training and supports in terms of management capability, leadership, marketing/sales skills, innovation and R&amp;D will help companies to build market share and create new market opportunities.  Enterprise Ireland will also deliver a suite of supports that help clients reduce supply-chain costs and drive efficiencies and cost reductions as a means of improving operating margins, thereby increasing competitiveness.</p>  <p>  In 2017, EI will also roll out the 'Global Ambition Campaign' which is a communications campaign to promote Irish companies and their products and services to international buyers. </p>  <p>  A key element of the 2017 drive for expanding our global export footprint include an enhanced programme of trade and investment missions, market study visits and inwards buyer visits from markets with specific sectoral opportunities.</p>  <p>  The plans have a specific emphasis on markets including the Eurozone, USA, Canada, Asia and the Middle East. EI's 2017 trade mission programme also outlines a number of trade missions to the UK focussing on key sectors including construction, engineering, consumer products and Agritech.</p></reply>

These negotiations could take the maximum allowed period of two years to complete.  Ultimately any deal on Article 50 will require the agreement of the EU Commission, Council and Parliament.</p>  <p>  There is a whole of Government approach in place focusing on Brexit issues and my Department and its agencies are to the forefront of this effort.  In advance of the UK Referendum my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across policy areas of my Department.  We have refined our analysis post-Referendum and we have been working with Agencies to put in place actions to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities.</p>  <p>  It is hard to predict at this stage the full impact of Brexit.  Much will depend on the nature of the future trade deal that will be negotiated between the EU and the UK.  These negotiations are likely to be complex and multifaceted.  The extent of the impact which Brexit would have on the Irish agrifood sector would depend on a range of factors.  Of these, the UK's future trading relationship with the EU is a key factor for the agri-food sector in Ireland and an area of high focus for the Government.  Promoting diversified export markets in light of the potential impacts of Brexit is a key priority for my Department.  This includes markets that are growing and have scale as well as markets where we are already well established but with potential for further growth.  The programme of trade missions and trade events for 2017 includes a substantive focus on the EU and third country markets.  In 2017 we have 42 Minister led trade missions to existing and emerging markets.</p>  <p>  We continue to work to promote Irish trade in the UK and Europe, our most traditional markets that still account for 65-70% of all Irish food exports.  Irish exports to mainland Europe have grown steadily and this market will continue to provide a destination for agri products and other categories of exports that may be challenged by exposure to the UK market.  These have been reoriented to reflect an increased focus on EU markets.</p>  <p>  In addition the recently signed Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada provides for a significant opening up of agrifood trade which will provide full unrestricted access for Irish beef and other meat products to the Canadian market.  Over the years, Ireland has developed an important pig-meat export trade to Canada and now there is potential to develop the export business for Irish beef and lamb also.  The removal of the Canadian import tariff of 26.5% will benefit Irish meat exporters.  CETA also provides significant new opportunities for the Irish dairy industry.</p>  <p>  The value of agriculture exports to emerging markets in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Central/South America stood at almost &euro;2.2 billion in 2015.  The value of trade to these markets increased by 82% in the period 2010 to 2015.  Exports to these markets now accounts for 21% of total food and drink exports compared to 16% in 2010.  This growth in share of exports occurred during a period when total food and drink exports jumped by more than 45%.</p>  <p>  Growth to emerging markets has been led by Asia with trade growing by more than 250% to &euro;955 million led by China, which recorded a fourfold increase.  Exports to other Asian markets more than doubled over the period to &euro;300 million.  Exports to the Middle East jumped by a third to &euro;380 million.</p>  <p>  My Department through Enterprise Ireland is engaged in ongoing Trade Missions to these markets in co-operation with Bord Bia, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and representatives from the agrifood sector.</p></reply>

While operational responsibility for these do not fall within my policy remit as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I support the extension of parental leave for parents; particularly in the crucial first year.  The Government has provided additional support for stay-at-home parents through the home carer tax credit, which has been increased to &euro;1,100 per year. I support an increase in the earnings threshold for this, and have raised this with the Minister for Finance. </p><p>It is important to recognise that the Affordable Childcare Scheme is only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children.  The provision of improved services for centre-based care is very important, but I will not lose sight of the needs of children who do not attend them.  In this regard, <i>Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People</i>contains a commitment to produce Ireland's first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years).  The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is well advanced. In December I hosted an Open Policy Debate on the strategy with a view to completion of the strategy this year.</p><p>My Department also provides a number of childcare schemes which are available to all families, both working parents and parents who choose to stay at home to care for their children.  The ECCE free pre-school programme has been extended from September 2016 - children's eligibility for ECCE has increased from 38 weeks for all children, to an average of 61 weeks (ranging from 51 to 88 weeks depending on date of birth and age starting school).  The Affordable Childcare Scheme will also be open for all families, whether or not they are in employment.</p><p>The Affordable Childcare Scheme responds to a specific need to increase the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.  It also reflects a core recommendation of the 2015 Inter-Departmental Group on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland to replace the existing targeted childcare schemes, which are administratively complex and inadequate in terms of accessibility, with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The Scheme also responds specifically to the high cost of childcare in Ireland, which has been criticised by the European Commission and Irish families. </p><p>Quality assurance will be an absolute prerequisite for participation in the Affordable Childcare Scheme and the Scheme will not be limited to centre-based providers. The Scheme will be open to all Tusla-registered childcare providers, including Tusla-registered child minders.  Child minders who mind three or fewer pre-school children in the child minder's own home are exempt from the Child Care Regulations, and are thus not subject to inspection by Tusla.  In order to meet the needs of parents whose preference is to use a child minder under the Affordable Childcare Scheme, and to build capacity to cater for increased demand in future years, the Department has commenced talks with Childminding Ireland (CMI) in recent months to explore a number of options around how quality can be assured within the child minding sector. </p><p>A Working Group has been established, chaired by CMI, and including officials from Tusla and the DCYA, to make recommendations on reforms and supports for the sector in the short, medium and long term, and the feasibility and implications of the migration from voluntary to mandatory regulation.  These will include recommendations in relation to child minders who are not currently eligible to apply for registration with Tusla (those minding three or fewer pre-school children, or those minding school age children only).</p></reply>

This was undertaken in order to enhance operational readiness and deployability, while reducing the number of personnel involved in administration.  This re-organisation led to a re-configuration of the Defence Forces operational processes, from a garrison-based system to a more flexible, deployable system that makes more efficient use of all resources, including personnel.</p>  <p>  All members of the Defence Forces reassigned under the Defence Forces Reorganisation Plan 2012 were entitled to Change of Station Allowance in circumstances where they meet the qualifying criteria.  The Defence Forces Personnel Support Service had a representative in every Barrack or Installation to which personnel were being reassigned and these individuals are in a position, using both internal and external resources to provide the necessary supports to the redeploying personnel and their families if applicable, as was previously provided during Barrack closures and redeployments. </p>  <p>  While functions moved between locations under the reorganisation, every effort was made to limit to relocation of personnel from their existing locations, insofar as was practicable.  The movement and transfer of Officers across locations throughout the country has always been and will continue to be a feature of an Officer's career, which is essential to their career and experiential development within the Defence Forces.  I am advised by the military authorities that every effort is made to limit the disruption to personnel and to relocate personnel closer to home as opportunities arise.  I understand that the military authority authorities take due consideration of personnel circumstances where possible.</p></reply>
