    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-15a.18.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500058#WRA01700"><p>As the Deputy will be aware, under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts is the responsibility of the Courts Service.  Section 4(3) of the 1998 Act provides that the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which includes the provision of information on the courts system.  However, to be of assistance I have made inquires with the Courts Service and they have provided the figures requested by the Deputy which I am including by way of a tabular statement.  It should be noted that where a summons is struck out not served, the summons can be reissued at the request of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, so a number of the offences listed as struck out for non-service are likely to have been reissued. </p><p>The figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that a significant percentage of cases are struck out for non-service.  My officials are seeking clarification from the Courts Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to the reason for this figure being at this level. It should however be noted in this respect that a working group was established by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to examine how the rate of summons serving can be improved and to regularly monitor the level of summons service throughout the country.  While this group has reported improvements in the rate of successful service of summons, challenges remain in relation to effecting service of summons in certain circumstances, relating to such matters as inaccurate address data, persons moving address, or living in multi-occupancy dwellings or other settings which make service difficult.  In addition, certain persons will take steps to evade service.  Similar difficulties are experienced by many other police forces.</p><p>I would like thank the Deputy for raising the serious issue of speeding on our roads.  The increase in the number of road traffic fatalities in the year to date highlights the need to continue to deploy all effective measures to reduce speeding, and therefore road traffic collisions.  </p><p>The Deputy will appreciate that road traffic enforcement is an operational matter and, as such, is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.  I am advised that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Roads Policing Operations Plan 2016 incorporates a programme of high visibility road safety and enforcement operations, carried out in partnership with other state agencies.  The focus of the Roads Policing Operations Plan for 2016 is on the most vulnerable road user categories of motor cyclists, pedal cyclists, pedestrians and learner permit holders. Garda operations specifically target road use behaviour known to contribute significantly to collisions, including speeding.  Road traffic legislation is also enforced as part of the day to day duties of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Both targeted and general methods of enforcement have a valuable role to play in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's enforcement programme, which targets locations with a view to preventing the commission of offences, detecting errant motorists, changing their behaviour and ultimately reducing death and injuries on our roads. </p><p>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 also sets out key strategic objectives for Roads Policing which will inform and guide An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s Road Policing plans over the next 5 years.  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the significant investment in Garda resources currently underway. This investment is closely associated with delivery on the Modernisation and Renewal Programme. </p><p>In addition, I will be meeting the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport later this month at the biannual Ministerial Committee on Road Safety, which oversees the implementation of the Road Safety Strategy and provides a forum for high-level discussion of road safety issues. </p><p>In so far as the recording of driver licences is concerned, the Courts Service has taken the following steps:</p><p>-  All summonses issued in respect of alleged offences under the Road Traffic Acts include a specific provision that notifies the person accused of the offence that he/she must bring to the court their driving licence/driving permit and a legible copy of their driving licence or learner permit; </p><p>- Court Registrars, following consultation with the presiding Judge, make an announcement in the court to the effect that as required by the summons, persons must produce their driving licence/permit and a copy thereof to the Registrar once their case is called;</p><p>- Where a driving licence/learner permit or copy thereof is produced and the accused is convicted of the offence, the Registrar records the driving licence number for the purpose of subsequently transferring the driving licence number to the Department of Transport for the application of penalty points;</p><p>- Where a driving licence/learner permit or copy thereof is not produced, the Registrar records this fact on the summons/minute book.</p><p>Road safety is of course a shared responsibility and it is incumbent upon us all to play our part by driving within the speed limit. </p><p>Table 1 - Report on the Number of Speeding Offences listed for Court between 1 Jan 2015 and 31 December 2015 and

This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide-ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 12 have been assigned to the Cork City Division.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November, which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based  training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016-2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Cork City Division, like all other Garda Divisions, will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Cork City Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan="3"><div><b>Cork City Division 31 Oct 2010</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>ANGLESEA STREET DISTRICT</td><td>ANGLESEA STREET</td><td><div>281</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BARRACK STREET</td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKROCK</td><td><div>30</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRIDEWELL</td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td><div>353</div></td></tr><tr><td>GURRANABRAHER DISTRICT</td><td>BALLINCOLLIG</td><td><div>22</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLARNEY</td><td><div>17</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GURRANABRAHER</td><td><div>60</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDUFF GRENAGH</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td><div>101</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAYFIELD DISTRICT</td><td>MALLOW ROAD</td><td><div>5</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYFIELD</td><td><div>59</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MC CURTAIN STREET</td><td><div>0</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WATERCOURSE ROAD</td><td><div>48</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td><div>112</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOGHER DISTRICT</td><td>BISHOPSTOWN</td><td><div>23</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIGALINE</td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROSSHAVEN</td><td><div>3</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOUGLAS</td><td><div>28</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PASSAGE WEST</td><td><div>4</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOGHER</td><td><div>59</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td><div>138</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY DIVISION</td><td>18 Stations</td><td><div>704</div></td></tr></table><div></div><table><tr><th colspan="3"><div><b>Cork City Division 30 Sept 2016</b></div></th></tr><tr><td>ANGLESEA STREET DISTRICT</td><td>ANGLESEA STREET</td><td><div>277</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKROCK</td><td><div>25</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRIDEWELL</td><td><div>27</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>329</div></td></tr><tr><td>GURRANABRAHER DISTRICT</td><td>BALLINCOLLIG</td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLARNEY</td><td><div>18</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIG NA BHFEAR</td><td><div>1</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GURRANABRAHER</td><td><div>52</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL </td><td><div>91</div></td></tr><tr><td>MAYFIELD DISTRICT</td><td>GLANMIRE</td><td><div>19</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYFIELD</td><td><div>51</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WATERCOURSE ROAD</td><td><div>45</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>115</div></td></tr><tr><td>TOGHER DISTRICT</td><td>BISHOPSTOWN</td><td><div>21</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIGALINE</td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROSSHAVEN</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOUGLAS</td><td><div>20</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PASSAGE WEST</td><td><div>2</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOGHER</td><td><div>48</div></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td><div>113</div></td></tr><tr><td>CORK CITY DIVISION</td><td>16 Stations</td><td><div>648</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through: </p>  <p>- an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>- the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>- the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave; and</p>  <p>- the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid.</p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court.</p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership.  This was a very welcome decision by the Garda Associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.</p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course.</p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions, including that of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost.</p>  <p>  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard officials of both Departments have had an initial discussion on the issues.  The question of the publication of revised Estimates is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's  recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-15a.28.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500058#WRA02300"><p>Crime statistics are compiled by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) based on PULSE data and the statistics for Kerry Garda Division reflect all crime incidents recorded by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for that area.  The Deputy will be aware that in the most recent CSO figures, for Quarter 2 of 2016, there were decreases in many crime categories.  This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor and in the Kerry Garda Division the figures show a reduction in Burglary of 32%.</p><p>In recent times, the CSO has carried out two important reviews of the quality of crime statistics, following on concerns raised in the 2014 Report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation.  The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country.</p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate.  The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area.</p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar.  This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Gardai directly on PULSE.</p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised.  As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.</p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.  In this regard, I understand that the CSO intends to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been.</p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.</p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report.</p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.</p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE</th></tr><tr><td>Co.

Drafting of the Domestic Violence Bill is at an advanced stage.  It is my intention that the Bill will be submitted for Government approval and published during the current D&aacute;il session.  The Second National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021 was published by me in January.  A multi-annual action plan to enable ratification of the Council of Europe Istanbul Convention is part of the action plan of the second national strategy.  The Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill is also being drafted for publication as a priority.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also wish to note I recently announced the awarding of contracts for a national awareness campaign as part of the Second National Strategy.  The campaign will be launched tomorrow and it is intended that it will run for a period of 6 years up to 2021, subject to the continued availability of the necessary funding.  The overall aim of the campaign is to increase the awareness of domestic and sexual violence, to bring about a change in long established societal behaviours and attitudes and to activate bystanders with the aim of decreasing and preventing this violence.  It will recognise that women and men are victims of such crimes.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency is the primary funder for refuges and that this a matter for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;ochana Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure.</p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the measures that the Garda Commissioner outlined at her meeting last June with the Policing Authority.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published its Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda members and civilians have been informed of this policy.  In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.</p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints or allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority.  To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints or allegations in a safe environment where their complaints or allegations are properly investigated.</p>  <p>  The Policing Authority has completed its review and reported to me last week.  The Report was published on my Department's website on Friday and has been laid before both Houses in accordance with the Act.  The Report contains a number of recommendations almost all of which have been accepted by the Commissioner and I understand that a revised version of the Policy will be published by the Commissioner shortly.  The Commissioner is committed to providing an environment in which protected disclosures can be made in full knowledge that persons making such disclosures will be supported and protected in the workplace.</p>  <p>  All of this points to significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures.</p>  <p>  I am aware of a number of instances where there have been allegations that individuals have been subjected to bullying and harassment.  I would again make the point that all of us in this House must be very careful in discussing individual cases of whistleblowing.  Protection for whistleblowers rightly prioritises the confidentiality of the process, which is central to the efficacy of the process, so I do not propose to discuss individual cases.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that she is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled &ldquo;Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment", outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.  The main objective of the policy is to achieve a safe and harmonious working environment that encourages and supports the right to dignity at work.  I am informed that the Commissioner has established  an internal Garda Working Group to review the current practice and policies in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and this work is currently ongoing.</p></reply>

This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide-ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.  The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year.  It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there will be four intakes of 200 trainee Garda in 2017 scheduled for 13 February, 2 May, 8 August and 6 November giving a total intake of 800 trainee Garda.</p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November.  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that another 900 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest in 2017 which when taking account of projected retirements will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end.</p></reply>

The Deputy will be aware that in the most recent CSO figures, for Quarter 2 of 2016, there were decreases in many crime categories. This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor and in Louth Garda Division the figures show a reduction in Burglary of 24%.</p><p>In recent times, the CSO has carried out two important reviews of the quality of crime statistics, following on concerns raised in the 2014 Report of the Garda Inspectorate on Crime Investigation. The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country.</p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate. The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area.</p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Garda&iacute; directly on PULSE.</p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised. As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process. This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.</p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics. In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been.</p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021.</p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report.</p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021. This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.</p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data. <table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE</th></tr><tr><td>Louth</td><td>None</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Within that policy coordination role, my priorities for 2017 are as follows:</p>  <p>  1. Ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities: Work is underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  It is intended that the Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty, as well as removing archaic references in existing legislation relating to mental health.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department's website.  It is expected that the Bill will be published shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention by end-2016.</p>  <p>  2. Implementation of the Comprehensive Employment Strategy (CES) for People with Disabilities: The role of the Department of Justice and Equality in relation to the CES is to monitor progress and ensure that the Strategy is implemented.  A key priority for 2017 is to progress the increase in the statutory public service employment target of people with disabilities on a phased basis as set out in the Strategy from 3% to 6% over the life time of the Strategy. Work will begin on this in early 2017.</p>  <p>  3. The commencement and implementation of the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy: I expect to be in a position shortly to finalise the new National Disability Inclusion Strategy, and present it at Cabinet for sign-off, so as to facilitate the publication of the Strategy by end-2016.</p>  <p>  4. Funding: In so far as the Department of Justice and Equality is concerned, there is an annual budget allocation of &euro;250,000 for the provision of disability awareness grants.  The 2017 allocation for the National Disability Authority is &euro;3.804m.  There are no proposals to reduce this funding to meet commitments elsewhere.</p></reply>

The result of this work was a roadmap to ratification, which was published on 21 October 2015 and which outlines the considerable legislative changes to be undertaken to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, along with the estimated deadline of end-2016 for ratification.  The Roadmap to Ratification, which is available on my Department's website, sets out the substantial legislative agenda required for ratification. Since publication of the Roadmap, work has continued on a bilateral basis between my Department and the other relevant Departments to progress each of the specific issues identified.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome barriers to Ireland's ratification.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity. The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 commenced its second stage reading in the D&aacute;il on 5 October.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on drawing up an Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.

This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.</p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country.</p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 5 have been assigned to the Mayo Division.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Mayo Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Mayo Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan="3">MAYO DIVISION 31 OCT 2010</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BALLINA</td><td>BALLINA</td><td>50</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYCASTLE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BONNICONLON</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROSSMOLINA</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLALA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LAHARDANE           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>BELMULLET</td><td>BALLYCROY           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BANGOR ERRIS</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BELLACORICK</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BELMULLET           </td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKSOD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLENAMOY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>26</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLEBAR</td><td>BALLA</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYGLASS</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYVARY           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEBAR           </td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GARDA INFO SERVICES  </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLENISLAND</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PARTRY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOURMAKEADY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLEBAR</td><td>TOTAL</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINDINE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINROBE</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLAREMORRIS</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CONG</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HOLLYMOUNT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILMAINE</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KNOCK</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHRULE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>CLAREMORRIS           </td><td>TOTAL</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYHAUNIS</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CHARLESTOWN</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FOXFORD</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILKELLY</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILTIMAGH           </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SWINFORD</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>WESTPORT</td><td>ACHILL SOUND</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KEEL</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LOUISBURGH</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULRANNY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWPORT</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WESTPORT</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>40 Stations</td><td>321</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="3">MAYO DIVISION 30 SEPT 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BALLINA</td><td>BALLINA</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BONNICONLON</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROSSMOLINA</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FOXFORD</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLALA</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>BELMULLET</td><td>BALLYCROY           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BANGOR ERRIS</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>B&Eacute;AL AN MHUIRTHEAD</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLEANN NA MUAIDHE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td>CASTLEBAR</td><td>BALLA</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEBAR           </td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PARTRY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>79</td></tr><tr><td>CLAREMORRIS           </td><td>BALLINDINE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINROBE</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYHAUNIS</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CHARLESTOWN</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLAREMORRIS</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CONG</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILKELLY</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILMAINE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILTIMAGH           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KNOCK</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHRULE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SWINFORD</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>91</td></tr><tr><td>WESTPORT</td><td>ACHILL SOUND</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KEEL</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>LOUISBURGH</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWPORT</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WESTPORT</td><td>31</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>MAYO</td><td>29 Stations</td><td>299</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country.</p>  <p>  The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate. The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area.</p>  <p>  I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.

Both Governments have publicly declared their commitment to ensuring no return to a so-called 'hard border' on the island of Ireland. There are excellent relations at official and political level in relation to enhancing the operation of the Common Travel Area and we are committed to that continuing.  </p>  <p>  In that regard, a central feature of the operation of the CTA has been that each State enforces the other's conditions of landing for non-EEA nationals, thus protecting each other's borders. In addition, cooperation extends across a number of other areas including the sharing of information and at an operational level on enforcement. For example, on the information front, earlier this year new arrangements to allow for the sharing of Advanced Passenger Information between Ireland and the UK in order to further enhance the integrity of the Common Travel Area were introduced. The development of the British-Irish Visa System was facilitated by this arrangement and indeed could not have happened without the electronic sharing of information such as biometrics. </p>  <p>  The practical impact of BREXIT on the operation of the CTA, including in respect of Non-EEA nationals, is being considered between officials of the Department and the UK Home Office, including at meetings of the Common Travel Area Forum jointly chaired by the Director General of the INIS and his UK counterpart.</p></reply>

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:</p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;</p>  <p>  - the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. </p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. </p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership. This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.</p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. </p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost. </p>  <p>  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's  recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.</p></reply>

A significant number of these, 6,434, were persons imprisoned for very short periods for non-payment of fines, who were granted early release shortly thereafter.  The Irish Prison Service publishes figures in relation to the number of prisoners currently on temporary release on their website <i>www.irishprisons.ie </i>on a daily basis. </p><p>Each application for Temporary Release is considered on its individual merits and a number of factors are taken into account when making a decision on whether to grant temporary release including the nature of the offence, whether or not the person is a first-time offender, and whether the person poses a threat to public safety.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service Recidivism study for 2010 shows that 2,561 persons out of a total of 9,339 that were released in that year went on to re-offend within the first 6 months of release.  As well as offences committed after expiration of sentence,<b></b>this figure also includes offences committed before their official release date and this would take account of crimes committed while on early release, day release, and compassionate release.  It also includes offences committed while in custody such as assaults and possession of mobile phones.</p><p>These figures were produced in partnership with the Central Statistics Office using a combination of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Irish Prison Service records, based on the Irish Crime Classification System.  The study, which was published on 10 November 2016, looked at the available data up to the end of 2013 to take account of the time to make a conviction and a broader 3 year analysis of recidivism. </p><p>I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that literacy supports form an important element of the prison education curriculum.  The literacy curriculum concentrates on the needs of the individual and aims to improve self-esteem and build confidence. </p><p>All prisoners who come into the Education Centre of each prison have an individual interview to assess their educational attainments, needs and interests.  Those with literacy difficulties are identified at this stage and are prioritised for support. Such prisoners are asked to undertake the Adult Basic Education test to assess their literacy levels.</p><p>The Irish Prison Service is currently exploring the feasibility of surveying the prison population using the 8 key competences for lifelong learning as defined by the European Commission.  These include literacy and language competence along with mathematical and digital competence.  Expressions of Interest have been sought from Irish Universities to enter into a research partnership with the Irish Prison Service to undertake this survey.</p><p>I can inform the Deputy that the education service in Irish Prisons devotes considerable resources to the provision of basic literacy education for persons in custody.  In conjunction with this professional service the Irish Prison Service facilitates a peer led basic literacy service amongst persons in custody called &ldquo;Toe by Toe&rdquo; where those with poor literacy and/or learning difficulties are mentored by individual volunteers who are also persons in custody but who receive specific training in this regard.</p><p>The Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills on a partnership basis provides the Irish Prison Service with 220 whole time equivalent teaching posts.  I am informed by officials in the Irish Prison Service that many of these educators have completed modular courses in dyslexia, ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages), adult literacy etc, and frequently work with students in prison on a one-to-one basis.</p></reply>

The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure. My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in State provided accommodation.  </p>  <p>  On this particular point, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. </p>  <p>  A transition Task Force was established in 2015 and put in place important supports to facilitate people with status moving into and integrating with the community. The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months. </p>  <p>  Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in State provided accommodation while their application is being processed is also being made. In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago. Prescription fees for all those in receipt of the Direct Provision allowance, including children, have also been waived. The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017.</p>  <p>  The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, which is responsible for the management and administration of accommodation and ancillary services to protection applicants in state provided accommodation, is actively progressing the implementation of other recommendations in the Report around access to cooking facilities and the increase in living space for those who avail of State provided accommodation.  Pilot projects are being undertaken in a number of centres to ensure the best approach to realising these objectives and ensuring that those residing in the direct provision system continue to be treated with respect and dignity.</p>  <p>  RIA are also working on the development of standards for the provision and maintenance of services in accommodation centres, enhancing the complaints mechanisms for residents of those centres and the provision of ongoing diversity and equality training and awareness programmes across all centres.</p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 10 have been assigned to the Wicklow Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Wicklow Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Wicklow Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan="3">WICKLOW DIVISION 31 OCT 2010</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BALTINGLASS           </td><td>BALTINGLASS</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLESSINGTON</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARNEW</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DONARD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNLAVIN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HOLLYWOOD           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHILLELAGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TINAHELY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>BRAY</td><td>BRAY</td><td>136</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENNISKERRY</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GREYSTONES</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWTOWNMOUNTKENNEDY  </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>182</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>ARKLOW</td><td>37</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ASHFORD</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AUGHRIM</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AVOCA</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDRUM</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROUNDWOOD           </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WICKLOW</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>111</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>19 Stations</td><td>360</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="3">WICKLOW DIVISION 30 SEP 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BALTINGLASS           </td><td>BALTINGLASS</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLESSINGTON</td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARNEW</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DUNLAVIN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHILLELAGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TINAHELY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>BRAY</td><td>BRAY</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENNISKERRY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GREYSTONES</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWTOWNMOUNTKENNEDY  </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>144</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>ARKLOW</td><td>34</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ASHFORD</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AUGHRIM</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>AVOCA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDRUM</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROUNDWOOD           </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>WICKLOW</td><td>48</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>94</td></tr><tr><td>WICKLOW</td><td>17 Stations</td><td>304</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Under the Act, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) is now the prescribed body authorised to receive protected disclosures on Garda matters.  </p>  <p>  Accordingly, members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may communicate their concerns to the Garda Commissioner, as their employer if they so choose, or they may make a disclosure directly to GSOC.  Where a protected disclosure is made to GSOC, the Act provides that GSOC may, if it appears to it desirable in the public interest to do so, investigate the disclosure. </p>  <p>  It is important to recognise the very significant fact that a member of the Garda&iacute; who makes a disclosure in accordance with the Act is entitled to all the protections provided for whistleblowers in the Act.  These protections include protection from having their identity revealed, protection from dismissal and protection from being penalised in their employment as a result of having made a protected disclosure.</p>  <p>  The Deputy is no doubt aware of the measures that the Garda Commissioner outlined at her meeting last June with the Policing Authority. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have published their Protected Disclosures Policy and all Garda Members and civilians have been informed of this policy. In addition the Garda Commissioner has appointed a Protected Disclosures Manager who will be supported with a dedicated and properly trained team. The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been working with Transparency International Ireland and other external providers to create an environment to ensure that whistleblowers are protected and supported.</p>  <p>  In light of the public interest in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na having robust policies and procedures in place to support and protect whistleblowers and to ensure that their complaints or allegations are fully investigated, I signalled during the D&aacute;il debate on the O'Higgins Report that I would refer certain matters to the independent Policing Authority. To that end, I wrote to the Authority on 2 June 2016 requesting that in accordance with section 62O(6) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 (as amended) they submit a report on the policies and procedures in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with whistleblowers/whistleblowing.  I also asked that they make any recommendations that they consider appropriate in order to ensure that the policies and procedures in place are appropriate and can provide assurance that whistleblowers can make complaints or allegations in a safe environment where their complaints or allegations are properly investigated. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority has completed its review and reported to me last week.  The Report was published on my Department's website on Friday and has been laid before both Houses in accordance with the Act.  The Report contains a number of recommendations almost all of which have been accepted by the Commissioner and I understand that a revised version of the Policy will be published by the Commissioner shortly.  The Commissioner is committed to providing an environment in which protected disclosures can be made in full knowledge that persons making such disclosures will be supported and protected in the workplace.  </p>  <p>  All of this points to significant changes in the regime for making protected disclosures by members of the Garda&iacute; and the significant protections afforded to those who make protected disclosures.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner has assured me that she is committed to providing a positive and supportive working environment for all Garda personnel.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's Dignity at Work Policy, entitled &ldquo;Working Together to Create a Positive Working Environment", outlines the policy and procedures for dealing with Harassment, Sexual Harassment and Bullying in the Workplace.  The main objective of the policy is to achieve a safe and harmonious working environment that encourages and supports the right to dignity at work.  I am informed that the Commissioner has established  an internal Garda Working Group to review the current practice and policies in place in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  and this work is currently ongoing.</p></reply>

Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed.  The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway.  This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma.  It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year.  As part of Phase 3, regional public consultations took place from 22 September 2016 - 27 September 2016; I attended two of those consultations (in Dublin and in Athlone, respectively) and I am delighted to report that overall attendance and participation were encouraging and positive.  Feedback from those consultation sessions is being collated by my officials and the draft Inclusion Strategy will be updated accordingly.  I plan to submit the final draft of the Inclusion Strategy to Government shortly for consideration and sign-off.</p>  <p>  The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy.  In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society.  This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition.  As such, there are no plans to introduce new legislation in this regard.  The key benefit is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced. Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; creates a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue.</p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue.  The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way.  My officials and I are currently working to advance this issue with national Traveller organisations in this regard.</p></reply>

This landmark new Bill will introduce for the first time statutory rights for victims of crime.  The Bill is being drafted as a priority and I expect to publish it during the current D&aacute;il session. </p>  <p>  The Bill will transpose into Irish law Directive 2012/29/EU establishing minimum standards on the rights, support and protection of victims of crime fulfilling a commitment in the Programme for Government to enact legislation to strengthen the rights of victims of crime and their families.</p>  <p>  At an operational level, arrangements have been put in place to ensure that rights conferred by the Directive are provided to crime victims both within existing legislation and on a non-statutory basis.  In practical terms this has meant that most of the rights conferred by the Directive are currently being made available for victims.</p></reply>

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. </p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate. The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area. </p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Garda&iacute; directly on PULSE. </p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised. As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process. This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.</p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics. In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been. </p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. </p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report. </p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021. This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.  </p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data. <table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE</th></tr><tr><td>Co.

The Government is also firmly of the view that it is necessary to provide a platform for the promotion of excellence and high standards of conduct by judges.</p><p>The Deputy will recall that the current Legislation Programme includes the Judicial Council Bill among those Bills whose publication this Session is a priority.  Work on the drafting of the Bill is continuing in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General and my Department is working closely with that Office to bring that work to a timely conclusion in order to ensure publication within the timeframe set out in the Legislation Programme.  Furthermore, my Department continues to be engaged in extensive consultations both with the Judiciary and the Courts Service in relation to ongoing drafting work.  The Bill has benefitted from past review by the judiciary who considered it as part of the work of the Interim Judicial Council which has been established pending the Bill&rsquo;s enactment.  </p><p>The Bill, when published, will provide for the establishment of a Judicial Council and Board of that Council.  It will also provide for the establishment of a Judicial Conduct Committee, the membership of which will include lay persons, to facilitate the investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct.  That Committee will also have a role in preparing guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics.  Matters relating to the training of judges will also be addressed.  </p><p>The Government continues to be committed to progressing this legislation as speedily as possible.  While it is regarded as a priority by the Government it has, in the past, had to give way to other pressing and urgent legislative requirements, some of which arose from our Troika commitments and some of which concerned important social and societal issues such as the establishment of the Court of Appeal and last year's Marriage Referendum.  I can assure the Deputy that work on the Bill is very advanced indeed and I look forward to its contents being debated by the Oireachtas.  I would hope that it will be possible to begin that debate early in 2017.  </p></reply>

I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have no function in decisions in this regard.</p><p>The Valuation Act 2001 as amended by the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose, including constructions affixed thereto, are rateable unless expressly exempted under Schedule 4 of the Act. Such exempt buildings would principally include those used for public worship, education and health care provided on a not-for-profit basis, and charitable purposes. In general, the Act maintains the long-standing position that all commercial properties - including all private childcare facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, cr&egrave;ches and Montessori schools - are liable for rates.  </p><p>I understand that inconsistency in the approach to the exemption from rates for childcare and education facilities and calls to exempt all such providers were among the issues raised at a number of stages during the passage of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015.  As a result, the Government approved an amendment to the Bill, to insert into Schedule 4 of the Valuation Act 2001 an exemption from rates for properties occupied by parties that provide early childhood care and education on a not-for-profit<b><i></i></b>basis. This extension of the childcare and education exemption removed an anomaly that previously existed where those that provided childcare and education on a charitable basis were exempt but those that did so on a not-for-profitbasis were not. Since the commencement of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, the Valuation Office has been updating the valuation lists to give effect to this extension of the exemption so that it became effective for qualifying providers in 2016.</p><p>The decision taken by Government to extend the exemption from rates for early childcare and education was taken having considered the views of stakeholders in the sector. As outlined in Oireachtas debates during the passage of the legislation, key valuation principles have to be respected to retain the integrity and equity of a system that is a significant source of funding for Local Authorities. One of those principles is that properties of occupiers that operate with the intention of making a profit are rateable. There are a variety of other more appropriate means through which Government can and does support the provision of such services. Making exception to core, long-standing valuation principles can have a far reaching negative impact on the rates system and consequently a far reaching impact on Local Government funding.</p><p>In addition to the exemption of those that provide childcare and early education on a not-for-profit basis, paragraph 10 of Schedule 4 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 also exempts from rates childcare facilities that only provide the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme.</p><p>The Acts are quite specific about the range of exemptions that can be allowed by the Commissioner, who has no discretionary latitude to grant exemptions not covered by Schedule 4.  As a matter of course, the Valuation Office examines all claimant cases on their individual merits by reference to the relevant statutory provisions governing the operation of the Valuation Acts as they relate to pre-school childcare facilities and all other categories of properties.</p><p>Regarding the payment of rates by individual ratepayers, the Deputy will be aware that under Irish law there is a distinct separation of function between the valuation of rateable property and the setting and collection of commercial rates. The amount of rates payable by a ratepayer in any calendar year is a product of the valuation set by the Valuation Office multiplied by the Annual Rate on Valuation (ARV) decided annually by the elected members of the local authority. The latter is a reserved function of the elected members and the Commissioner of Valuation has no function in this regard.</p><p>Private childcare facilities which are operated for profit, form part of the rateable valuation base on a nationwide basis. The exemption from rateability of such facilities would reduce local authority revenues, which if it were not to entail an increase in Exchequer funding of local authorities, would have to be made good by imposing a corresponding increase on the remaining ratepayers. Accordingly, there are no plans at this time to extend the exemption from rates to for-profit childcare facilities, which as I have indicated would represent a significant departure from core valuation principles. However, the Deputy will be aware of the wide range of measures being pursued by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in relation to the childcare sector.</p></reply>

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:</p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;</p>  <p>  - the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. </p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. </p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership. This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.</p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. </p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost. </p>  <p>  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.  </p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 15 have been assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based  training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Cavan/Monaghan Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Cavan/Monaghan Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan="3">CAVAN/MONAGHAN DIVISION 31 OCTOBER 2010</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BAILIEBORO DISTRICT</td><td>BAILIEBORO</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYJAMESDUFF</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COOTEHILL           </td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINGSCOURT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULLAGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHERCOCK</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>VIRGINIA</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>CARRICKMACROSS DISTRICT</td><td>BALLYBAY</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICKMACROSS</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEBLANEY</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROCKCORRY           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>76</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN DISTRICT</td><td>ARVA</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINAGH           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYCONNELL</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BELTURBET           </td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKLION            </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAVAN</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOWRA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLESHANDRA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILNALECK           </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SWANLINBAR</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>98</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN DISTRICT</td><td>CLONES</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EMYVALE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>72</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SCOTSTOWN           </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN/MONAGHAN TOTAL</td><td>25 Stations</td><td>318</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="3">CAVAN/MONAGHAN DIVISION 30 SEPT 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BAILIEBORO DISTRICT           </td><td>BAILIEBORO</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYJAMESDUFF</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COOTEHILL           </td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINGSCOURT</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MULLAGH</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHERCOCK</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TULLYVIN</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>VIRGINIA</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>67</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYCONNELL DISTRICT</td><td>BALLYCONNELL</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BAWNBOY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BELTURBET           </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BLACKLION            </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DOWRA</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILLESHANDRA</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SWANLINBAR</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>CARRICKMACROSS DISTRICT</td><td>BALLYBAY</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICKMACROSS</td><td>51</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLEBLANEY</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CORRINSHIGAGH</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROCKCORRY           </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHANTONAGH</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>85</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN DISTRICT</td><td>ARVA</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINAGH           </td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAVAN</td><td>69</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILNALECK           </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>REDHILLS</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>STRADONE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>81</td></tr><tr><td>MONAGHAN DISTRICT</td><td>CLONES</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONTIBRET</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EMYVALE</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MONAGHAN</td><td>101</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWBLISS</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SCOTSTOWN           </td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SMITHBORO           </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Total</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>CAVAN/MONAGHAN TOTAL</td><td>34 Stations</td><td>397</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. </p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate.  The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area.</p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar.  This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Garda&iacute; directly on PULSE.</p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised.  As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.</p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.  In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been. </p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. </p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report. </p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.</p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.<table><tr><th><font color="#2F2F2F">Division</font></th><th><font color="#2F2F2F">Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE</font></th></tr><tr><td><font color="#2F2F2F">Co.

We are agreed that it is our shared aim to seek to ensure that the current high levels of co-operation on this island can be continued.</p>  <p>  There is close and ongoing co-operation between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI in respect of all aspects of policing.  This co-operation is based firmly on a shared commitment to improving community safety throughout the island of Ireland, to disrupt criminal and terrorist activity and to enhance the policing capability of both police services on the island.</p>  <p>  There is also strong ongoing co-operation across the range of criminal justice areas involving the Justice Departments and justice agencies North and South that includes initiatives in respect of forensic science, youth justice, probation and the management of offenders and issues relating to the requirements of social diversity in the justice system.</p>  <p>  There is also a range of important areas of civil justice to do with contracts, debt recovery and family law, for example, which are based in EU law and would have particular relevance to the circumstances in which people live and do business on the island of Ireland.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been working to identify the principal sectoral impacts and opportunities in the short to medium term and to identify priority actions in terms of policy measures relating to North-South justice and policing co-operation.  There has been and will continue to be close interaction with officials in the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland in this regard.</p>  <p>  There can be no question about the extent to which EU measures in respect of policing and in the criminal and civil justice fields can support actions to combat crime and to improve community safety and support justice.  It is essential, therefore, to work to ensure that the greatest possible levels of co-operation can continue to be maintained.</p></reply>

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:</p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;</p>  <p>  - the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. </p>  <p>  The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. </p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership.  This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.</p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. </p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost. </p>  <p>  Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p>  <p>  What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.</p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 10 have been assigned to the Kerry Division.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. </p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate.  The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area. </p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar.  This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Gardai directly on PULSE.</p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised.  As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process.  This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.</p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics.  In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been. </p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. </p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report. </p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021.  This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations. </p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE</th></tr><tr><td>West Cork</td><td>Inishannon</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kilbrittain</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Timoleague</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Kealkil</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Glengarrif</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Durrus</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ballydehob</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Drimoleague</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Roscarberry</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Baltimore</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Drinagh</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Coachford</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>B&eacute;al &Aacute;tha an Ghaorthaidh</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Crookstown</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Tarelton</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Ballydesmond</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Boherbue</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rathmore</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The majority of citizens would accept that there should be a balance between personal privacy and public safety once the mechanisms by which such data is accessed is both legal and proportionate.</p>  <p>  I want to emphasise that the interception of an individual&rsquo;s communications in this State can only occur in the very specific circumstances laid down in the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act of 1993.  This Act permits me to authorise an interception but only for the purposes of criminal investigation into serious offences or in the interests of the security of the State.  The operation of the Act is overseen independently by a Designated Judge of the High Court who reports to the Taoiseach on his examination of its operation.  In addition, a Complaints Referee (a serving judge of the Circuit Court) receives and investigates complaints from persons who believe that their communications have been unlawfully intercepted.  If the Complaints Referee finds that there has been a violation of the Act he can order that the interceptions cease and recommend the award of compensation.</p>  <p>  The interception of communications is not a matter that is regulated at EU level.  However, arrangements are in place under the EU Mutual Assistance Convention which provide for the implementation of reciprocal interception arrangements in the context of criminal investigations.  The Convention is given effect in Irish law in the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware of reports early last year which alleged that authorities in the UK had accessed communications cables between this State and the UK.  The reports suggest that this access may have been connected to surveillance activities being carried out within the jurisdiction of the UK.  At that time, my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade was in contact with the British Embassy on this issue.  It has been conveyed that it is generally understood that friendly relationships between States include the acceptance of the principle that the privacy of communications must be respected.</p></reply>

The International Protection Act 2015 provides for such a procedure.  My Department is currently preparing all of the steps necessary to commence the Act which responds to some 26 of the Working Group&rsquo;s recommendations and can be expected to positively address the crucial issue of the length of time that applicants spend in the protection process and by extension in State provided accommodation.  </p><p>On this particular point, significant efforts have been made to deal with those who are longest in the system and at this stage the vast majority of those who are over 5 years in the system and who do not have any impediments to progress, such as pending judicial challenges, have now had their cases processed to completion.  This has been a key achievement that has had a real impact on many people and families in the protection process. </p><p>A transition Task Force was established in 2015 and put in place important supports to facilitate people with status moving into and integrating with the community.  The Task Force reported that 87% of people granted status had moved into the wider community within six months. </p><p>Tangible progress in improving the daily lives of asylum seekers living in State provided accommodation while their application is being processed is also being made.  In January last, the former T&aacute;naiste announced an increase to the Direct Provision Allowance for children, the first such increase since the introduction of the payment some sixteen years ago.  Prescription fees for all those in receipt of the Direct Provision allowance, including children, have also been waived.  The Minister for Education and Skills has also announced a second year of their pilot support scheme for students in the protection system for the academic year 2016/2017. </p><p>The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department, which is responsible for the management and administration of accommodation and ancillary services to protection applicants in state provided accommodation, is actively progressing the implementation of other recommendations in the Report around access to cooking facilities and the increase in living space for those who avail of State provided accommodation.  Pilot projects are being undertaken in a number of centres to ensure the best approach to realising these objectives and ensuring that those residing in the direct provision system continue to be treated with respect and dignity.  </p><p>RIA are also working on the development of standards for the provision and maintenance of services in accommodation centres, enhancing the complaints mechanisms for residents of those centres and the provision of ongoing diversity and equality training and awareness programmes across all centres.  </p></reply>

Part IIA of that Act, comprising sections 19A to 19H, as inserted by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002, provides for offences in relation to illegal trespass and occupation of land.  Such land includes privately owned land and public land provided or maintained by a statutory body or held in trust primarily for the enjoyment of the public.  The legislation empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to direct trespassers to leave the land concerned and remove any object belonging to them from the occupied land.  A person who is guilty of an offence under this Part of the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;4,000 or a term of imprisonment of up to one month, or both.</p>  <p>  Trespass in relation to buildings, as well as land, is also dealt with in the 1994 Act.  Section 11 of the Act provides that it is an offence for a person to enter a building or the vicinity of a building as a trespasser with the intention of committing an offence or interfering with property.  A person who is guilty of an offence under this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.</p>  <p>  In addition, section 13(1) of the same Act provides that it is an offence for a person, without reasonable excuse, to trespass on a building or in the vicinity of a building in such a manner as causes or is likely to cause fear in another person.  Section 13(2) empowers the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to request the person concerned to desist from acting in such a manner and to immediately leave the place concerned in a peaceable and orderly manner.  It is an offence not to comply with a direction given by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under section 13(2).  A person who is guilty of an offence under section 13(1) is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;2,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months, or both.  A person who is guilty of an offence under section 13(2) is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;1,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.</p>  <p>  The Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Act 1971 also contains provisions relating to trespass.  Under this Act it is an offence to forcibly enter land, including buildings, or remain in forceful occupation, or to encourage or advocate the commission of such an offence.  A person guilty of a first offence under the Act is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to &euro;500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 6 months, or both.  A second or subsequent offence under the Act is punishable, on summary conviction, by a fine of up to &euro;1,000 or imprisonment for term of up to 12 months, or both.  Conviction on indictment for an offence under the Act can result in a fine of up to &euro;5,000 or a prison term of up to 3 years, or both.</p>  <p>  As I have outlined, there is already robust legislation in place in relation to trespass and I have, therefore, no plans to change the law in this regard, but the situation will be kept under review. </p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I  am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Co. Laois is part of the Laois/Offaly Garda Division. I am informed that of the 534 newly attested Garda&iacute;, 24 have been assigned to that Division.  Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and classroom based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Laois/Offaly  Division, like all other Garda Divisions, will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Laois/Offaly Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan="3">LAOIS/OFFALY DIVISION 31 OCT 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>ABBEYLEIX</td><td>ABBEYLEIX</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ARLES</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLACOLLA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLINAKILL</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYLINAN</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BORRIS-IN-OSSORY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DURROW</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDOWNEY</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>BIRR</td><td>BANAGHER</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BIRR</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOGHAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FERBANE</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCORMAC</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINNITTY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHANNONBRIDGE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHINRONE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>PORTLAOISE</td><td>CLONASLEE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOUNTMELLICK</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOUNTRATH</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTARLINGTON</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTLAOISE</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>STRADBALLY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>143</td></tr><tr><td>TULLAMORE</td><td>CLARA</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONBOLOGUE</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DAINGEAN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EDENDERRY</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GEASHILL</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RHODE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TULLAMORE</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>102</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS/OFFALY</td><td>29 Stations</td><td>334</td></tr></table></p><p><table><tr><th colspan="3">LAOIS / OFFALY  DIVISION 30 SEP 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BIRR</td><td>BANAGHER</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BIRR</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOGHAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FERBANE</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILCORMAC</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINNITTY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SHINRONE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>PORTLAOISE</td><td>ABBEYLEIX</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ARLES</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYLINAN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BORRIS-IN-OSSORY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONASLEE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DURROW</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOUNTMELLICK</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOUNTRATH</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTARLINGTON</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PORTLAOISE</td><td>107</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHDOWNEY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>STRADBALLY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>159</td></tr><tr><td>TULLAMORE</td><td>CLARA</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DAINGEAN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EDENDERRY</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RHODE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TULLAMORE</td><td>73</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>93</td></tr><tr><td>LAOIS / OFFALY  </td><td>24 Stations</td><td>294</td></tr></table></p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 5 have been assigned to the Sligo/Leitrim Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Sligo/Leitrim Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p><p>For ease of reference I have provided a breakdown of the detailed information requested in relation to the number of Garda stations and number of Garda assigned to the Sligo/Leitrim Division on 31 October 2010 and 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, for the record.<table><tr><th colspan="3"><div>SLIGO/LEITRIM 31 OCT 2010</div></th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMOTE</td><td>ACLARE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYFARNAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BALLYMOTE</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BUNNANADDEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>EASKEY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENNISCRONE</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GURTEEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RIVERSTOWN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TUBBERCURRY</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>CARRICK-ON-SHANNON</td><td>BALLINAMORE</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICK-ON-SHANNON</td><td>45</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIGALLEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLOONE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DROMOD</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KESHCARRIGAN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOHILL</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>60</td></tr><tr><td>MANORHAMILTON</td><td>DROMAHAIR</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DRUMKERRIN</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DRUMSHAMBO</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GLENFARNE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILTYCLOGHER</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINLOUGH</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MANORHAMILTON</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>CLIFFONEY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COLLOONEY</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>COOLANEY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GRANGE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROSSES POINT</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SKREEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SLIGO</td><td>166</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO/LEITRIM</td><td>30 Stations</td><td>326</td></tr></table><table><tr><th colspan="3"><div>SLIGO/LEITRIM 30 SEPT 2016</div></th></tr><tr><td>Division</td><td>Stations</td><td>Garda Numbers</td></tr><tr><td>BALLYMOTE</td><td>BALLYMOTE</td><td>29</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ENNISCRONE</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GURTEEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RIVERSTOWN</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TUBBERCURRY</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td>LEITRIM</td><td>BALLINAMORE</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRICK-ON-SHANNON</td><td>49</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CARRIGALLEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DRUMSHAMBO</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KINLOUGH</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MANORHAMILTON</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MOHILL</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>97</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO</td><td>COLLOONEY</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>GRANGE</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROSSES POINT</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SKREEN</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>SLIGO</td><td>133</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>146</td></tr><tr><td>SLIGO/LEITRIM</td><td>17 Stations</td><td>292</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The outcome of these reviews are reflective of the quality of the crime figures for all areas of the country. </p><p>The first CSO Review, published in June 2015, helped to clarify and quantify many of the issues raised by the Inspectorate. The second review, published in September this year, indicated that the estimated impact of the issues identified in the Garda Inspectorate Report in relation to recorded crime is substantially less than at the first review.  I am, however, determined that a strong focus remains on the need for improvements in this area. </p><p>I must explain that most crime incidents are recorded via the Garda Information Services Centre (GISC), based in Castlebar. This provides a round the clock service which enables Garda&iacute; to phone in details of a crime incident, and specially trained staff in GISC facilitate its correct recording and classification on PULSE.  As a result, a lack of access to PULSE in a particular Garda station should not prevent the accurate recording of crime data.  In fact, the latest information from the Garda authorities is that 92% of crime incidents are recorded via GISC, with the balance being recorded by Gardai directly on PULSE. </p><p>Some of the issues raised by the Garda Inspectorate concerned the need for procedures to ensure that the recording of crimes through GISC is maximised. As part of the work to implement the Inspectorate&rsquo;s very broad ranging recommendations, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has implemented new measures to improve data quality including a new Incident Recording process. This, together with important upgrades of the PULSE system during 2015, is supporting the improvement of Garda crime data as well as procedures for the supervision of investigations.</p><p>It will take time for the full effect of the upgrading of Garda systems to be reflected in the Crime Statistics. In this regard, I understand that the CSO intend to provide further analysis of crime data quality in due course which will help us to gauge, at that stage, how successful the ongoing work to achieve improvements in our crime statistics has been. </p><p>For its part, the Government remains committed to supporting this work and this is underlined by the investment of &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. </p><p>In relation to the specific question of PULSE access for Garda stations, as a number of Deputies have sought similar information in relation to various counties, I propose to provide those Deputies with a table with this information and to include the table in the Official Report.</p><p>I might add that the question of enhancing rural access to the Garda network is being examined as part of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021. This includes plans to introduce mobile technology solutions to enable operational Garda&iacute; to access core information systems, including PULSE, while on duty and away from Garda stations.</p><p>However, as I have explained, the availability of PULSE in a given Garda station is not a prerequisite for the accurate recording and classification of crime data.<table><tr><th>Division</th><th>Names of Garda Stations in these areas without access to PULSE</th></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>None</td></tr></table></p></reply>

As reported upon by Ireland during its response to the UN's Universal Period Review earlier this year, on 19 May 2015 the Oireachtas did not support a Private Members' Bill that sought to insert into the Constitution a statement that the State shall progressively realise, subject to its maximum available resources and without discrimination, the rights contained in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and that this duty would be cognisable by the Courts. The Government pointed out that it aims to ensure that the State&rsquo;s obligations to implement the Covenant in Ireland are met through policies aimed at improving the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights, including by fighting persistent poverty and social exclusion and recognising that others - including individuals and families as well as many organisations and bodies - have important responsibilities as well. The means by which the State sets out to meet its obligations in this area is through the allocation of resources.</p></reply>

Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed. The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway. This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma. It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year. As part of Phase 3, regional public consultations took place from 22 September 2016 - 27 September 2016; I attended two of those consultations (in Dublin and in Athlone, respectively) and I am delighted to report that overall attendance and participation were encouraging and positive. Feedback from those consultation sessions is being collated by my officials and the draft Inclusion Strategy will be updated accordingly. I plan to submit the final draft of the Inclusion Strategy to Government shortly for consideration and sign-off.</p>  <p>  The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy. In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society. This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition. As such, there are no plans to introduce new legislation in this regard. The key benefit is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced. Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; creates a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue. </p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue. The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way. My officials and I are currently working to advance this issue with national Traveller organisations in this regard.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p><p>Ratios such as number of Garda per head population are not an appropriate tool to use when considering the allocation of Garda resources as they fail to take account of, among other things, the fact that crime levels and types can vary significantly among communities of similar population size. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division, on the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 307.  There are also 23 Garda Reserves and 26 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. I am informed that of these, 25 have been assigned to the Kildare Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources. However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Kildare Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.<b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

The implementation of the Traveller Accommodation Programme of each local authority, including the draw-down of funds, in accordance with the 1998 Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, is a matter for each individual authority.    I have no plans to establish a Traveller agency. My officials and I engage in an ongoing process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs. It is important to have positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in order to identify sustainable solutions to the challenges faced by the Traveller community, based on respect and honest dialogue.</p>  <p>  There is a comprehensive consultation process underway, led by my Department, to develop a new National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy to improve the situation for the Traveller and Roma communities in Ireland. Phase 1 (identification of key themes for the new Strategy) and Phase 2 (identification and agreement of high level objectives under each agreed theme) of that consultation process have been completed. The final phase, Phase 3 (identification of detailed actions to achieve each agreed objective, with associated time-scales, key performance indicators, institutional responsibilities and monitoring arrangements), is currently underway. This process will provide a new set of specific, cross-Departmental actions that need to be taken to bring about a real improvement in quality of life for Travellers and Roma. It is intended that the new Inclusion Strategy will run from 2016 to 2020 and that it will be in place later this year. As part of Phase 3, regional public consultations took place from 22 September 2016 - 27 September 2016; I attended two of those consultations (in Dublin and in Athlone, respectively) and I am delighted to report that overall attendance and participation were encouraging and positive. Feedback from those consultation sessions is being collated by my officials and the draft Inclusion Strategy will be updated accordingly. I plan to submit the final draft of the Inclusion Strategy to Government shortly for consideration and sign-off.</p>  <p>  The issue of recognition of Travellers as an ethnic group is being considered in the context of the development of the Inclusion Strategy. In September 2015, my predecessor brought a paper to the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy on the question of recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within Irish society. This followed a process of dialogue with the national-level Traveller NGOs during 2015, which culminated in the presentation of an agreed position paper by them and confirmation that there are no legal or legislative or expenditure implications arising from such recognition. The key benefit is that recognition of the distinct heritage, culture and identity of Travellers and their special place in Irish society would be hugely symbolically important to Traveller pride, to Traveller self-esteem and to overcoming the legacy of marginalisation and discrimination that the community has experienced. Such a symbolic gesture &ndash; as the Traveller NGO paper argues &ndash; creates a new platform for positive engagement by the Traveller community and Government together in seeking sustainable solutions based on respect and honest dialogue. </p>  <p>  I have had a long standing interest in this area, most notably through my chairing of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality when it produced its report on the Recognition of Traveller Ethnicity (April 2014). When I spoke earlier this year at the Traveller Pride awards, I stressed that we need to broaden the discussion on this issue. The debate needs to be taken forward in an inclusive way. My officials and I are currently working to advance this issue with national Traveller organisations in this regard.  </p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 24 have been assigned to the Wexford Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.

However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors.  </p><p>The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

However, section 29 (2) (b) of the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995 (as amended by Section 80 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008) provides that the Legal Aid Board may waive any contribution payable or accept a lower contribution on the grounds that a failure to do so would cause undue hardship to the applicant. The Legal Aid Board has put in place guidelines for its decision makers in relation to applications for a waiver of contributions. The guidelines provide for a sympathetic approach to be taken to applications for a waiver in cases where the application is in connection with a domestic violence matter and the person&rsquo;s sole source of income is social welfare. In such circumstances a decision maker may decide to waive the aid contribution so that the person will only pay the nominal contribution for legal advice.  The Deputy will wish to note that a majority of applicants for legal aid in connection with domestic violence reliefs pay the minimum contribution and that contributions are subject to a maximum cap.   </p></reply>

Harassment is deemed to occur where a person seriously interferes with the other's peace and privacy or causes alarm, distress or harm to the other. Section 10(3) also provides for orders to be made by the court to prevent communication by any means with the victim or to approach within any distance specified by the court of the place of residence or employment of the victim. Such an order can be made even in circumstances where the accused person is not convicted of the offence if the court is satisfied, having regard to the evidence, that it is in the interests of justice.  While aspects of what is known loosely as &quot;revenge pornography&quot; are addressed by the harassment offence in this Act, there has been a growing awareness and concern in relation to harmful internet content in recent years with the growth of cyber technology. </p><p>The Law Reform Commission's report also addresses a number of other regulatory issues that have implications across Government Departments. </p><p>I welcome the fact that the report addresses the wider context within which law reform should be framed and that it has identified the need for education and empowerment, the need to strike the correct balance between the right to freedom of expression and the right to privacy, and the desirability of a graduated response where the criminal law is reserved for the most significant harm.  My officials are examining the report in detail, and I would intend bringing forward legislative proposals to address any potential gaps in the criminal law in this area.</p></reply>

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:</p><p>-  an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;</p><p>-  the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;</p><p>-  the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;</p><p>-  the  implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.</p><p>Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid. </p><p>The Government has also made it clear that it is committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda Associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. </p><p>On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership. This was a very welcome decision by the Garda associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.</p><p>The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation. The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. </p><p>The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.  The nature of the Labour Court's recommendation is such that some of the cost of the implementation of the proposals, if they are accepted by the members of AGSI and the GRA, depend on the amount of overtime worked in any year.  That said, I am advised that, depending on a number of variables, the estimated gross annual cost of implementing the Labour Court Recommendation could exceed &euro;50m; however, this gross cost will be offset by statutory deductions for tax, PRSI, etc., which will reduce the net Exchequer cost. </p><p>Once the outcome of the ballots is known and if the proposals are accepted,  the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><p>What is most important at this juncture is that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's  recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.  <b><font color="#000080"></font></b></p></reply>

Section 15A(2) provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion waive some of the conditions in relation to an application from a spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen if she is satisfied that the applicant would suffer serious consequences in respect of his or her bodily integrity or liberty if not granted Irish citizenship.

One of the tasks of that Committee will be to draw up guidelines on judicial conduct and ethics which, in turn, will be adopted by the Judicial Council.  The norm for such codes is that they would include matters such as guidance in respect of conflicts of interest and other integrity-related matters.</p><p>As the Deputy will also be aware, the scheduling of court cases and the allocation of court business is a matter for the respective Presidents of the Courts and the presiding judge who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  The decision reached in any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.  If a person believes that their interests would be affected if a particular judge were to hear and determine the matter in question, then an application to recuse a judge must be made to the judge concerned by, or on behalf of, that person.  The decision on recusal is a matter for the judge concerned and, if the applicant is not satisfied with the decision the judge makes, it is possible to appeal any decision of that judge to the appropriate appeal court.</p></reply>

In the limited number of such cases, the results of biometric tests can provide a greater degree of certainty of a family link.

In July the Government approved my proposals for a Five Year Reform and High Level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which combines the Government&rsquo;s response to the report of the Garda Inspectorate and the commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government to increase the visibility, effectiveness and responsiveness of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In this regard it sets out an overall vision of a Garda workforce of 21,000 comprising 15,000 Garda&iacute;, 2,000 Reserves and 4,000 civilians to be to be achieved incrementally over five years in tandem with the delivery of reforms.  The delivery of this overall vision is supported by provision in the 2017 Estimates for the recruitment of 800 trainee Garda&iacute;, up to 500 additional civilian staff and 300 Reserves. </p>  <p>  The reform plan has three interlocking elements that must work together if it is to succeed-</p>  <p>-  the reform measures themselves which are designed to deliver 21st century policing in a world class policing service;</p>  <p>  -  the resources in terms of increased numbers of Garda&iacute;, Reserves and Civilians backed up by the substantial capital investment of &euro;311m already earmarked for ICT, the fleet and Garda stations under the Capital Plan 2016-2021; and</p>  <p>  -  the enhanced implementation structures to ensure delivery leveraging the resources and statutory remit of the Policing Authority.</p>  <p>  The vehicle for the reform agenda will be the Garda Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 published in June which captures the bulk of the recommendations of the Inspectorate Report. </p>  <p>  In the case of civilians the plan sets a target of 20% to bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more into line with international norms.  This in effect means an increase in the number of civilians to 4,000. This will be achieved through (i) a &lsquo;civilian by default&rsquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and (ii) redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties that may be done by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.  It is worth noting that the Inspectorate Report suggests that there are up to 1,250 Garda&iacute; in such posts including in the Garda Technical Bureau, ICT, Human Resources etc. The Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority will prepare a plan by the end of this year to realise this target by 2021.  </p>  <p>  As I have said, the bulk of the Inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendations have been accepted. However,  it is not intended to implement at this time the recommendations of the Inspectorate aimed at reducing the number of regions and Divisions having regard to the major reform programme underway in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and the importance of ensuring visible leadership and maintaining and enhancing the close links between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and local communities.  These recommendations will be kept under review. </p>  <p>  The Policing Authority is an independent statutory body established on 1 January 2016.  Its role is to oversee the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to policing services, to promote public awareness of policing matters and to promote and support the continuous improvements in policing in Ireland. Its mission is to drive excellent policing through valued and effective oversight and governance.</p>  <p>  Since its establishment, the Policing Authority has been focusing, as a matter of priority, on its functions which have statutory deadlines and reform significance.  The Policing Authority has met on several occasions with the Commissioner and her senior team, as a follow up on its consideration of the O&rsquo;Higgins Report and related matters.  A number of these meetings have been held in public to reassure the community about the performance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Areas that have been highlighted in the discussions include:</p>  <p>  -  Implementation of the Modernisation and Renewal Programme within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p>  <p>  -  Review of the Garda Protected Disclosure policy;</p>  <p>  -  Plans to conduct a culture audit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na;</p>  <p>  -  Corporate governance arrangements and management structures within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and</p>  <p>  -  Arrangements for training and the professional development of members</p>  <p>  The Authority has approved a three year Strategy for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It has also determined the policing priorities for 2017 which will inform the content of the 2017 Policing Plan  which will be published before the end of the year.  It has reviewed and issued recommendations on the Garda Protected Disclosure policy and will also establish a Code of Ethics that includes standards of conduct and practice for Garda members.  </p>  <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission (GSOC) has a hugely important role in ensuring that public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is safeguarded, and has extensive powers under the 2005 Act to enable it to carry out its responsibilities.  Significant changes were made to the powers of GSOC in the last two years including making GSOC a designated body for receiving protected disclosures.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that we have in place the most effective possible mechanism for the investigation of complaints and I met with the Chairperson of GSOC last month in the context of considering what further changes are desirable.  It was agreed that a working group would be established to consider possible legislative changes.</p></reply>

In the case of individual members, the recommendation for the GRA and AGSI would provide extra remuneration of around &euro;4,000 on average to a member of the Service over the next 12 months through:</p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the introduction of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of leave by Garda&iacute;.  This payment will be worth &euro;510 per annum to a Garda with 34 days annual leave;</p>  <p>  - the implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate through the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  Under the Labour Court recommendation, new recruits who do not currently receive rent allowance, will have it restored, in addition to the other improvements I just listed.  In addition, the increment freeze in place for GRA members since 1 July will be lifted and any arrears arising from increments foregone will be paid.  </p>  <p>  On foot of the Labour Court recommendation, the GRA and AGSI agreed to defer the intended industrial action over the course of the four Fridays in November to facilitate a ballot of their membership.  This was a very welcome decision by the Garda Associations and has ensured that a full policing service remains in place.</p>  <p>  The Government fully respects the decision of the Labour Court as the independent industrial relations body of last resort in the State and agreed last week to accept its recommendation.  The outcome of the process is now being examined in detail by all sides and it is hoped that it will form the basis for a final resolution of this dispute following the balloting of members of AGSI and the GRA in due course. </p>  <p>  The independent recommendation of the Labour Court seeks to address the concerns that have been articulated by the representative bodies in relation to their pay and conditions including of new recruits, and their access to the statutory dispute resolution bodies.</p>  <p>  It is most important at this juncture that members of AGSI and the GRA are afforded the time and space to give the Labour Court's recommendation the detailed consideration that it deserves.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to the gradual restoration of remuneration for all public servants, including members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Lansdowne Road Agreement started this process, and by September next year, public servants will have received &euro;1,900 in restoration.  The first report of the Public Service Pay Commission established by the Government and chaired by Mr Kevin Foley, former Chair of the Labour Court, is to address the issue of the unwinding of the Financial Emergency in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts and to help provide the Government with a roadmap for exiting this legislation and addressing further pay restoration. </p></reply>

Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and that the best possible Garda service is provided to communities. </p>  <p>  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the existing station network continues to provide the necessary levels of policing services through a centralisation of services which in turn has facilitated the introduction of enhanced patrolling systems that are operational and intelligence led.  This helps to ensure that a high visibility and community-oriented policing service continues to be delivered throughout Divisions nationwide and yields a number of benefits, including:</p>  <p>  -  increased Garda visibility and patrol hours;</p>  <p>  -  increased mobility and flexibility within an area resulting in an improved policing service to the public;</p>  <p>  -  enhanced co-ordination of Garda activity resulting in a greater visibility and presence in the communities;</p>  <p>  -  more effective use of finite resources across a wider area; and</p>  <p>  -  continued Garda presence in communities.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware of the Government's commitments under the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Programme recognises that community policing is the embodiment of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, providing a means of recognising that every community, both urban and rural, has its own concerns and expectations.  It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community, including the most minimal response times possible.</p>  <p>  In line with the Programme's commitments, I have requested the Policing Authority to oversee a review into, amongst other things, the dispersal of Garda stations in rural areas.  In this regard, I understand that the Authority has formally requested the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to examine the dispersal and use of resources available to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the delivery of policing services to local communities and to make recommendations to provide a more effective, visible and responsive policing service. I have also requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify 6 stations for reopening on a pilot basis and the outcome of this pilot scheme will feed into the wider review being overseen by the Authority.</p>  <p>  I would also draw the Deputy's attention to the significant investment of some &euro;46 million in the Garda Fleet under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021 which provides An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  Indeed, since the beginning of the year, some 520 new vehicles have come on stream for use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></reply>

It is assumed that the Deputy is enquiring as to whether An Grian&aacute;n is also covered by the Magdalen Laundries Restorative Justice Ex Gratia Scheme under the remit of my Department.</p>  <p>  The Magdalen Scheme is limited to 12 named institutions - the 10 Magdalen laundries that were the subject of the McAleese Report as well as the Domestic Training Schools at Stanhope Street and Summerhill.  An Grian&aacute;n is not one of those 12 named institutions.  Although An Grian&aacute;n  was located on the same complex as the Magdalen Laundry in High Park, it was a separate institution in its own right.  Its function was to rehabilitate teenage girls and provide education to prepare them for reintegration into society.  It thus served a different purpose to that of the traditional Magdalen institutions which dated back to the 19th century and which were open to women of all ages.  An Grian&aacute;n Training Centre, officially established in 1971, had a separate legal status as a certified place of detention and an approved residential children's home. </p>  <p>  Aside from An Grian&aacute;n's own separate legal status and its different function to that of a Magdalen laundry, it should be further noted that the terms of the Magdalen Laundries Restorative Justice Ex Gratia Scheme specifically exclude institutions that are covered by the Residential Institutions Redress Board Scheme.  This is to prevent a situation arising where an individual could receive compensation under two separate schemes for the same period of time spent in one institution.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-15a.366.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500066#WRJ04000"><p>As I have outlined in my Written Reply to Questions Number 91 and 93 on 2 November 2016,  it is intended that the phased commencement of the remaining sections and Parts of the Legal Services Regulation Act will be implemented over the remainder of this year and into early 2017 in relation to major undertakings such as the start-up of the Authority&rsquo;s critical public complaints function.  The immediate focus includes the phased commencement of Parts of the 2015 Act such as those dealing with legal costs, the new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator, the Roll of Practising Barristers and Pre-Action Protocols.  Following this, in the new year, the key provisions centred around Part 6 of the Act dealing with the new public complaints and professional conduct and disciplinary procedures, and the appointment of the new Legal Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal, will be commenced in tandem with the developing resource base and capability of the new body.  </p>  <p>  Now that the members and Chairperson of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority have been duly nominated, approved by motions of each House of the Oireachtas and appointed and have held their inaugural meeting on 26 October 2016, the working focus is, of necessity, on the managed roll-out of the Authority's functions.  For the sake of good order this has to be done in tandem with the phased commencement, by the Government, of the various remaining Parts and provisions of the 2015 Act.  Moreover, the setting of establishment day of the Authority for 1 October 2016 has automatically triggered a number of working obligations on the new Authority several of which are statute-bound in terms of their delivery deadlines and in terms of the completion of public consultations and reports on the specified matters concerned.  These are tasks for which the new Authority will need to build up its working resources in the short term and I know that the Authority is already taking action in this regard.  Both my Department and the new Regulatory Authority will, therefore, continue to liaise closely by way of ensuring that we can successfully coordinate the commencement, from my side as Minister, and delivery, by the Authority as the new independent statutory regulator, of the various provisions concerned. </p>  <p>  I would also point to the fact that Part 14 of the 2015 Act contains a series of miscellaneous provisions which deal with a range of matters and is not, therefore, a Part which deals with a single component of the new regulatory regime.  These provisions, therefore, are of varied application in relation to the rest of the 2015 Act and are being dealt with accordingly in the ongoing determination of their respective commencement dates.  As the Deputy will be aware, the general commencement provision in Section 1 of the Act is such as to allow for the commencement of particular provisions within a Part, where necessary, without a necessity to commence the entirety of the provisions in that Part.  The provisions of Part 14 deal with disparate matters such as the legal immunity of the Regulatory Authority; the right of audience of solicitors; barristers in employment providing legal services to their employer; money laundering; restriction on withdrawal from a case; the service of notices; regulation of movement between the two legal professions and the advertising of legal services. Aligning all of these issues across the 2015 Act is, therefore, a complex task for which a unilateral solution cannot be imposed.  I continue to anticipate that the planning and progress of all of these matters will come to be determined in much more precise terms by my Department in conjunction with the Legal Services Regulatory Authority over the coming weeks.  </p></reply>

This reflects the success of the concerted Garda drive against crime being implemented under Operation Thor.  It is important we build on this success by ensuring that Garda numbers continue to increase.  The Government has put in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging programme of reform which is being implemented in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In addition, approximately 300 appointments will be made to the Garda Reserve. </p><p>The ongoing recruitment process will support all policing operations, including special targeted strategies such as Operation Thor<b><font color="#000080">, </font></b>which marks a significant step-up in the Garda response to burglaries and related crime.An additional &euro;55 million has been provided in 2016 resulting in a more than doubling of the overtime allocation for 2016, bringing the total to over &euro;90 million. For 2017,  I have secured a further &euro;71.5 million for Garda overtime which will facilitate the continuation of large scale policing operations, including those targeting gangland crime and burglary.</p><p>Furthermore, investment in a modern, effective and fit-for-purpose Garda fleet will continue under the Government&rsquo;s Capital Plan 2016-2021 which provides &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles, ensuring that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive, on the roads and in the community. The Government is also investing in Garda airborne surveillance and enhanced technology and ICT systems.  In fact, some &euro;330 million, including &euro;205 million under the Capital Plan, is being invested in Garda ICT infrastructure between 2016 and 2021 to enable An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deploy the latest cutting edge technologies in the fight against crime. All of these investments underline the  commitment in the Programme for Government to resource and equip An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide enhanced policing and support local communities in all areas of the country.</p></reply>

In furtherance of this, I recently announced that the Government had approved my proposal for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel to be achieved by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 4,000 civilians and 2,000 Reserve members.

This investment will continue to provide the Garda&iacute; with additional high-powered vehicles, marked and unmarked patrol cars, and motorcycles to ensure that Garda&iacute; can be mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  The Plan also provides an additional &euro;205 million for investment in Garda ICT infrastructure.  </p>  <p>  Under the Garda Building and Refurbishment Programme 2016 - 2021, that I announced in October 2015 with my colleague the Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, a number of new Garda Stations will be built and a significant number of others will be refurbished.

However, having regard to a number of unique factors, including the fact that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is a single national police force which provides a security and intelligence service as well as a policing service, international policing models may require tailoring to our circumstances. </p>  <p>  Section 117(1) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 specifically requires the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to benchmark their recommendations by reference to the best standards of comparable police services. Arising from this requirement, every inspection conducted by the Garda Inspectorate, and any recommendation arising, has involved examining policing practices in other jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will no doubt be aware that the recommendations of the Inspectorate's 2015 Report, 'Changing Policing in Ireland', formed the basis of the Government's Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Commissioner&rsquo;s Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 is the vehicle for implementing the agreed Government Plan for Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Key reforms being implemented include the replacement of the current District model of policing with a Divisional model where responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis. However, in implementing this reform, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required to continue to maintain the close relationship it has with communities in large rural Divisions. The Plan also contains a commitment to increase the number of civilian staff in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na  in line with international norms. A  medium term target of achieving 20% civilians by 2021 is proposed to this end. I have asked the Policing Authority to monitor the implementation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na of the Plan and to provide regular progress reports to the Department on the matter. </p>  <p>  In relation to policing practices, I would point to the Garda Commissioner's responsibility under section 26 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 to direct and control the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. In exercising this function, I understand that the Garda Commissioner has ensured that relevant policing developments in other jurisdictions are reviewed on an on-going basis with a view to identifying and promoting the application of international best practice throughout the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p></reply>

More generally, tackling serious and organised crime and addressing the harms it gives rise to at all levels in our community is a central policing priority, and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has my full support for the strategies it has in place to give effect to this commitment.</p><p>While the criminal law in this area is kept under ongoing review, there are already a range of robust legislative provisions available, including specific legislation to deal with assaults to emergency workers, including Garda&iacute;.

In addition, in the case of assault causing serious harm, an offender can be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and could be subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p><p>Therefore, the law already recognises the gravity of any attack on Garda&iacute; and other members of the emergency services carrying out their duties and the penalties in place reflect the seriousness with which such acts are viewed.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b></p></reply>

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 4,000 civilians and 2,000 Reserve.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300. </p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. </p><p>Of these 1,200 new recruits,  534 have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November.  Next year the Commissioner has planned four intakes to the Garda College of 200 new recruits scheduled for  February, May, August and November giving a total intake of 800. It is expected that in total 900 trainee Garda will attest  in 2017 which, taking account of projected retirements, will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,500 mark by year end 2017.</p><p>The target of 15,000 Garda members by 2021 is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I this regard I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. The existing recruitment campaign (launched last November) is ongoing and successful candidates will continue to be called from that campaign this year and into next year. It is expected that successful candidates from the new campaign will enter the Garda College from mid-2017.  </p></reply>

It commits the Government to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing in every community throughout the country in order to provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.  This commitment is underlined by very significant investments in Garda resources. </p>  <p>  Community Policing continues to be a key aspect of the Garda approach to the prevention and detection of crime.  Garda&iacute; engage with a wide range of community based groups, as well in more formal setting such as Joint Policing Committees, to ensure that local issues can be aired and appropriate partnerships formed with communities to address matters of concern. </p>  <p>  Garda&iacute; also support over 3,700 Community Alert and Neighbourhood Watch Schemes nationwide, and these form an important partnership with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent crime and protect communities, especially the elderly and more vulnerable persons.  In addition, the Garda Text Alert Scheme provides an effective means for Garda&iacute; to communicate crime prevention information to local communities.  Since it was launched in September 2013, it has grown quickly with a total of 164,000 subscribers and in the order of 3 million text messages sent annually.  Every Garda Division, rural and urban, now offers the text alert service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has published guidelines to assist in the establishment and operation of local groups. </p>  <p>  I was glad to announce a new cost rebate scheme recently which will assist local text alert groups with the costs incurred from service providers.  The scheme is administered by Muintir na Tire and is open to all Text Alert groups registered with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Overall, the funding available from my Department for Community Crime Prevention, such as Community Alert and Text Alert, has been doubled in 2016.</p>  <p>  On 9 June 2016 the Garda Commissioner launched a five year programme to professionalise, modernise and renew An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure that it can meet present and future policing and security challenges. Important elements of the Garda plan include: </p>  <p>- increased Garda visibility with crime prevention being the number one priority</p>  <p>- victims being placed at the heart of the Garda service</p>  <p>- introduction of advanced IT systems to enhance the investigation of crime</p>  <p>- enhanced collaboration with national and international partners to tackle and disrupt terrorism and organised crime.</p>  <p>  The Garda modernisation plan was developed with the benefit of inputs from Garda personnel and community stakeholders, as well as the experience of police forces in other jurisdictions.  The measures in the plan also respond to reports and recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.</p>  <p>  In conclusion, all Garda activities, including community policing, will undoubtedly benefit from the resources now coming on stream through the Garda recruitment programme, and in particular the Government's commitment to increase Garda numbers to 15,000, so that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has the capacity to address the needs of communities throughout the country and into the future.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Kildare Division, on the 30 September 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 307.  There were also 23 Garda Reserves and 26 civilians attached to the Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.</p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p>  <p>   I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  Since the reopening of the Garda College, 534 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am informed that of these, 25 have been assigned to the Kildare Division. Another 150 trainee Garda will attest this Thursday, 17 November which will bring Garda numbers to around the 13,000 mark by year end. </p>  <p>  The Government's plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I expect that the Kildare Division, like all other Garda Divisions will benefit from these new resources becoming available.</p></reply>

This is c.&euro;0.2 billion more than the level that is forecast as being compliant with the expenditure benchmark.  The calculation in Table A7 of the Budget book shows net fiscal space for 2017 of &euro;-0.2 billion, indicating an excess over forecast permitted expenditure.  This level of deviation equated to about 0.07% of GDP, which is substantially below the 0.5% of GDP that is defined as a significant deviation.</p>  <p>  This excess over permitted expenditure in 2017 is due to the projected increase in our non-discretionary EU Budget contribution arising from the large revision in our GDP.  As this is a factor beyond our control, the Government has decided not to alter its fiscal plans to cope with a one-off level shift in our EU contribution.  </p>  <p>  As regards our 2017 Budget, we expect that the European Commission will find that Ireland is broadly compliant with its obligation.  Indeed, following the submission of draft budgetary plans for 2017, Ireland is one of the countries that the European Commission did not write to seeking clarification or changes.</p></reply>

In this context I wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank to request that an assessment be undertaken of the range of available sustainable restructure solutions offered by banks and non-bank entities and that this assessment should consider in particular how the available options may impact on the distressed borrower's capacity to remain in their primary residence. </p>  <p>  The Central Bank has recently submitted its report to me and my officials are currently reviewing it.  The report provides valuable insights on the range of available mortgage restructure options offered by banks and non-banks.  </p>  <p>  The CCMA is a statutory code under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989.  The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and lenders to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow.  The Central Bank has the power to administer sanctions for a contravention of the CCMA under Part IIIC of the Central Bank Act 1942. </p>  <p>  Finally, the Deputy should be aware that the numbers in mortgage arrears have been steadily declining.  Data released by the Central Bank on 13 September shows that to end-Q2 2016, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears for principal dwelling houses (PDH) has declined for the last twelve quarters.  Some 120,614 PDH accounts were also classified as restructured.  It is clear that where a borrower actively engages with their lender under the CCMA with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that the borrower will be able to remain in their family home. </p></reply>

The Initiative was extended beyond the original planned pilot cities of Limerick and Waterford, to include the cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Kilkenny. In line with my Department's commitment to evidence based policy-making, the inclusion of these additional four cities followed the completion of a comprehensive, independent ex-ante cost benefit analysis.</p><p>Following the commitment referred to by the Deputy, my officials have undertaken a further review of the Living City Initiative this year, and this was published in the Report on Tax Expenditures (October 2016) that was released on Budget Day.  This document is available at <i>.</i></p><p>In light of this report, and in consultation with the relevant councils and the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, I announced a number of changes to the scheme in the Budget which aim to make the scheme more attractive and effective.</p><p>The principal change is to extend the residential element of the scheme to landlords, who will now be able to claim the relief by way of accelerated capital allowances for the conversion and refurbishment of property which was built prior to 1915, to be used for residential purposes.  Eligible expenditure must be incurred during the relevant qualifying period which will begin on 1 January 2017 and terminate on 4 May 2020, which is the pre-existing end-date for the scheme.  The allowances are at the rate of 15% per annum for 6 years with 10% in year 7. </p><p>In addition, I have decided to remove the requirement for a pre-1915 building to have been originally constructed for use as a dwelling in order to qualify for the residential element of the Initiative.  The floor area restriction for owner-occupiers has also been removed and in its place, relief claimed by owner-occupiers under the Initiative will be subject to the high earners restriction.  The minimum amount of capital expenditure required for eligibility for relief under all elements of the scheme is also being amended and must from 2017 exceed &euro;5,000.</p><p>Subject to Oireachtas approval of the Finance Bill 2016, these changes will come into operation from 1 January 2017.  My Department will continue to monitor the Initiative in consultation with the other stakeholders, particularly in light of these alterations.</p></reply>

However I can provide the following general information with regard to the taxation of widowed persons in the year of bereavement, and in subsequent years.</p><p>In regard to the tax year in which a spouse has died, the allocation of standard rate bands and personal credits varies depending on how the couple were assessed to tax.</p><p>In the case of a couple assessed on the basis of joint assessment where the deceased individual was not the &quot;assessable spouse&quot; (i.e. the spouse responsible for making a joint return on behalf of the couple), the assessable spouse will continue to be entitled to married persons' tax credits and rate bands until the end of that year. </p><p>Where the deceased individual was the &quot;assessable spouse&quot;, the surviving spouse is taxed on a joint assessed basis for the period to the date of death, and for the balance of the tax year the surviving spouse is taxed as a single person but with an increased personal tax credit of &euro;3,300 (equivalent to the married tax credit) in respect of that period.</p><p>Where the spouses were assessed on the basis of separate treatment (i.e., taxed as single individuals) the surviving spouse is entitled to the increased personal tax credit of &euro;3,300 in respect the year of death.  </p><p>In subsequent years, a person whose spouse has died will be entitled to the widowed person's tax credit of &euro;2,190 if there are no dependent children.  If there are dependent children the surviving spouse will be entitled to the single personal tax credit of &euro;1,650 and the single person child carer tax credit of &euro;1,650, and a widowed parent tax credit is also available for the five years following the year of bereavement.  This credit tapers out over the five years and the current rates are: &euro;3,600 in year one (the first year following bereavement), &euro;3,150 in year two, &euro;2,700 in year three, &euro;2,250 in year four, and &euro;1,800 in year five.</p><p>It is also worth noting that, following the death of a spouse, the surviving spouse may have an entitlement to a widow or widower's pension from the Department of Social Protection.  As the Department of Social Protection do not operate PAYE, an individual's tax credits may be reduced in order to collect the tax due in respect of this payment.

In the case of a self-build home, they must have drawn down of the first tranche of the relevant mortgage on or after that date.  The full conditions of the scheme and its commencement remain subject to the approval of the Finance Bill 2016 by the Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  The date of 19 July was chosen as it was the date of the launch of  Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness when the introduction of the incentive was initially announced.  The backdating of this incentive was announced at that time with a view to avoiding any potential interruption in house sales, by purchasers who may otherwise have deferred purchases, pending the announcement of full details of the incentive.</p>  <p>  It is not clear if the Deputy is seeking a further backdating of the incentive prior to this date but those who entered into contracts to purchase new homes in advance of July 19th last would have made their purchasing decisions without any expectation that they would qualify for any tax relief to be introduced at a future date.  Therefore any further backdating of the relief would consist of pure deadweight.  As with all time-limited reliefs, there will always be people who just miss out.  I do not intend to extend the parameters of this new measure as to do so would make it less targeted and more costly.</p></reply>

I consider that this particular relief has lost focus since its introduction because of changes made to how it operates over the years.  The purpose of my amendment is to realign the exemption with its original policy objective i.e. to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability for a person who inherited a house in which he or she had been living with the deceased and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.  The changes I have proposed will have two principal effects. </p>  <p>  Firstly, the exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. </p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the disponer's principal private residence at the date of death.  This requirement will be relaxed in situations where the disponer lives elsewhere at the date of death-for example, in a nursing home-because he or she has had to leave the house because of ill health. </p>  <p>  If my amendment is accepted by the Oireachtas and enacted in the Finance Bill, it will take effect from the date of enactment.  There will not be any provision for transitional arrangements for those people who may have arrange their affairs with the intention of taking advantage of the exemption when the required three-year period of occupation comes to an end.  As the provision was originally intended to alleviate hardship it is not my intention to make transitional arrangements to facilitate individuals who intended to make use of it to transfer assets free of capital acquisitions tax.</p>  <p>  I am also aware that connected amendments have been proposed by other deputies which are likely to be discussed at Committee Stage.  </p></reply>

The review by Revenue will provide an opportunity for the sector under review to change its structures as necessary and there is no specified time in which the Minister for Finance must decide on restrictions to the flat-rate scheme.  The Minister for Finance will have the ability to delay signing an Order to restrict the flat-rate addition, if he believes that the effected agricultural sector are rearranging their business structures, contractual arrangements or models to provide that no systemic excess of flat-rate addition payments will incur.</p></reply>

It would incentivise landlords to only accept tenants in receipt of rent supplement, and as a consequence put increased pressure on tenants currently renting in the private market, which could potentially result in increased need for social housing supports.  It could also create particular difficulties for tenants who transition out of rent supplement for example as a result of gaining employment or increased income as their landlord would be incentivised to end the tenancy in order to continue renting to a person in receipt of rent supplement.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware that last year in Budget 2016 I introduced a new incentive to encourage landlords to commit to letting their property to tenants in receipt of social housing supports for a minimum period of three years.  The incentive acts by allowing such landlords to claim a deduction for 100% of qualifying mortgage interest relief, in place of the 75% deduction which currently applies in respect of rented residential property in general.  This was introduced as a time-limited measure, specifically targeted to improve certainty of supply of rental housing for such tenants.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017, as part of a package of measures designed to support housing supply, I announced that a full 100% deduction of qualifying interest for all residential landlords will be restored.  However in order to preserve the current incentive for landlords to house tenants in receipt of social housing supports, full deductibility for other landlords is being restored on an incremental basis over the next 5 years.</p>  <p>  It is my view that these measures are more appropriate than a tax free allowance of the nature proposed by the Deputy.</p></reply>

The introduction of two thresholds provides an incentive to develop blended solid fuels with a higher biomass content.  To further the environmental rationale, this relief is available only for low smoke solid fuels.</p></reply>

When first announced, the stated purposes of individualisation were, essentially, to ease the burden on single persons (65% of the work force), to take workers on the average industrial wage out of the higher rate of tax and more generally to facilitate a reduction in the numbers paying tax at the higher rate.  Prior to this, a second spouse faced the marginal rate of tax on the first euro (or Punt as it was then) earned in his or her own name.</p>  <p>  Individualisation was progressed to some extent in later years but never completed.  The result is that we now have a hybrid system.  Up to &euro;9,000 of the standard-rate band can be transferred between spouses and the full married personal tax credits, can be allocated in full to one spouse.  Because the income tax system allows married couples to choose whether to be jointly or individually assessed, there can be a difference between the tax liabilities incurred by married couples on the same household income, depending on the method of assessment chosen.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to stress that married one-earner couples on average earnings are not affected by the different standard rate bands under the current structure as the married one-income band standard rate band of &euro;42,800 is in excess of the current average wage.  Furthermore, the &euro;9,000 transferable standard rate band, which married one earner couples can avail of, reduces their income tax liability to around half that incurred by a single individual earning a similar income.</p>  <p>  The difference in treatment for couples depending on whether one or both work may be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that there are costs associated with earning an income, such as travel and childcare costs.  Such costs are likely to be greater if two persons, rather than one person, work outside the home to earn the same gross income.</p>  <p>  It is my view that individualisation has now bedded into the tax system to a degree where it cannot be changed easily, and there are no plans to do so.  It was estimated last year that to complete or to reverse individualisation would cost in the region of &euro;800 million.  Such a cost, if it related to the reversal of individualisation, would result in an increased burden of taxation on other cohorts of taxpayers including single parent families and single individuals.</p>  <p>  However, you may be aware that a Home Carer Tax Credit may be claimed where one spouse works primarily in the home to care for a dependent person, such as a child or an elderly relative.  This credit was introduced in the context of the move towards individualisation of the tax system, in recognition of the choices made by families where one spouse stays at home to care for children or the elderly.  In the recent Budget, I announced an increase in this credit from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1,100 per year, effectively allowing the credit to shelter family income of &euro;5,500 from taxation.  This follows on from last year's Budget where the credit was increased from &euro;810 to &euro;1,000.</p>  <p>  The constitutionality of the various provisions of the tax code are ultimately a matter for the courts to decide, where issues are put before them.  However, I would point out that due regard is given to the provisions of the Constitution when constructing the tax code.</p>  <p>  The issue of tax individualisation was considered by the Commission on Taxation in 2009 and that body recommended no change should be made to the current system.  It concluded that the current system represents a balance between, on the one hand, acknowledging the choices families make in caring for children and, on the other, taking account of the need to encourage labour market participation.</p>  <p>  As regards future measures, in the Programme for a Partnership Government there is a commitment to ask the Oireachtas to continue to phase out the USC as part of a wider medium-term income tax reform plan that keeps the tax base broad, reduces excessive tax rates for middle income earners, and limits the benefit for high earners.  The changes introduced in the last three Budgets have commenced reducing the income tax burden with an emphasis on low and middle income earners, and it is my intention to continue this process in future Budgets, as fiscal resources allow.</p>  <p>  In relation to childcare, this is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in the first instance.  Minister Zappone has announced the introduction of a new Affordable Childcare Scheme which will be available to all families both single income and double income.  It is important to recognise that the Affordable Childcare Scheme is only one element of a broader set of commitments and supports aimed at parents and children.  The provision of improved services for centre-based care is very important, as also are the needs of children who do not attend such services. </p>  <p>  In this regard, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People contains a commitment to produce Ireland's first-ever National Early Years Strategy.  The intention is to deliver a cross-cutting strategy which will take a joined-up, whole of Government approach to the issue of supporting children and their families during the early years (0-6 years).  The drafting of the National Early Years Strategy is at an advanced stage and the Department of Children will hold an Open Policy Debate on the strategy before the end of the year with a view to publication shortly thereafter.  Minister Zappone and her Department are open to hearing views about supports for parents raising children at home.</p></reply>

Neither I nor the Central Bank of Ireland, can interfere in the provision or pricing of insurance products, as these matters are of a commercial nature, and are determined by insurance companies based on an assessment of the risks they are willing to accept. </p>  <p>  This inability to intervene in such matters is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  </p>  <p>  However, I do accept that it is possible for the State to play a role in helping to stabilise the market.  Consequently, I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The initial focus of the Working Group is on the factors that are contributing to the cost and availability of motor insurance and identifying what short-term, medium-term and long-term measures can be introduced to help consumers and businesses.  </p>  <p>  It is likely however that because of some of the common factors underlying all  insurance lines that many of the recommendations being considered will also address the difficulties being experienced in the cost and availability of other types of insurance, including public liability insurance. </p>  <p>  The Working Group has met with a number of stakeholders during the course of its work, including the representative body that the Deputy refers to.  This consultation included a presentation of to the Minister for State of its survey findings.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that at the end of October 2016, the Working Group provided me with an initial set of emerging recommendations.  Since then, the Working Group has been working to finalise the Report and developing an action plan to enable the relevant Government Departments and Offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions.  The report and action plan will detail any legislative or regulatory changes that may be required and will include a detailed timeline for implementation.</p></reply>

This is contributing to what we know is already a considerable strain on some students and their families to participate in higher education with knock-on effects on completion rates.  The reality is that dealing comprehensively with this issue will only take place as part of a more general programme to address the major housing and homelessness issue.</p><p>Accordingly, my colleague Mr. Simon Coveney T.D., Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, on 19 July 2016 published <i>&ldquo;</i><i>&rdquo;</i>, following Government approval of this comprehensive and ambitious Plan.  The full plan can be accessed at:<i></i>.</p><p>My Department worked closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in developing this Plan, with a specific focus on student accommodation, and I very much welcome the commitments contained in the plan and I look forward to working with colleagues on a cross-Departmental basis to ensure that the commitments contained in the Plan are implemented as soon as practicable.</p><p>The current position in respect of the specific measures relating to student accommodation as detailed in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>is as follows:</p><p><i>(i) The Department of Education and Skills in conjunction with a number of other key stakeholders will prepare and publish a national student accommodation strategy, which will set out a broad framework for delivery of an enhanced level of accommodation and which will inform local authority housing strategies and the land management process in general, in order to provide suitably located and affordable sites.  This will be prepared with a view to developing a national policy on specific needs and mechanisms for the development of appropriate on-campus and off-campus student accommodation.</i></p><p>Action: <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>details that this plan will be in place by Q2 2017 and my Department is working on the development of this plan with a view to meeting the timescale envisaged in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>.</p><p><i>(ii) My Department will work with stakeholders to prioritise and progress viable projects to provide additional student accommodation in key urban areas.  This will be done with a view to bringing on stream proposals capable of delivering an additional 7,000 student accommodation places by end 2019, on or off campus, in addition to projects already committed to.</i></p><p>Action: <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>details that the initial assessment will be completed during Q4 2016 and officials from my Department are working closely with officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government with a view to meeting the timescale envisaged in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>.</p><p><i>(iii) Dedicated delivery structures, such as Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) will be established in the Higher Education Institutions (HEI) sector to access Housing Finance Agency (HFA) funding, and complete any required policy, regulatory or legislative changes necessary.  This will be done with a view to providing additional funding mechanisms for the HEI sector, in conjunction with the HFA.</i></p><p><i>(iv) The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will enable student accommodation projects for 100 units or more to go straight to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, as well as maximise the opportunities for joint venture projects on local authority sites to proceed through the Part 8 process and prepare guidance on planning policies around student accommodation developments.  This will be done to enhance certainty and reduce delivery timescales and costs associated with bringing student accommodation proposals forward.</i></p><p>Action: To facilitate early action on new processes and structures which are key to the delivery of housing and the regulation of the housing sector, the Government approved the publication of the General Scheme of a Planning and Development (Housing and Residential Tenancies) Bill in September and is now prioritising its drafting and full publication to enable a number of legislative actions and reforms highlighted across the five pillars of the Action Plan.  This includes facilitating (for a limited time-period) planning applications for large-scale housing developments and student accommodation developments, being made directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and facilitating Higher Education Institutes to borrow monies from the Housing Finance Agency for the purposes of financing student accommodation provision.  Officials from my Department have been linking in directly with officials in the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and with representatives of the Higher Education Institutions around the modalities and practicalities for implementing these measures once the proposed legislation has been implemented.</p><p><i>(v) The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government will help to fund a Student Housing Officer to work with the Union of Students in Ireland, local authorities, AHBs and housing providers, to identify and expand short-term capacity enhancing measures in the student accommodation sector.  This will be done with a view to assisting students in finding appropriate accommodation.</i></p><p>Action:  Funding for a Student Housing Officer to work with the Union of Students in Ireland has been agreed for 2016 with a commitment to examine future funding needs going forward.  This builds on the funding of &euro;30,000 which was provided to Union of Students in Ireland (USI) by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) to fund their 2016 #HomesForStudy campaign.</p><p><i>(vi) Funding mechanisms will be established for Institutes of Technology to support the development of their student accommodation capacity.  This is to facilitate the Institute of Technology sector in developing their potential for on-campus student accommodation through addressing current borrowing capacity and funding constraints.</i></p><p>Action: I believe that a borrowing framework for the IOT sector would deliver significant benefits.  My officials are in discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to examine ways Institutes of Technology can be facilitated in developing on-campus student accommodation through addressing borrowing capacity and funding constraints.</p><p><i>(vii) The Department of Housing Planning Community and Local Government in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills will carry out an assessment of scope for provision of additional student accommodation on local authority or other publicly-owned lands with a view to maximising the potential for student accommodation provision on suitable sites as part of mixed developments.</i></p><p>Action: Work is ongoing in the Department of Housing, Planning Community and Local Government on developing a comprehensive database of publicly owned lands in key developable areas with a view to identifying land suitable for housing development.  The database of publicly owned lands will also inform the scope for provision of additional student accommodation.</p><p>In addition to these developments, I should point out that a number of our Higher Education Institutions have Student Accommodation projects ongoing, or in the pipeline, with a number of additional on-campus Student Accommodation bed-spaces coming online from September 2016.  Maynooth University have 296 new on-campus bed spaces, and UCD have 350 new on-campus bed spaces, which came on stream for the commencement of the 2016/17 academic year.  Six other Higher Education Institutions are currently engaged in, or going through the planning phases for student accommodation projects, namely National University of Ireland Galway, Trinity College Dublin, University of Limerick, Dublin City University, University College Cork and Dublin Institute of Technology.</p><p>The Actions in the Plan in relation to Student Accommodation build on the report, Student Accommodation: Demand &amp;amp; Supply, which was published last year by the Minister for Education and Skills.  The full report can be accessed at:</p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The previous Minister for Education and Skills introduced two immediate actions following the publication of this report.  Firstly, and as already pointed out, funding was provided by the HEA to the Union of Students' (USI) in Ireland to progress short-term solutions for students in need of accommodation.  This funding allowed USI to develop their homes.usi.ie website, to communicate more effectively to students and homeowners, and to carry out research into this important issue.</p><p>Secondly, this led to the establishment of an inter-departmental steering group to examine the recommendations contained in the HEA Report and to provide a coordinating mechanism to ensure that the higher education institutions have access to information on new potential funding and delivery models.</p></reply>

It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and guidance and counselling services, and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally. </p>  <p>  My Department has issued Well-Being in Post Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention  to all primary schools in 2013  and Well-Being in Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion 2015 to all  schools.  These guidelines were developed in conjunction with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive. The Guidelines have been circulated to schools and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.  </p>  <p>  The Guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners and by the findings of current research. They provide practical guidance to schools on how they can promote health and mental well-being in an integrated school-wide way and they also provide evidence-based advice on how to support young people who may be at risk. </p>  <p>  These guidelines complement existing measures to promote positive mental health at primary level. They build on the significant work already taking place in schools, including through the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum, the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) continuum of support model and the HSE, Health Promoting Schools Process.</p>  <p>  The SPHE curriculum is mandatory up to junior cycle and contains a number of specific aims that are relevant to positive mental health and promotion of healthy lifestyles through exploration of substance use and misuse.  These include promoting all aspects of the child's health, fostering in the child a sense of care and respect for himself/herself, and enabling the young person to make informed decisions and choices about all aspects of life including health.</p>  <p>  Schools are also encouraged to participate in the 'Health Promoting Schools' initiative, which is supported by the Department of Health. This European-wide programme aims to strengthen schools' capacity to be a healthy setting for learning and working by focusing at whole-school level on all the conditions that affect health and well-being. The results from the second Lifeskills survey which were published by my Department in January of this year indicate that approximately 40% of respondent primary schools are currently in the Health Promoting Schools initiative or are in the process of joining.  My Department is working with the Department of Health to increase participation among primary schools.</p></reply>

Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts in both the primary and post-primary sector.</p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals. It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders. This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles. The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders. Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards.</p>  <p>  My Department recently published &ldquo;Looking at Our School 2016", a quality framework for primary and post primary schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. The current review of the post of responsibility structure in schools will also, in the context of restoration of posts, address the further development of a distributed leadership model in schools.</p></reply>

This Budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education, and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade. The budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post primary schools next year.

This means that any person including a member of the public, an employer or a teacher may make a complaint to the Teaching Council about a registered teacher.</p>  <p>  A complaint may proceed to an inquiry and, if deemed necessary, sanctions ranging from advice, admonishment or censure to suspension or removal from the register may be imposed by the Council. The Deputy will appreciate that the fitness to teach process is independent of my Department and the Deputy should contact the Council directly if she is seeking information on the number of complaints received.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that, under Section 55 of the Teaching Council Act, the Council is obliged to submit an annual report of its activities and proceedings under the Act to me as Minister. Fitness to Teach was commenced on 25 July during the current reporting year. I look forward to the next annual report which will be due after 28 March next.</p>  <p>  The provisions of the Education Act, 1998 (Sections 24 and 28) are relevant to the new investigatory powers of the Teaching Council under Part 5. Section 24 as amended provides for inter alia the appointment, suspension and dismissal of teachers by boards of management in accordance with procedures agreed from time to time between the Minister, the patron, recognised school management organisations and any recognised trade union and staff association representing teachers or other staff as appropriate. The agreed procedures provide for two separate and independent strands which should be utilised in appropriate circumstances:</p>  <p>-  Procedures relating to professional competence issues </p>  <p>-  Procedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional competence </p>  <p>The procedures are set out for schools in Circulars  60/2009 and 0071/2014 which are available on my Department's website. </p>  <p>  Schools, as teachers' employers, will, therefore, continue to manage issues of teacher conduct or poor professional performance under Section 24 of the Education Act. Parental complaints in relation to teacher conduct or poor professional performance will, in general, also continue to be investigated in the first instance by a school under the Section 24 procedures.</p>  <p>  Under the Teaching Council Act, the Teaching Council is obliged to pause its investigation of a complaint where a Section 24 process is in hand, except where there are good and sufficient reasons to do otherwise. I am advised by the Teaching Council that its Investigating Committee will take any Section 24 procedures into consideration as appropriate. </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government provides, in addition, that the Government will introduce a charter for parents.</p>  <p>  In that regard, my Department has been working on draft legislation to provide for the replacement of the current Section 28 of the Education Act, 1998. The legislation will provide the statutory basis for ministerial guidelines which will form the framework for a Parents&rsquo; and Students&rsquo; Charter in every school, following consultation with parents, students, recognised school management bodies and staff associations representing teachers and other appropriate bodies. Revised local complaint and grievance procedures will be a key part of the Charter.</p>  <p>  I plan to make an announcement shortly on the draft legislation. </p>  <p>  With the Teaching Council (Amendment) Act 2015 having been commenced in full, the only remaining section of the principal act to be commenced is Section 39. I am advised by the Teaching Council that Cos&aacute;n, the national framework for teacher&rsquo;s learning (CPD) is now entering a development phase which is due to conclude in 2020. This will then pave the way for the commencement of this section of the Act.</p></reply>

These included pay reductions and also reductions to the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, since 2011. Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road/Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. </p>  <p>  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.</p>  <p>  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.</p></reply>

The new curriculum area of Well-being will also be introduced at that time.</p>  <p>  Phase 4 will begin implementation in September 2018 with the introduction of Mathematics, Home Economics, History, Music and Geography, with the final phase 5 being implemented from September 2019. Phase 5 subjects will include Technology subjects, Religious Education, Jewish Studies and Classics.</p>  <p>  Teachers of English who are members of ASTI have been directed by their union that, while they are to teach the new Junior Cycle subject specification, they are not to undertake Classroom Based Assessments (CBAs) with their students. CBAs form a key element of the new Junior Cycle. Therefore, students who are taught by a teacher who is a member of the ASTI will not receive a grade for their CBAs and also since the written Assessment Task which is to be completed by students is linked to the second CBA, which is worth 10% of the marks for the final examination, these students cannot complete the Assessment Task, or gain marks for this examination component. Candidates for Junior Cycle English in 2017 who do not complete the assessment task can only be marked and graded based on a maximum of 90% of the available marks.</p>  <p>  My Department requested the ASTI to provide an immediate derogation from their directive regarding the CBAs for current teachers of English in order that some current third year English students are no longer unfairly and unjustifiably disadvantaged. However, the ASTI did not accede to this request. My Department remains in contact with ASTI on these matters.</p></reply>

The Plan provides a key statement on the reform agenda across education and training and contains a range of actions to be implemented with particular focus on disadvantage, skills, and continuous improvement within the education service</p>  <p>  Key objectives of the Plan that address skills shortages are to: develop innovative responses to skills gaps across key priority areas of the economy; expand Apprenticeships and Traineeships; develop Regional Skills Plans to respond to local needs; expand Skillnets to reach more employers with new options for upgrading skills; reform the funding model for higher education to support Ireland&rsquo;s growth ambitions and the system&rsquo;s capacity to meet specific targets on skills gaps; and to increase the availability of quality entrepreneurship programmes and modules in schools and in higher and further education.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Skills Strategy which was launched by my Department earlier this year will provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland&rsquo;s growth both economically and societally over the next decade. Included in the actions is the creation of a new National Skills Council. The Council, when established shortly, will oversee research and advise on prioritisation and delivery of identified skills needs.</p>  <p>  The SOLAS 2016 service plan sets out measures to address Further Education and Training (FET) skill needs in line with labour market and EGFSN forecasts.  ETBs are currently reviewing existing provision for the purpose of matching capacity with potential demand for specific programmes e.g. apprenticeship, engineering, entrepreneurship and IT. This will also enable the realignment of course provision to meet identified skills shortages.  Based on skills need forecasts, the 2016 FET service plan is making provision for almost 340,000 beneficiaries this year.</p>  <p>  As well as mainstream provision in the higher education sector, Springboard+ 2016, which incorporates the ICT skills conversion programme, is providing almost 6,000 free higher education places for jobseekers who wish to upskill or reskill in areas where there are identified skills needs</p>  <p>  Courses will be delivered in areas such as ICT, Manufacturing which includes the biopharma sector, Construction, Entrepreneurship, Cross-Enterprise Skills, the Hospitality Sector and International Financial Services.</p></reply>

This will contribute to delivering a &ldquo;Step-Change&rdquo; in the development of critical skills, knowledge and competences and providing the foundations for participation in work and society. </p>  <p>  The roll-out of the new Leaving Certificate subject of Politics and Society has commenced in 41 schools from September 2016, following an open invitation to introduce this as an optional Leaving Certificate subject. Politics and Society aims to develop the student's ability to be a reflective and active citizen, in a way that is informed by the insights and skills of social and political science. The introduction of the specification is part of my Department's commemoration of 1916 and its commitment to education for sustainable development. The subject will be available to all schools from 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to enhancing the availability of technology in schools through the introduction of ICT/Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject. As set out in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is conducting a scoping exercise in this regard. Informed by this research, the NCCA will work on development of a draft subject specification in 2017, with a view to implementation in schools in September 2019. </p>  <p>  Physical Education is being developed by the NCCA as a full subject that can be assessed for the Leaving Certificate in a manner similar to other subjects. A specification for Leaving Certificate Physical Education is due to be finalised by the NCCA by the end of 2016. In addition, a Senior Cycle Physical Education Framework specification  has recently been completed by the NCCA. The Framework will assist schools to design a P.E. programme for those students who may not choose to take P.E. as part of their Leaving Certificate examination.  These developments are in keeping with the strong emphasis from my Department on promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for all students and commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education also includes commitments to finalise and implement additional subject specifications at Leaving Certificate level as resources permit.</p></reply>

The ratio of 27:1 is an overall classroom teacher allocation ratio for the school and is not a reference to class size.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. Depending on the circumstances of the school, e.g. higher pupil numbers in certain classes, accommodation available, there may be a variation in the size of the classes in the school.  School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any one class is kept as low as possible, taking into account all of the above factors.  The Department also requests school authorities to use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.</p>  <p>  Each 1 point adjustment to the staffing schedule is estimated to cost in the region of &euro;15m-&euro;18m per annum.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 sets out the resources available for schools for the 2017/18 school year.

These included pay reductions and also reductions to the pay of new entrant public servants, including teachers, since 2011. Collective agreements reached between the Government and the public service unions provided vital industrial peace during this very difficult period for the State.</p>  <p>  The Haddington Road/Lansdowne Road Agreement has allowed a programme of restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers. </p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. </p>  <p>  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.

The allocation of 7430 posts for schools represents an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers which have been allocated since the 2011/12 school year, at which point 5265 posts were allocated.  </p>  <p>  In addition, over 5000 learning support posts have been allocated to schools under the General Allocation Model for primary schools and Learning Support allocations for post primary schools.   </p>  <p>  Approximately 150 new Special Classes will be opened for the 2016/17 school year, which means there will be over 1,150 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p>  <p>  125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it.</p>  <p>  As part the recent Budget announcements, an additional 115 SNA posts at an annual cost of &euro;3.75m will be provided for allocation from January to June 2017 and an additional &euro;18 million in 2017 to provide for around 900 additional resource teacher posts. </p>  <p>  I also announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years, a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017. Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months. </p>  <p>  The combination of supports provided means that school places are available for all children with special educational needs, regardless of their level of need.</p>  <p>  The provision which is being made ensures that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.  I can confirm that this Government will continue to ensure that the supports required to ensure that all children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education will be provided.</p>  <p>  There is still a long way to go and as committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government, I plan to examine the adequacy of the present policies and provision, and their scope for improvement, particularly in relation to speech and language difficulties and early intervention.</p></reply>

To this end, my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify the areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. The system uses a range of data sources in carrying out nationwide demographic exercises to determine where additional school accommodation is needed at primary and post-primary level. The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015, 13 new schools were announced to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018.</p>  <p>  The November 2015 announcement also detailed the new building projects and major extensions, including special schools, that will be progressed in areas where significant demographic need has been established. In addition, the 6 Year Programme (2016-21) prioritises projects that in addition to meeting increases in enrolments, have a major deficit of mainstream accommodation capacity for current enrolments, require major refurbishment and replacement of poor accommodation. School projects that were announced under my Department's 5 Year Plan (2012-16) will also be advanced in the Capital Programme.</p>  <p>  While all projects included in the Programme are based on the educational and demographic needs of the particular school and area, the decision of when exactly each individual school building project can proceed to tender and construction is based on a number of factors including the stage reached by the project in architectural planning, the level of overall funding available and the other contractual commitments and profiled expenditures extant under the Programme at that time.</p>  <p>  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for smaller scale projects for schools, where an immediate accommodation requirement has been identified, such as the appointment of an additional teacher. In that regard, it is open to schools to apply for funding for additional classroom accommodation, where required.</p></reply>

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a' fail' ceased in 1968. </p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected. Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level. In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher-achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower-achieving end of the Higher level distribution. This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics,  known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. </p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.</p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.</p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example). In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.</p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar. These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students. The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete. By this time students will have been through the new maths cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers. I have asked the State Examinations Commission to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process. The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.</p></reply>

Institutes report on retention measures in place within their institutes to combat high non-progression rates. The HEA funds retention initiatives in Computer Science disciplines in higher education institutions through the Information Technology Investment Fund.  In 2015 these initiatives included additional classes, attendance mentoring, teaching and learning initiatives, student support sessions, buddy practical&rsquo;s and maths enabling courses. In 2016 the National Forum for Teaching and Learning established an ICT Retention Scoping Group to examine ways in which students could be enabled to complete ICT courses.  The group working with practitioners and industry are examining areas such as career guidance, pathways, provision and pedagogy. </p>  <p>  One of the key objectives of the National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education 2015-2019 (&lsquo;National Access Plan&rsquo;) is to address the issue of non-completion within higher education institutions, for those in under-represented target groups. The Plan also commits to the further development of mechanisms to track the progression, retention and student experience of target groups. The target student groups include entrants from socio-economic groups that have low participation in higher education; first time mature student entrants and students with disabilities. </p>  <p>  To support the implementation of these objectives, a Working Group is being established to consider the issues contributing to the non-completion of target groups in the National Access Plan and to produce recommendations for policy and practice. The group is being convened by the Higher Education Authority (HEA) and will include representatives of relevant stakeholders.   Considerations of members will be informed by recent, qualitative research by the National Forum for Teaching and Learning on the reasons why students leave higher education (National Forum for Teaching and Learning, 2015).</p></reply>

Its first task was to formally invite proposals for new apprenticeship programmes from consortia of enterprise, professional bodies and education and training providers. Over 80 separate proposals were received all of which were evaluated by the Council. Following the evaluation process, the Council prioritised 25 proposals for development. Included in these proposals are a number of proposals in the hospitality sector, particularly in the culinary area. </p>  <p>  Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship through the Apprenticeship Council and it is envisaged that this programme will commence in 2017. A separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship was recently approved development funding by the Apprenticeship Council. The Council will continue to work closely with these consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis.</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged that the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships is low as they operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment. SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage women to take up apprenticeships in these areas. Despite this the number of female apprentices remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers. 25 proposals have been prioritised by the Council for development. In recent months, we have seen the first of these new apprenticeships with the new Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship recently commencing. Further new apprenticeships will get underway later this year and early next year. Many of these new programmes are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident that this will lead to a strong increase in female participation when these new apprenticeships are launched in the coming months. </p>  <p>  Accompanying the renewal and expansion of apprenticeship in Ireland will be a new branding and marketing campaign. SOLAS will examine how this campaign can assist with promoting apprenticeship to women and to their potential employers.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's policy in allocating this support. </p><p>Circular 0042/2011 provides information to schools regarding the staffing arrangements which apply in Special schools. The Circular sets out that special schools are staffed based on their pupil profiles and the disability category of the pupils enrolled, as opposed to being based principally on school designation. Staffing levels therefore reflect the complexity of needs that exist within schools rather than being determined solely by a school's designation, in recognition that many Special schools enrol students from disability categories other than from those provided for by their school designations. </p><p>In determining the staffing allocation for schools, the NCSE takes into account up-to-date enrolment and pupil profile information. School staffing schedules are reviewed and updated each year by the NCSE. As such, the profile of Special school pupil populations are aligned with appropriate staffing allocations. </p><p>Staffing arrangements for special schools are in line with policy advice provided by the NCSE, which did not recommend alteration to staffing ratios established under the Report of the Special Education Review Committee (SERC).</p><p>In addition, as outlined in the SERC Report, administrative principals should be recognised in all special schools at the point at which the sixth teacher (i.e. the fifth assistant teacher) is about to be appointed. </p><p>There are no plans to deviate from these arrangements for special schools that do not meet the criteria set out above.</p><p>The school to which the Deputy refers, having a staffing of 1 principal and 3 assistant teachers, is not eligible for an administrative principal post at this point in time as the school does not meet the qualifying criteria.</p><p>I am aware of the workload and the pressures on teaching Principals.  In this regard, my Department has provided release days for teaching principals to assist them in fulfilling their Principal duties. Circular 25/02 which is available on my Department's website outlines the number of days that teaching principals may take as release time in a school year. </p><p>Under these arrangements my Department pays for a substitute teacher to be employed by a school to facilitate administrative functions to be undertaken by the teaching principal. Under the current arrangements the number of days that principal teachers may take as release time in each school year ranges between 14 and 22 days depending on the size of the school. My Department provides capitation funding to all recognised primary schools.  The amount of grant paid to an individual primary school for capitation and ancillary services is determined by the school&rsquo;s enrolment, subject to a minimum grant for both capitation and ancillary services in respect of schools with enrolments up to 60, and a maximum ancillary services grant in the case of schools with enrolments of 500 or more.</p><p>Boards of Management have autonomy on how they use and prioritise that funding to meet their day to day running costs including for the provision of secretarial services, to assist with school administration.</p><p>The detailed arrangements are set out in Circular 0076/2015 that was published in December 2015 on my Departments website.</p></reply>

These guidelines will be published after consultation with the education partners. </p><p>I believe that these actions will significantly strengthen the focus on reducing school costs for parents.</p></reply>

To qualify for a student grant, it is the candidate's nationality or his/her immigration status in the State that determines whether or not he/she meets the nationality requirement outlined in the Act and Regulations.

In 2004, surplus allocations in schools were used to provide for resource teaching allocations. Only where no surplus existed in schools was additional provision made. A figure for the number of resource teacher posts allocated to schools in 2004 is therefore not available. In 2008, approximately 4800 resource teacher posts were allocated to schools by the NCSE, while in 2012, 5265 posts were allocated. For the 2016/17 school year, 7452 resource teacher posts are available to the NCSE to allocate to schools, of which 7430 posts are currently allocated.</p>  <p>  We now have the highest level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support and Resource Teaching allocations which we have ever has and which will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the Act is to replace the system whereby a vehicle was declared off the road retrospectively with a system under which the vehicle must be declared off the road in advance.  The system of making retrospective declarations had become a means of evasion of motor tax estimated to have cost some &euro;50m annually.</p><p>The Act provides that a vehicle can be declared off the road for a minimum period of three months and a maximum period of twelve months.  Where the owner of a vehicle wishes to make a declaration of non-use, he or she must do so during the final month of an existing tax disc or a previously made declaration of non-use.  The declaration can be made on-line at <i>www.motortax.ie</i><i><font color="#0000FF"> </font></i>or through the local motor tax office.  The National Vehicle and Driver File, under the auspices of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, issues renewal notices at the beginning of the final month of tax or a previously made declaration of non-use to remind motorists that the vehicle must be taxed or declared off the road for a further period.  </p><p>Where a declaration of non-use is not made in the final month of a tax disc or previously made declaration of non-use, a vehicle must be taxed for the minimum period provided for in motor tax legislation for the category of vehicle concerned.  A new declaration can then be made at any stage during the final month of the new motor tax disc if the vehicle is thereafter not going to be in use in a public place.  </p><p>These arrangements were well publicised at the time of introduction of the legislation.  </p><p>The legislation does not provide for exemptions from the foregoing requirements.  This is to protect the revised arrangements; allowing an owner to declare a vehicle off the road after the expiry of a current declaration of non-use could potentially be a move back to the system of retrospective declarations, thereby undermining the overall objective of the legislative change. </p></reply>

In particular, engaging with banks and investment companies in respect of their vacant/available property portfolios, which normally span a number of local authority jurisdictions, benefits from a national approach.  In that context, the Housing Agency currently acts as a central co-ordination body at national level for banks/investors to interact with.  This activity began in early 2015 and to date has yielded 174 properties across 29 local authorities at a total value of over &euro;25m. </p>  <p>  In a further development of this activity, a new acquisitions initiative was provided for in Rebuilding Ireland (Action 5.6), under which the Housing Agency is to be provided directly with capital funding with the specific focus of engaging with banks and investment companies to acquire properties for social housing nationally, thereby increasing social housing delivery.  Under this acquisitions programme, the Agency will use a rotating fund of &euro;70m to acquire vacant properties from banks and private equity investment funds in areas with high levels of social housing demand.  In doing this, the Agency will work in close consultation with local authorities to ensure that suitable properties are only purchased in areas where there is a demand for social housing.  It is estimated that this mechanism, implementation of which is already underway, will deliver some 1,600 units over the period to 2020.  Details of the progress under this initiative will be outlined in future Rebuilding Ireland quarterly progress reports.  </p>  <p>  In respect of dealing with vacant dwellings generally, Action 5.1 of Rebuilding Ireland undertakes to develop a National Vacant Housing Re-Use Strategy by early 2017.  To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group to inform the Strategy, with senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself.  It has met twice so far.  A number of local authorities have commenced, or are planning to commence, pilot programmes to identify vacant homes and bring them back into use; these pilot programmes will inform the Strategy.  In addition, the Strategy will be informed by international best practice and experience, and research is being undertaken in this area.  </p></reply>

The NPPR Charge, which has since been discontinued, applied in the years 2009 to 2013 to any residential property in which the owner did not reside as their normal place of residence.  The self-assessed charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties.  It is a matter for an owner, whether resident in Ireland or elsewhere, to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge and any late payment fees applicable.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.</p>  <p>  Approximately 385,000 properties have been registered for the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge, which has raised in excess of &euro;544m to date over its five years of operation.  Proceeds from the charge are retained by local authorities and are used for the provision of local services.  It is not possible to state with certainty the level of non-compliance with the Charge.  In 2016, to date, approximately &euro;30m has been collected by local authorities in charges relating to the period 2009-2013. </p></reply>

Authorities were also advised to undertake local advertising campaigns informing households about the Summary.  Where a number of attempts to contact a household failed to elicit a response, authorities were advised that the household&rsquo;s application may be closed.  However, housing authorities were also advised that should the household subsequently respond with the information required within a reasonable time, the application could be re-activated. </p></reply>

The overall amounts incurred by housing authorities on housing and homelessness related expenditure are a matter for the individual housing authorities.  The funding needs of the various regions are kept under review on an on-going basis.</p><p>Under Section 10 funding arrangements, funding in respect of homeless services is made available on a regional basis and a regional allocation is delegated to a lead-authority in each region.  Given the statutory position, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on housing and homelessness are a matter for those authorities and the amount of funding provided by my Department as a percentage of the local authorities&rsquo; own housing budgets is not available in my Department.  However, for information purposes, details of Exchequer funding drawn down to date in 2016 are set out in the following table on a regional basis.<table><tr><th colspan="2">Funding under Section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 </th></tr><tr><td>Region </td><td>2016 to date - &euro; </td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>44,662,925 </td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East </td><td>1,620,628 </td></tr><tr><td>Midland </td><td>801,028 </td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West </td><td>3,150,000 </td></tr><tr><td>North-East </td><td>925,639 </td></tr><tr><td>North-West </td><td>305,696 </td></tr><tr><td>South-East </td><td>2,423,997 </td></tr><tr><td>South-West </td><td>4,450,084 </td></tr><tr><td>West </td><td>1,800,000 </td></tr></table></p></reply>

As such, 22 rapid build units have already been delivered and are occupied.  Dublin City Council is currently advancing a number of rapid build projects, including on four sites at Finglas, Darndale, Cherry Orchard and Drimnagh, which will deliver a further 131 units.  These units will be handed over to Dublin City Council on a phased basis from the end of the year and delivery will be completed early in 2017.  My Department is working closely with the Council to expedite delivery.  The assignment of households to these units, once delivered, will be a matter for the City Council.</p>  <p>  Further work is underway across the four local authorities, which will bring to 350 the total number of rapid delivery homes advancing through various stages of delivery, including construction, by the end of the year, on additional sites in Dublin city and on sites in Dun Laoghaire, Tallaght, Blanchardstown and Balbriggan.  Construction dates will be finalised in the context of completion of procurement and award of contracts.</p>  <p>  Rapid delivery needs to be viewed in the context of the wider range of solutions to address the unacceptable level of families in emergency accommodation, including 1, 600 vacant units to be sourced by the Housing Agency and an expanded Housing Assistance Payment ( HAP ) Homeless pilot scheme &ndash; 550 tenancies in 2016 and 1,200 in 2017 - across the greater Dublin region.  More than 1,350 exits from homelessness were achieved nationally in the first half of this year and, in Dublin , a further 411 exits have been achieved in the third quarter.  This compares to 2,322 sustainable exits from homelessness in 2015.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced with local authorities from outside of Dublin in terms of advancing rapid build projects in their areas.  Following the putting in place of the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) Framework, a workshop will take place in January 2017 to support all local authorities advance rapid build projects.</p></reply>

Of the 3,498 cases submitted, 2,642 were ineligible or terminated during the process for a variety of reasons.  Of the remaining cases submitted, 669 are being actively progressed and 187 have been completed.

The review, currently underway, is examining what further amendments can be made to the scheme to make it work better for borrowers and my Department is consulting with key stakeholders in this regard.  The review will also explore alternative models for the purchase of units, including long-term leasing arrangements. The review is to be completed by the end of the year.</p></reply>

Consultation involving EUROSTAT and the Central Statistics Office to address considerations affecting the potential balance-sheet treatment of the vehicle is ongoing.  If significant challenges in respect of both the commercial and the &lsquo;on-/off-balance sheet&rsquo; treatment of such a vehicle can be addressed satisfactorily, the objective is to establish a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) in 2017 to acquire properties for onward leasing to local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies under long-term leasing arrangements that are already well established in the market.  It is envisaged that the SPV, if commercial and off-balance sheet treatment are established, has the potential to provide in the order of 5,00 0 units over a five-year period for social housing purposes.

The broader National Land Supply Management Strategy is being developed with in the context of the National Planning Framework which is due to be finalised by mid- 2017.</p><p>In this regard, my Department has commenced work on assembling data on the location and availability of local authority or other publicly owned lands for the purpose of the provision of new housing, including additional student accommodation.  This work is being conducted with the support of the Housing Agency; relevant Government Departments and Agencies; local authorities and the Office of Public Works in the context of its work in relation to the State Property Register. </p><p>To date, data on over 700 individual local authority and Land Aggregation Scheme sites has been gathered and collated.  The identification of other publicly owned lands will focus initially on the main urban areas (i.e. Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford ).  Once the broader data set is available, during the first Quarter of 2017, I anticipate that this will provide an enhanced basis for identification of lands for the provision of increased housing, including for student accommodation, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and other stakeholders.</p><p>During this data gathering phase, a number of early actions have already been undertaken by local authorities and the Housing Agency to progress housing development on sites in public ownership, particularly in areas of high housing demand.  One such proposal was announced by South Dublin County Council at the recent launch event for Pillar 3 of Rebuilding Ireland in relation to a site that could yield almost 1, 000 new homes in Kilcarberry, Clondalkin.  I expect further proposals to be brought forward by other local authorities in the coming months.</p><p><i></i>Rebuilding Ireland contains a clear commitment to reporting regular progress, through both a monthly housing activity report and a quarterly overall progress report.  The First Quarterly Progress Report on the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland (in respect of Quarter 3 2016 commitments and actions) was published on 1 November 2016, and can be accessed through the following link: .</p><p>Further progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis, with the next due to be published in January 2017.  Each Quarterly Report will focus on the actions due to be progressed or completed in the preceding quarter.</p></reply>

It is anticipated that further funding will be made available in 2017. </p>  <p>  Access to funding is on the basis of formal applications made to my Department.  Details of the fund were circulated in April 2016 and a further reminder issued in July 2016 calling for applications to be submitted for consideration.  The closing date for receipt of applications was 1 November 2016.

In this context, regulation is important in order to underpin stability in the sector, to better protect tenants and to safeguard public and private investment in AHBs and the assets developed through that investment.  </p><p>In 2014, my Department established an interim Regulation Committee (iRC) under the auspices of the Housing Agency and supported by a Regulation Office within the Agency.  The committee was set up to oversee implementation of the voluntary regulation code for AHBs, published in July 2013, and to advise on statutory regulation.  To date, 243 AHBs have signed up to the voluntary code. </p><p>Recently, the Regulation Office published their second Annual Report.  The annual report provides an overview of those AHBs signed up to the Code, insight as to the size, scale, ambitions and risk appetite of the sector; establishes and shares good practice; and identifies some of the challenges for AHBs arising from the regulatory assessments.  A copy of the report can be found at the following link:. </p><p>Encouragingly, the number of AHBs that have now signed up to the Voluntary Code (243) represents 90% of all housing stock held by AHBs which means that some 26,900 AHB homes are now protected.  Under the code, AHBs that have signed up to regulation are assessed in terms of their governance, financial viability and their performance in the provision of social housing. </p><p>While the code is voluntary at present, the development of a statutory regulatory framework has commenced with the General Scheme of the Housing (Regulation of Approved Housing Bodies) Bill 2015 approved for drafting by Government in September 2015. Pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed Bill took place in December 2015.  My Department is currently examining the recommendations of the Joint Committee as well as the stakeholder submissions on the General Scheme to ensure that the drafted legislation is reasonable, proportionate and appropriate to the differing needs of AHBs and serves to underpin a regulatory system that facilitates a growth of capacity and efficiency in the sector.  It is expected that the legislation will be published in the first quarter of 2017. </p></reply>

The new range of products provides extremely competitive fixed interest rates ranging from 5 to 30 years.  Local authorities will be able to borrow fixed rate funding for 25 years at 1.5% or lower.

The Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Bill 2016 provides for the legislative underpinning of a number of key priority commitments in the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness &ndash; Rebuilding Ireland, published in July 2016.  </p>  <p>  Action 3.10 of the Action Plan   incorporates a commitment to commence a "root and branch" review of the planning system, particularly around forecasting, planning and delivering residential development and taking account of the work underway in relation to the development of the National Planning Framework.  It is intended to commence the implementation of this action in the first quarter of 2017, in line with the timeline indicated in the Action Plan.   </p></reply>

The Regulations specify requirements in relation to a range of matters, such as structural repair, sanitary facilities, heating, ventilation, natural light and safety of gas and electrical supply.  With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units as well as private rented residential accommodation. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. </p><p>To ensure that the standards reflect the requirements of a modern rental market, a review of the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended, has been initiated.  The review is at an advanced stage with new regulations currently being finalised for conclusion before the end of the year.</p><p>Additionally, as indicated in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, a number of measures in relation to improving the enforcement of standards will be considered in developing the strategy for the rental sector, including a move towards delivery of enforcement services on a regional basis.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland contains a clear commitment to reporting regular progress, through both a monthly housing activity report and a quarterly overall progress report.

To this end, the Housing Agency, which has lead responsibility for co-ordinating the development of the Strategy, has established a working group to inform the Strategy, with senior representatives from my Department, local authorities and from the Housing Agency itself. The working group has met twice to date with a further meeting scheduled for later this month.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Housing Agency are liaising with local authorities and with the Central Statistics Office in order to obtain a better understanding of the numbers, characteristics and reasons why homes are vacant. A number of local authorities have commenced, or are planning to commence, pilot programmes to identify vacant homes and bring them back into use; these pilot programmes will help to inform the Strategy. Furthermore, the Strategy will be informed by international best practice and experience, and research is currently being undertaken in this area.</p>  <p>  While the development of the Strategy is being progressed, I have already announced a number of new initiatives aimed at addressing vacancy and facilitating the reuse of vacant houses.  A new Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has recently been launched by my Department to assist private property owners and local authorities, or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs), to bring vacant houses into social housing use as new homes for families on local authority waiting lists. The new Scheme will operate initially in Waterford and Carlow and my Department will work closely with other local authorities to roll it out around the country over the course of the next six months.</p>  <p>  I have secured &euro;140m for the successful implementation of this scheme over the next five years. This scheme has significant potential and I am hopeful that it can bring at least 3,500 vacant houses back into productive use between now and 2021. </p>  <p>  In addition, under a new &ldquo;Buy and Renew&rdquo; initiative, my Department will support local authorities and AHBs to purchase private housing units in need of remediation, which will be refurbished and made available for social housing use.  An initial capital provision of &euro;25 million is being made available for this initiative in 2017.</p></reply>

In June 2016 there was an initial allocation of almost &euro;24m for works on 1,300 vacant units.  In September, an additional &euro;13.3m was allocated for 755 units.

The Repair and Leasing Scheme (RLS) has been developed to assist private property owners and local authorities or Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to harness this potential, and bring these vacant houses into social housing use to provide homes for families on local authority waiting lists.</p><p>The new scheme was launched in Waterford and Carlow in early October 2016 on a pilot basis, and depending on the take-up from private property owners, will be rolled out to further local authorities. The purpose of the pilot is to ensure that the scheme is workable from local authorities&rsquo; and AHBs&rsquo; perspectives.  It is anticipated that other local authorities will come into the scheme on a rolling basis, with full roll-out expected within 6 months. <font color="#1F497D"> </font>Given that the launch was very recent no statistics on the RLS are available as yet.</p><p>AHBs have a proven record in managing the refurbishment of properties and being good landlords puts them in an excellent position to play a key role in the success of the scheme.  Several AHBs will be working together with the Waterford and Carlow local authorities to manage the scheme in those particular areas.  As the scheme is rolled out in other local authority areas, more AHBs around the country will become involved with other local authorities.</p><p>The scheme is targeted at owners of vacant properties who cannot afford or access the funding required to bring them up to the standard for rental property.  Subject to the suitability of the property for social housing, and the agreement of the property owner, the cost of the necessary repairs will be met upfront by the local authority or the AHB.  This allows for the property owner to sign-up to a lease arrangement for a length that is linked to the value of the repairs, subject to a minimum of 10 years.  The value of the repairs will then be offset incrementally against the agreed rental payment over a defined period within the lease.</p><p>Over the period 2016 to 2021 it is anticipated that up to 3,500 units will be secured for social housing under this scheme.  &euro;6m has been budgeted for 2017, with a target of 150 units.  The availability of a national scheme from mid-2017 will see an increase in activity and budget from 2018 onwards.</p></reply>

The inaugural meeting of the Working Group took place on 15 June last, and has met twice since with a further meeting scheduled for later this month.   </p>  <p>  As part of its deliberations and in line with the commitment in Action 5.9 of the Action Plan, the Working Group is presently reviewing planning legislation to allow the change of use of vacant commercial premises in urban areas, including vacant or under-utilised areas over ground floor premises, into residential units without having to go through the planning process. </p></reply>

The local authority MPI scheme has applied to all house purchase loans approved by local authorities after 1 July 1986.  One of the conditions of the scheme, which is a group policy, is that it is obligatory for all local authority borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria to join the scheme.  Altering this condition would have a negative impact on the scheme and increase the cost for all existing borrowers.  A local authority housing loan applicant who is not eligible for the local authority MPI scheme must source a suitable comparable individual MPI policy from the market.</p><p>There are a number of differences between the local authority MPI scheme and standard MPI products available on the market. Standard MPI products are individually priced based on a member&rsquo;s age, amongst other factors, whereas the local authority MPI scheme is a group arrangement offering a single group rate per &euro;1,000 sum assured to all participants in the scheme.</p><p>Aside from the difference between an individual and a group rate, the following factors are the main influences on the price of the local authority MPI scheme:</p><p>i.  standard mortality and morbidity factors based on population statistics;</p><p>ii.  the local authority borrowers&rsquo; risk profile;</p><p>iii.  the terms and conditions of the local authority MPI scheme and, in particular, the fact that all eligible local authority housing loan borrowers are accepted without medical evidence; and</p><p>iv.  the claims experience of the local authority MPI scheme.</p><p>The Local Authority MPI scheme also provides extra benefits, such as;</p><p>-  mortgage repayments are paid if there is a valid claim as a result of disability;</p><p>-  separate to life cover, an additional &euro;3,000 is payable in the event of a member&rsquo;s death; and</p><p>-  members are covered for death up to age 75 whereas standard MPI cover usually ceases at the age of 65.</p><p>The Mortgage Protection Committee which oversees the scheme endeavours to achieve a balance between the most economic rate to be charged for the scheme and the benefits provided.  As part of the current re-tendering process, the Committee will seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017, the most appropriate Mortgage Protection Insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance scheme of approximately &euro;2.45 billion.</p>  <p>  It is open to any individual to make a claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at any time.  However, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments compensate for periods of involuntary unemployment only.  For this reason social welfare legislation provides that a person must satisfy certain conditions in order to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  The qualifying conditions for receipt of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance require a person to be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking full-time employment.  Where a teacher is on a short term contact, in full-time employment they would not satisfy the conditionality of being unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work and therefore would not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance when they are in remunerative employment. </p>  <p>  Where these individuals are unable to work as their schools are closed due to industrial action, it is a matter for the Department of Education and Skills in the first instance to determine whether these individuals will continue to be paid.  If they are not participating in the industrial action and do not receive payment, they may be eligible for a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment provided they satisfy the eligibility criteria.  However, each case would be decided on a case by case basis and dependent on its individual merits.  It should be noted that if an individual is awarded a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment they will not be paid for their first three days of their jobseeker&rsquo;s claim.</p></reply>

This provides them with access to long-term benefits including State pension (contributory), Widow&rsquo;s, Widower&rsquo;s or Surviving Civil Partner&rsquo;s Pension (contributory), Guardian&rsquo;s Payment (contributory) as well as Maternity Benefit and Adoptive Benefit.  Since September 2016, self-employed workers can also access the newly introduced Paternity Benefit.</p>  <p>  Self-employed workers who have to temporarily stop working because of illness can apply for the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This is a means tested payment for people whose means are insufficient to meet their needs including the needs of a spouse/partner or qualified children.</p>  <p>  In line with the commitment contained in the Programme for Government for an improved PRSI scheme for the self-employed, as part of Budget 2017 I announced the extension of cover for Invalidity Pension to the self-employed on the same basis as employees, with effect from December 2017.  Invalidity Pension is a pension payment for people who cannot work because of a long-term illness or disability.  Gaining access to Invalidity Pension will provide the self-employed with a much stronger safety net to protect them in the event of significant injury or disablement.</p>  <p>  In addition, the self-employed will have access to the Treatment Benefit Scheme which provides partial dental, optical and aural services to qualified people, from March 2017.  Treatment Benefit entitlements will be extended further from October 2017 for both the self-employed and employees, providing additional dental and optical benefits.</p>  <p>  I hope this provides some clarity on the issue for the Deputy, if you require any further information contact Philip in my office.</p></reply>

As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, and who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under this scheme.  Under the scheme, entitlement is calculated by means of a &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; calculation, where the total contributions paid or credited are divided by the number of years of the working life.  Payment rates are banded.  For example, someone with a yearly average of 48 contributions will qualify for a full pension, whereas someone with a yearly average of 20 will qualify for a pension at 85% of the full rate.  Where someone does not qualify for a full rate contributory pension, they may qualify for an alternative payment.  If their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), which amounts to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.</p>  <p>  The National Pensions Framework (2010) proposed that a &ldquo;Total Contribution Approach&rdquo; (TCA) should replace the yearly average approach, for new pensioners from 2020.  The aim of this approach is to make the rate of contributory pension more closely match contributions made by a person.  Officials of my Department are currently working on the detailed development of the TCA with a view to making proposals for consideration in the first half of the New Year.  It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is a very significant reform with considerable legal, administrative, and technical elements in its implementation.  An important element in the final design of the scheme will be the position of people who have gaps in their contribution records for various reasons, and this factor is being considered very carefully in developing this reform.</p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that a pensioner can already claim a State pension contributory and continue in employment.  In developing the TCA my officials are also examining flexibility options in both contributing to and drawing down State pension contributory.  These include deferment of pension and/or payment of further reckonable PRSI contributions after State pension age.  Decisions on whether and how to include these options will depend on a balance between costs, benefits for pensioners, demand for the options and practicality of administration. </p>  <p>  It is important that the changes are announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

A range of sanctions, including disqualification, closure or disallowance of the jobseeker claim, may be imposed where a client fails to meet the stated conditions.  A jobseeker claim may be reviewed at any time in order to establish continued entitlement. </p>  <p>  Additionally, in relation to activation, legislation provides that further sanctions/penalties in the form of reduced payments may be imposed by a Deciding Officer where clients fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures.  Activation measures include the requirement to attend group or individual meetings with case officers and/or avail of suitable education, training or development opportunities, or specified employment programmes, which are considered appropriate to a person&rsquo;s circumstances. </p>  <p>  Where a person continues to fail, without good cause, to comply with activation measures, while on a penalty rate, he/she may be disqualified from receiving the personal rate of payment.  The normal rate of payment may be reinstated at any time, if the jobseeker complies, as requested, with activation measures. </p>  <p>  All decisions regarding the application of penalty rates are taken by officials of the Department. Some 1,500 people who were referred to the JobPath service since its inception have had a penalty rate applied to them.  Of these there are at present c500 people on a reduced penalty rate of payment.

Each person is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person&rsquo;s skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants are provided with a range of training and development supports directly and via online modules.  These include such things as confidence building, career advice, CV preparation and interview skills.  Participants may also be referred to external training providers including Education and Training Boards. </p>  <p>  Participants receive the JobPath service for a period of 12 months (which can be extended by up to six months to facilitate the jobseeker completing training programmes) or until such time as they find employment whichever is the sooner. If the jobseeker secures employment during this period they can continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. </p></reply>

Nevertheless, the Department recognises that abuse of the welfare system is an ongoing reality and must be  tackled through a range of measures.These measures are governed by the Department&rsquo;s Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018.  The actions set out in the strategy are designed to prevent and detect fraud, to ensure effective oversight of schemes, to pursue prosecution of offenders and to ensure the recovery of any overpaid entitlements identified. </p><p>All Departmental staff exercise a control and compliance function in processing new applications and reviewing existing entitlements.  The systems used to support schemes are designed to detect wrongful claiming and to highlight anomalies.  In addition, the Department&rsquo;s inspectorate undertakes detailed examination of claims on a risk assessed and random basis.  In addition, at least three fraud and error surveys of Departmental schemes are conducted annually to assess the quality of claim processing and fraud detection.  These surveys are published and subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and their findings are used to tighten control measures around schemes, where this is found to be warranted.</p><p>My Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit comprises trained inspector and Garda officers and is tasked with undertaking targeted and systematic examination of claims to tackle fraud and to work with other enforcement agencies to identify more serious breaches of the law.</p><p>Cross-functional and targeted actions are undertaken - both internally and in joint operations with other national and international agencies - to ensure a strategic response to high risk sectors or where fraud is prevalent.  In particular, actions are focused on sectors of the economy where there is a risk of concurrent working and claiming social welfare payments.</p><p>Overall, the Department conducts of the order of one million reviews annually comprising customer entitlement reviews, inspections and special investigations.</p><p>The Deputy should also note that the continued roll-out of the Public Services Card has considerably reduced the potential for identity fraud and the Department has deployed identity and analytics software and other intelligence systems to reinforce its fraud prevention work.</p><p>Members of the public play an important role in supporting these anti-fraud activities and some 17,000 reports from concerned citizens have been processed already in 2016.</p><p>The Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018 and annual updates on progress are published on the Department&rsquo;s website: <i>www.welfare.ie.</i></p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

I issued a statement on 4 November, in which I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s concern at the arrests and also at the intensification of the media crackdown, and I emphasised the need to uphold the fundamental principles of democracy, human rights and rule of law.

The EU statement recalls that it is crucial that parliamentary immunity is applied to all democratically elected representatives on a non-discriminatory basis.</p><p>Furthermore, developments in Turkey were discussed in the meeting of Ministers&rsquo; Deputies at the Council of Europe on 9 November, at which Turkey was represented. Ireland&rsquo;s representative expressed our concern at the current situation in Turkey , and recalled that rule of law, human rights, democracy and freedom of expression are core Council of Europe values.

The project has been separated into a number of sub-projects which ensures that the necessary resources are in place to complete each individual task.</p><p>  The project has been technically very complex and hampered by the extremely fragile nature of the structure. Over a number of seasons, poor weather has affected progress resulting in high water levels in the river (making conditions for workers hazardous). By June 2015, works had progressed to a stage where specialist expertise was required, focussing on a more long-term geo-technical design solution which recognises the vulnerability of the structure into the future.

There has been a particular need for such revision in Ireland because our unique legislative past has left us with a complex stock of legislation, with enactments from the Parliaments of Ireland, England, Great Britain and the United Kingdom as well as our own Oireachtas.</p>  <p>  To date, the Oireachtas has passed five Statute Law Revision Acts as follows:</p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005, which repealed a selection of pre-1922 statutes;</p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2007, which was a comprehensive revision of pre-1922 Public General Acts;</p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2009, which revised all Private Acts up to and including 1750 and all Local and Personal Acts up to and including 1850;</p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2012, which revised all Private Acts from 1750 to 1922 and all Local and Personal Acts from 1850 to 1922; and</p>  <p>  - The Statute Law Revision Act 2015, which revoked Secondary Instruments made before 1 January 1821.</p>  <p>  A sixth Statute Law Revision Bill, covering primary legislation enacted between 1922 and 1950, is currently progressing through the Houses.</p>  <p>  The progress we have made with the Statute Law Revision Programme has been considerable.  To date, over 60,000 pieces of legislation have been either expressly or implicitly repealed under the programme.  Collectively this is the most extensive set of repealing measures in the history of the State and the most extensive set of statute law revision measures ever enacted anywhere in the world.  I propose, however, in view of the progress made, to pause the Statute Law Revision Programme at this time in order that my Department can progress other priorities.</p>  <p>  Common law will continue to constitute the basis of the legal system of Ireland and neither the Statute Law Revision Programme nor Brexit have any bearing on this. Ireland has functioned successfully as a common law country within the EU since it joined in 1973 and I see no reason why this should not continue.</p></reply>

This was signalled in the Mid-Year Expenditure Report 2016.  Separately, a further &euro;110 million is provided for current expenditure.  This amount reflects the estimated cost of &euro;220 million relating to a Christmas Bonus for long-term Social Welfare recipients, net of anticipated offsetting year-end savings across a number of Departments.  As outlined on pages 28 and 31 in the <i>Expenditure Report 2017</i>, the extent of any required supplementary estimate to make provision for the Christmas bonus and capital expenditure will be determined later in the year in accordance with normal procedures and practice.  As the Deputy will be aware, Supplementary Estimates are an important feature of the management of a cash based accounting system, amounting to some &euro;56 billion in 2016.  In this context, Supplementary Estimates play an important role in achieving a proper alignment of funding allocations with planned expenditure that is subject to approval by the D&aacute;il.</p><p>The additional amounts in 2016 are projected to be aligned with the requirements of the Preventive Arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  Compliance for 2016 will be formally assessed when the Stability Programme Update is submitted to the European Commission in April 2017.</p></reply>

Local Authorities, in conjunction with local communities and businesses, were invited to submit up to 8 proposals to my Department<b></b>by the end of September for approval.</p><p>Following an assessment of the proposals received, on 4th November I announced the details of 172 towns and villages which will benefit from the funding available under this year&rsquo;s Town and Village Renewal Scheme for a range of demonstration projects.  The full list of towns benefiting under the scheme is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>I have secured increased funding of &euro;12 million for an enhanced Town and Village Renewal scheme as part of Budget 2017.  This represents a trebling of the original 2016 baseline allocation of &euro;4 million.  As part of an enhanced scheme in 2017, I intend to include a pilot initiative to encourage increased residential occupancy in town and village centres in line with commitment 5.12 in the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  My Department will work closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in finalising the details of this initiative.</p></reply>

Targeted tree planning has been carried out at the site - originally a plantation which had become neglected over the past 25 years - as part of a ten year management plan for the woodland to encourage natural regeneration.  The activities undertaken were carried out under license from the Forest Service and the works have been assessed and approved by my Department.  The felling included a thinning out process to encourage continuous woodland cover and natural regeneration.  Large numbers of invasive species such as Rhododendron, Sycamore and Laurel had become well established within the woodland.  These species were rampant in the areas selected for thinning.</p>  <p>  As part of the conditions agreed to secure the thinning license for the woods, the entity involved agreed to carry out the removal of all invasive species from the selected area.  In addition, standing dead wood and veteran trees were selected for retention for conservation purposes.</p>  <p>  From the selected thinning, some Oak were removed, as were all Sycamore, most Beech, some Ash, all Rhododendron and all Laurel, as well as Willow from dry areas only, with wet Willow being left in situ.  Most Oak trees selected were between 60-80 years old, with the occasional older tree.  Contrary to some reports, I am advised that there were no 400 year old Oak trees on the site.</p>  <p>  Trees were removed to allow natural regeneration of the Oak woodland, to promote continuous woodland cover and to help in the conservation of this important site.  The removal of the alien species and the thinning of the woodland assist in this management by allowing the light to reach the forest floor, encouraging the natural regrowth of the woodland.  This had not happened over the last 25 years, so no natural regeneration had occurred.</p>  <p>  Expert personnel from my Department have met the personnel involved to walk the site and assess the works carried out to date.  My Department remains satisfied that the work was carried out in accordance to the conditions set out in the thinning/felling license.  A further assessment was made recently to ensure that completion of the licensed works would be beneficial to the long-term recovery of the woodland.</p></reply>

Additional funding of &euro;1.715m has been allocated from the &euro;2m available to the HSE in 2016 to address mental health needs of homeless persons in the Dublin region.  This funding is being used to provide care and case management to homeless persons in a number of supported accommodation settings in Dublin City Centre.  In-reach GP, nursing and mental health nursing services provided to these settings have also been enhanced as a result of the additional funding.</p>  <p>  I am committed to ensuring that improvements in mental health and primary care services for homeless persons achieved during 2016 are sustained over the course of the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness.  The priority for 2017 will be to ensure that the health-related needs associated with the provision of homeless accommodation and tenancies are addressed, with a view to ensuring that vulnerable homeless people have access to primary care and mental health services, where required.  To this end, the HSE has been asked to provide the appropriate level of resources in the 2017 Service Plan to deliver on Action 1.15 of the Government's Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, my Department is developing a new National Drugs Strategy which will cover the period from 2017 onwards.  The rehabilitation needs of homeless people with addiction issues, many of whom have comorbid mental health problems, will be addressed through the development of the new National Drugs Strategy. </p></reply>

Current clinical activity in the three Dublin children's hospitals, population growth, innovation and developments in treatments, waiting lists and unmet need have all been factored into the calculations for the inpatient bed numbers planned for the new children's hospital.  All clinical specialties were considered in this health planning work.</p>  <p>  With a very few exceptions, beds are not allocated or ring-fenced for particular conditions or services.  The reason for this is to maximise the efficient use of beds depending on need.  The number of children with inflammatory bowel disease requiring an inpatient bed at any one time is not constant and while one month a small number of beds might be required, in another month a greater number of beds might be required.</p>  <p>  In contrast to the current situation, in planning the new children's hospital, the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group (CHG) has allocated beds to acute care, that is, beds for children admitted with an acute illness, the majority of whom are likely to require only a short in-patient stay.  As a result of separating this cohort of children from those with chronic conditions who might require either planned or emergency admission, the CHG can allocate a group of beds for children with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease which will be available to them when the bed is required but will be available to others also.</p>  <p>  From an outpatient service viewpoint, the accommodation in which the gastroenterology outpatient department is situated includes clinical examination rooms, allocated rooms for the specialist nurses, rooms for the multi-disciplinary team, support rooms for children with gastrostomy feeding and rooms for outpatient investigations.</p>  <p>  Within the theatre department, there are two endoscopy rooms which provide very significant extra capacity in terms of gastrointestinal endoscopy.</p>  <p>  This allocation of resources has been developed with the GI team in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin. </p></reply>

Implementation of the Framework over the period to 2025 will take account of emerging evidence, research, international best practice and national policy developments.</p><p>I am happy to update the Deputy on current implementation of Healthy Ireland.  Key current priorities include:</p><p><b><i>Implementation of the National Physical Activity Plan </i></b></p><p>Get Ireland Active &ndash; the National Physical Activity Plan for Ireland which was developed in partnership with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a range of key stakeholders including the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, was launched in January 2016.</p><p>Implementation during 2016 is concentrating on development of a communications campaign (led by the Department of Health) and supporting physical education in schools (Department of Education and Skills and PDST) amongst other initiatives.</p><p><b><i>National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020</i></b></p><p>The <i>National Sexual Health Strategy 2015-2020</i>was launched in October 2015.  It takes a takes a life course approach, acknowledging the importance of developing a healthy attitude to sexuality in young people and of building on that foundation for positive sexual health and wellbeing into adulthood and older age.  The Strategy is being delivered in partnership between the Department of Health, the HSE and the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p>A Clinical Lead for Sexual Health Services has been appointed and a strategy implementation group has been established to deliver the actions and goals of the strategy.  A 2017-2020 action plan is currently being developed.</p><p><b><i>Healthy Ireland Survey</i></b></p><p>The annual Healthy Ireland Survey was commissioned to enhance data collection and monitoring capacity to track progress in achieving targets to evaluate the success of Healthy Ireland.  The first Healthy Ireland Survey Report was published in October 2015, with the report on the second wave published in October 2016.  Survey results give an up-to-date picture of the heath of the population.</p><p>Data collection for Wave 3 of the study is now underway.</p><p><b><i>Alignment of Education and Health Services</i></b></p><p>The Health and Wellbeing Programme and the Department of Education and Skills, in partnership with the HSE and PDST (Professional Development Service for Teachers), are working to strengthening collaboration, streamline and simplify current structures for the promotion of health and wellbeing in schools and to develop a more comprehensive service alignment to support the delivery of SPHE (Social, Personal and Health Education) and to extend the Health Promoting Schools initiative more widely in schools.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills has announced the introduction of Wellbeing as a compulsory area of learning (encompassing the subjects SPHE, PE and CSPE) from September 2017 in the new Junior Cycle Framework.  A particular focus for the Department of Health and the HSE is to ensure that the health service is fully supporting health and wellbeing in school settings around the country.</p><p><b><i>Healthy Workplaces Framework </i></b></p><p>My Department, with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is leading a subgroup to develop a National Healthy Workplace Framework.  This work primarily involves development of a framework to encourage and support the development of Health and Wellbeing programmes in all places of employment.  The objective is to support employers to develop individual, practical plans identifying how they will protect and promote the physical, mental and social wellbeing of their employees, within the context of their own size, sector, location, number of employees, etc.</p><p>In addition, the workplace wellbeing element of the Health and Wellbeing (Calorie posting and workplace wellbeing) Bill which is in development will require all public sector workplaces to have and report on a healthy workplace policy.</p><p><b><i>'Warmth and Wellbeing' Pilot Project </i></b></p><p>The Warmth and Wellbeing initiative is a new pilot scheme commencing in 2016, available in Dublin 12 and 24.  It aims to establish if the provision of extensive energy efficiency upgrades to homes can have a positive effect on the health and wellbeing of the people living in the homes.</p><p>The Health and Wellbeing Programme is supporting this project which is being led by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and is a key action in the recently published Strategy to Combat Energy Poverty.

This new legislation will effectively mean that all children in respect of whom a DCA payment is made will automatically qualify for a medical card and, therefore, no longer be subject to the medical cards means test at any point in the future while in receipt of DCA.  It is my objective to have this legislation prepared and brought before the Oireachtas as quickly as possible.  In addition to the preparation of the legislation, I have asked the HSE, so that the proposal can be implemented in a smooth and efficient manner, to commence the process of planning for the requirements of the scheme and how the cards will issue<b>.</b></p><p>It is estimated that approximately 9,000 children in respect of whom a DCA payment is currently being made are not in receipt of a medical card.  The full year cost of providing these children, and the additional children expected to qualify for a DCA payment by end 2017, with a medical card is approximately &euro;16m.  The cost which will be incurred on a monthly basis will ultimately depend on the number of children encompassed by the measure whose parents or guardians apply for a medical card, as well as the profile of service usage they incur.  The 2017 Budget allocation for the measure is &euro;10m and it is my intention that medical cards for these children will be provided as early as is possible, commensurate with the funding which has been allocated by the Oireachtas.</p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out-of-hours cooperatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services helping to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting.  Where GPs decide not to become members of out-of-hours co-ops they must still discharge their contractual obligation in terms of out-of-hours provision in accordance with their GP contract.</p>  <p>  In the Mid West region, the out-of-hours arrangements for participating GPs are discharged through Shannondoc, a not-for-profit GP cooperative, which is funded by the HSE.  Shannondoc has recently indicated that due to a difficulty in attracting GPs, and in particular locum cover, it is no longer able to maintain its existing service across all its centres.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Shannondoc, the HSE, in order to ensure the sustainability of the service, accepted a proposal from the cooperative to changes in the provision of the service.  The most significant changes relate to parts of East and West Clare, essentially affecting Ennistymon, Kilrush, and Killaloe with minor changes in terms of operating hours in two locations in North Tipperary.   </p>  <p>  The recent changes to the Shannondoc out-of-hours services will be subject to a three-monthly review and their impact will be closely monitored and evaluated by the HSE.</p>  <p>  In relation to the Deputy's query on the emergency department at Ennis General Hospital, as this is a service matter it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

While there is no obligation on GPs to participate in GP out-of-hours cooperatives as a means of meeting the contractual requirement, such services have been developed and expanded over time and are now an essential part of our primary care services helping to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, urgent care needs are met in the primary care setting. Where GPs decide not to become members of out-of-hours co-ops they must still discharge their contractual obligation in terms of out-of-hours provision in accordance with their GP contract.</p>  <p>  In the Mid West region, the out-of-hours arrangements for participating GPs are discharged through Shannondoc, a not-for-profit GP cooperative, which is funded by the HSE. Shannondoc has recently indicated that due to a difficulty in attracting GPs, and in particular locum cover, it is no longer able to maintain its existing service across all its centres.</p>  <p>  Following discussions with Shannondoc, the HSE, in order to ensure the sustainability of the service, accepted a proposal from the cooperative to changes in the provision of the service.  The most significant changes relate to parts of East and West Clare, essentially affecting Ennistymon, Kilrush, and Killaloe with minor changes in terms of operating hours in two locations in North Tipperary,   </p>  <p>  The recent changes to the Shannondoc out-of-hours services will be subject to a three-monthly review and their impact will be closely monitored and evaluated by the HSE.</p></reply>

The Act obliges the HSE to assess whether a person is unable, without due hardship, to arrange general practitioner services for himself or herself and his or her family, having regard to his or her overall financial position and reasonable expenditure and every application must be assessed on that basis.  Under the legislation, having a particular illness, in itself, does not establish eligibility for a medical card and therefore, the medical conditions of applicants for this scheme are not monitored on that basis.  Where the applicant's income is within the income guidelines, a medical card or GP visit card will be awarded.</p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.  </p>  <p>  In certain circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card, even though an applicant exceeds his or her income threshold, where he or she faces difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.  Social and medical issues are considered when determining whether undue hardship exists for an individual accessing general practitioner or other medical services.  The HSE affords applicants the opportunity to furnish supporting information and documentation to fully take account of all the relevant circumstances that may benefit them in the assessment, including medical evidence of cost and necessary expenses.</p>  <p>  The HSE has a system in place for the provision of medical cards in response to an emergency situation for persons with a serious medical condition in need of urgent or on-going medical care that they cannot afford and persons in palliative care, who are terminally ill.  With the exception of terminally ill patients, all medical cards, granted on an emergency basis, are issued on the basis that the patient is eligible for a medical card on the basis of means or undue hardship, and will follow up with a full application within a number of weeks of receiving the medical card eligibility.  These cards are issued within 24 hours of receipt of the required patient details and a letter which confirms the medical condition from a doctor or consultant.  </p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost. The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings. A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  </p>  <p>  A person's Principal Private Residence (PPR) is only included in the financial assessment for the first three years of the NHSS participants' time in care.  A farm or relevant business can also qualify for the three year cap where unexpected health events prevent early succession arrangements.  This applies where:</p>  <p>  a)  The applicant has suffered a sudden illness or disability which caused them to require care services and</p>  <p>  b) A substantial part of the working day of the applicant or their partner was regularly and consistently applied to the farming of the farm or carrying on of the relevant business until the onset of the sudden illness or disability, and </p>  <p>  c)  A family successor certifies in writing that he or she will on a consistent and regular basis apply a substantial part of his or her working day to the farming of the farm or the carrying on of the relevant business.</p>  <p>  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small business and family farms. </p>  <p>  Furthermore, when the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years. The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme. This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the Review.  Changes arising from this Review may require legislative implementation.</p></reply>

Drug and Alcohol Task Forces play a key role in assessing the extent and nature of the drug problem in their areas and in coordinating action at local level, so that there is a targeted response to the problem of substance misuse in local communities.</p>  <p>  Following the 2011/12 Review of Drug Task Forces, increased responsibilities were given to Task Forces in relation to addressing the alcohol problem.  In light of this expanded role, over &euro;900,000 in additional funding has been made available to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces from the Dormant Accounts Fund for substance misuse initiatives. This initiative aims to promote healthier lifestyle choices throughout society in relation to alcohol, by influencing and raising awareness of alcohol harm among the general population and specific risk groups.  In addition, through the Alcohol Forum, training has been provided to a number of Task Forces in developing local alcohol action plans. </p>  <p>  Every effort has been made to protect the budgets of Drug and Alcohol Task Forces in recent years. The overall allocation to Drug and Alcohol Task Forces for community-based drugs initiatives this year is in excess of &euro;27.6 million, the same amount provided in 2014 and 2015. The Department of Health will shortly be writing to Task Forces to invite them to submit their recommendations for funding of drugs initiatives in 2017. It is a matter for Task Forces to ensure that their budget is effectively deployed to address current priorities and locally identified needs.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-15a.1299.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500091#WRJJ03000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 488 to 491, inclusive, together.</p>  <p>  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC).  NIAC is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland comprising of experts in a number of specialties including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health. The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and international best practice. </p>  <p>  Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests. NIAC recommended that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all girls aged 12-13 in 2009 and in September 2010 the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second level schools.  </p>  <p>  By January 2016, over 200 million doses of Gardasil had been distributed worldwide. In Ireland over 580,000 doses of Gardasil have been administered and over 220,000 girls have been fully vaccinated against HPV since it was introduced in 2010.</p>  <p>  Aluminium has been used in vaccines for many decades to improve the body's response to vaccination. It is a component of Gardasil and several other vaccines. The World Health Organisation's (WHO) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine safety (an expert clinical and scientific advisory body) has concluded that there is no evidence of a health risk from aluminium-containing vaccines. </p>  <p>  The safety of the aluminium adjuvant used in Gardasil has been established in clinical studies and the level of aluminium present is tightly controlled as part of the quality control testing of the vaccine.  Gardasil which contains amorphous aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate adjuvant was tested in nonclinical safety assessment studies where daily monitoring for physical signs did not reveal any notable effects on any physiological function. In addition, the safety of Gardasil was tested in human clinical studies and no signs of concern were identified. Apart from the expected immune response and local injection site reactions, there was no evidence of systemic effects (such as effects on CNS, respiratory, cardiovascular, and renal systems) caused by HPV L1 VLP vaccines such as Gardasil from study data and there is no data to suggest that Gardasil crosses the blood brain barrier.  The pharmacological evaluation of Gardasil focused on the evaluation of primary pharmacodynamics (i.e. immunogenicity) as the vaccine did not show any effects apart from the expected immune response.  </p>  <p>  The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a decentralised agency of the European Union responsible for the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU.  It would not be appropriate to comment on data submitted by manufacturers of a medicinal product to the EMA as part of their market authorisation processes or monitoring of its safety following authorisation for use.</p>  <p>  No medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, there is therefore on-going pharmacovigilance and monitoring of medicinal products once they are authorised for use. The safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level. In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the statutory regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland. </p>  <p>  As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting.  All reports of suspected adverse reactions submitted to the HPRA are reviewed and followed up as necessary to ensure all relevant information is available, prior to onward reporting to relevant stakeholders, including the EMA. At EU level, regulators continuously monitor this cumulative reporting experience as part of the ongoing assessment of the safety of HPV vaccines.  In addition, pharmaceutical companies are obliged, as a condition of the authorisation to market a medicine, to submit reports of adverse reactions received directly, to the HPRA.  In accordance with its reporting obligations, the HPRA provides anonymised details of reports received to the EMA, the WHO and to the relevant pharmaceutical companies. The fact that a suspected adverse reaction has been reported does not necessarily mean that the medicine has caused the observed effect, which may have also been caused by the condition being treated, a new condition the patient developed, or by another medicine that the patient is taking.  Further data are usually needed to complete the picture.  </p>  <p>  I am aware of claims of an association between HPV vaccination and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women. It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine, and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter&rsquo;s condition. It is important to reassure people that anyone who is suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention, and to access appropriate health and social care services, irrespective of the cause of their symptoms.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services. The HSE are currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.  </p>  <p>  I encourage the parents of all eligible girls to ensure that their daughters receive this important cancer preventing vaccine.</p></reply>

My Department has examined the review in detail and advises that Dr. Herity's analysis and his recommendations are very soundly based and provide a robust evidence base for future decisions regarding invasive cardiology services in the South East.  Implementation of Dr. Herity&rsquo;s report will, I believe, strengthen the provision of safe and sustainable services for patients in the South East.</p>  <p>  In relation to current waiting lists for cath lab services, the position is that Dr. Herity recommends investing in UHW to address waiting times and to provide improved access for patients.  The additional resources necessary to implement this recommendation, to increase the number of weekly sessions currently provided, will be reflected in the HSE National Service Plan 2017.  </p>  <p>  Dr. Herity also recommends that some services be provided elsewhere.  I have asked my Department to address the implications of this recommendation by undertaking a national review of all primary PCI services with the aim to ensure that as many patients as possible have access on a 24/7 basis to safe and sustainable emergency interventions following a heart attack.  I expect the review to be completed by the end of July 2017. </p></reply>

The vaccine has not been available in Ireland since the end of April 2015.  The manufacturer has had difficulties in the production of the BCG vaccine. The manufacturer has informed the HSE there will be no supply of BCG until 2017. Consequently, BCG vaccination clinics in HSE Clinics and Maternity hospitals have been postponed until new stock arrives.</p>  <p>  There is only one licensed supplier of BCG vaccine to Ireland and to other countries within the EU.  Since this problem became apparent, the HSE National Immunisation Office has been in regular contact with the manufacturer of BCG vaccine to ascertain when the vaccine might be available.  The HSE has also asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA), which licenses and regulates all human medicines in Ireland, to source an alternate supplier of the BCG vaccine.  Efforts have been made to find a company who can provide the vaccine for use in Ireland which satisfies all the HPRA requirements on safety and efficacy.  To date no suitable alternative BCG product has been found.  Therefore the HSE has been unable to procure the BCG vaccine from any other source and still awaits the product from the HPRA licensed supplier of the vaccine. </p>  <p>  The supplier has indicated that supplies of the vaccine are not expected to be delivered into Ireland until early 2017.  When there is confirmation of the date of new supply a decision will be made, guided by the recommendations of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee, on who should be prioritised to receive the vaccine. </p></reply>

It outlines the need for smaller hospitals and larger hospitals to work together within hospital groups; the reorganisation of hospitals into more efficient and accountable hospital groups will ensure that all hospitals play a vital role in service delivery.  The Deputy can be assured that I am strongly committed to developing the role of smaller hospitals so that they play a key role in the provision of services to local communities.</p>  <p>  Nenagh Hospital is a constituent hospital in the University of Limerick Hospitals Group.  In that context, the Nenagh Local Injury Unit provides care to patients with minor injuries and plays a significant role to divert patients from the ED in University Hospital Limerick (UHL).  The Deputy will be aware that a new larger ED is under development at UHL.  I can confirm that increased funding will be available to the UL Hospitals Group in 2017 to facilitate the opening of this new ED.

The Commission has now published its report on the Midlands Regional Hospital in Portlaoise. It found that this hospital was non-compliant in terms of Individual Care Plans and the administration of medicines.</p><p>To deal with these issues, the hospital has convened a multi-disciplinary working group to develop a new Individual Care Plan template and appointed a pharmacist to oversee the administration of medicines.</p><p>The report also found that there were issues in relation to the admission of children and the use of seclusion in the hospital.</p><p>The hospital has taken the following corrective actions:</p><p>- A Policy on the Use of Seclusion has been updated to include provision for the frequency of training and identifies appropriately qualified persons to deliver that training.</p><p>- There will be a daily review of seclusion orders by second Consultant Psychiatrist.</p><p>- Seclusion training will be provided for all staff.</p><p>- All children will be admitted to a single room with 1:1 nursing care.</p><p>Having ensured that any immediate safety concerns have been addressed the HSE is now working at all levels within the Mental Health Division on a programme of work to ensure that the services offered in Portlaoise are not only safe, but of the highest possible quality.  There is daily and weekly monitoring of this work at regional and national levels respectively. I am satisfied that the hospital concerned is making progress in relation to the issues raised in the reports.</p><p>The Department will, however, continue to closely monitor the issues raised in the Mental Health Commission report, in conjunction with the HSE, to ensure that the necessary corrective actions have been taken.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-11-15a.1609.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016111500099#WRRR04000"><p>I am aware that many patients believe that cannabis should be a treatment option for their medical condition.  However, with the exception of Sativex, cannabis-based preparations are not currently authorised as medicines in Ireland.  Cannabis has not gone through the normal regulatory procedures for medicines which are designed to protect patients and ensure treatments are supported by good evidence of their safety and efficacy. </p>  <p>  I am however committed to urgently reviewing policy on medicinal cannabis.  I have requested the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) to provide me with expert advice on the matter.  The HPRA&rsquo;s statutory role is to protect and enhance human health by regulating medicines and other health products and it has the necessary clinical and scientific expertise to provide advice on this issue.  I have asked the HPRA to report on recent developments in the use of medicinal cannabis in other countries including an overview of emerging research.  This report may also propose changes to Irish legislation in relation to the use of medicinal cannabis.</p>  <p>  Separately the Oireachtas Health Committee will also start to examine the issue of medicinal cannabis later this month.  I hope to receive the report from the HPRA and the output from the Oireachtas Health Committee early in the new year and I will then be in a position to consider future policy and progress any legislative changes that may be recommended.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, it must be emphasised that treatment options for a particular condition are a matter to be discussed between a patient, their carer and their doctor in the first instance.  There are, for example, cannabis-based preparations intended for the treatment of certain types of epilepsy which are currently undergoing clinical trials.  It may be possible for patients to access these products on an individual basis, but this is something for discussion with the treating doctor.</p>  <p>  Cannabis-based preparations are strictly controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  It is open for an Irish registered doctor to apply for a licence for such preparations for an individual, named-patient.  Such applications will be considered on a case by case basis.  The appropriateness of any particular treatment is a matter between the patient and their doctor.  It would be entirely inappropriate for me, as Minister for Health, to involve myself in this process.  My understanding is that many doctors would be quite cautious about recommending a cannabis-based treatment for a patient, in the absence of the robust clinical evidence which underpins authorised medicines.</p></reply>

This memo was provided by the HSE&rsquo;s legal advisors to the National Director for Acute Hospitals.  Immediately on becoming aware of the existence of this memo, the Department contacted the HSE who confirmed that it had been rescinded.  I have already stated publicly that the memo was offensive and unacceptable and is utterly out of line with Government policy with respect to the care of patients and our vision for the health service.</p>  <p>  The HSE has apologised and confirmed that the memo does not reflect the policy of the HSE.  It is not in accordance with the HSE's espoused values of care, compassion and trust.  It was written as legal advice and should never have been circulated at hospital and staff level.</p>  <p>  The HSE is focussed on implementing the Winter Initiative 2016-2017, which it published on 9 September last.  The Initiative provides &euro;40 million of additional funding to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care.  The Initiative is primarily focussed on facilitating timely discharge from hospital, striking a balance between hospital avoidance measures, such as community intervention teams, supporting patient flow through acute hospitals and increasing the availability of social care services.</p></reply>

I have also asked the Director General of the HSE to remind all senior health service staff of their legal obligations, particularly under the Ethics in Public Office Acts and also of their obligations under the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies and to consider whether any additional guidance may be merited in respect of interaction between individual employees, their employing authority and commercial interests.</p><p>It is important, nonetheless, to appreciate that that engagement between clinicians and the pharmaceutical industry is a necessity and is central to excellence in clinical care as well as research.  Such engagement must of course comply with the relevant regulations, ethical guidance and public service codes of conduct.</p><p>The Medicinal Products (Control of Advertising) Regulations 2007 govern the advertising of medicines, and provide for a range of restrictions on gifts, hospitality and sponsorship of meetings.  For example, a gift must be inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy.  Hospitality must be reasonable in level, strictly limited to the main purpose or scientific objective of the event, and not extended to persons other than health professionals.  Health professionals are also prohibited from soliciting or accepting any prohibited inducement, hospitality or sponsorship.  Breaches of the Regulations may be prosecuted in the courts under section 32 of the Irish Medicines Board Acts 1996 and 2006.</p><p>Regulation of the medical profession is undertaken by the Medical Council, which updated its <i>Guide to Professional Conduct and Ethics for Registered Medical Practitioners</i>in May 2016.  While the Guide is not a legal code, it sets out the principles of professional practice and conduct that all doctors registered with the Medical Council are expected to follow.</p><p>The Guide advises that doctors &quot;should not accept gifts (including hospitality) from pharmaceutical, medical devices or other commercial enterprises&quot;.  However, it further states that this does not prevent practitioners attending educational meetings or receiving payment of reasonable fees for professional services to commercial enterprises&quot;.  The Guide directs doctors to tell patients and any other relevant party about any professional relationship they may have with pharmaceutical companies in order to show that they are acting without influence from commercial enterprise.  It also gives advice on how any funding received should be channelled to avoid conflict of interest.</p><p>All State Bodies under the aegis of my Department, including the HSE and voluntary hospitals established under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961, must comply with relevant legislation such as the Ethics in Public Office Acts 1995 to 2001, which set out statutory obligations that apply to Board members and public sector employees.  In addition, they must comply with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform&rsquo;s Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms.</p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently under way and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the Review.  Changes arising from this Review may require legislative implementation.</p></reply>

This use would apply at national level. There is no proposal to extend the use of LULUCF credits for compliance by individual companies who fall within the scope of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). In order for such use to occur it would require agreement at EU level to change and extend the current proposals. At individual forest level it would entail considerable measurement and monitoring of forest carbon stocks over an extended period of several decades, including the need to track levels of harvest and account for emissions associated with these removals. At present carbon stock change estimates for the forest sector are based on national data sources including the sample-based National Forest Inventory.  </p>  <p>  My Department therefore does not envisage the introduction of such a scheme as that described by the Deputy for individual companies falling within the ETS. The UK Woodland Carbon Code for example is one such scheme that my Department has been examining.  This model provides a mechanism whereby industry can invest in the creation of new forests and be associated with the climate mitigation benefits this delivers. The Department will continue to look at the possibilities that might exist in this area.</p></reply>

In terms of direct input, officials from my Department, along with those from other Member States, met with the Task Force in September to reiterate these points and to respond to questions from the Task Force on issues such as the operation of market safety net measures and the means by which greater transparency could be brought to the functioning of the food supply chain.</p>  <p>  We highlighted the fact that free and fair competition must be the prerequisite for a sustainable food supply chain, accompanied by balanced relationships between all of the entities along the chain.  We also emphasised that operators along the supply chain should acknowledge their interdependence with each other, and to work together to develop a model which sustains agricultural production, without which none of the downstream industrial or service sectors could exist.</p>  <p>  With regard to unfair trading practices, we considered that an EU-wide legislative framework would be a very useful step, as voluntary arrangements in our experience had proven to be of limited effectiveness, and the Single Market required legislative frameworks in order to function well and freely.  We also considered that measures to reduce cost, improve competitiveness and support innovation would be required in order to improve the longer-term sustainability of the food supply chain.</p>  <p>  On price observatories and market transparency, we drew attention to the fact that knowledge of market pricing in the EU is quite limited.  Producer returns at primary level are quite well publicised, retail prices are also known but there is little data on the basis on which they are constructed.  We said we would welcome efforts to improve transparency at processer and retailer levels in this regard.</p>  <p>  I took the opportunity to highlight these points during the informal Agriculture Ministers meeting in Bratislava in September, which also focused on the question of how to improve farmers&rsquo; position in the food supply chain.</p></reply>

Indeed, the importance of the need to strengthen farmers&rsquo; position in the food supply chain led to the establishment last January of the Agricultural Markets Task Force, which presented its report to the Agri-Fish Council in Brussels earlier today.</p>  <p>  More particularly as regards unfair trading practices, the Slovak Presidency made &ldquo;strengthening the position of farmers in the food supply chain&rdquo; the topic of its informal meeting in Bratislava in September.  I took the opportunity to again emphasise Ireland&rsquo;s view in relation to the usefulness of having an EU-wide legislative framework governing unfair trading practices.</p>  <p>  While many of the points raised by Ireland, including in relation to unfair trading practices, appear to have been addressed in the Task Force&rsquo;s report, I look forward to considering its contents in detail in due course.

Indeed, in the more formal discussions that have started on the mid-term review of the current financial framework up to 2020, the Commission&rsquo;s communication includes advance notice of the need to evaluate expenditure on, particularly, the cohesion and CAP budgets, particularly in light of the new demands that are emerging in the areas of, for example, migration and security.  We have responded to this very directly by stating our concerns about such an approach, and by emphasising the key role that the CAP will continue to play into the future in achieving important EU strategic objectives in the areas of, for example, jobs and growth, and dealing with the challenge of climate change.</p>  <p>  A formal communication in relation to the post-2020 EU budget is not expected from the Commission until late 2017 or early 2018.  However, Ireland will in the interim continue to promote the relevance and effectiveness of CAP expenditure, and will strongly defend the need for a budget that matches the strong ambitions for the CAP in the post-2020 negotiations.</p></reply>

These were as follows: </p><p>The first licence was for the thinning of 27.76 hectares and clearfell of a further 7.43ha.</p><p>The second was  for the thinning of 66.32 hectares.</p><p>The third licence was for the thinning of 14.34 hectares.</p><p>The applications were processed by the administrative and inspectorate staff  in my Department.  In relation to the first two licences, as the area proposed for felling intersected with a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Special Protection Area (SPA), the views of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) were sought.</p><p>The area covered by the third licence lies outside of the SAC and SPA and involved thinning.  In these situations, referral to NPWS is at the discretion of the Forest Service, and it was deemed unnecessary in this case.</p><p>In March 2016, concerns about the felling were raised with the Department and at the request of the Forest Service operations ceased on site for the areas relating to the second and third licence.  At that time, felling within the first licence area had been completed.  Following discussions with the contractor and further site assessments by the Forest Service, NPWS and an ornithologist engaged by the operator, the Forest Service was satisfied that the operations were appropriate and that the licenses issued were in keeping with agreed procedures.  The request to cease operations was lifted on 12<sup>th</sup>April, conditional upon stated requirements.  A speedy resumption and completion of the felling work was sought in order to have the work completed before possible nesting began.  On 11<sup>th</sup>May, work on the site ceased and was scheduled to resume at the end of the Summer.</p><p>A basis for lifting the request to cease operations on the 12<sup>th</sup>April was the commitment of the contractor to retain sequoia onsite within the area of the second licence (unless overriding health and safety concerns arose).  There was no condition on the original general felling licence that required the retention of that specific species.</p><p>In recent days, the Department received a report that sequoia trees had been felled on site.  The Forest Service inspected the site on the 9<sup>th</sup></p><p>November and noted that three sequoia stumps were observed in one of the two areas within which these trees are present, as previously indicated by the contractor.  In the opinion of the Forest Service Inspector the three sequoia appeared to have been felled in spring or very early summer and it appeared that the felled sequoia were quite likely to have been dominated by larger sequoias, as there continues to be a closed canopy following the removal of the trees.  Following this inspection, the contractor was contacted and he explained that three small sequoias were felled for the following reasons; </p><p>-  They were suppressed by the dominant sequoia overhead and therefore had little or no living crown remaining;</p><p>-  They were either dead or dying;</p><p>-  They represented a health and safety risk.</p><p>The Forest Service has not received any complaint regarding the felling of oak on this site.  Any information regarding possible illegal felling should be forwarded to the Felling Licence Section, Johnstown Castle Estate, Wexford.</p></reply>

It is designed and operated to ensure payments are made in a timely manner to farmers while also ensuring robust controls are in place to ensure the validity of payments. </p>  <p>  Ordnance Survey maps at a scale similar to the LPIS (1:5000) typically show each individual field on the farm as a distinct parcel.

Officials from my Department work very closely with other Departments and in particular, with the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment which is the lead in this area.</p>  <p>  The IIEA report is a valuable contribution to the research and will help to inform a coherent and cost-effective policy to meet the twin challenges of sustainable food production and climate change in the agriculture and land use sector.  The policy is based on an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. </p>  <p>  Through the deployment of innovative and efficient practices at farm level, combined with the application of emerging scientific knowledge, Ireland can take the necessary steps towards addressing the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane, in the Irish agriculture sector.  In the Rural Development Programme, there are some 38,000 farmers taking part in the Green Low carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS) and 24,000 herds are in the Beef Data Genomics Programme, which is a world-leading initiative to improve the quality of breeding of our beef cattle. </p>  <p>  Under the 2015 Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, a National Mitigation Plan is being prepared.  This work is overseen by Government through a hierarchy of committees and sub-groups, with independent advice from the Climate Change Advisory Council.  These committees and groups include the Cabinet Committee and Senior Officials' Group on Infrastructure, Environment and Climate Action, a Technical Research and Modelling Group and a Domestic Climate Finance Group. </p>  <p>  Food Wise 2025 &ndash; the strategic plan for the sustainable development of agri-food sector over the next decade - provides a framework for the agri sector to engage with the national mitigation plan.  Food Wise builds on its predecessor and focuses on the continued growth in the value of Irish agri-food including dairy production.  While this is likely to mean some increase in dairy numbers, it is not expected that there will be a significant increase in overall cattle numbers. </p>  <p>  There is a strong commitment in Food Wise 2025 to measure and monitor the sustainability credentials of the sector.  As part of the implementation of Food Wise, an Environmental Sustainability Committee has been established.  This implementation process will include evaluation and assessment of the delivery of sustainability and mitigation actions.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to invest in and engage with research initiatives to further assist with the refinement, development and deployment of new and innovative practices to reduce GHGs that are associated with agricultural production.</p></reply>

It should be noted that there has never been a national waiver scheme for household waste collection.  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then, for only a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price. However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste.  Waste collection is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between the service provider and customer and the range of services and fees offered vary amongst providers and across the country.  In that regard, it became increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.</p>  <p>  A mandatory pay-by-weight charging structure for household waste collection was due to be introduced in mid-2016.  The waste management industry had committed, on a voluntary basis, to providing a full weight allowance for the disposal of non-infancy incontinency wear to patients supplied with such products by the HSE, if a mandatory pay-by-weight per kilogramme charging system was introduced for household waste collection.  However, on 30 June 2016, regulations were signed to remove the requirement for mandatory pay-by-weight charging structure.  Notwithstanding the above, as previously stated, a review of the pricing structures that households are charged for the collection of waste, with a focus on encouraging households to prevent, separate and recycle waste and to reduce residual waste going to landfills, is due to be completed by July next year.  The issue of household non-infancy incontinency waste will be considered as part of this review.</p></reply>

The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team, and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids and get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further at this juncture, given that discussions are ongoing in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p><p>In parallel, and in accordance with commitments in the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p><p>In July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

Cavan.</p><p>The maps shows that Cootehill in the townland of Killycramph is included in the BLUE area where commercial providers are either currently delivering or previously indicated that they have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by scrolling through the map online or entering their Eircode. </p><p>Investment decisions by the commercial electronic communications network infrastructure providers in that market, including the timing and location of infrastructure upgrades to make high speed broadband services available, are taken on commercial grounds by each network operator.  Neither my Department nor the Commission for Communications Regulation, the independent market regulator, have statutory authority to oblige any particular network provider to invest in the provision of upgraded broadband services. </p><p>My Department is however actively monitoring the deployment plans in the BLUE area.  Direct feedback from consumers is important and if customers in Cootehill County Cavan cannot access high speed broadband services, I would encourage them to contact my Department directly at <i>broadband@dccae.gov.ie</i>, quoting their address and Eircode, and giving details of providers they have contacted with a view to obtaining services.  If  investment from commercial operators is not forthcoming, the Department has reserved the right to include the premises in question as part of the procurement process. </p><p>The Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area comprising over 750,000 premises including over 24,000 premises in County Cavan, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p><p>The procurement process commenced in December 2015.  In July, 3 consortia were shortlisted as bidders and invited to participate in formal dialogue.  All three bidders involved in dialogue are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) network solution to connect rural Ireland.  This means that consumers in rural Ireland could have access to services of up to 1,000 megabits per second, with businesses availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds.  It will involve the building of a new network in rural Ireland, spanning the equivalent of up to 100,000km of road. </p><p>Through this combination of commercial investment by telecoms operators, and the State Intervention, the National Broadband Plan aims to deal conclusively with Ireland&rsquo;s connectivity challenges.</p></reply>

IFI manages salmon stocks on an individual river basis as each of Ireland&rsquo;s salmon rivers has its own genetically unique stock of salmon.</p>  <p>  IFI is supported in its management role by a statutorily independent Standing Scientific Committee (SSC) for Salmon comprising scientists from IFI, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Loughs Agency, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (Northern Ireland), and other State bodies and third level institutions.</p>  <p>  The SSC estimates the number of salmon likely to return to each river in the next fishing season based on estimates of salmon runs over the most recent five years.  Each river has an individual conservation limit which is essentially the number of salmon required to spawn to maintain a healthy population.  If the estimate of returning salmon is above this limit then salmon from that individually genetic river population may be harvested commercially or by rod and line.</p>  <p>  The harvest of salmon is restricted to those river stocks that are meeting their conservation limits.  Fisheries are only considered in rivers where the estimated returns are above the conservation limit for the river.  I am advised by IFI that a Risk Analysis is undertaken on any estimate of returns expected to be above the conservation limit.</p>  <p>  In the case of the River Slaney, fish counter data is used to estimate the salmon run.  IFI has confirmed that the estimate of returning salmon in 2015 was below the individual conservation limit for the river Slaney and, using fish counter data averaged over the past five years, no surplus of salmon was available for 2016. I am advised that the data from all counters is verified on an annual basis.  I am happy to ask IFI to brief the Deputy on the methodologies used around counter technology, and to provide the latest verified counter figures.</p>  <p>  The salmon assessment methodologies used in Ireland are considered best practice internationally, with many other countries moving towards the development of similar scientific assessment models for salmon stock conservation.</p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) was reviewed in 2012 and again in 2015 in line with EU requirements. IFI carried out a comprehensive public consultation process as part of the both reviews.  Based on management advice from IFI, and having considered all aspects of their report, the existing conservation measures in Ireland&rsquo;s EMP remain in place up to mid-2018.  Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 319, 2015 prohibits fishing for eel, or possessing or selling eel caught in a river in the State and ceases up to 30 June 2018.</p>  <p>  The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) for 2016 (published October 2015) is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible.&rdquo;  There is no change in the perception of the status of the stock as being critically endangered.</p>  <p>  A new collaborative research initiative, involving IFI scientists and former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer term potential for recovery, is underway.  It is intended that the scientific fishery is to be undertaken for three years commencing in 2016 to increase data and knowledge ahead of further review of eel management measures in 2018.</p>  <p>  While I recognise fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and currently there are no plans to introduce a hardship scheme as outlined by the Deputy, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.</p></reply>

There is no charge for a re-test involving a visual assessment where the use of test equipment is not necessary.</p>  <p>  The CVR testing system is operated on a fully commercial basis and without any financial contribution from the State.  Authorised by the Road Safety Authority, CVR tests are delivered by privately owned garages who are responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure and facilities to do so and who bear the financial and operational risks associated with such investment.</p>  <p>  Apart from the introduction of the road safety levy as part of the fee for the annual CVR test, which incidentally does not apply to a re-test, there has been no change to the level of test fees since 2007.  The model for commercial vehicle testing has been reviewed and it was decided by Government that the prevailing model involving the delivery of commercial testing by privately owned garages should continue.</p></reply>

However, the UK Minister for Transport chose to give only very minor exemptions from the levy to Northern Ireland.  Subsequently, the Irish Government, supported by the Northern Ireland Department of the Environment, sought an exemption for the A5 from Derry to Monaghan, as it is a significant transit route from North West Donegal to Dublin.  This request was also ultimately not accepted.  While it is appreciated that the levy has imposed significant additional costs on Irish hauliers operating across the region, the application of the levy is a matter for the UK authorities.</p>  <p>  Road charging systems for HGVs have been introduced in 10 EU Member States under Directive 1999/62/EC, as modified by Directives 2002/38/EC and 2011/76/EU.  This Directive set out the legal basis for charging HGVs for the use of road infrastructure and authorises Member States, if they so wish, to levy user charges, which can be time-based, for example per day, week or year, or distance-based, calculated on the basis of number of kilometres driven.</p>  <p>  The introduction of a road user charge for HGVs in Ireland is under consideration in my Department.</p></reply>

In an effort to address inappropriate driving speeds on rural roads a new rural speed limit sign was introduced in March 2015 to emphasise this point.  This new sign means that drivers must use their judgement according to the conditions prevailing, but never exceed the 80km/h maximum limit on roads to which this sign applies.</p><p>It is important to remember that elected members of local authorities have statutory responsibility for setting appropriate Special Speed Limit bye-laws for any particular road within their remit.  Supported by expert advice from local authority road engineers, elected councillors are best placed to decide on the most appropriate speed limits and any associated traffic calming measures that should apply according to varying local conditions.  My Department's <i>Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits</i>reiterates these responsibilities and provides guidance in relation to such.</p><p>In addition, local authorities have also been requested to review and update all speed limits in their administrative areas in accordance with these<i>Guidelines</i>and this process is currently on-going.  In the case of national roads, local authorities were requested to undertake this review in conjunction with TII.</p></reply>

This year's fares determinations mean that approximately 75% of passengers will see no increase in their fares next year.</p>  <p>  Since it assumed its powers in this area, the NTA has sought to simplify what was an extremely complicated and cumbersome fares system and introduce a more logical and fair distance based model.</p>  <p>  In relation to rail, an examination of approximately 1,200 Origin and Destination station pairs concluded that fares between some pairs were set particularly low for various historic, commercial and operational reasons and were not in line with the fares other passengers are paying for a similar distance journey.  The NTA has been adjusting fares across the rail network in recent years in order to remove these anomalies.</p>  <p>  This year the final 261 station pairs were examined with the vast majority seeing a decrease in their fares for next year as a result.</p>  <p>  However, inevitably a small number, 36 station pairs to be exact or around 3% of the total number of possible pairs, will see a fare increase.  This is as a result of the previously unfair level of fares when compared with other station pairs across the broader network.</p>  <p>  In terms of Leixlip, the trip to Dublin Pearse has been moved from zone 3 to zone 4.  A single adult Leap fare will now cost &euro;2.93 as opposed to &euro;2.46.  There is no change to the cost of a single fare between Maynooth and the City Centre.</p>  <p>  Obviously I can understand that passengers at Leixlip will be disappointed at such a change; however, the overall impact of these changes is that all passengers within the Short Hop Zone are now paying the same fare for the same distance from 1 December next and that is in line with the overall strategy being pursued by the NTA.</p></reply>

Legal Metrology is responsible for the implementation of the Metrology Acts 1980-1996 and related Regulations.  It does this through certifying and inspecting measurement instruments and the quantities of pre-packaged products.  A wide range of measuring instruments, including liquid fuel dispensers on service station forecourts are subject to legal metrological control when used for trade purposes.</p>  <p>  The Metrology Act 1996 and Legal Metrology (General) Regulations 2008, provide that only nationally approved instruments or instruments that have undergone European conformity assessment and bear the CE mark can be used for trade.  The primary responsibility for design approval and conformity assessment rests with the manufacturer.  The trader is obliged to ensure that only such a measuring instrument is used for trade and that it is correct and verified at all times.  Re-verification must be carried out after the instrument has been repaired, re-calibrated or failed inspection.  The process of re-verification involves establishing that the instrument complies with regulations, in particular, testing for accuracy against applicable measurement tolerances and the application of tamper evident seals.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure sufficient resources are available for traders to keep their instruments in compliance, Legal Metrology has authorised private operators, subject to specific conditions, under Section 12 of the 1996 Act, to undertake verifications at the request of the instrument owner.  To monitor compliance, NSAI Legal Metrology Inspectors, operating out of seven offices countrywide, carry out inspections of liquid fuel dispensers on the basis of risk-based enforcement.</p>  <p>  Legal Metrology Inspectors have inspected 7420 liquid fuel dispensers to date in 2016.  Compliance levels are satisfactory.</p>  <p>  Approximately 60% of liquid Fuel dispensers were metrologically tested to determine if they were dispensing within legal tolerances while approximately 40% were visually inspected to ensure that they were verified and sealed.</p>  <p>  NSAI Legal Metrology continues to review its enforcement strategy on the basis of inspection information allocating resources as necessary to the areas of highest risk.</p></reply>

(<i></i>).</p><p>The making of the Order follows a public consultation on draft proposals that were developed by the Contract Cleaning Joint Labour Committee for an amended Employment Regulation Order for the Sector.  This process was undertaken in August of this year when notice of making of the proposals was advertised in national newspapers on 18 August.  That notice invited observations on the proposals to be submitted by 16 September.  Copies of the draft proposals were available from the Joint Labour Committees Secretariat and were also uploaded on the Workplace Relations website.<i></i></p><p>The Joint Labour Committee (JLC) for the Sector, made up of representatives of the main unions and employers in the sector, considered submissions made and submitted their final proposals for pay and other terms to apply to workers in the Sector, to the Labour Court for consideration.  Amongst other things, the JLC must have regard to the legitimate financial and commercial interests of the employers in the sector in question.  In this instance the Labour Court adopted the proposals and sent them to me.  Being satisfied that the provisions of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012 were complied with, I signed the Order to effect the proposals.</p><p>If enterprises that are covered by Employment Regulation Orders are experiencing severe financial difficulties they may apply to the Labour Court for an exemption from their obligation to pay the rates provided for in the Orders for a specified period of time.  The criteria relating to these exemptions are provided for in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2012.

Much will depend on the nature of the deal that will be negotiated between the UK and the EU.  This Government will seek, during that process, to highlight our unique economic ties with Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  It is clear that the cross-border market on the island is a particularly important one for SMEs, with nearly two thirds of Northern Ireland small firm exports going South and one sixth of Ireland&rsquo;s small firm exports going North.</p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland is initiating a research project to examine the impact of differing trade regimes which may emerge in the post-Brexit environment.  This study will include an analysis of tariff rates to look at the range of possible impacts for products currently traded between both jurisdictions. </p>  <p>  I am engaged strongly with Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to ensure that Irish jobs are maintained and created.  I am in ongoing communication with these agencies, and chair a Brexit Coordination Group which includes the senior management of my Department and the CEOs of the agencies.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland will continue to work to implement its business development strategy for the North West, which includes Donegal, to help it maximise investment in the Region.  Among its targets, this strategy will see the Agency seeking to secure potential &ldquo;second site&rdquo; investments from companies with existing operations in Dublin, as well as pursuing new investments for the region.</p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is working with its 1,500 clients who export to the UK, looking at the individual challenges faced by companies in every county in Ireland and also on a sectoral level, as some sectors are more exposed than others. </p>  <p>  From a strategic perspective Enterprise Ireland has a two pronged approach.  It is working to assist companies to maintain and grow UK exports and extend their international reach.  It is also supporting companies in enhancing their competitiveness to protect and grow Irish exports and jobs.  In this regard, EI is assisting clients to improve their processes to drive efficiencies and cost reductions and undertake R&amp;D and innovation with a view to improving existing products and processes or developing new ones.</p></reply>

I am establishing a new focused Brexit Unit within the Department, and a Brexit Senior Officials Group to monitor developments across the Department on a regular basis at official level.</p>  <p>  As chair of the Retail Consultation Forum, I am also very aware of the specific issues faced by the retail sector.  The Forum provides a platform for my Department to engage directly with the concerns of retailers, and its work programme is focused on identifying opportunities and responses to challenges in a collaborative manner to maintain the competitiveness of the sector and support sustainable jobs growth in the retail sector across all regions.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Forum&rsquo;s work programme has four key areas of focus: reducing energy costs, maximising opportunities in the digital economy, identifying skills needs for the sector, and the revitalisation of town centres.  These working groups are focused on maximising the benefit of concrete initiatives and funding streams, such as the fund of &euro;10 million made available by the Government this year for the Town and Village Renewal Scheme, and further funding of &euro;12 million in 2017.  Effective use of funds such as this will be of particular support to small and medium retailers.  Progressing the work areas of the Forum will provide support to the retail sector in facing Brexit-related challenges. </p>  <p>  I will be chairing the next meeting of the Retail Consultation Forum on 21st November.  Brexit is now a standing item on the agenda and members of the Forum will be briefed at this meeting by senior officials from the Department of the Taoiseach on the whole of Government response to the Brexit-related challenges.  This will also provide retail members of the Forum with an opportunity to outline their concerns regarding the impact of Brexit on the sector.</p>  <p>  At this stage, it is difficult to predict what the precise impact of Brexit will be on specific business sectors, and much will depend on the nature of the deal negotiated between the UK and the EU.  This Government will ensure, during that process, to highlight our unique economic ties with both Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>  <p>  As Minister, I have responsibility for supporting SMEs across the whole of the economy.  I am making sure that I am armed with the detail of how Brexit impacts on each sector and each company type &ndash; be they SMEs, micro enterprises, or larger companies, before I finalise any proposals about specific measures.  My Department is scoping out possible responses to the short term currency challenge and I expect to be in a position to announce more detail, based on actual company needs shortly. </p></reply>

Ensuring Ireland is a competitive location to establish and run a business is essential for job creation.  Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness also impacts on the comparative cost of living between Ireland and other regions with which we compete, including between North and South of the Border on the island.  Brexit means we must do more across a wide range of policy areas to enhance our attractiveness as a location to start and locate a business relative to the UK.  The most recent data from the World Bank&rsquo;s Ease of Doing Business shows that Ireland is ahead of the UK in terms of ease of starting a business and paying tax but is behind the UK in the overall rankings.</p>  <p>  Enterprise 2025, the Government&rsquo;s long-term enterprise policy is an ambitious strategy, with the objective of delivering growth over the next decade that is sustainable.  The Regional Action Plans for Jobs are the key instrument by which we are seeking to deliver on the objectives of Enterprise 2025 at regional level.  Implementation Groups have been established in the North East and North West Regions for their respective Action Plans and my officials have received the first reports on progress on the Action Plans and will consider with the stakeholders the next steps required. </p>  <p>  I have also asked the Chairman of the National Competitiveness Council to review the competitiveness of Ireland versus the UK.  I expect the work of the Council to be completed early in the new year.</p>  <p>   In addition, InterTrade Ireland is actively developing a programme of information sessions and resources to support businesses through the challenging period of exchange rate volatility and I will be participating in their programme of engagements over the coming months to assess for myself the competitiveness issues for businesses and communities in the Border areas.</p></reply>

Good progress was made in this respect in 2015, with a total of 750 new jobs being created in the county.</p>  <p>  IDA Ireland, for its part, is engaging with both current and prospective clients about investing further in Westmeath and the wider region.  A good example of positive investment into the county was the announcement last year by Patterson Pumps of a 30-person expansion at its manufacturing facility there.  I am hopeful that more investment will be secured in the time ahead. </p>  <p>  In terms of enterprise development in the Midlands, and in Mullingar in particular, EI supports entrepreneurs who are setting up start-up companies in manufacturing and internationally traded services.  EI also aims to create new jobs by working with its existing established companies in the Midlands.  The Westmeath Local Enterprise Office provides an important service too by supporting those who are looking to start or grow a small business.  </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs for the Midland Region is another key tool to help boost employment in the area.  Launched in June 2015, its core objective is the creation of an extra 14,000 jobs across the counties of Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois by 2020.  The Plan includes a series of actions aimed at attracting at least 25 additional multinational investment projects to the region by 2019.</p></reply>

The Forum provides a platform for my Department to engage directly with the concerns of retailers and its work programme is focused on maintaining the competitiveness of the sector.  In so doing, we ensure that retail businesses are supported in identifying challenges that may impact on future competitiveness.</p>  <p>  Currently, the Forum&rsquo;s work programme has four key areas of focus: reducing energy costs, maximising opportunities in the digital economy, identifying skills needs for the sector, and the revitalisation of town centres.  These working groups are focused on maximising the benefit of concrete initiatives and funding streams, such as the fund of &euro;10 million made available by the Government this year for the Town and Village Renewal Scheme.  Effective use of funds such as this will be of particular support to small and medium retailers.</p>  <p>  In recent weeks, several members of the Forum have voiced concerns to me and publicly about the cost and compliance implications of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.  Notwithstanding these concerns, it is important to note that these organisations are very supportive of the overall aims of the Bill, given the justified public health concerns around harmful drinking patterns in Ireland, and they take the issue of alcohol retailing very seriously.  Many of their members are also members of RRAI (Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland), an organisation which has also raised this issue with me recently.</p>  <p>  My officials are engaging with the Department of Health to highlight the concerns voiced by retailers, while also supporting the central objective of the proposed Public Health (Alcohol) Bill, which is to reduce the level of harmful alcohol consumption in Ireland.  The Retail Consultation Forum, which is meeting later this month, provides an additional platform for consultation on the matter.</p></reply>

In consequence the Labour Court no longer had jurisdiction to enforce, interpret or otherwise apply these agreements. </p><p>Existing contractual rights of workers in sectors covered by REAs were unaffected by the ruling.  Contractual rights can be altered only by agreement between the parties involved.</p><p>However, the striking down of the REAs meant that new employees into the Sectors previously covered by REAs could be hired at any rate agreeable between workers and their employers, subject only to the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Acts.</p><p>Legal advice provided following the Supreme Court judgment indicates that while the decision had immediate effect on REAs registered pursuant to the 1946 Act it did not mean for example that monies paid by employers to employees pursuant to those REAs having been incorporated into contracts of employment could be recouped.  It should be recalled that the monies involved relate to wages paid by employers to their own employees.</p><p>The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 provides a replacement for Registered Employment Agreements in individual enterprises and a new mechanism whereby pay and pension and sick pay provisions in a particular sector can be established and enforced. </p><p>This new framework contains a mechanism whereby, at the request, separately or jointly from organisations substantially representative of employers and/or of workers, the Labour Court can initiate a review of the pay and pension and sick pay entitlements of workers in a particular sector and, if it deems it appropriate, make a recommendation to the Minister on the matter, who in turn, if satisfied that the process provided in the new legislation for the Labour Court to follow has been complied with, shall make the Order.  Such an Order will be binding across the sector to which it relates and will be enforceable by the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>Since the Act came into effect on 1 August 2015, two such applications have been made to the Labour Court, one of which was from the TEEU and which was subsequently withdrawn.</p></reply>

In September there were 1,173 families in emergency accommodation, including 1,568 adults and 2,426 dependents.  I am committing to supporting implementation of <i>Rebuilding Ireland: the Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness. </i>We have made some progress in this regard, but more remains to be done.</p><p>In relation to Action 1.4 of the Plan, the joint protocol between Tusla and the Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) governing child welfare and protection matters has been fully operational since approval in June 2016.  A review of the protocol has already commenced and will be concluded early December 2016.  It is intended to replicate this protocol across the State.  However, the current protocol would not necessarily fit as a national template as organisational set up differs across the country.  Accordingly, the protocol will need to be tailored to individual local authorities.  This work will take place on a phased basis commencing in Q1 2017 and will continue throughout the year.</p><p>Action 1.5 commits to strengthening the supports and initiatives that have been established for families in emergency accommodation to mitigate the challenges that such parents and children face.  My Department and others have undertaken a number of initiatives as part of this Action.</p><p>The DRHE is working to provide free public transport for family travel and for school journeys for those homeless families in the Dublin Region who are residing in hotel accommodation.  Each family is being given five 24-hour family LEAP cards, which will be valid for use on all Dublin transport systems, allowing for family days out at weekends or during holiday periods.  Distribution of the family cards is almost complete.  This will be quickly followed by the distribution of the school journey cards.</p><p>My Department is funding research, commissioned by Focus Ireland, to identify issues regarding access to food and potential nutritional impacts on families in emergency homeless accommodation. </p><p>My Department is also enhancing access to early years services for homeless families through a new Community Childcare Subvention Scheme for homeless children.  It will provide part-time childcare for children aged between 0 and 6 years of age.  It is planned to launch the Scheme next January.</p><p>Also, I recently secured the agreement of the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that the provision of accommodation for young people leaving State care would be eligible for funding under the Capital Assistance Scheme (CAS) operated by his Department.  My Department and Tusla will work to ensure that any accommodation proposed, and ultimately delivered, will be provided with the appropriate levels of protective factors for the young person making the transition to independent living.</p><p>Many of the remaining child-focussed actions in the Action Plan are being advanced by Tusla and progress is being made on several fronts.  This year, Tusla provided funding to Focus Ireland for additional child support workers to assist with the challenges facing families in emergency accommodation and I will be requesting Tusla to examine the possibility of funding for similar initiatives in 2017.</p></reply>

Social workers employed in maternity hospitals engage with vulnerable mothers to assess their capacity to care for their new born babies and, if necessary, will contact the local social work department in Tusla.  When a social work department receives a referral regarding child protection concerns a social worker completes an assessment of those concerns.  If the outcome of the assessment demonstrates that a child is at significant risk of harm or neglect, and that work with the family has failed to address that risk then an application is made to the Courts for a care order.  Children are only separated from parents/carers when alternative means of protection have been exhausted.

Tusla will, in response to the Performance Statement, prepare a Business Plan for 2017 which will be submitted to me for consideration.</p>  <p>  The precise level of funding to be allocated to the Family Resource Centre Programme will be considered by Tusla, in preparing its Business Plan, having regard to the overall level of funding available in 2017, which will exceed &euro;700m, including the additional Budget 2017 provision.</p>  <p>  It is not my intention to prescribe the overall level of funding to be allocated by Tusla to family support services, including the Family Resource Centre Programme.  It is more appropriate, in my view, that Tusla first sets out its proposals for this important service area, having regard to its statutory remit and taking account of the totality of funding available next year.</p></reply>
