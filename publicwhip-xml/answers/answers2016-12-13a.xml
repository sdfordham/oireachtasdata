This paper, along with others, was considered as part of the discussions on future developments in the area of security and defence.</p>  <p>  The way forward for the implementation of the EU Global Strategy was agreed in Council Conclusions adopted on the 14 November.  Ireland shares the views of other member states on the need for coherence in internal/external security policies and increased investment in addressing external conflicts through a range of instruments including diplomatic, economic development, peace support and crisis management tools.  Ireland remains fully committed in these areas including through an active contribution to EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) as it has developed to date.</p>  <p>  We will continue to participate in the ongoing development of CSDP, as provided for in the EU Treaties, in support of the UN and international peacekeeping and crisis management.</p></reply>

This is a long-standing position which was reaffirmed in the 2015 White Paper on Defence.</p><p>As Minister with responsibility for Defence I provide policy direction for Civil Defence and the Department of Defence manages and develops Civil Defence at national level.  The Civil Defence Branch of the Department provides centralised training, administrative support and guidance and centralised procurement of major items of uniform and equipment in support of local authority Civil Defence efforts.</p><p>At local level, Civil Defence Units are based in each local authority area under the operational control of the relevant local authority.  On a day to day basis these Units operate under the control of a Civil Defence Officer, who is a full-time employee of the local authority.<b></b></p><p>Civil Defence in each county is generally funded on a 70:30 basis, by way of an annual grant from the Department of Defence with the balance being funded by the local authority.</p><p>Senior officials from the Department of Defence have met with senior officials from Westmeath County Council earlier this year.  This has been in keeping with efforts by the Department, since the closure of Columb Barracks in 2012, to explore a number of avenues to try and secure the long term future of the former barracks for the benefit of the local community.  To date, Westmeath County Council has declined the option of availing of Columb Barracks for use, including for use by Civil Defence.</p><p>I met recently with a number of volunteers from Westmeath Civil Defence who outlined their concerns with the existing accommodation arrangements.  I understand that this has also been raised at a meeting of Westmeath County Council.</p><p>Westmeath County Council have advised officials in the Department of Defence that they are conducting a review of the accommodation for Civil Defence in Westmeath.  While the provision of accommodation is a matter for Westmeath County Council, department officials have offered to provide any advice required by the Council in developing their outline plan for Westmeath Civil Defence.</p></reply>

As a consequence of taking over command we deployed an additional Company of some 150 personnel as part of Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to this mission.</p><p>Ireland has a long and continuous record of contributing to peacekeeping missions.

The current provision in relation to annual leave that cannot be availed of is that Officers can carry-over a maximum of 24 days and Other Ranks can carry-over a maximum of 19 days.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may wish to note that personnel who serve overseas are also in receipt of leave from the mission in accordance with the mission&rsquo;s Standard Operating Procedures during their deployment, which is generally three weeks.  In addition, all personnel serving overseas also receive special leave immediately upon their return from overseas service, which is six days per calendar month that the individual served overseas up to a maximum of 30 days.  This is in addition to the facility to carry-over leave stated earlier. </p>  <p>  The Department received a claim from PDFORRA under the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme to have the provisions for the carrying over of annual leave, currently capped at 19 days, set aside.  Having considered the matter, the Department advised PDFORRA on the 23 November 2016 that, on the basis of the case made by them, it was not in a position to accede to their claim.</p>  <p>  I have been advised by my officials that legal proceedings have been commenced recently in relation to this matter and, as the matter is before the courts, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-13a.29.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121300058#WRA02600"><p>The Conciliation and Arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) provides a formal mechanism for the PDF Representative Associations, RACO and PDFORRA, to engage with the Official side.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide a means for the determination of claims and proposals from the Associations relating to remuneration and conditions of service.  Since 1993, there have been significant developments and improvements in the pay and conditions of military personnel.  The Representative Associations have been to the fore in advancing the interests of their members in this regard, bringing them in line generally with the pay and conditions available in other public service employments.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department continue to work with the Representative Associations in a positive and collaborative process within the C and A Scheme which points to the effectiveness of the scheme for resolving IR issues. It is open to the Representative Associations to submit claims to the Official side in relation to matters falling within the C and A scheme, generally claims relate to pay and conditions, award of allowances etc.  When submitted these claims are generally the subject of negotiations and where agreement is not reached it is open to both sides to seek the assistance of an adjudicator to settle the matter. </p>  <p>  In relation to the parallel process referred to by the Deputy, I should firstly outline that under the terms of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1990 the Defence Forces Representative Associations are prohibited from being associated with, or affiliated to any trade unions, or any other body without the consent of the Minister. Accordingly, the Representative Associations cannot be affiliated to ICTU at present.  The basis for the prohibition is that it would be inappropriate to apply the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990 to members of the Defence Forces.  The taking of any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.  This is a long standing policy position taken by respective Governments since the foundation of the State.  The Defence Forces may be called on to contribute to maintaining vital services in times of industrial action.  The potential for serious difficulties and conflicts could arise in these circumstances if the Defence Forces Representative Associations were associated with, or affiliated to ICTU, given ICTU rules in relation to such matters.However, a number of mechanisms have been put in place through the Defence Forces Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme which provides the Representative Associations with structures and processes, which enable them to make representations and negotiate on behalf of their members.</p>  <p>  In addition, a framework exists which facilitates the Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level. </p>  <p>  I have recently received a detailed submission from RACO in which they put forward their views and recommendations in relation to the future development of both processes.

I should point out at the outset that this is simply a proposal from the Commission.  It has not been discussed or agreed by the member States or the European Parliament.  As such, it has yet to go through the wide ranging and extensive EU procedures before any part of it becomes a reality.  The aim of the Plan is to explore how EU policies and instruments can ensure that the EU&rsquo;s industrial and skills base will be able to deliver required defence capabilities in view of current and future security challenges.  As part of this Plan, the Commission has proposed the creation of a European Defence Fund.   There are also proposals in the Plan to increase transparency in relation to Defence procurement.   </p>  <p>  The purpose of the Defence Fund is to promote research and innovation and contribute to the strengthening of the European defence technological and industrial base, and to further stimulate the development of key defence capabilities.  The Commission has proposed that the fund would have research and capability windows. </p>  <p>Under the research window, it is proposed that &euro;90 million in funding will be made available for collaborative defence research projects over the period 2017-2020 in what is known as the &ldquo;Preparatory Action&rdquo;.  The 2017 allocation of &euro;25 million has already been approved.  The Commission also propose that post 2020, a European Defence Research Programme will be established which will require funding of &euro;500m per annum.  It should be noted that this has yet to be negotiated as part of the post 2020 Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>  <p>  Under the capability window, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a fund which would facilitate Member States in purchasing capability platforms together through the pooling of national contributions and where possible supported by the EU Budget.  The Commission estimate that this fund would be in the region of &euro;5 billion per year.  Any capabilities developed as a result of this plan would continue to be owned by the relevant Member State.  It is important to highlight that this would depend on Member States agreeing to initiate joint projects which they would co-fund from national resources.   </p>  <p>  It should be noted that the proposals contained in the Plan, in particular in relation to the creation of European Defence Fund, have yet to be defined in full and negotiated with Member States.</p></reply>

At this meeting Council Conclusions were adopted on implementing the EU Global Strategy in the area of security and defence. </p>  <p>  Ireland is supportive of the range of actions set out in the conclusions and is committed to the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy and the key role that it can play in international peacekeeping and crisis management.  Global threats require coordinated approaches, including within the EU, and between the EU and its international partners.  </p>  <p>  The EU has a long track record of cooperation with the UN, NATO, OSCE, AU and other organisations.  I welcome in particular the continued commitment to work closely with United Nations.  As set out in the Global Strategy, &ldquo;the EU will promote a rules-based global order with multilateralism as its key principle and the UN at its core&rdquo;.  </p>  <p>  It is also essential that our military have the necessary interoperable capabilities to participate effectively and safely in UN mandated international peacekeeping operations and crisis management, be they UN, EU or NATO led missions.  In that context, I welcome the proposals in the conclusions in relation to capability development in support of CSDP.   </p>  <p>  Within the EU, it is accepted that defence and security is a national competence and that each sovereign State has the right to choose its own defence policy, which in Ireland&rsquo;s case is one of military neutrality.  The Council Conclusions, at Ireland&rsquo;s instigation, include a commitment that the specific character of the security and defence policy of all EU Member States will be fully respected.  Accordingly, the conclusions have no implications for Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality.</p></reply>

Future equipment priorities for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service are being considered in the context of the lifetime of the White Paper on Defence as part of the capability development and equipment planning priorities planning process.</p>  <p>  There will be continued investment in the development of suitable network enabled communications in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly complex operational environment.  This is also a priority area for investment if additional funding, beyond that required to maintain existing capabilities, is made available.   </p>  <p>  Training standards in the Defence Forces are constantly benchmarked against international best practice.  Participation in overseas operations also necessitates multi-lateral training and assessment.  This facilitates ongoing review of Defence Forces training methods and standards within an international military context. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the Defence Forces training techniques and the most modern methods and effective range of equipment which is line with best international standards are available to ensure that personnel are fully equipped to meet their roles.</p></reply>

I understand and accept that the current blanket exemption in respect of Defence Forces activities under the Act in implementing the Directive is no longer tenable.  The task now is to ensure maximum compliance with the Directive.</p>  <p>  A detailed review of Defence Forces activities was initiated some time ago in this regard.  The Defence Forces recently concluded an audit of its activities with a view to determining what activities may require derogations or exemptions under the terms of the Directive.</p>  <p>  A list of activities undertaken by the Defence Forces which may qualify for a derogation or exemption under the terms of the Working Time Directive will soon be submitted to the Attorney General for advice with a view to implementing appropriate provisions in the planned amending legislation.  Subject to that advice, amendments to deal with these issues in respect of the Defence Forces will be included in the proposed amendments to the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 which is being brought forward by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.   </p>  <p>  I have been advised by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that her Department will shortly, following the recent approval of the Government, amend the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, insofar as it provides for a specific exclusion for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it is liaising with my Department regarding issues arising for the Defence Forces in any such amendments.  My Department, subject to legal advice, will deal with potential issues for exemption and derogation for the Defence Forces in this legislation.</p></reply>

I note that the Director responded to the issue, when it came to his attention, clearly outlining his considerations at the time.   </p>  <p>  I am also advised by the military authorities that risk assessments are carried out for all mission areas.  These risk assessments are intended to identify all hazards that might exist in a mission area, including health risks.  Suitable control measures are then put in place to minimise identified risks.  Where a health risk is identified the control measures will include preventative medication where appropriate. </p>  <p>  Where malaria has been identified as a risk in a particular mission area, the choice of chemoprophylaxis medication is dependent on a number of factors including the type of malaria in the destination, resistance to particular drugs, the profile of the traveller (contra-indications, underlying health conditions, purpose of travel), the duration of travel and adherence issues. </p>  <p>  The choice of medication for overseas deployment, for both officers and enlisted personnel, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by Medical Officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Defence Forces. </p>  <p>  Significant precautions are taken by Defence Forces Medical Officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of our Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications.

As I previously advised the House, there have been proposals around for some time, that the EU should establish a joint operational headquarters to support the planning and conduct of its civil and military operations.  A permanent joint civil-military operational headquarters, appropriately configured, could potentially deliver more effective and responsive CSDP operations in support of the UN and international peace and security, a position which Ireland supports.</p>  <p>  This is a matter which EU Member States, including Ireland, will consider in the context of the Council Conclusions of 14 November on implementing the EU Global Strategy on Foreign and Security Policy.  Ireland will participate fully in that process and in the ongoing development of the EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) in support of the UN and international peacekeeping and crisis management.</p>  <p>  Current proposals are designed to improve the effectiveness of operational planning and conduct capacity within the EU for both civil and military operations under CSDP.  I do not believe that that represents an increase in or a move towards militarisation of the EU.  The Lisbon Treaty provides that the Common Security and Defence Policy &ldquo;shall provide the Union with an operational capacity drawing on assets civil and military.  The Union may use them on missions outside the Union for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.  The performance of these tasks shall be undertaken using the capabilities provided by the Member States&rdquo;.     </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the issue of having an effective joint planning and operational capacity to support CSDP civil and military operations is one which is reasonable to consider in this regard, particularly having regard to the EU&rsquo;s comprehensive approach to international crises.</p></reply>

In line with this, work is ongoing to further develop the Defence Enterprise Initiative.</p>  <p>  Projects proposed by institutes and companies, where they are seeking to partner with, or involve, Defence Forces participation are submitted to the Defence Enterprise Committee for consideration.  The Defence Enterprise Committee consists of personnel from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and Enterprise Ireland.  All capabilities to be researched are vetted and agreed at the highest level in the Defence Organisation to ensure compatibility with the roles assigned to the Defence Forces by the Government.</p>  <p>  The engagement is targeted at companies and research institutes which have relevant technologies or are developing technologies which can support Defence Force capabilities and does not target specific geographical area.  However, I am aware of two projects involving the Defence Forces and Kildare based companies, one of which was part of a successful bid for Horizion 2020 funding in 2016.</p>  <p>  Another Kildare company has been involved with the Irish Maritime Energy and Resource Cluster (IMERC) on an ongoing basis since 2010.  IMERC is a partnership of the Naval Service, University College Cork, and Cork Institute of Technology.  This research and commercial cluster aims to realise Ireland&rsquo;s economic potential in the global, maritime and energy markets and brings together expertise in the fields of energy engineering, maritime operations, maritime technology and ecosystem governance.  In collaboration with IMERC, the Naval Service is involved in a number of research initiatives in the maritime domain.</p>  <p>  My Department and the Defence Forces will continue to provide assistance to EI and companies supported by EI in 2017 and beyond.</p></reply>

I am ensuring that a whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being developed, including through the Brexit Cabinet Committee which I established following the referendum result, which I chair and which will involve all Ministers as required.   The issues involved concern all Ministers, Departments and Agencies and require a consistent and comprehensive whole-of-Government response. </p>  <p>  The Cabinet Committee on Brexit has met on a number of occasions, most recently on 24 November, to continue overall coordination of our preparations for the negotiations on Brexit which will take place once the British Government submit their Article 50 notification.  The Committee also considers the potential impact of Brexit for Ireland, as well as any economic opportunities that may arise.   Separately, a special Government meeting was held on 16 November to consider Brexit issues and, in particular, to prepare for an important plenary meeting of the North South Ministerial Council in Armagh on 18 November. </p>  <p>  I have also restructured my Department to ensure that Brexit is treated as a crucial cross-cutting issue, including by creating a newly amalgamated International, EU and Northern Ireland Division, under a new Second Secretary General.  The work of this Division includes supporting the  Cabinet Committee on Brexit and the Cabinet Committee on European Affairs.</p>  <p>  Work on Brexit is also supported by the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who now have a greater role in EU matters overall, with a newly created EU Division and the existing Division dealing with Anglo Irish affairs both having important roles to play.</p>  <p>  Across Government, relevant Departments, agencies and overseas missions are being strengthened to deal with Brexit.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-12-13a.112.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016121300059#WRB05800"><p>The position is that the Programme for Government contains a series of commitments in relation to housing, including a commitment to keeping families in their homes and avoiding repossessions as far as possible; establishment of a new national service to standardise supports available to borrowers in mortgage arrears; establishment of a dedicated new court to handle mortgage arrears and other personal insolvency cases; a review of the thresholds and processes for Personal Insolvency Arrangements; and a review the Central Bank's Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears.  I will be working closely with my Government colleagues in the coming months towards achievement of these aims.</p>  <p>  A number of measures have already been put in place with the aim of providing assistance to those finding themselves in mortgage arrears. These include:</p>  <p>  - development of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) as the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo; point of information and guidance for homeowners in mortgage arrears, working closely with the Insolvency Service;</p>  <p>  - establishment and staffing of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears centres in key locations with nationwide coverage, which offer specialised expertise on mortgage debt;</p>  <p>  - the presence of MABS and the Insolvency Service at courthouses to provide information and &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; support for householders issued with repossession proceedings involving their homes (operating nationwide since 1 October last, following a successful pilot scheme in July 2015).  This initiative is facilitated by the Courts Service, and is currently provided for all Circuit Court repossession hearings.</p>  <p>  I should also mention the new, innovative mortgage arrears resolution service - Abhaile - which the Minister for Social Protection and I officially launched recently.  The new nationwide service marks a departure in State assistance by providing free, independent expert advice and support on financial and legal issues.  The objective of the Scheme is to ensure that a person who is at risk of losing their home due to their mortgage arrears can access independent expert financial and legal advice, which will help them to identify their best options for returning to solvency - with priority to their remaining in the home, where that is a sustainable option. It aims, in particular, to reach those in arrears greater than 2 years.  The scheme started in late July and is already proving very effective.  </p>  <p>  Under the scheme, eligible clients are given vouchers to obtain expert advice from financial and legal advisers in order to resolve their debt issues.  In addition, they can get assistance in court where needed, have access to solicitors, and get help obtaining legal aid. Since the establishment of the scheme in July, over 2,100 home owners have received assistance.  A major Government information campaign will be launched in the coming weeks to raise awareness of the scheme.  I believe that the introduction of the scheme will help people get out of debt and, wherever possible, to stay in their own homes and would strongly encourage anyone worried about mortgage arrears on their home to contact MABS, the Government gateway for accessing free expert help and advice.</p>  <p>  This new service builds on the protections set out in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 which assists homeowners in mortgage arrears by granting the Circuit Court specific powers to adjourn repossession proceedings in order to allow such a borrower to consult with a personal insolvency practitioner (PIP) with a view to making a Personal Insolvency Arrangement (PIA) under the Insolvency Acts and to instruct the PIP to make such a proposal.  In addition, the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015 has been enacted in order to further assist homeowners in mortgage arrears.  The Act has introduced a new "court review" process applicable in cases where creditors such as a lending institution refuse a proposal for a PIA drawn up to resolve the homeowner's debts, including the mortgage on their home.</p>  <p>  Regarding the Courts Bill 2016, currently before the Oireachtas, the position is that the Bill does not have any implications for applications for repossession of principal private residences by the banks and financial institutions.  The Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2013 already gives the Circuit Court jurisdiction to deal with repossession proceedings involving principal private residences, irrespective of when the mortgage was created or the value of the property.  The Courts Bill 2016 does not seek to change that position in any way.</p></reply>

To compensate for the uncertainty attaching to the taking of annual leave by members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na the Recommendation provides for a payment of a &euro;15 premium payment per annual leave day to the ranks of Garda, Sergeant and Inspector on commencement of the next leave year.  The implementation of this is to be agreed among all parties. The recommendation also provides for:</p>  <p>  - the restoration of the rent allowance of &euro;4,155 per annum to new recruits as of the date of acceptance, the 5 December;</p>  <p>  - an increase in the value of the rent allowance by &euro;500 bringing it to &euro;4,655 per annum with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the integration of the rent allowance in the new amount of &euro;4,655 into salary with consequential increases in unsocial hours and overtime payments also with effect from 1 January 2017;</p>  <p>  - the implementation of a long-standing recommendation of the Garda Inspectorate by way of the introduction of paid 15 minute pre-tour briefing or tasking sessions with effect from 1 January 2017.</p>  <p>  In relation to the information previously requested by the Deputy, it is the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.

The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 passed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December 2016.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is under way on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.

The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website.  The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and while I am not in a position to give an exact date, I expect the Bill to be published very shortly so as to facilitate early ratification of the Convention.</p></reply>

It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p><p>I am further informed that the Garda strength of the Limerick Division, on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 549. There are also 38 Garda Reserves and 51 civilians attached to the Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau.  For the Deputy's information I have set out below in tabular form the number of Garda stations and number of Garda&iacute; assigned to the Limerick Division on 31 October 2016.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates. I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 23 to the Limerick Division. </p><p><b>Garda Strength Limerick Division 31 October 2016</b><table><tr><th>District </th><th>Garda Stations</th><th>Strength </th></tr><tr><td>BRUFF</td><td>BALLYLANDERS</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRUFF</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>BRUREE</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAPPAMORE</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HOSPITAL</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>KILMALLOCK</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MURROE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PALLASGREEN</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>HENRY STREET</td><td>ARDNACRUSHA</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CASTLECONNELL</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>HENRY STREET</td><td>237</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>MAYORSTONE PARK</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>309</td></tr><tr><td>NEWCASTLE WEST</td><td>ABBEYFEALE</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ADARE</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ASKEATON</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ATHEA</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CROOM</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>DRUMCOLLOGHER</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>FOYNES</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>NEWCASTLE WEST</td><td>36</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PALLASKENRY</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>RATHKEALE</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>75</td></tr><tr><td>ROXBORO ROAD</td><td>BALLYNEETY</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CAHERCONLISH</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>PATRICKSWELL</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ROXBORO ROAD</td><td>117</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>TOTAL</td><td>123</td></tr><tr><td>Total Limerick Division  </td><td>26 Garda Stations</td><td>549</td></tr></table></p></reply>

PAS will consider letters or reports from relevant professionals which clearly indicate the nature of the disability and the type of accommodation(s) that may be relevant to the person.

In addition, the Government is committed to launching a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  In relation to the proposed pilot scheme, I have requested the Garda Commissioner, while fully cognisant of her statutory functions in relation to the distribution of Garda resources in the State, to identify for reopening 6 stations that were closed under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na District and Station Rationalisation Programme. I have also asked the Authority to initiate the proposed review.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014. This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.

However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that while there was an increase in the number of prosecutions in the courts of non-summary serious crime offences in 2015, the full picture across the courts system for 2016 will be compiled early in 2017 and the trends carefully examined at that point.</p>  <p>  The Courts Service has also advised me that the allocation of judicial resources and the scheduling of court cases is a matter for the Presidents of the courts and the judiciary who are, under the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.

It is open to the Courts to impose a Post Release Supervision Order under the Sex offender Act 2001 or a Part Suspended Sentence Supervision Order under the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  The supervision of offenders in the community post release is based on the outcome of a formal risk assessment process conducted by the Probation Service.</p>  <p>  In an effort to strengthen the overall management of prolific offenders a Joint Agency Response to Crime (J-ARC) was developed.  J-ARC is a strategic response to the management of prolific offenders.  As part of this strategy a number of pilot initiatives have been developed to address the offenders' behaviour and reduce crime.  J-ARC cases are managed on an inter-agency basis by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service.</p>  <p>  In November 2015 I formally launched J-ARC which four inter-agency initiatives in Dublin.  This is now being extended to three additional areas; Dundalk, Waterford and Limerick.</p>  <p>  On 22 September this year I launched the first Joint Strategy between the Department of Justice and Equality, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, The Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service.  The Joint Strategy, drawn up by the three agencies and with the full support of my Department recognises that in order to protect the public and reduce victimisation in Irish society, a joint approach to the management of offenders is essential.  The Joint Strategy sets out a range of agreed key objectives and supporting actions for the enhanced management of offenders, to be advanced on an inter-agency basis in the period 2016-2018.  It places particular emphasis on the management of high-volume offenders, sex offenders, perpetrators of domestic violence, combined with a strong focus on the rights and protection of crime victims.</p></reply>

The times at which court hearings take place and the length of hearing days are matters falling within the responsibility of the judiciary.  Court hearing times are arranged to enable judges to prepare for the case, read the papers where appropriate in the case or cases listed before them for hearing and to complete other preparatory work associated with their lists.  Judges, in individual cases, regularly arrange earlier times for commencement of hearings and extend hearings beyond the usual finishing time to facilitate parties, witnesses and legal representatives, and to ensure hearings are completed within the time allocated to them in the court's calendar.</p>  <p>  Business is scheduled in so far as possible with a view to ensuring that the court has sufficient business for the full duration of a scheduled sitting.  The Court normally has no advance notice of matters that will not proceed, matters that will proceed as expected and matters that overrun their expected duration.  Inevitably, on occasions, cases listed for hearing may settle and the Court will finish early.  The Court, in scheduling cases, endeavours to strike a balance between managing the expectations of parties that their cases will get listed for hearing and the realistic possibility of such occurring.  The Presidents of the Courts, in consultation with the Courts Service, keep waiting times under regular review.  Where specific issues are identified additional judicial resources are targeted at the areas of greatest need.</p>  <p>  The Supreme Court continues to make significant progress in dealing with the backlog of cases awaiting hearing with the proactive review and management of its caseload under the direction of the Chief Justice.  Management of the Court of Appeal list is overseen by the President of the Court of Appeal and judges have been designated by him to actively manage both the civil and the criminal appeals list on a weekly basis to ensure cases are dealt with as efficiently as possible and delays are kept to a minimum.  The establishment of the Second Special Criminal Court this year has also impacted positively on waiting times.</p>  <p>  Waiting times in the High Court remain generally low and the President of the High Court continues to keep the waiting times under review and has introduced measures to assist in prompt disposal of cases.  New measures introduced in the Bail List have had a positive impact on hearings with almost all matters now heard on the first day listed or the following day resulting in improved case conclusion times as well as in significant efficiencies for the Irish Prison Service.  Waiting times in the Central Criminal Court have also been significantly reduced following the introduction by the President of a fifth sitting of the court.</p>  <p>  Sittings of Circuit and District Courts are being held as scheduled and waiting times are kept under ongoing review in consultation with the Presidents of the courts to ensure waiting times are kept to a minimum.  Earlier this year arrangements were put into place to redistribute the work of the District Court in Dublin to allow the use of three courtrooms in Chancery Street Courthouse for District Court Family Law child care business.  This increased from five to eight the available courtrooms in Dublin to hear family law matters in the District Court.  As the Deputy will be aware, it is my intention, subject to Government approval, to bring forward proposals in the coming months regarding a dedicated Family Court and issues relating to access to the Family Courts and optimising the use and availability of court time are likely arise for discussion in the course of discussions and consultations on those legislative proposals.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware, a Family Law and Children Court complex is being developed which will include a new Supreme Court facility and accommodation for court offices.  The project will allow for the much needed replacement of facilities currently in Dolphin House, Phoenix House, &Aacute;ras U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh and the Children Court in a single location with custom-built facilities and will also provide appropriate accommodation for the Supreme Court.</p>  <p>  I also intend to bring forward legislative proposals during 2017, in the form of a Civil Law and Courts (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which among other things will make provision for electronic case filing in the courts.</p>  <p>  Finally, a Criminal Procedure Bill is currently being drafted by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  The primary aim of the Bill is to reduce delays and increase efficiency and fairness in the criminal trial process.  The Bill will in particular provide for new Preliminary Trial Hearings to allow for procedural arguments which arise during trials at present to be dealt with before a jury is empanelled, thereby saving time and allowing juries to focus on the facts of the case.  My officials are working closely with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to progress the Bill.</p>  <p>  Against the overall backdrop of these and other developments, and bearing in mind the considerable number of legislative priorities already in train, including many relating to the courts, I intend in the new year to revisit the particular Programme for Government commitment referred to by the Deputy with a view to identifying a process for delivering on that item in 2017.</p></reply>

Such a letter will propose terms of settlement and will generally include a clause setting out that the applicant and their legal representatives will, as part of the agreement, jointly agree not to disclose or reveal the contents of the settlement.  This is a routine practice in litigation, not unique to this jurisdiction and such settlements are agreed between the CSSO and various solicitors representing applicants on a case by case basis.  These agreements relate to legal representatives of private individuals and many of these individuals may have at some stage applied for asylum or protection status in the State.  I would therefore not be in a position to disclose the details of such individual cases.  Indeed, as the Deputy may be aware, in cases brought by a person seeking asylum, the Court withholds the identity of the applicants from its published judgment in order to protect their confidentiality.</p>  <p>  In addition, in circumstances where the State is defending proceedings involving claims for damages, it is commonplace for legal proceedings to be settled on the basis of confidentiality being maintained by way of agreement between the parties in relation to the terms of any settlement.  Once a confidentiality clause becomes part of a settlement, it is commonplace that these proceedings are then struck out either with /without an Order, in accordance with the agreement between the parties.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that my Department seeks to ensure that feedback from court cases and/or judgments is conveyed to the relevant policy or operation division in order to have any lessons learned applied to processes or policy.</p></reply>

It is essential therefore that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland.  Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.</p>  <p>  Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il on 7 December.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.</p>  <p>  Work is underway on drawing up the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to progress miscellaneous legislative amendments necessary to proceed to ratification.  The Bill will address issues such as the Convention's requirements in relation to reasonable accommodation and deprivation of liberty.  The General Scheme of the Equality/Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill is available on the Department of Justice and Equality website.  The Bill is at the final stages of drafting and while I am not in a position to give an exact date, I expect the Bill to be published very shortly so as to facilitate ratification of the Convention as early as possible.</p></reply>

On establishment date, all charities with a valid CHY number, i.e. those with tax exemption status from the Revenue Commissioners, were automatically entered on the statutory Register of Charities.  Part 4 of the 2009 Act, providing for new investigatory and enforcement powers allowing the Regulator to investigate the affairs of a charitable organisation and to take enforcement action if necessary, was commenced on 5 September 2016.</p><p>I am advised by the Charities Regulator that a total of 7,942 charities with CHY numbers are deemed to be registered. In order for charities to be in compliance with the Charities Act they must:</p><p>(a) engage with the Charities Regulatory Authority and establish an online account;</p><p>(b) complete and submit details for the Public Register of Charities; and</p><p>(c) on an annual basis prepare and file annual reports and accounts.</p><p>The following table provides details on the current status of the 7,942 charities:<table><tr><th>Status</th><th>Charities</th><th>% of total</th><th>% Change from end 2015</th></tr><tr><td>a) Engaged and Established Account</td><td>5,736</td><td>72%</td><td>Up 57%</td></tr><tr><td>b) Submitted details for Public Register</td><td>5,027</td><td>63%</td><td>Up 282%</td></tr><tr><td>c) Annual Report &amp;amp; Accounts Filed</td><td>4,410</td><td>55%</td><td>Up 509%</td></tr></table></p><p>I am advised that the Regulator has begun a final phase of contacting those who have yet to engage to establish if they are still operating. The removal from the Register of charities which are no longer operating will result in a reduction of the total number of deemed registered charities.  By not ensuring that they are in compliance with the Charities Act, they put their organisations at risk of financial and reputational damage and both the Regulator and I have urged charities to take steps to ensure compliance. Charities that continue to operate but which have not yet engaged with the Charities Regulator will be subject to potential enforcement action by the Regulator.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division.  It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. </p>  <p>  Laois forms part of the Laois/Offaly Division.  I am informed that the number of personnel assigned to that Division on the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 294 members, 22 Garda Reserves and 22 civilians.  I am further informed that the personnel assigned to the Kildare Division was 307 members, 22 Garda Reserves and 29 civilians.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI), the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau (formerly the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation) and the Garda National Drugs and Organise Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p>  <p>  Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide including 29 to Laois/Offaly Division, and 35 to the Kildare Division.</p>  <p>  In so far as the allocation of newly attest Garda&iacute; next year is concerned, this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister has no direct role in it.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required structures and resources in place, including Garda tutors. </p></reply>

I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the allocation of Garda&iacute; is continually monitored and reviewed taking into account all relevant factors including crime trends, demographics, and security assessments relating to the area in question so as to ensure optimal use is made of Garda human resources. </p><p>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that as of the 31 October 2016, the latest date for which figures are readily available, there were 237 members assigned to the Garda Divisional Drugs Units.</p><p>It is important to note that all Garda&iacute; have a responsibility in the prevention and detection of criminal activity whether it be in the area of drug offences or otherwise.  I can assure the Deputy that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continues to pro-actively and resolutely tackle all forms of drug crime in this jurisdiction.  The Garda  National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau leads out the policing strategy for tackling drugs supply.  This approach allows for the co-ordinated use of Garda resources in tackling all forms of organised crime, including illicit drug activity nationwide.</p><p>This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  In 2017, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.</p><p>Taking account of projected retirements, reaching a strength of 15,000 will require some 3,200 new Garda members to be recruited on a phased basis over the next four years in addition to the 1,200 that will have been recruited by the end of this year since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014.  This is an ambitious target and will require a continuous pipeline of suitable candidates.  I am pleased to say that the recruitment campaign launched by the Public Appointments Service on behalf of the Commissioner last September, the second campaign this year, again received a strong response. </p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College, 679 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  It is expected that Garda drug law enforcement activities and all other Garda activities will undoubtedly benefit from these resources coming on stream. </p><p>For the Deputy's information the table sets out the number of Garda members assigned to Divisional Drugs Units as of 31 December for the years in question, and as of 31 October, in the case of this year.  </p><p>The Deputy may wish to note that there has been some restructuring of Garda Divisions within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na within the time period requested and that this is reflected in the tables.<table><tr><th colspan="10">Garda  Divisional Drugs Unit Strength  2008 - 2016</th></tr><tr><td>Division </td><td>2008</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td><td>2014</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.South Central </td><td>22</td><td>18</td><td>19</td><td>16</td><td>13</td><td>11</td><td>19</td><td>19</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.North Central</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>20</td><td>13</td><td>20</td><td>20</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.North </td><td>25</td><td>31</td><td>34</td><td>32</td><td>31</td><td>27</td><td>16</td><td>25</td><td>22</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.East</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>13</td><td>15</td><td>13</td><td>13</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.South </td><td>28</td><td>26</td><td>30</td><td>31</td><td>30</td><td>23</td><td>17</td><td>16</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>D.M.R.West </td><td>32</td><td>35</td><td>36</td><td>35</td><td>28</td><td>26</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>21</td></tr><tr><td>*Waterford / Kilkenny</td><td>15</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>-</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>13</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny/Carlow</td><td>-</td><td>8</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>14</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Cork City</td><td>26</td><td>25</td><td>27</td><td>24</td><td>26</td><td>29</td><td>28</td><td>15</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Cork North</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Cork West</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>14</td><td>19</td><td>22</td><td>20</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan/Monaghan</td><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo/Leitrim</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Galway</td><td>8</td><td>13</td><td>12</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>*Roscommon / Galway East</td><td>3</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>*Longford / Westmeath</td><td>12</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon/Longford</td><td>-</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>-</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Meath</td><td>3</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>*Carlow / Kildare</td><td>8</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>-</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Laois/Offaly</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>341</td><td>357</td><td>378</td><td>359</td><td>304</td><td>270</td><td>253</td><td>258</td><td>237</td></tr></table></p><p>* These Garda  Divisions were restructured in with in the period 2008-2016 </p></reply>

Section 29 of the 1995 Act provides that a person shall not qualify for legal aid or advice unless he or she satisfies the requirements in respect of financial eligibility specified in the Act and in regulations made under the Act.</p><p>The eligibility criteria are applicable to the vast majority of applicants that apply for civil legal aid under the Civil Legal Aid Act 1995.  There are a handful of matters for which there are no financial eligibility criteria and these include:</p><p>- Legal advice to a complainant in a prosecution for rape and certain other sexual offences</p><p>- Legal advice to an alleged victim of human trafficking</p><p>- Legal aid where the State is obliged to provide legal aid under an international instrument</p><p>- Legal aid for an Applicant in child abduction and foreign maintenance proceedings who is referred by the respective Central Authority</p><p>- Legal aid to a complainant in a prosecution for rape and certain other sexual offences for the purposes of an application under section 4A of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981</p><p>- Legal services provided as part of Abhaile, the Government&rsquo;s Mortgage Arrears Resolution Service, to a person who satisfies the criteria for admission to that scheme.</p><p>- Conveyancing (for which legal services are only provided where legal aid has already been provided to the person in relation to a connected matter)</p><p>For all other matters the financial eligibility criteria is provided for under the Civil Legal Aid Regulations 1996 to 2016 and in particular Regulations 13 to 21 of same.  These provide that a person whose disposable income exceeds &euro;18,000 shall not be financially eligible for legal services.  A person&rsquo;s disposable income is calculated by reference to their gross income less certain deductions prescribed in the Regulations.  In calculating a person&rsquo;s gross income certain social welfare payments, namely Child Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Benefit, Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, Domiciliary Care Allowance, Foster Care Allowance and Guardians Payment will not be taken into account.  A disregard of &euro;20 per week will be applied to income received from a child of the applicant residing with the applicant.</p><p>The deductions which will be made from gross income in order to calculate disposable income are:</p><p>- A deduction of &euro;3,500 in respect of the applicant&rsquo;s spouse or partner; or alternatively a deduction of up to &euro;3,500 of maintenance payments made for the benefit of the Applicant&rsquo;s (former) spouse, in respect of an applicant who is separated or divorced;</p><p>- A deduction of &euro;1,600 for each of the applicant&rsquo;s dependent children; or alternatively a deduction of up to &euro;1,600 per child in respect of maintenance payments made for the benefit of children of the applicant who do not live with the applicant;</p><p>- Deductions equivalent to the amount of all of the applicant&rsquo;s Income Tax, PRSI, and USC payments for the next twelve months;</p><p>- A deduction of up to &euro;8,000 equivalent to the applicant&rsquo;s annual payments towards their mortgage or rent;</p><p>- A deduction of up to &euro;6,000 per child for the applicant&rsquo;s childcare expenses, where the applicant is working;</p><p>- A deduction equivalent to all of the applicant&rsquo;s Public Service Pension Related Deduction payments for the next twelve months, in respect of an applicant employed in the Civil or Public Service or who is otherwise required under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to pay PRD.</p><p>In certain circumstances the Board will aggregate the applicant&rsquo;s spouse/partner&rsquo;s income with that of the applicant.  It should be noted that such circumstances are rare and in practice are applied only where the Board deems the spouses to have a common interest in the outcome of the proceedings.  In this regard it should be noted that over 80% of the cases taken on by the Board are in the area of family law.</p><p>The Board has a policy role in relation to the provision of civil legal aid and periodically it brings proposals to my Department in relation to the financial eligibility and other criteria in relation to civil legal aid.  I understand that the Legal Aid Board are to consider making proposals in relation to revising the financial eligibility criteria for civil legal aid early in 2017. </p></reply>

The relief is available, subject to a maximum limit, where farm land is leased to a qualifying lessee for a period of 5 years or more. In order to qualify for the purpose of the relief, the lessee must not be connected with the lessor or with any of the lessors if there is more than one.  The rules for establishing whether or not persons are connected are laid down by section 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Effectively this means that a lessor is not entitled to relief where the land is let to family members or family members of their spouse or civil partner.</p>  <p>  The restriction on the availability of the relief in relation to leases to closely connected relatives is a standard anti-avoidance measure without which the relief would be potentially open to abuse, for example with the passing back to the lessee of rent on which tax relief had been claimed.  This would not arise on transactions made at arm's length.</p>  <p>  I would also point out that there are reliefs from stamp duty and capital acquisitions tax available in the case of permanent transfers of land between family members, such as by gift or sale.  I also introduced succession farm partnerships in Finance Act 2015, which will be commenced in early 2017, to assist succession planning and the transfer of farms between family members. </p></reply>

NAMA has acquired loans and its role is that of a lender with claims over security for its loans, like a bank, rather than a property owner or lessor.  In that capacity, NAMA holds security over properties that are owned by its debtors or, in the case of enforcement, which are managed on behalf of those debtors by duly appointed insolvency practitioners.</p><p>I am advised that, through its debtors and receivers, NAMA has an interest in lands in five of the 10 Strategic Development Zones, as set out in the table.</p><p>In particular, the Deputy will be aware of the significant office and commercial development that is being carried out in the Grand Canal and North Lotts (Dublin Docklands) SDZ, where NAMA currently holds an interest in 63% of the developable land area of 22 hectares.  A key NAMA objective is to facilitate the delivery of Grade A office accommodation in the Dublin Docklands SDZ. NAMA expect that this will deliver up to 4m sq. ft. of office space and 2,000 apartments, which I am sure will prove hugely attractive to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and domestic businesses. I am advised that, to date, construction has commenced on over a third of the lands controlled by NAMA debtors or receivers, with planning permission granted on a further 22%.</p><p>In addition, the Deputy will be aware that in May 2016, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney TD, designated 34 acres of land in the Poolbeg peninsula as an SDZ.  Currently Dublin City Council is in the process of preparing a Planning Scheme for the Poolbeg SDZ which will ultimately be submitted for approval to the elected members of Dublin City Council.  The Poolbeg SDZ is expected to have the potential to deliver up to 3,000 homes, along with commercial and retail development.  However, this will be dependent on the provision of essential infrastructure to improve access links to the area.  NAMA, through its receivers, has an interest in 15 hectares of land within the Poolbeg SDZ.</p><p>The table summarises the position:<table><tr><th>SDZ</th><th>% of total developable land (by volume) within each SDZ in which NAMA has an interest</th></tr><tr><td>Cherrywood</td><td>3.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Clonburris</td><td>12%</td></tr><tr><td>Poolbeg West</td><td>44%</td></tr><tr><td>Hansfield</td><td>9%</td></tr><tr><td>North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock           </td><td>63%</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Improve the composition of public finances by creating more room for tangible and intangible investment and ensure the effective functioning of national fiscal frameworks.&quot;</p><p>The recommendation stops short, however, of advocating specific loosening by respective Member States to support the 0.5% of euro area GDP looser fiscal stance.</p><p>Ireland falls into category (ii) and the euro area recommendation emphasises that is essential that Member States that need further fiscal adjustment under the preventive arm remain broadly compliant with the Stability and Growth Pact.</p><p>Government policy is to utilise the fiscal space available to Ireland under the rules and this is reflected in Budget 2017 and approved in the 16th November Commission Opinion.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, an overall Exchequer deficit of c. &euro;1.4 billion is projected for this year.</p>  <p>  In relation to our revised tax revenue forecast for 2016 of &euro;48.1 billion, the position at end-November was that approximately 93 per cent of our overall targeted tax receipts had been collected, which is very much in line with expectations.  By way of contrast, 92 per cent of overall taxes were collected in the corresponding period last year.</p>  <p>  It is also worth pointing out that at end-November, c. 87 per cent (&euro;49.1 billion) of the overall projected gross voted expenditure for 2016 had been issued.  By comparison, at end-November 2015, approximately 88 per cent (&euro;48.2 billion) of the overall gross voted allocation had been issued.</p>  <p>  Finally, it should be noted that the other components of the Exchequer are broadly in line with expectations at end-November 2016.

However, the SME Credit Demand Survey, conducted on behalf of the Department, monitors the credit requirements of SMEs.  The latest published survey indicates that demand for non-bank finance for SMEs is considerably lower than bank finance.  For the period October 2015 to March 2016, the survey indicates that seven percent of SMEs sought non-bank finance, this represented a reduction of three percentage points on the previous period.</p>  <p>  The Government remains committed to the SME sector, as reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government, and sees it as a key engine of ongoing economic growth.  Consequently, my Department and the Credit Review Office, working with the other relevant Departments and Agencies, will continue to monitor the availability of both bank and non-bank credit on both a macro and sectoral basis in order to ensure that sufficient access to finance is available to facilitate participants in the SME sector to reach their full potential in terms of growth and employment generation.  In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs 2016 includes a dedicated chapter and associated integrated set of actions to support the financing for growth in the SME sector.</p></reply>

With regard to the sustainability of solutions to address mortgage arrears, the guidelines obligate the lender, in circumstances where a borrower subject to a compulsory retirement age is seeking a term extension beyond that term, to conduct an assessment with a view to providing evidence to demonstrate that the borrower can service the revised loan repayments to maturity on an affordable basis.  An overall ceiling of 70 years of age will apply for the Central Bank to consider a term extension sustainable unless such evidence of affordability for loan repayments to maturity is available.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank publishes quarterly bulletins on Residential Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions Statistics which provides the number and value of accounts categorised as restructured, including information on term extensions.  The latest bulletin was released on 12th December.  The Central Bank does not, however, publish restructuring information broken down by age characteristics.  It is not possible, therefore, to provide the numerical breakdown of mortgage restructurings for mortgages that have been extended to at least 70 years sought by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  Finally, it is  worth noting that Mortgage Arrears and Repossessions data released by the Central Bank for quarter 3-2016 provided further evidence that progress is being made in addressing mortgage arrears, with the number of PDH mortgage accounts in arrears continuing to fall for the 13th consecutive quarter.  In addition, over 121,000 PDH mortgage accounts were classified as restructured, of which 88% were deemed to be meeting the terms of their restructure arrangement.  This shows that where a borrower actively engages with their lender with a view to agreeing a sustainable arrangement to address their mortgage arrears, it is more likely that an equitable arrangement will be found and that borrower will be able to remain in their family home.</p></reply>

In Section 52 of the Bill, I have provided for an amendment to section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, the section that provides an exemption from capital acquisitions tax on the inheritance or gift of a dwelling house in certain circumstances.  I consider that this particular relief has lost focus since its introduction because of changes made to how it operates over the years.  The purpose of my amendment is to realign the exemption with its original policy objective i.e. to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability for a person who inherited a house in which he or she had been living with the deceased and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.  The changes I have proposed will have two principal effects.</p>  <p>  Firstly, the dwelling house exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65.</p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement will be relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  If my amendment is accepted by the Oireachtas and enacted in the Finance Bill, it will take effect from the date of enactment.  There will not be any provision for transitional arrangements for those people who may have already acquired a dwelling house for another person to live in with the intention of making a gift of the house to that person when the required three-year period of occupation comes to an end.  As the provision was intended to alleviate hardship it is not my intention to delay the introduction of the new arrangements to facilitate individuals who intended to make use of the previous arrangements to avoid tax.</p></reply>

These statutory exemptions apply where the recipient of a dividend from an Irish resident company would not be subject to Irish tax in respect of that income.  In those cases, if exemptions from DWT were not available, any DWT deducted would have to be refunded.  Deducting DWT in cases where there is no liability to Irish tax on the dividend income would result in an unnecessary burden for the recipient of the dividend, with no net additional yield to the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  A dividend paid by an Irish resident company to another Irish resident company is not subject to corporation tax in the hands of the recipient company on the basis that the profits from which the dividend is paid will already have been subject to corporation tax in the hands of the paying company.  Therefore, Irish tax legislation does not require DWT to be applied in respect of dividends paid by one Irish resident company to another.  In circumstances where the paying company is not a '51% subsidiary' of the company in receipt of the dividend, the exemption from DWT is not automatic and must be established by means of an appropriate declaration of entitlement to exemption completed by the applicant company.</p>  <p>  DWT also does not apply where a dividend is paid by an Irish resident company to a shareholder that is a collective investment undertaking such as an investment fund regulated by the Central Bank.  In order for the exemption to apply the collective investment undertaking must make an appropriate declaration of entitlement to the exemption.</p>  <p>   Certain non-resident persons, who are not chargeable to tax in respect of the dividend income concerned, are also specifically exempted from DWT under the legislation.  An individual shareholder who is resident in a country with which Ireland has a double tax treaty, such as Malta, and who is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the State, is exempt from income tax, under Irish tax legislation, in respect of dividends received from an Irish resident company.  Similarly, the individual would also be exempt from DWT in respect of such dividends provided he or she makes an appropriate declaration confirming entitlement to the exemption.</p></reply>

The Tracker Mortgage Examination is a key priority for the Central Bank and it continues to challenge lenders to ensure that progress is being made and fair outcomes are being achieved for customers.</p>  <p>  The review is currently ongoing and while all lenders are currently in the process of carrying out their internal reviews it is important to note that some lenders may have their internal reviews completed sooner than others depending on the size of their mortgage books and the complexities associated with them completing the Examination.</p>  <p>  As groups of impacted customers are identified, in the first instance the lender must stop charging the incorrect rate of interest on the customer's account and then communicate this to the customer to ensure that any further customer detriment is stopped as early as possible.</p>  <p>  Once a full review of the customer's account is complete, following external independent third party assurance, the lender will then issue a letter to the customer explaining the nature of the error, the correct rate to apply to the customer's account and information on the next steps in the Examination, including the redress and compensation process.</p>  <p>  The Central Bank will provide an update on progress on the Examination before the year end and it has indicated that it can provide a copy of this update to the Deputy.</p></reply>

Artistes who are not resident in the State for tax purposes have a  liability to Irish tax on income arising from the exercise of their profession in the State.  However, because foreign resident artistes merely have a transitory presence in the State, there are numerous practical difficulties associated with enforcing such a liability.  For example, the vast majority of non-resident entertainers do not file an Irish tax return and there is therefore no effective mechanism to quantify the potential tax exposure of such entertainers on the income related to their Irish performances and to collect any tax owing.  Similarly, an alternative system which would impose an obligation on paying agents to deduct tax from payments made to foreign entertainers and account for the tax to Revenue, would also present many difficulties such as the requirement to identify the paying agent, in order to enforce collection, as well as placing a costly compliance burden, both on Revenue and the non-resident artistes and paying agents.  Imposing tax therefore would be administratively cumbersome relative to the potentially small prospective yield and would also undoubtedly discourage some artistes from performing in the State.</p>  <p>  I can however advise the Deputy that in general where a concert takes place in Ireland, the artists performance fee is subject to Irish VAT.  Where an international performer is engaged by a promoter, it is the responsibility of the promoter to account for the VAT due on the performance fee.  This means that where the promoter is established in Ireland, the promoter is required to account for Irish VAT on the performance fee. In circumstances where the artist and promoter are both established outside the State, the promoter is required to account for VAT on the performance fee where she/he is established.</p>  <p>  Where a premises provider allows a promoter who is not established in the State to hold a concert on their premises, the provider must report details of the event to Revenue.  Failure to do so can make the premises provider jointly liable for any VAT arising.  This is a safeguard provision to ensure the correct VAT is collected and paid in relation to any merchandise sold at the concert venue.</p></reply>

Rather, NAMA's role is that of a secured lender to the property owner.  As a secured lender, NAMA may provide funding to its debtors and receivers where it is shown that this will increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded.  Such funding is entirely consistent with NAMA's mandate to secure maximum return to the Irish taxpayer.</p><p>NAMA was established as a commercially independent body mandated to achieve its Purposes under the NAMA Act.  Chapter 2 of the NAMA Act provides for the establishment of the NAMA Board whose functions are to operate NAMA in accordance with the Act, and to oversee the commercial operation of NAMA.  Under Section 14 of the NAMA Act, the Minister may issue directions concerning the achievement of the Purposes of the Act as set out in Section 2 of the Act.  The Deputy will note that all previous Directions issued to NAMA have been technical in nature and did not relate to individual assets nor NAMA's commercial decisions.  The list of directions is available from the NAMA website: .</p><p>The NAMA Act bars political interference for good reason.  There is no role for political interference with the commercial decisions of NAMA, such as any proposed funding strategy for the site the Deputy references.  From the outset, the Oireachtas worked to ensure NAMA would be independent in its decision-making to avoid a position where others, whether for political or commercial self-interest or for other reasons, would seek to influence decision-making in a way that would serve vested interests.</p><p>As such, issuing a direction to NAMA is not a measure that I take lightly.  I have no reason to believe that NAMA is not operating within its mandate and progressing its objectives, as required by the NAMA Act in achieving the Purposes of the Act.  Therefore, I do not propose to issue a direction, regarding the achievement of the purposes of the Act, at this time.</p><p>Perhaps more importantly for the Deputy's question, Dublin City Council is specified as the Development Agency for the purposes of the Planning Scheme under the Poolbeg West Strategic Development Zone designation in accordance with Part IX Section 166(3) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 and accordingly intends to prepare a Planning Scheme.</p><p>I am informed by Dublin City Council that as part of its initial research, Dublin City Council has undertaken a consultation process in relation to this scheme.  This non-statutory phase has helped to inform the process, ensuring that all relevant considerations are taken into account in the preparation of a Draft Planning Scheme.  On 5 July 2016 a newspaper notice prepared by Dublin City Council was published in the Irish Times to advertise the consultation period.  It invited interested individuals and bodies to submit ideas or comments on matters relevant to the preparation of the Draft Planning Scheme.  The deadline for submissions was 4 August 2016.  It was also emphasised that all comments/submissions would become a matter for public record and would be taken into account  in preparing the scheme.  To coincide with the consultation period, a series of public information sessions was organised in the local area during July.</p><p>The consultation sessions provided an opportunity for members of the public to discuss aspects of the SDZ with Dublin City Council staff.  I understand that these sessions were well attended and those in attendance raised a broad range of issues and concerns which related not only to the area within the SDZ boundary, but also to the surrounding areas.  In addition to these sessions, representatives of groups who wished to discuss the content of a submission made could arrange to meet a member of the planning team.  These meetings were then held during the week of the 8th-12th of August.</p><p>The Council's SDZ planning team is now preparing a report on the consultation process and the content of all submissions received. In parallel, research work is continuing and this includes consultation with relevant statutory bodies.  These research processes, along with the development parameters defined in the Government Order and Draft City Development Plan 2017-2022 will inform the early development Draft Planning Scheme through the analysis stage, to the development of a concept plan(s) for the site.</p><p>Further updates will be provided on the Dublin City Council website () on how this process is proceeding along with details of further public consultation.  Once the Draft planning scheme is complete a statutory public display period will take place and this will last for 6 weeks during which time submissions will again be invited.  I would suggest that the Irish Glass Bottle Housing Action Group actively participate in the consultation phases of this planning process.</p><p>Separately, I have consistently explained that NAMA cannot subvent the supply of social housing.  Section 10 of the NAMA Act requires NAMA to act in a commercial manner to obtain the best financial return for taxpayers.  In line with NAMA's obligations under Section 10, all residential projects, including any which may be envisaged for the Glass Bottle site, will be required to pass a stringent commercial viability threshold before NAMA approves funding and funding will only be made available if it is expected to increase the overall recovery for NAMA from the security being funded.  NAMA is obliged to act akin to a private sector commercial entity.</p><p>With NAMA estimating that 20,000 residential units may be delivered under its Residential Funding Programme between 2016 and 2020, the corresponding Part V contribution of 2,000 social housing units should not be forgotten.  As with any delivery of housing, the Part V contribution is a meaningful contribution to social housing supply.  However, for the reasons outlined above, it is not appropriate to direct or dictate a particular strategy to NAMA.  The Agency cannot fund the development of residential units, private or social, on anything other than commercial terms.</p></reply>

Countries typically agree in such treaties to allocate taxing rights in respect of activity carried out in one country by residents of the other country.  This will be done to encourage trade and investment between the two countries.  The exact allocation of taxing rights is a matter for negotiation between the Governments of the two countries concerned and a treaty will only be agreed if both countries are satisfied with the outcome.</p>  <p>  As an OECD member country, Ireland's treaties are typically based on the OECD Model Treaty.  However, in any of our treaties negotiated with developing countries, the final treaty contains a mix of OECD Model and UN Model Treaty provisions, which are considered favourable to developing countries.  Both countries must be happy that a proposed treaty strikes an appropriate balance for it to be agreed.</p>  <p>  Very positive efforts have been made by Ireland in recent years in the area of tax treaties and developing countries.  The Department of Finance commissioned the IBFD to undertake a spillover analysis to look at the possible effects of the Irish tax system on Developing Economies.  The Report was published on Budget Day in October 2015 and is available on the Department's website.  Ireland is only the second country in the world to undertake such a spillover analysis and I have consistently called on all countries to undertake a similar analysis.</p>  <p>  Some points of concern in relation to our treaties with Zambia and Pakistan were noted in the spillover analysis.  Those treaties were two of Ireland's oldest double taxation agreements and were both already under re-negotiation when the study started.  They have now been renegotiated and the new treaties were signed and ratified by Ireland in 2015.</p>  <p>  I note the publication of the report 'Survival of the Richest' by a number of civil society organisations.  The report also references a previous report by ActionAid which had included in its analysis those older tax treaties which have been replaced.  It is unclear exactly which Irish tax treaties were included in the analysis in this new report and the inclusion, for example, of treaties which have been replaced would clearly distort any analysis.  As the report has just been published, my Department intends to seek further information from the authors of the report providing further clarity on the analysis.</p></reply>

Ireland does not do "deals" with taxpayers.  Our tax system is founded on the strict application of the law, as enacted by the Oireachtas, without exception.</p>  <p>  Revenue do not issue unilateral Advance Pricing Agreements.  The Apple case concerns two advance opinions issued by Revenue in 1991 and 2007.</p>  <p>  Revenue has published detailed guidelines on the provision of tax opinions which are available on Revenue's website at www.Revenue.ie.  While it is open to any taxpayer to seek an opinion from Revenue on the tax treatment of a particular transaction or activity, the circumstances in which a taxpayer should require an opinion from Revenue are relatively limited.  This is because Revenue already publishes extensive detailed information on the application of tax legislation in various tax briefings and guidelines which are available on the Revenue website.</p>  <p>  An opinion will be provided by Revenue where the issues are complex, information is not readily available or there is genuine uncertainty in relation to the applicable tax rules as set down in the legislation.  An opinion will provide Revenue's view of the correct application of tax law to a particular transaction or situation so that the taxpayer can file a correct tax return as required under the legislation.</p>  <p>  In no case has Revenue the authority or discretion to depart from the applicable rules as set out in tax law.</p>  <p>  In relation to Advanced Pricing Agreements more generally, I would highlight that they are a standard feature of the international tax system.  Taxpayers can seek such an agreement where they want certainty that they are correctly applying transfer pricing rules.  One of the recommendations from the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project was that countries should implement bilateral APA programmes to provide greater certainty in relation to the taxation of cross-border transactions.  Acting on this OECD recommendation, Revenue introduced a formal bilateral Advance Pricing Agreement programme and the guidance on how the programme is operated is available on the Revenue website.  As I have already mentioned, Revenue do not issue unilateral Advance Pricing Agreement so such agreements will only be issued if the tax authorities in both countries impacted by a transaction are satisfied that the correct pricing is being applied.</p>  <p>   At EU level, Member States have agreed a Directive to require the automatic exchange of both tax opinions or 'rulings' and Advanced Pricing Agreements between tax authorities in Member States.  I was an enthusiastic supporter of this Directive.  I expect to have completed the transposition of this Directive into Irish law  through a combination of Regulations and Finance Bill changes by the end of this year.</p></reply>

I would clarify that while Revenue may issue non-binding advisory opinions in certain circumstances and may make determinations in respect of certain VAT matters, Revenue does not issue &quot;letters of comfort&quot;.  </p><p>There has been a focus on tax opinions, or 'rulings' as they are sometimes called, over the last number of years, in particular as a result of the European Commission State aid investigations in a number of countries.  Ireland does not have a statutory system of binding tax 'rulings' and there is no provision in Irish law for the issuing of such rulings.</p><p>Revenue may provide non-binding opinions on the application of tax law to specific transactions or situations.  The provision of such opinions comes within the general administrative functions vested in Revenue under tax legislation.  While it is open to any taxpayer to seek an opinion from Revenue on the tax treatment of a particular transaction or activity, the circumstances in which a taxpayer should require an opinion from Revenue are relatively limited.  This is because Revenue already publishes extensive detailed information, on the application of tax legislation, in various tax briefings and guidelines which are available on the Revenue website.  Revenue has published detailed guidelines on the provision of tax opinions, which are also available on the Revenue website.  Guidelines relating to opinions for cases dealt with by Revenue's Large Cases Division (LCD) are available on <i>www.revenue.ie</i>under &quot;[37.0.40] Large Cases Division: Opinions/Confirmations on Tax/Duty Consequences of a Proposed Course of Action&quot;.  Guidelines relating to requests for opinions submitted for non-LCD cases through the Revenue Technical Service (RTS) are available on<i>www.revenue.ie</i>under &quot;Guidelines on Revenue's Service to Practitioners and Business Taxpayers&quot;.</p><p>An opinion will be provided by Revenue where the issues are complex, information is not readily available or there is genuine uncertainty in relation to the application of the tax rules as set down in the legislation.</p><p>An opinion will provide Revenue's view of the correct application of tax law to a particular transaction or situation and will assist the taxpayer in filing a correct tax return as required under the legislation.  In no case has Revenue the authority or discretion to depart from the applicable rules as set out in tax law. </p><p>In addition to providing opinions, Revenue may make determinations on certain VAT matters such as the appropriate rate of VAT that applies to a particular supply of goods or services or on whether a particular activity is exempt from VAT.  Information on the circumstances in which such determinations are made and the process is available at <i>.</i></p><p>Statistics have not been compiled on the number of tax opinions issued by Revenue and determinations made by Revenue in relation to certain VAT matters each year.  However, in responding to the European Commission enquiries in relation to tax ruling practice in the various Member States, Revenue identified that, in the period 2010 to 2012, the total number of opinions issued to companies on various matters relating to corporation tax was as follows: <table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Total</th></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>99</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>128</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>108</td></tr></table></p><p>To facilitate accountability Revenue has committed to publishing in its future Annual Reports the number of opinions it issues each year.  Where Revenue makes a determination in respect of a VAT matter, that determination may be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il.  </i></p><p>On 7 September 2016 I confirmed in the D&aacute;il that Revenue would be amending its guidance and instructions to provide that tax opinions will not remain valid beyond five years without a full review.  </p><p>I am informed by Revenue that it has updated its guidance to confirm that opinions issued to taxpayers will remain valid for a maximum period of five years.  Previously the maximum period was seven years.  However, depending on the particular circumstances, a shorter period than five years may be specified.  After the maximum validity period, whether five years or less, an application for a renewal or extension must be made if the taxpayer wishes for the opinion to continue.  It has always been the case that an opinion will only remain valid for so long as the facts and circumstances on which it is based continue to exist and the relevant legislation and practice remains in place.</p><p>Revenue has also confirmed that it has begun reviewing a number of opinions that were provided more than five years ago.</p></reply>

The consultation invited submissions from interested parties on possible measures to address the loss to the Exchequer that may arise under arrangements (i) where an individual, who would otherwise be an employee, establishes a company to provide his or her services, and (ii) where an individual, who is dependent on, and under the control of, a single employer in the same manner as an employee, is classified as a self-employed individual.  Twenty-three submissions were received.  </p>  <p>  As we discussed during the Finance Bill 2016 debates recently in the D&aacute;il, a report on the consultation is being been finalised by a working group of officials.  Once the report has reached me, and my colleague the current Minister for Social Protection, we will consider its contents and then I expect we will publish it.

In Section 52 of the Bill, I have provided for an amendment to section 86 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, the section that provides an exemption from capital acquisitions tax on the inheritance or gift of a dwelling house in certain circumstances.  I consider that this particular relief has lost focus since its introduction because of changes made to how it operates over the years.  The purpose of my amendment is to realign the exemption with its original policy objective i.e. to alleviate the hardship of an inheritance tax liability for a person who inherited a house in which he or she had been living with the deceased and to ensure that the person did not have to sell the house to pay the tax liability.  The changes I have proposed will have two principal effects. </p>  <p>  Firstly, the dwelling house exemption will only be available for inheritances.  With one exception, it will no longer be possible to receive a tax-free gift of a dwelling house.  The exception will be where a person gifts a dwelling house to a dependent relative.  For this purpose, a dependent relative is a direct relative of the donor, or of the donor's spouse or civil partner, who is permanently and totally incapacitated because of physical or mental infirmity from maintaining himself or herself or who is over the age of 65. </p>  <p>  Secondly, the inherited dwelling house must have been the deceased person's principal private residence at the date of his or her death.  This requirement will be relaxed in situations where the deceased person had to leave the house before the date of death because of ill health; for example, to live in a nursing home.</p>  <p>  If my amendment is accepted by the Oireachtas and enacted in the Finance Bill, it will take effect from the date of enactment.  There will not be any provision for transitional arrangements for those people who may have already acquired a dwelling house for another person to live in with the intention of making a gift of the house to that person when the required three-year period of occupation comes to an end.  As the provision was intended to alleviate hardship it is not my intention to delay the introduction of the new arrangements to facilitate individuals who intended to make use of the previous arrangements to avoid tax.</p></reply>

In 2016 a total of 1,320 students sat an examination in the subject. </p><p>Like its Junior Certificate equivalent, it is a broadly-based course of study focusing on the value of religious belief and on diversity and mutual respect and is of particular relevance for national and global citizenship.  The subject calls on the student to explore issues such as meaning and value, the nature of morality, the development and diversity of belief, the principles of a just society, and the implications of scientific progress.</p><p>Both courses are designed to be experienced as educationally valuable and coherent programmes, independent of the dominant beliefs in the learning environment.</p></reply>

Schools need to prepare for situations where a majority of students may wish to withdraw and where religious instruction and worship may be required only by a minority. </p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which passed second stage on the 17<sup>th</sup>November 2016, also includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school's arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction. </p><p>I believe this is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p><p>On 5 December 2016, I published the General Scheme of an Education (Parent and Student Charter) Bill 2016.  The Government have approved the draft outline of a new law, which will require every school to consult with parents and students, and publish and operate a Parent and Student Charter.</p><p>The Parents and Students Charter Bill essentially deals with how schools communicate with parents and will provide a greater opportunity for dealing with such issues.</p><p>The publication of this draft legislation will fulfil a key commitment in the Action Plan for Education to improve information and complaint procedures for parents and students relating to schools.</p><p>The draft legislation defines the principles that will guide how schools will engage with students and parents.  Some of the issues which schools will be required to deal with under the charter include:</p><p>-  Inviting feedback from students and parents and</p><p>-  Providing better information about School Management and School Policies.</p><p>Following consultation with our education partners, including the National Parents Council (Primary), National Parents Council (Post Primary) and the Irish Second-level Students Union, I will finalise national guidelines on a Parent and Student Charter.</p><p>The draft Bill will now go to the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Skills for pre-legislative scrutiny.</p></reply>

Other options include a predominantly State-funded system or a State-funded system supplemented with continuing student fees. </p>  <p>  As committed to in the Programme for Government, I have referred the report to the Oireachtas Education Committee and this engagement will form part of the process for formulating a plan for the future funding of the sector.  I do not want to pre-empt the work of the Committee, however, I look forward to working with it as it analyses all of the options put forward by the Expert Group and hears the voice of all stakeholders.</p>  <p>  While Cassells deals with the medium and long term funding needs of higher education we also have to consider the immediate challenges and in that context I am pleased that we placed a particular focus on this area in Budget 2017.  I secured additional funding for the sector for the first time in recent years.  In 2017 an additional &euro;36.5 million will be made available with &euro;160 million additional over the next three years.  This will allow the sector keep pace with demographic increases and introduce targeted initiatives in areas such as disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning.  Among those who will benefit from the additional third level funding being made available are, students from disadvantaged backgrounds, lone parents and Travellers.</p>  <p>  In Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.  This review will be undertaken as part of the overall response to meeting the anticipated skills needs in the economy over the coming years, in line with the policy framework set out in the National Skills Strategy.</p>  <p>  This review will include an analysis of the business case for enhanced investment in the higher and further education and training sectors.  In this context it will identify key elements of the new funding model and of the expected impacts including those on employers.  The review will include consultation with stakeholders. </p>  <p>  The policy review will be published by the end of April 2017, and will complement the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p></reply>

Funding for 2017 will support 179,000 full-time enrolments, provision for expansion in apprenticeship, provision to implement the new International Education Strategy and increase the value of the sector by &euro;500million per year and attract 37,000 additional students by 2020. </p>  <p>  In addition, in Budget 2017 the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and I, announced a policy review with the aim of designing and implementing a sustainable and predictable multi-annual funding model for higher and further education and training involving increased Employer and Exchequer contributions from 2018.

The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes. Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings.  The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years. </p>  <p>  In the current year the issue of this limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council.  Having considered the matter in detail and taking into account all circumstances both the union and management partners considered that their preferred option is to retain the existing scheme as set out in the published circular.</p>  <p>  Available teaching posts are to be filled by redeployment, in the first instance, in accordance with the redeployment schemes or by the agreed recruitment and appointment procedures as published in Governance Manual for Primary Schools 2015 &ndash; 2019.</p></reply>

Similar variations, but not quite of the same magnitude, also apply in respect of commercial development. </p>  <p>  Section 49 of the 2000 Act provides for the application of supplementary development contributions in respect of ancillary public infrastructure or projects benefitting developments in specific areas. Such supplementary development contributions are generally applied in respect of the provision of large-scale infrastructure such as road projects, connections to motorways and light rail facilities servicing specific developments. </p>  <p>  Details of the development contribution schemes applied by local authorities are published on their respective websites, and include therein the detailed statistical information requested.   It is not possible to itemise the requested information into tabular form as differing development contribution charging regimes are applied by local authorities ,   depending on local circumstances in terms of the charges applied per square metre of residential and commercial development or for different classes of infrastructure development. </p></reply>

This is intended to provide greater certainty for developers and facilitating the earlier provision of increased housing supply and helping to address the current housing supply shortage situation.</p><p>Under the new arrangements, the local planning authority will retain a major role in the planning process for large housing developments, with a statutory input into both the pre-planning application consultations conducted with the developer and the subsequent examination by the Board of the substantive planning application, in terms of advising whether or not the proposed development is broadly in compliance with the development plan or local area plan and is serviced by necessary supporting infrastructure .</p><p>Furthermore, members of the public will continue to be able to make submissions to the Board about applications for large housing developments in the same manner as currently applies in respect of planning applications submitted to the local planning authority or appealed to the Board.</p><p>In relation to the rental sector, the Bill proposes amendments to the Residential Tenancies Acts.  One of the most significant proposals provides that, where a landlord proposes to sell multiple units within a single multi-unit development at the same time, the sale will be subject to the existing tenants remaining <i>in situ.</i>The purpose of this provision is to prevent a future recurrence of situations where numbers of residents in a single development have had their tenancies terminated simultaneously  . </p><p>The Bill further improves security of tenure for tenants by providing for the abolition of a landlord&rsquo;s right, during the first 6 months of a further Part 4 tenancy, to terminate that tenancy for no stated ground.  This is an important amendment and one that has been welcomed both by those working with tenants and those working to prevent homelessness.  It also provides for a number of other early actions which will enhance the Residential Tenancies Board&rsquo;s enforcement and dispute resolution powers, including accelerated dispute resolution timeframes.</p><p>As committed to in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, the provisions in the Bill will be supplemented by a new Rental Strategy, which I am launching today with a view to delivering a mature and stable rental sector, providing a balance between the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants. </p></reply>

In broad terms, the Government does not believe that acquisition, compulsory or otherwise, of significant levels of additional land for public housing building programmes is required at this time and considers that local authorities have sufficient lands upon which to deliver the commitments under <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, including the delivery of 47,000 additional social housing units between now and 2021 through a number of means as part of an overall Exchequer commitment of &euro;5.35 billion.</p><p>In addition, the active pursuit of progressing housing developments on State-owned lands, including local authority lands, is a major part of the new approach to housing provision under <i>Rebuilding Ireland &ndash; Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>.  This involves identifying and mapping sites in local authority and public ownership with appropriate lands to be master-planned to deliver increased mixed-tenure housing, including social and more affordable housing.  Overall, between the Land Aggregation Scheme sites and Local Authority lands approximately 700 sites in total have been identified, which are referenced on page 50 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>, in the context of the potential for mixed-tenure development on State-owned and other lands.  These sites are being mapped in detail and in accordance with the timelines outlined in <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>and the Housing Agency is preparing a Strategic Management Plan for all 73 Land Aggregation Scheme sites which will be completed in Quarter 1 2017.  </p><p>My Department has already written to all key Departments and State Agencies and to relevant local authorities to gather information and assess further prospective sites in State ownership to be mapped on an effective and easy-to-use database of publically owned lands, suitable for housing, collated in one location.  This work will provide a further indication of the extent of the sites available that may be suitable for housing, in particular in areas of highest need. </p><p>During this data gathering phase, a number of early actions have already been undertaken by local authorities and the Housing Agency to progress housing development on sites in public ownership, particularly in areas of high housing demand.  One such proposal was announced by South Dublin County Council at the recent launch event for Pillar 3 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>in relation to a local authority owned site with the potential to yield almost 1,000 new homes in Kilcarberry, Clondalkin.  I expect further proposals to be brought forward by other local authorities in the coming months.</p></reply>

A range of measures are being progressed in this regard under the <i>Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness</i>which was launched in July 2016 and provides a multi-stranded, action-oriented approach to achieving the Government&rsquo;s key housing objectives, including tackling homelessness in a comprehensive manner.  <i>Rebuilding Ireland</i>fully recognises that the period of time that families spend in emergency hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation should be minimised.</p><p>This is reflected in the commitment that by mid-2017, hotels should only be used in limited circumstances for emergency accommodation for families.  It is intended that this will be achieved by meeting their housing needs through the enhanced Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme and general housing allocations, and by providing new supply to be delivered through an expanded Rapid Build Housing Programme and a Housing Agency initiative to acquire vacant houses. </p></reply>

The &euro;200m Fund will be composed of an Exchequer allocation of &euro;150 million, matched by a &euro;50 million contribution from participating local authorities.</p>  <p>  A call for proposals under the fund was issued to local authorities on 26 August 2016, with a closing date for receipt of proposals of 14 October . It was open to all local authorities to apply, with funding to be allocated on the basis of a competitive bid process. Twenty-one local authorities have submitted a total of 74 project applications, relating to specific sites or development land areas. Limerick City and County Council submitted a proposal in relation to Greenpark which includes the former Limerick racecourse. </p>  <p>  The overall total cost of the 74 funding bid applications is approximately &euro;800m, with funding of some &euro;600 million being sought from the Exchequer and local authorities agreeing to fund approximately &euro;200 million as part of their matching fund requirements.  It will not be possible to approve all applications, given the scale and value of applications received. </p>  <p>  The viability of the applications is currently being examined in detail against the assessment criteria set out in the Call for Proposals, with a focus on the level of funding required and what it might leverage, the number of housing units that could be delivered, their strategic location and speed of delivery, and affordability levels of a proportion of the homes.  I intend to make an initial announcement on progress on the assessment of the proposals before the end of the year. </p></reply>

Moreover, I am confident that the draft Planning Scheme, to be considered fully by the members of Dublin City Council, will enable significant delivery of all housing types, including housing that is intrinsically affordable for the broad range of households likely to settle in the area, including low- and middle-income earners seeking properties to rent or buy.   </p>  <p>  I urge all interested stakeholders to engage with the Planning Scheme process within the statutory framework laid out in the Planning Act. </p></reply>

The overall strategic objective of Government housing policy is to enable all households to access good quality housing appropriate to their household circumstances and in sustainable communities of their choice.  The main focus of social housing supports is on meeting the most acute housing needs among the population, within the resources available.  Thus, State- funded housing supports will continue to be targeted at those people who are unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources, as measured by their annual net income.</p>  <p>  To support the implementation of Rebuilding Ireland: Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, I have secured &euro;5.35 billion in Exchequer investment to deliver 47,000 social housing units through build, refurbishment, acquisitions and leasing, over the period 2016 to 2021.  This &euro;5.35 billion investment comprises some &euro;4.5 billion in capital funding and &euro;844 million in support of programmes funded from current expenditure.  In addition, &euro;200 million is being provided for the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund through investment in key enabling infrastructure.</p>  <p>  Under Budget 2017, some &euro;1.3bn will be invested across the broad range of housing programmes next year, including those covered by the Rebuilding Ireland investment programme.  The annual allocations for the years 2018 to 2021 will be finalised in the context of the annual budgetary process.</p>  <p>  My Department monitors the impact of Non-Mortgage borrowing by local authorities on the General Government Balance (GGB) on an on-going basis.  While there is a requirement for the overall borrowing of the local government sector to remain within the GGB parameters, should there be a requirement to borrow for social housing purposes, my Department will consider any sanction request in the context of supporting priority infrastructural investment, meeting contractual commitments and ensuring appropriate projects can proceed.  Borrowing is a reserved function of each local authority; a local authority must demonstrate that any borrowing is matched by appropriate repayment capacity.  However, given the funding being made available through Rebuilding Ireland, I am satisfied that sufficient capital funding is being made available to local authorities  for social housing. </p></reply>

The Report of the Pyrite Panel  (June 2012) provided the overarching framework for the pyrite remediation scheme and its eligibility criteria are broadly reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of that report.  The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated unless or until they exhibit significant pyritic damage.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.</p><p>The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2.  Dwellings which do not have a Damage Condition Rating of 2 are not eligible to apply under the scheme.  I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion nor do I propose to review the scheme in this regard.</p><p>Given that the scheme does not apply to dwellings which have a Damage Condition Rating of 1, the Pyrite Resolution Board does not maintain records on the number of properties that fall into this category.  Nevertheless, the Board is aware that 10 dwellings, which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their building condition assessments were first completed, and which were refused under the scheme, have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme following the submission of new applications.</p></reply>

It is a matter for local authorities, when assessing individual households, to consider whether rents payable are in accordance with the authority&rsquo;s rent scheme.  Therefore, decisions on whether or not to disregard either a proportion of income or particular sources of income for the purposes of calculating rents are matters for each individual local authority to consider in accordance with their own rent scheme.</p>  <p>  Section 31 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 allows the Minister to make regulations in respect of various matters to be included in a rent scheme.  These can include the sources of household income that may be assessed for the purpose of determining rent levels.</p>  <p>  Considerable work has been carried out by my Department in developing a draft framework for a harmonisation of the approach to be taken by local authorities in regard to various aspects of rent schemes.  This includes providing for a common set of income disregards to be applied by all housing authorities in determining a household&rsquo;s assessable income for rent calculation purposes.</p>  <p>  These proposals are now being examined further in the light of the broader commitment given in the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness, to review the disparate systems of differential rents for social housing in place across local authorities to ensure that housing supports are fair and sustainable, prioritise those on lowest incomes and avoid creating social welfare traps that may prevent people from either returning to work or to the private housing market.  This review will be completed by the end of the second Quarter 2017.   </p></reply>

As part of the implementation of this decision the original proposal to designate the then Department of Environment, Community and Local Government&rsquo;s Wexford office as Headquarters was rescinded.  The reconfiguration of my Department in 2011 and again earlier this year has resulted in a number of reviews and restructurings of divisions and sections generally, including the further expansion of the Housing function and the creation of new sections to support delivery of this important priority for Government.  These restructurings have resulted in the movement of pieces of work between the Department's three locations in some cases but no entire unit has been re-centralised back to Dublin as a result.   </p></reply>

As the nature of our business changes, the organisation must adapt and structure itself in the most efficient way for effective service delivery.  Functions move between locations in the Department to deal with business efficiencies.  </p>  <p>  A number of elements of the Communications and Customer Services functions are being brought together within a new unit in Dublin.  One of the consequences of this reorganisation is that over the coming months 25 staff in the information section Sligo will transition to other important roles in the area. Government approval is not required for such internal reorganisations.</p>  <p>  Sligo is a key location for Departments Services with 654 staff located there.  The Department's office in College Road in Sligo administers national schemes including State and other Pensions, Household Benefits, the School Meals Programme and Supplementary Welfare Allowance Policy.  Since 2013 the Department's office in College Road has taken on all of the following additional functions - administering the deduction at source facility from welfare benefits for Local Property Tax, payments to the women under the Magdalen Commission Scheme and the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA).  The administration of the BSCFA in Sligo, since 2015, involves the recruitment of some 50 staff, mainly local, for a period of up to 6 months.  More recently payment of the Water Conservation Grant was administered from the Sligo Offices.  The Department also has an Intreo Centre in Sligo, located at Cranmore Road.</p>  <p>   The change to Information section location is in no way a diminution in the Department&rsquo;s regional office structure; 65% of the Department&rsquo;s 6,300 staff are located outside of Dublin.  Sligo was among the first locations within the Department selected for decentralisation, with 450 posts earmarked to decentralise to Sligo in 1989.  A further seven successful decentralisation initiatives have followed, with staff and schemes areas administered from Letterkenny, Buncrana, Roscommon, Longford, Dundalk and Waterford.</p>  <p>  Within the Department, the movement of staff between roles is ongoing and actively managed to allow the Department respond to changing demands while promoting staff development and better succession planning. Such moves, including the movement of staff from Information Section to other business areas, are supported where necessary by the provision of training and other supports.  Other than such costs, the staff changes mentioned will incur no additional cost to the Exchequer.  The transfer of staff between locations, whether by way of internal or external transfer lists or redeployment will continue to take place in accordance with all relevant agreements.</p></reply>

While communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fishermen, participants also have the opportunity to improve existing skills, or develop new skills, while performing valuable work in their local communities.  Since it was introduced in 2004, community groups have benefitted from the many projects undertaken through the scheme with minimal cost to the Exchequer.  It has also played an important role in sustaining rural communities.  </p>  <p>  As part of the social welfare budget package for 2017, I announced an increase of &euro;5 a week in the personal rate of payment for RSS participants from March 2017.  I also announced an additional 500 places on the scheme to be rolled out in 2017 which will increase the overall number to 3,100.  My Department intends allocating these places as early as possible in 2017, taking into account a number of factors.  These include the number of places already allocated, the demand for places in particular areas, work opportunities available and the numbers of farmers and fishermen and women in receipt of income support.  In allocating the additional places, the Government recognises the valuable contribution the RSS is making to the provision of services to communities across Ireland.</p>  <p>  Eligibility for participation on the scheme will continue to be limited to those in receipt of certain specified social welfare payments and all participants must be also actively engaged in farming or fishing.  In future, all new entrants to the RSS will have to be over 25 years of age.  I believe this is appropriate as it will give younger people an opportunity to explore other training or education options before entering a long-term work programme.</p>  <p>  In addition, a 6 year overall participation limit will be introduced on the scheme.  This will ensure that there will be a throughput of places available.  In this context, the Deputy should note that almost 50% of the current participants have been on the RSS for over 10 years so opportunities for new people to go on the scheme are limited.  It should also be remembered that income support will still be available to eligible farmers and fishermen in the form of Farm or Fish Assist. </p>  <p>  Existing RSS participants will remain on the scheme as long as they continue to satisfy the eligibility conditions of the scheme.  The new conditions outlined above will only apply to new RSS entrants.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It is a condition for receipt of a CA that the person being cared for must have a disability whose effect is that they require full-time care and attention. This is defined as requiring from another person, continual supervision and frequent assistance throughout the day in connection with normal bodily functions or continuous supervision in order to avoid danger to him or herself and likely to require that level of care for at least twelve months.</p>  <p>  The evidence submitted in support of this application was examined and the deciding officer decided that this evidence did not indicate that the requirement for full-time care was satisfied in respect of both of the care recipients concerned.  The person concerned was notified on 29 September 2016 of this decision, the reason for it and of her right of review and appeal. </p>  <p>  Subsequently, the person concerned requested a review of this decision and submitted additional evidence in support of her application in respect of both care recipients.  The review now has been completed and the outcome is that CA is awarded to the person concerned in respect of one of the care recipients but, in the case of the second care recipient, the original decision to disallow has been confirmed.  The person concerned has been notified of these decisions and of her right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office. </p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In addition to providing this income support the Department also provides employment services and supports to unemployed jobseekers and expects jobseekers who are in receipt of a payment to engage with these services in order to improve their prospects of securing employment and achieving financial self-sufficiency. </p>  <p>  This approach is in line with the principle of &lsquo;rights and responsibilities&rsquo; whereby an unemployed jobseeker has a right to receive income and employment supports from the State but also has a responsibility to engage with those State service if requested to do so.  All jobseekers acknowledge this responsibility in writing when they claim a jobseeker payment. </p>  <p>  Failure of a jobseeker to engage, without good cause, with the Department&rsquo;s employment services can have consequences for the jobseeker&rsquo;s payments.  Legislation provides that a Department deciding officer can apply a reduced payment in such circumstances. </p>  <p>  The process of applying a penalty rate includes written and verbal warnings and an opportunity for the jobseeker to re-engage with the services prior to the application of a reduced payment rate.  The number of penalty rates applied from 1 January 2016 to 4 December 2016 was 10,428.  Reductions in payments due to penalty rates are not recorded or considered as control savings.  Therefore, a savings figure is not available.</p>  <p>  However, on the basis that there are 1,100 &ndash; 1,300 penalty rates of payment in force at any one time, the weekly reduction in payments is estimated at circa &euro;48,000 - &euro;57,000 or approximately &euro;2.5m - &euro;3m per annum.  It should be noted that the application of penalty rates of payment can be appealed and payments reinstated with refunds.</p>  <p>  The length of time involved in the application of each penalty rate varies from case to case, depending on individual circumstances.  The average administrative cost of the application of a penalty rate has been estimated at &euro;19.73.</p>  <p>  This calculation is based on the assumption that the decisions are made at Executive Officer level and that the process takes an hour on average, including the meeting at which a verbal warning is given, the decision to apply and the application of the penalty rate.</p></reply>

The first is the school meals local projects scheme through which funding is provided directly to participating schools and local and voluntary community groups who run their own school meals projects.  The second scheme is the urban school meals scheme which is operated by local authorities and part-financed by my Department.  </p><p>The school in question has participated in the school meals local projects scheme since 2002 providing a breakfast and a homework club up to and including the last academic year.  For the current academic year the school applied to run a breakfast and a lunch club and their application has been approved.  The application was received on 5 December 2016 and funding for the current academic year has been significantly increased over that in the previous year from some &euro;11,500 to &euro;43,000. </p><p>Department officials have been advised that the hot meals supplied previously by the school were supplied by Dublin City Council and was administered with the aid of community employment (CE) staff.</p><p>Schools are not permitted to sponsor CE schemes and CE participants cannot be employed by schools to work in areas that are directly related to the schools.

In late October 2016, my Department was advised that the Sponsor Board of the CE scheme had decided to withdraw the final CE Participant from the School.

There are currently 3,400 in receipt of the diet supplement.</p>  <p>  Following the outcome of a review of the costs of healthy eating and specialised diets by the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute commissioned by the Department during 2013, the scheme has been closed to new applicants from 1 February 2014.  The research showed that the average costs of the diets supplemented under the scheme could be met from within one third of the current rate of personal social welfare payments.  A decision was taken to allow existing recipients to continue to receive the diet supplement at the current rate of payment for as long as they continue to have an entitlement to the scheme or until their circumstances change.  This measure ensured that nobody was immediately worse off by the closure of the scheme.  I have no plans to re-instate this allowance. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should be aware that in cases of particular hardship that may present, officials in my Department have the legislative power to award a payment under the SWA scheme in cases of exceptional need. </p>  <p>  In reviewing a person&rsquo;s continued entitlement to diet supplement, both medical and financial need must be established.  This can be established by producing the appropriate medical evidence.  However, if a permanent need for the diet was originally established no further medical evidence is required and the review is concerned with financial means only.</p>  <p>  In relation to verification of financial means, documentation required on review of diet supplement can include bank statements, payslips, certified accounts, stocks, shares or any other document that shows proof of means. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

JobPath supplements the internal case management capacity of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and the Local Employment Service.  Over the past year, this additional capacity has enabled the Department to provide an intensive employment support and advisory service to over 60,000 long-term unemployed jobseekers who would otherwise not have received such a service.  JobPath aims to place people into full-time sustainable employment.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time they receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment and, if a person is placed into a job, they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment.  The JobPath service was rolled out on a phased basis from mid-2015.  Data in respect of the first groups who have completed their engagement period is currently being compiled and is expected to be available shortly.</p><p>Community Employment (CE) and T&uacute;s are both employment programmes funded by my Department.

The work undertaken is primarily to support local service provision via community, voluntary and not-for-profit organisations, provided that this does not displace existing service provision or employment. </p>  <p>  In order to retain eligibility for participation on the RSS, participants must continue to be actively farming/fishing and retain entitlement to the underlying qualifying DSP payment.  An eligible farmer must also have a valid herd number.  Participation is by voluntary self-selection and is dependent on the availability of vacancies in the relevant locality. </p>  <p>  Eligible RSS participants are offered contracts of one year&rsquo;s duration.  Contracts are reviewed annually subject to participants continuing to satisfy the underlying criteria for the scheme and subject to local demands. </p>  <p>  There are provisions under the scheme for an eligible applicant to use a herd number belonging to a spouse, parent or a sibling provided they satisfy the other conditions of the scheme, including being actively farming.  There are no provisions under the scheme for a son to pass his herd number to his father for the purposes of participation on the scheme and there are no plans to change these rules and conditions.  This is to ensure that access to limited places is available for those who need it most.  </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that there is significant demand for places on the RSS and only people who satisfy the conditions can be considered for participation.  </p>  <p>  As part of Budget 2017, I announced an additional 500 places on the RSS and I plan on allocating these early in the New Year.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The trust deeds and rules of a scheme differ from one to another and, as with any contractual situation, reflect the level of obligation on the parties involved.  While the Pensions Act provides a framework for the regulation and supervision of occupational pension schemes, it does not impose any requirement on an employer to fund scheme benefits or maintain an existing scheme. </p><p>These matters have been considered many times during comprehensive reviews of the pensions system in Ireland.  The introduction of a debt on employer would raise a range of issues and possible consequences for defined benefit schemes, some of which may not be beneficial for members.  </p><p>It is not clear whether a change in the law could be applied to existing Schemes as well as new ones and it is not clear that any change in the law could apply to deficits already accrued as opposed to future ones.</p><p>There are strong arguments both for and against the introduction of an employer obligation.  While such an obligation may seem to provide stability and certainty for scheme members it may result in less desirable outcomes such as:</p><p>- prompting well-funded schemes to wind up to avoid the new obligations being imposed thus making the change in the law counterproductive;</p><p>- threatening the company's financial stability and in some circumstances rendering employers insolvent thus resulting in the loss of job or a diminution in pay, terms and conditions of employees;</p><p>- impacting on the company's creditors, including debts owed to other businesses, SMEs, and/or individuals impacting on the company's shareholders and share values, many of which may be held by other pension funds, credit unions or small scale investors;</p><p>- impacting on company debt, investment and growth and the employers' ability to raise funds, to expand or create new employment;</p><p>- giving a competitive advantage to employers who never provided a pension and those with 'risk-free' defined contribution schemes.</p><p>I would like to assure the Deputy that the issues in relation to defined benefit schemes are continuously scrutinised by the Department, especially in the present environment.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the issue for the Deputy.</p></reply>

She was refused IP on the grounds that the medical conditions for the scheme were not satisfied.  She was notified on the 11 November 2016 of this decision, the reasons for it and of her right of review and appeal.  The lady concerned requested an appeal of this decision and submitted further medical evidence in support of her request.  Following a review of all the information available the DO is now satisfied that the medical conditions for the scheme are satisfied.</p>  <p>  The lady concerned has been awarded invalidity pension with effect from the 11 August 2016.  Payment will issue to her nominated bank account on the 15 December 2016.  Any arrears due from 11 August 2016 to 14 December 2016 (less any overlapping social welfare payment and/or outstanding overpayment) will issue in due course.

Each participant is assigned to a personal adviser who assesses a person's skills, experience, challenges and work goals.  The personal adviser works with the jobseeker to agree a personal progression plan that includes a schedule of activities, actions and job focused targets.  Participants receive the JobPath service for a period of 12 months (which can be extended by up to six months to facilitate the jobseeker completing training programmes) or until such time as they find employment whichever is the sooner.  If the jobseeker secures employment during this period they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to twelve months while in employment.</p>  <p>  Participants must attend the JobPath offices to engage with the service but there is nothing to prevent a person from searching for jobs from their own home or elsewhere.  The JobPath companies offer expert job application advice and assistance on an individual basis so attendance at a JobPath office provides a better opportunity for a person to secure suitable employment.</p>  <p>  The JobPath companies take account of individual circumstances and can structure appointments to accommodate such things as child care and may, on a case by case basis, provide financial support towards childcare costs.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

JobPath aims to place people into full-time sustainable employment.  The period of engagement with the service for any individual is typically 52 weeks.  During that time they receive intensive individual support to help them to overcome barriers to employment and if a person is placed into a job they will continue to receive support for at least three months and up to an additional twelve months while in employment. </p>  <p>  Some 62,000 jobseekers have engaged with the service to date.  The JobPath service was rolled out on a phased basis from mid-2015. Job placement data in respect of the first groups who have recently completed their engagement period are currently being compiled and are expected to be available shortly. Payments to the JobPath companies amounted to &euro;1.2m in 2015 and &euro;25.2m in 2016.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Over 1,200 loans were drawn down under the Scheme during the pilot with an overall value of over &euro;720,000.</p><p>The <i>Programme for a Partnership Government</i>provides for the rollout and extension of the Personal Micro Credit Scheme.  Following an evaluation of the pilot, an Implementation Group, which is chaired by my Department and comprises all relevant stakeholders, is working towards this aim. </p><p>While the pilot scheme was targeted towards social welfare customers with access to the Household Budgeting facility operated by An Post, the scheme has now also been extended to social welfare recipients who receive their payment electronically into accounts in financial institutions, provided the loan repayments are made by direct debit or standing order to the credit union.  </p><p>Incremental progress is being made towards extending the geographical coverage of the Personal Micro Credit Scheme through efforts to recruit Credit Unions to participate in the scheme.</p><p>Accordingly, 94 Credit Unions have signed up to participate in the scheme, resulting in the availability of the <i>It Makes Sense </i>loan in over 170 local Credit Union offices.  Not all of the 94 are currently offering the loan.  Seventeen (17) Credit Unions have decided not to offer loans under the scheme until the New Year for a number of reasons, including mergers, training requirements and internal resource constraints.  A small number (4) have placed a limit on the number of loans available under the Scheme due to the high level of demand and the additional administrative work associated with setting up payment through the Household Budgeting facility.  In addition, in order for Credit Unions to be guaranteed payments coming through the Household Budgeting facility, applications had to be submitted by 12 December to allow for the timely transfer of loan repayment from An Post to the relevant Credit Union.</p><p>Each Credit Union is an independent entity and the approach taken to implementation of the scheme is a matter for each Credit Union Board, at local level.  Credit Unions which have signed up to participate are committed to making the PMC scheme a success, building on the experience of the pilot and working towards broadening the reach of the scheme.  However, as Credit Unions are bearing all of the risk, a cautious approach is being taken, in order to ensure that the scheme is sustainable in the longer term.</p><p>The list of participating Credit Unions is updated regularly on the website for the <i>It Makes Sense</i>loan scheme at <i>www.itmakessenseloan.ie/participating-credit-unions</i>and on the <i>It Makes Sense</i>Facebook page.</p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy. Please feel free to contact Philip in my office if you require any further assistance with this query.</p></reply>

My Department has not incurred expenditure on external public relations services since March 2011.  The expenditure in question has rather arisen in the context of specific initiatives under Ireland&rsquo;s overseas development programme for which we have from time to time commissioned companies with a public relations and communications background to provide other professional services such as project management, logistics and event management.</p><p>DHR Communications has been contracted to manage and administer grants to journalists reporting on international development issues under the Simon Cumbers Media Fund (SCMF) and to manage and administer annual Africa Day celebrations.  The SCMF involves managing three funding rounds each year, including the annual SCMF student competition.  This typically involves the following activities: </p><p>Convening national and regional information workshops;</p><p>Managing and administering the application process;</p><p>Organising the judging process</p><p>Providing detailed feedback to all applicants;</p><p>Processing grant payments and keeping detailed administrative and financial records;</p><p>Maintaining and updating the SCMF website.  </p><p>It should be noted that expenses paid to third parties account for approximately 30% of the total paid to DHR for managing and administering the Simon Cumbers Media Fund.  This includes costs associated with maintaining and updating the SCMF website, facilitating the judging process and raising awareness of the Fund among journalists.  </p><p>Following a competitive tendering process, DHR was also engaged to plan, manage and execute a national Africa Day flagship event in Dublin.  This includes the administration of a small grants scheme for regional events which DHR managed on behalf of the Department in partnership with a number of local authorities.  DHR also worked to raise public awareness of the Africa Day events, including through the use of social media and the Africa Day website.  This public awareness work represented a very minor element of the overall project and was conducted in close cooperation with my Department&rsquo;s communications office.</p><p>Africa Day Family Days were hosted by the Department in Iveagh Gardens in 2009 and 2010, in CHQ in Georges Dock in 2012 and at the Farmleigh Estate annually since 2013. In 2011, the Department supported a series of smaller-scale performances, family events, art exhibitions, debates and educational activities instead of hosting a flagship event. </p><p>In relation to the expenditure on Africa Day, expenses paid to third parties accounted for between 70% and 80% of the total costs listed below.  This included expenditure on security, sanitation, venue set-up, health and safety issues and small grants to facilitate the participation of community groups.</p><p>DHR also provided short-term management support services for the Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, including the logistical management of the nationwide public consultation activities.</p><p>The table below sets out the payments for project and event management since 2011.  </p><p><b>Payments for Project and Event Management 2011 to 2016</b><table><tr><th>Name of Project/Event</th><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013</th><th>2014</th><th>2015</th><th>2016 (to date)</th></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications: SCMF</td><td>&euro;73,237</td><td>&euro;47,430</td><td>&euro;73,836</td><td>&euro;60,338</td><td>&euro;83,757</td><td>&euro;131,344</td></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications: White Paper Review</td><td>&euro;25,000</td><td>&euro;26,026</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>DHR Communications: Africa Day</td><td>&euro;6,806</td><td>&euro;90,851</td><td>&euro;118,644</td><td>&euro;143,829</td><td>&euro;179,221</td><td>&euro;206,126</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>&euro;105,043</td><td>&euro;164,307</td><td>&euro;192,480</td><td>&euro;204,167</td><td>&euro;262,978</td><td>&euro;337,470</td></tr></table></p></reply>

These developments are of great concern and are being closely monitored by my Department and by the Embassy of Ireland in Mexico, which is accredited to Colombia. I condemn unreservedly any intimidation or violence perpetrated against human rights defenders in Colombia and elsewhere.</p>  <p>  Officials from my department regularly meet representatives of human rights organisations which are active in Colombia and last month hosted a delegation from Peace Brigades International.  This meeting discussed the worrying increase in assassinations and attempts on the lives of local leaders and human rights defenders in Colombia.</p>  <p>  Officials from our Embassy in Mexico also regularly interact with organisations working to promote and defend human rights in Colombia.  In this context Ireland has provided more than &euro;5 million to international and local civil society organizations in Colombia since 2009, including to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and Christian Aid, amongst others. </p>  <p>  In addition, Ireland regularly raises issues relating to human rights directly in Bogot&aacute; and via the UN and European Union.</p>  <p>  International support for the implementation of the peace agreement between the Government of Colombia and the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) will be vital to ensuring the long term stability of Colombia.  Ireland has pledged to contribute &euro;3 million to the European Union Trust Fund for Colombia, which was formally established on 12 December of this year.  This Fund will support the implementation of the peace agreement and Ireland has been closely involved in discussion of its governance structures and strategic direction. </p>  <p>  In this context, Ireland has advocated a strong human rights perspective in the Fund&rsquo;s strategic plan, in keeping with our commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights internationally.  We will continue to prioritise this issue as the agreement between the Government of Colombia and the FARC is implemented in the months and years ahead. </p></reply>

Notwithstanding the changing political context in the United States, the Government&rsquo;s commitment to these objectives remains constant.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach availed of his recent separate telephone conversations with President Elect Trump and Vice President Pence to raise our concerns in regard to immigration matters. I was also able to raise the issue of Immigration Reform in the United States with Speaker Paul Ryan in a courtesy phone call on Wednesday, 23 November.</p>  <p>  The new Administration does not take office until 20 January and the process of considering and announcing nominations to its senior posts is ongoing. Nevertheless, during the transition period, the Government will avail of all opportunities for contact with the incoming Administration to sensitise them to our concerns and interests in regard to immigration reform, and the plight of the undocumented in particular. </p>  <p>  The Government has raised the issue of immigration reform with US interlocutors &ndash; including at the highest levels &ndash; on many occasions.  It will continue to use high-level visits to and from the US, as well as Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic representation in the United States, to advance these aims.  The Embassy in Washington has worked closely with members of the US Congress - in both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, and on both sides of the aisle &ndash; to advance progress on this matter and will continue to do so.  We are fortunate to be able to draw on the assistance of the Friends of Ireland in Congress and the many representatives of Irish America who share our commitment to immigration reform.</p>  <p>  Conscious of the challenges that may lie ahead, the Government will continue to support, through my Department&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme, the work of the Irish Immigration Centres across the US, who do so much to help undocumented Irish citizens in the US.  This year we are committing almost &euro; 1 million to support their work.</p>  <p>  The Government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and our Embassy in Washington continue to work closely with Irish-American community leaders in actively pursuing all viable opportunities to advance immigration reform. A new Administration and a new Congress will take time to settle in.  We will of course pursue this issue in our contacts with the incoming Administration and Congress and encourage and promote any realistic possibilities for a solution that may arise.  </p></reply>

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade maintains and administers a roster of observers for such missions.  The aim is to ensure that Ireland is represented at an appropriate level in international election observation missions organised in the main by the OSCE and the EU.</p><p>A full list of observers who have served on election observation missions from 2013 to mid-November 2016, together with the costs arising, is set out in the tables below.  Those names marked with an asterix are officials from the Department, who work on relevant geographic desks, or election Focal Points who on occasion also participate in such missions.</p><p>The European Union covers the costs associated with EU Election Observation Missions.  For OSCE missions, the Department covers all costs incurred by the individual Irish election observers.  This includes a daily allowance based on OSCE guidance, to cover the cost of food, accommodation and local transport costs in country.  A return air fare is also provided.  In addition, all Irish election observation roster members undertaking a mission, receive a once-off grant annually of &euro;600 from the Department to cover pre-departure mission expenses.  Insurance cover is also provided by the Department for all observers.  The costs incurred by officials are paid on the same basis as other election roster members, but no pre-departure grant is provided.</p><p>For each election observation mission, the EU or OSCE set out their specific requirements and, on the basis of expressions of interest and application form submitted by roster members, the Department draws up a list of observers.  In selecting nominees to be put forward, the specific criteria set by the EU or OSCE, including relevant local and regional experience and language proficiency, form the principal basis for decision-making.  Issues of gender balance and length of time since serving on a mission are also taken into account.  In many cases, the EU and OSCE also invite Member States to nominate observers with limited experience.  Following consideration of the applicants, a draft list of nominees is submitted for Ministerial approval.</p><p>For EU missions, the final selection of observers submitted by the Department rests with the European Commission.  In the case of OSCE election missions, all of the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected.  By the end of 2016, it is envisaged that 67 observers will have participated on missions this year, compared to 46 in 2015. </p><p><b>Election Observation Missions

This followed a review of the previous roster and a public call for applications.  Following the independent appraisal and ranking of the 263 eligible applications, the 200 individuals who achieved the highest scores were selected to serve on the new roster and a reserve panel of the next 10 highest scoring individuals was also established, from which replacements would be drawn should any members leave the roster during the five year period.</p>  <p>  Taking account of members who have left the roster, and those who have been added from the reserve panel, the current roster complement stands at 198 and the reserve panel has been fully utilised.   Of this current roster, 128 members have undertaken missions since 2013 while 70 members have not yet served on a mission.  In the vast majority of cases, the reason for non-participation is that members have not yet applied to go on a mission.</p>  <p>  In the case of EU missions, the final selection of nominees submitted by the Department rests with the European Commission.  In the case of OSCE election missions, all of the observers nominated by the Department are usually selected.  </p>  <p>  Officials of the Department&rsquo;s Election Desk do take into account any feedback received from roster members, but are also mindful that the numbers of applicants for election missions are always higher than the available places. </p>  <p>  Ireland actively participates in the European Commission and European External Action Service - led European Observation network, which brings together election observation Focal Points from all EU Member States, together with Norway, Switzerland and Canada.   The network facilities exchange of information and international best practice on all aspects of election monitoring and roster administration and helps to ensure that Ireland is acting in accordance with best practice in the operation of the roster. </p>  <p>  I am confident that the current roster is well equipped to deal with the requisite requirements of the EU and OSCE.  It is envisaged that the current roster will operate until May 2018, but will be kept under review.</p></reply>

Last spring, when a ceasefire was announced after over a year of fighting, it seemed like the conflict might come to an end.  However, efforts to broker peace were unsuccessful and, since August, the situation has continued to deteriorate.  </p>  <p>  UN Special Envoy Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed and his team continue to try to draw the parties to the negotiating table, and I commend them for all of their efforts to date.  However, time continues to pass and it does not seem that there is an end to the conflict in sight.  Those with influence in the region need to use their sway to convince the parties to lay down weapons and negotiate in earnest. </p>  <p>  This war is having a devastating impact on the civilian population of the Gulf&rsquo;s poorest country.  The UN has described the humanitarian situation as &ldquo;catastrophic&rdquo;.  About 80% of the population is dependent on humanitarian aid.  There are reports of a cholera epidemic, and the country is one step away from famine.  </p>  <p>  In 2015, Irish Aid provided &euro;1,850,000 in response to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.  This included &euro;1 million to the UN Humanitarian Pooled Fund in Yemen, which provides rapid, flexible funding to NGOs and UN agencies; &euro;750,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Yemen; and &euro;100,000 to Oxfam Ireland, to assist displaced people.  To date in 2016, Ireland has provided &euro;2 million to the UN Humanitarian Pooled Fund in Yemen, and &euro;100,000 to Goal.  Total Irish humanitarian response since 2015 is &euro;3,950,000.</p>  <p>  This conflict has also been characterised by allegations of violations of International Humanitarian Law and the Law of War by all sides.  Reports abound of airstrikes on civilian infrastructure, including homes, hospitals and even a funeral.  I cannot comment on the intent of these attacks, but I strongly condemn the killing and injuring of innocent civilians in all circumstances.  At the Human Rights Council in September, Ireland supported calls for the establishment of an independent international investigation into the situation in Yemen.  </p>  <p>  Ireland does not have an Embassy in Yemen, but the Ambassador to Saudi Arabia is also accredited to Yemen.  I myself recently travelled to the Gulf, where I met with the UAE Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and with the Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Dr Nizar bin Obaid Madani.  While the detail of these conversations is confidential I can confirm that I expressed my concern about the appalling humanitarian situation in Yemen, resulting from the conflict, and about attacks which have directly impacted on civilians.  </p>  <p>  I have also discussed the Yemeni situation with my EU counterparts.  In November 2015, we passed Council Conclusions on the conflict, urging the parties to respect International Humanitarian Law and International Human Rights Law, and to begin negotiating a peace settlement in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 2216.  The humanitarian situation was also discussed several times in Brussels in 2016 at official level.  </p>  <p>  I encourage the parties to this conflict to lay down arms and return to the negotiating table.  As I have said before in this House, a resolution will not come through continued fighting.  The only way to end the suffering of the Yemeni people is through peace.  </p></reply>

This discounting of the FEMPI 2013 pay cuts, which affected persons with annualised salaries over &euro;65,000, reflects the operation of a "grace period", instituted under section 9 of FEMPI 2013 and extended to 1 April 2019 under the terms of the Public Service Pension Rights (No. 2) Order 2015 (S.I. No. 547 of 2015).</p>  <p>  The &euro;1,000 salary increase due on 1 September 2017 will apply to public servants on annualised salaries up to &euro;65,000.  For retirements from then on, this salary increase will be reflected in the rates of pension awarded.</p>  <p>  Reductions to public service pensions under the financial emergency legislation are being significantly reversed in three stages under FEMPI 2015, with Public Service Pension Reduction (PSPR)-affected pensioners getting pension increases via substantial restoration of the PSPR reductions  on 1 January 2016, 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018.  As I have previously indicated, it will be for Government in due course to consider the issue of how to adjust the post-award value of public service pensions through appropriate pay or other linkages, as we move beyond FEMPI and PSPR restoration towards more normal pay and pension setting conditions in the public service.</p></reply>

Three hundred locations nationwide are being assessed under the Programme, the purpose of which is to implement the EU Floods Directive and national flood policy. </p><p>The CFRAM Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood risk mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. </p><p>Twelve locations in Co. Kilkenny were identified as Areas for Further Assessment (AFA) in the Programme.  The twelve are Ballyhale, Ballyragget, Callan, Fiddown, Freshford, Graiguenamanagh, Inistioge, Kilkenny - Nore, Kilkenny &ndash; Bregagh, Mullinavat, Piltown, &amp;amp; Thomastown.  These locations fall under the South Eastern CFRAM Study and under the Suir CFRAM Study.  The statutory public consultation on the draft flood risk management plans for the South Eastern CFRAM Study closed on the 28 of October, 2016.  The statutory public consultation on the draft flood risk management plans for the Suir CFRAM Study closes today 13 December, 2016  <i>.</i></p><p>The draft flood risk management plans will now be finalised taking account of comments and observations received and the plans will contain a prioritised list of feasible measures, both structural and non-structural, to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner  <i>.</i></p><p>The target date for finalisation of all these plans for approval by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is Spring 2017.</p><p>A &euro;430 million, 6 year programme of capital investment on flood defence measures was announced as part of the Government&rsquo;s overall Capital Investment Plan 2016 &ndash; 2021.  During this time, the annual allocation for flood defence schemes will more than double to &euro;100m.</p></reply>

The Act gives primary responsibility to planning authorities to identify and protect the architectural heritage by including relevant structures on the Record of Protected Structures.  Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p><p>As Minister, I draw on information provided by the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage, maintained by my Department, to recommend structures for inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures. However, the final decision in regard to inclusion is a reserved function of the planning authority.</p><p>Under section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its Record of Protected Structures a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the Record of Protected Structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  </p><p>There is a duty on owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.</p><p>The structure referred to by the Deputy is listed on both the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage and on the Record of Protected Structures.  The destruction of the house, which I understand is the subject of a Garda investigation as a criminal matter, is most regrettable. </p><p>My Department has issued guidance circulars previously on disaster management/security of derelict protected structures to local authorities and follows up as appropriate in individual circumstances.  In this case, officials of my Department met with the local authority in the week following the fire to initiate discussions on all the issues arising from the loss. Correspondence was received from the organisation referred to by the Deputy in relation to the structure mentioned and a reply was issued by my Department.</p><p>I understand that the local authority has been acting with the relevant parties to seek to protect the building.  In 2012 and 2014, the council carried out urgent conservation works to the roof of the house with financial assistance from my Department.</p><p>There are a number of ways in which my Department acts in respect of possible heritage sites/buildings deemed to be at risk.  One of these is the receipt of applications for funding for the repair, conservation, preservation or safeguarding of protected structures, sites or monuments.</p><p>Financial support is provided by my Department through a number of structured schemes for the conservation and protection of heritage buildings.  My Department itself operates a Structures at Risk Fund (SRF) to enable conservation works to heritage structures, in both private and public ownership, that are protected under the Planning and Development Acts.</p><p>In 2015, I launched a new &euro;2 million scheme - the Built Heritage Investment Scheme (BHIS) - for the repair and conservation of protected structures.  The 2016 BHIS scheme has operated via the local authorities, on the same model as the very successful Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme, which ran in 2014.  In 2016, BHIS has supported over 270 projects across the country, creating over 17,000 days of employment in the conservation and construction industries, while helping to regenerate urban and rural areas.  The scheme has also leveraged just under &euro;5.5 million, more than double the scheme&rsquo;s allocation of &euro;2 million. Both schemes will run again in 2017.</p><p>The Heritage Council, which my Department funds, also provides grants for the protection and preservation of the built heritage.  For 2016, the Council is administering a community-based heritage grants scheme available for projects that contributed to particular heritage themes.  Further details can be found at <i>www.heritagecouncil.ie</i>.</p><p>My Department will continue its ongoing support and engagement with local authorities as regards their functions for the protection and management of our built heritage as set out under the Planning and Development Acts, having regard to the available resources.</p></reply>

This will be based on the inclusive, open and consultative approach that has worked so well this year.  At all times, the Government has been supported in its plans by the guidance and advice of the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations and the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations.</p>  <p>  For example, next year, we will remember the battle of Messines.  In 2018, we will mark the end of the First World War and the General Election of 1918 and then moving on to commemorate the First D&aacute;il in January 2019.  Commemorating the period of the War of Independence and the Civil War will present its own challenges.  However, I strongly believe the same open and honest approach which we used for this year's successful commemorations, allowing all narratives to be heard, will ensure that we will be able to reflect appropriately on the all of the major historical events as they unfolded.</p>  <p>  To this end, I can advise the Deputy that a number of new appointments have recently been made to the Expert Advisory Group on Commemorations and that Group is currently considering the issue of guidance around the approach to the second half of the Decade of Centenaries.  As the Deputy will be aware, the term of office of the All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations expired on 3 February of this year, with the dissolution of the 31st D&aacute;il and Seanad.  I am currently considering the steps necessary to re-establish the Oireachtas All-Party Consultation Group on Commemorations and I am committed to ensuring that we will be able to reflect appropriately and respectfully on all of the major historical events to be commemorated over the remainder of the Decade.</p></reply>

In December 2014, the Health Service Executive (HSE) launched Safeguarding Vulnerable Persons  at  Risk of Abuse &ndash; National Policy and Procedures.  This new national policy applies to all HSE and HSE-funded services for older people and people with disabilities.  It incorporates the previously existing HSE elder abuse service into a single structure for older people and people with disabilities.  The policy outlines the procedures to be followed when there is a concern of abuse, neglect or self-neglect of a vulnerable adult. </p>  <p>  The HSE has established a number of structures to implement the policy, including a National Safeguarding Office and a National Safeguarding Committee.  Safeguarding and Protection Teams to deal with suspected abuse have been established in each of the nine Community Healthcare Organisation Areas.  These Teams are managed and led by a Principal Social Worker and staffed by Social Work team leaders and Professionally Qualified Social Workers.  Staff training is under way  and over 900 Designated Officers have been appointed in service settings within the HSE&rsquo;s Social Care Division to receive concerns or referrals of abuse. </p>  <p>  The National Safeguarding Committee was established in December 2015 with the overarching remit to support the development of a societal and organisational culture which promotes the rights of persons who may be vulnerable and safeguard them from abuse.   It is a multi-agency and inter-sectoral body with an independent chair and will publish its Strategic Plan 2017 &ndash; 2021 later this month.  This Plan includes the strategic objective of informing and influencing Government policy and legislation to safeguard the rights of people who may be vulnerable, including a focus on issues such as adult safeguarding, advocacy, the use of chemical restraint and deprivation of liberty.  Minister Harris met with the Chair of the Committee on 5 December to discuss a number of issues, including the possibility of a consultation document  on the development of legislation to include adult safeguarding.  </p>  <p>  With regard to residents of nursing homes, all public and private nursing homes must comply with Regulations under the Health Act 2007 and with National Standards prepared by HIQA and subject to Ministerial approval.  The Regulations contain provisions in relation to the prevention, detection and response to abuse.  National Standard 3.1 specifically states that each resident must be safeguarded from abuse and neglect and their safety and welfare promoted.</p>  <p>  The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for planning, managing and delivering home and other community-based services for older people and people with a disability.  Homecare services are currently not formally regulated.  It is accepted that there is a need to regulate the sector and the Department has asked the Health Research Board to review how homecare services are funded and regulated in comparable jurisdictions.  The HRB review is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.</p></reply>

It is not possible to give a definitive timeframe for the completion of the draft Bill and its subsequent passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. </p>  <p>  The proposed legislation will take cognisance of the 2014 Supreme Court judgment in the MR and Anor v An tArd Chl&aacute;raitheoir &amp;amp; Ors (surrogacy) case, which found that the birth mother, rather than the genetic mother, is the legal mother.  It is envisaged that the legislation will establish a mechanism for transfer of parentage from the surrogate (and her husband, if she has one) to the intending parents. </p>  <p>  In relation to the issue of Irish citizens engaging in surrogacy outside of the State, a guidance document was published on this matter in February 2012 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence.  This guidance document is entitled "Citizenship, parentage, guardianship and travel document issues in relation to children born as a result of surrogacy arrangements entered into outside the State".  The guidance document provides information to people who intend to enter surrogacy arrangements outside the State on the practical and legal considerations arising under Irish law where the intending parents intend to bring the child to live with them in the State.</p></reply>

Participants contribute to the cost of their care according to their income and assets while the State pays the balance of the cost.  The Scheme aims to ensure that long-term nursing home care is accessible and affordable for everyone and that people are cared for in the most appropriate settings.  A financial assessment is carried out by the HSE to determine how much a participant in the Scheme will contribute to the cost of their care.  The Programme for a Partnership Government has committed to reviewing the NHSS to remove any discrimination against small businesses and family farms. </p>  <p>  When the NHSS commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015. Arising out of the Review, a number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  This work is currently underway and the IFA has made a submission in this context to the Interdepartmental Group which is overseeing the implementation of certain recommendations contained in the Review.  The proposals put forward by the IFA are currently being considered.  Once all of the relevant Review recommendations have been considered, any amendments required to the Scheme will be identified.  Changes which require legislative implementation will be addressed collectively.</p></reply>

In this context it is essential that we consider how homecare services should be provided and regulated.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Partnership Government includes commitments to increase funding for home support services, to improve these supports, to introduce a uniform homecare service so all recipients can receive a quality support, 7 days per week, where possible and to review the management, operation and funding of national home-help services.</p>  <p>  I am committed to legislating for the financing and regulation of homecare, however I do not underestimate the extent and the complexity of the work involved which will involve very significant legislative, operational and financial resources.  In this context additional resources are being provided to the Older People&rsquo;s Division of the Department so that this legislation can be progressed as quickly as possible.  Preparatory work has already commenced and the Health Research Board has carried out an evidence review of the approaches to the regulation and financing of home care services in four European countries.  This review is being finalised at present. </p>  <p>  In terms of quality assurance in the homecare sector, a significant step was taken in 2012 when the HSE introduced a single procurement framework for external providers. This included quality standards covering governance and accountability, person-centred care, complaints management, training and qualifications. Providers are monitored through Service Level Agreements with the HSE and are required to provide a range of information in relation to the services they provide.   From the 1st September 2016 all new Home Care Packages approved by the HSE will be provided by organisations that have been approved by the HSE following a detailed tender process.  The 32 approved providers appointed under this process meet a required level of quality based on consistent national standards.   </p></reply>

Two changes were made to the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule which came into effect on 1 December, 2016 with the introduction of Men B and Rotavirus for all babies born on or after 1 October, 2016.  All vaccines administered through the Primary Childhood Immunisation Schedule are provided free of charge.  Ireland is the second country in Europe to make the vaccine available free of charge as part of its national immunisation programme. </p>  <p>  NIAC makes many recommendations in relation to &ldquo;at risk groups&rdquo; but not all of these are included in the current immunisation schedule.  The introduction of the vaccine to the childhood immunisation programmes means that all children born on or after 1 October 2016, including those in "at risk groups", will automatically receive the vaccine.  However, there are no plans at this stage to introduce a catch-up programme for older children.  Those who have a medical card are eligible to have the vaccine administered by their GP free of charge.  However the purchase of the vaccine is not covered by the medical card scheme. </p></reply>

Persons can opt to be treated privately on admission to a public hospital, in which case they are liable for the consultants fees and hospital charges arising for that episode of care, whether paid for by the patient or by a health insurer on their behalf.   </p>  <p>  The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 revised the charging regime in respect of private patients in public hospitals.  Previously, the cost of providing private services in public hospitals were not reflected in the charges levied on private patients, as only a &euro;75 statutory in-patient charge applied.  The private in-patient charge applicable now takes account of all the services which a public hospital provides, for example, accommodation, nursing, diagnostics (such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI etc.) and other overheads and maintenance costs.  The 2013 Act makes it clear that it is not where the private service is received that matters, but rather it is the receiving of such private services that makes patients liable for the charges and obliges the charges to be raised.   </p>  <p>  Regarding the broader issue of charging in respect of customers for inaccurate services, it is my understanding that health insurers issue a statement of benefit to each customer detailing the payments made by that insurer on their behalf.  If customers think that there is a mistake on their statement or that their insurer has been charged for  treatments not received, they can notify the insurer accordingly.  The insurer can then examine the individual case, on behalf of their customers, to ensure the claim details are accurate.  In this way, incidences of error or overcharging by healthcare providers can be identified, fully investigated and rectified as appropriate. </p></reply>

Immediately, my Department contacted the HSE, and the HSE confirmed that it had been rescinded. </p>  <p>  I have stated publicly that the memo was offensive and unacceptable and is utterly out of line with Government policy on the care of patients and its vision for the health service.  The HSE has confirmed that the memo does not reflect the policy of the HSE.  It is not in accordance with the HSE's espoused values of care, compassion and trust.  It was written as legal advice and should never have been circulated at hospital and staff level.</p>  <p>  A core aim of our health service is to ensure that every person can access safe, compassionate and high quality healthcare.  With that in mind, the HSE are implementing measures under the Winter Initiative Plan 2016/17 that are reducing delayed discharges, by increasing capacity within our Healthcare system.  The Initiative provides &euro;40 million of additional funding to manage the expected winter surge in demand for hospital care. </p>  <p>  Under the Winter Initiative to date, over 3,343 patients have availed of aids and appliances, enabling them to be discharged from hospital sooner.  Over 475 additional home care packages have been made available, and over 251 additional transitional care beds have been approved.  In addition, 18 step-down beds, and 10 acute beds have been opened to date.  Community Intervention Teams, as a whole, have received almost 25,000 referrals by end November, with 262 additional referrals enabled by the Winter Initiative.</p>  <p>  The HSE are on target to meet the target of less than 500 delayed discharges by 1 January 2017.  Delayed discharges are currently at 553 as of 6 December 2016. In order to maintain a tight focus on implementation, I am meeting the HSE on a weekly basis to monitor progress on the Initiative.</p></reply>

Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1.  the health needs of the public; </p><p>2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services;</p><p>3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks;</p><p>5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item;</p><p>6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item;</p><p>7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety;</p><p>8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9.  the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Respreeza for maintenance treatment of emphysema in adults with documented severe alpha-proteinase inhibitor deficiency.</p><p>In June of this year the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment on the cost effectiveness of this treatment. The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation on 9 December 2016. The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug and did not recommend it for reimbursement.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: www.ncpe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/NCPE-website-summary_Final.pdf  .</p><p>The HSE will consider the NCPE assessment, and other expert advice, as part of its decision-making process for reimbursement.  This decision will be made on objective, scientific and economic grounds by the HSE in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>I understand  that the NCPE is arranging to meet the patient representative group, the Alpha One Foundation,  as soon as possible to provide them with an update in relation to the recommendation of the NCPE.</p><p>In relation to compassionate access schemes, I have previously asked manufacturers to show compassion and to maintain access compassionate access schemes for patients during the assessment process by the HSE and this remains the position. However, the operation of these schemes is at the discretion of manufacturers. My Department has asked the NCPE to contact the company to seek clarification for those patients currently receiving this drug.</p></reply>

The vast majority of claims under the remit of the State Claims Agency  are resolved without confidentiality/non disclosure agreements attaching.  Confidentiality/non disclosure agreements typically apply to claims in respect of minors or claims associated with abuse or specific medical negligence issues.  The agreements, where entered into at the behest of either party, preclude the disclosure of settlement details by either party. </p></reply>

The prescription must specify, in the prescribers own handwriting: full name and address of the person for whom the prescription is issued; form and strength, where appropriate, of the preparation; amount/total quantity prescribed in words and figures and the dose to be taken.  Methylphenidate prescriptions must also contain the name, address and telephone of the practitioner and detail the type of practitioner. </p>  <p>  A prescription for a methylphenidate is valid for 14 days from the date of issue indicated on the prescription.

New service initiatives on Child and Adolescent Mental Health services are being progressed in the context of finalising both the overall HSE Service Plan 2017 and the more detailed regional Operational Plan for Mental Health.  These will be published by the HSE in the near future. </p>  <p>  The agreed 2016 mental health development priorities cover improvement of counselling services; enhanced Community Mental Health teams; improved 7/7 response and Liaison Services; and Perinatal Mental Health. We have introduced also two new mental health clinical programmes - ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  Priorities to be addressed in the new HSE Service Plan include Positive Mental Health and Early Intervention enhancements for youth mental health; improvements to Child &amp;amp; Adolescent community-based services; developing the Eating Disorders Clinical Programme for young people, and expanded CAMHS forensic mental health care. There will be continued enhancement of Out-of-Hours responses, and development of Primary Care counselling services for those under age 18. In addition, the HSE will continue to develop the existing 10 Jigsaw sites, and the development of new sites in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. </p>  <p>  These initiatives are all relevant to supporting the wider objectives of the National Taskforce on Youth Mental Health. Development of service user and carer engagement at CHO level, including that relating to young people, and the Advancing Recovery Ireland programme with recruitment of peer support workers, is also being provided for over 2017. </p></reply>

The figure of &euro;325,000 is based on the capital costs of building new ward space to accommodate an additional bed, and does not include additional equipping costs, or the costs of providing the necessary associated hospital infrastructure (theatres, laboratories etc.) that would be required to service large expansions in bed capacity.</p>  <p>  In the context of a larger expansion of hospital bed capacity, the HSE estimate that the total costs of the development of a bed could be around &euro;1 million per bed.</p>  <p>  Similarly, the figure of &euro;78,000 annual running costs (&euro;500 per week) provided to the D&aacute;il Committee for the Future of Healthcare is derived from estimates for the provision of additional beds within existing infrastructure, and not those associated with any substantial expansion of facilities and staffing.  In the context of a major expansion of bed capacity, the HSE estimate that the running cost of a bed would be in the region of &euro;839 per day, giving a total annual cost per bed of &euro;306,000.</p>  <p>  The figures quoted in the submission to the Committee for the Future of Healthcare, and the information provided by the HSE in response to Parliamentary Question No. 425 of 17 December 2015, apply in different circumstances.</p>  <p>  All costings above are subject to very significant caveats, as considerations such as the bed type (e.g. intensive care, coronary care, high dependency, and general ward), specialty usage (e.g. orthopaedics, neurosurgery, general medicine) and current location, infrastructure and layout of individual hospital sites, all of which impact on the prospective costs of bed capacity provision.</p></reply>

The company must submit a separate application to extend a treatment to a new cohort of patients.  Each application is considered separately on its merits and in line with the 2013 Act.</p><p>In reaching its decision, the HSE examines all the evidence which may be relevant in its view for the decision (including the information /dossier submitted by the company) and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations which may have been sought by the HSE at its sole discretion (for example, from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics).</p><p>In considering an application, the HSE will also have regard to Part 1 and Part 3 of Schedule 3 of the 2013 Act.  Part 3 requires the HSE to have regard to the following criteria: </p><p>1. the health needs of the public;</p><p>2.  the cost-effectiveness of meeting health needs by supplying the item concerned rather than providing other health services; </p><p>3.  the availability and suitability of items for supply or reimbursement; </p><p>4.  the proposed costs, benefits and risks of the item or listed item relative to therapeutically similar items or listed items provided in other health service settings and the level of certainty in relation to the evidence of those costs, benefits and risks; </p><p>5.  the potential or actual budget impact of the item or listed item; </p><p>6.  the clinical need for the item or listed item; </p><p>7.  the appropriate level of clinical supervision required in relation to the item to ensure patient safety; </p><p>8.  the efficacy (performance in trial), effectiveness (performance in real situations) and added therapeutic benefit against existing standards of treatment (how much better it treats a condition than existing therapies); and </p><p>9.  the resources available to the HSE. </p><p>I am informed that the HSE received a request and economic dossier from the manufacturer of Ivacaftor, brand name Kalydeco, for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients aged 2 years and older and weighing less than 25 kg.  In March of this year, the HSE asked the NCPE to carry out a health technology assessment of the applicant&rsquo;s economic dossier on the cost effectiveness of this treatment.</p><p>The NCPE completed its assessment and made a recommendation in October 2016.  The NCPE determined that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the drug for its intended cohort of patients and did not recommend that it should be reimbursed for this indication at the submitted price.  In the economic dossier submitted to the NCPE, the manufacturer estimates that there are 18 patients who may be eligible for early Ivacaftor treatment.</p><p>A summary of the health technology assessment has been published on the NCPE website and is available at: <i>www.ncpe.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Ivacaftor-2-5-years-web-summary.pdf</i>. </p><p>As the HSE is responsible for negotiations with manufacturers, I have asked it to reply to the Deputy directly in relation to the status of negotiations with the manufacturer.</p><p>I understand how patients and their families must feel in these circumstances, as they await the decisions by the HSE in relation to reimbursement.  However as with all new drugs developed, the HSE must follow a statutory process, as set out in the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

I can assure the Deputy that the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance is a significant patient safety and public health priority for the Government.</p><p>I am advised that Irish hospitals, like other hospitals internationally, are taking steps to reduce healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance including the prudent use of antibiotics.  I am aware of the challenges in relation to tackling multidrug-resistant superbug infection rates in all hospitals including at University Hospital Limerick (UHL).  UHL has confirmed that a focused Quality Improvement Plan is in place to tackle the issues of control of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance, commonly known as HCAIs and AMR.  This is in line with the recommendations of the HIQA unannounced inspection reports at the Hospital on 28 November 2014 and 13 January 2015.</p><p>This includes:</p><p>-  An intensive screening programme for the detection of Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CRE among high risk patients;</p><p>-  An isolation ward for the mitigation of any risk of cross-transmission of newly detected or known positive patients;</p><p>-  Adoption of strict contact precautions, dedicated equipment and a highly intensive cleaning regimen;</p><p>-  Speedy laboratory procedures to ensure results regarding infections available within 24 hours;</p><p>-  Good communication amongst microbiologists and with all relevant parties on detection of a new case.</p><p>-  Good communication with patients and GPs and other health care worker contacts to inform GPs of their patients&rsquo; status.</p><p>A wide range of initiatives has been put in place in the Irish health system over several years to tackle healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance, covering improved surveillance of infections and prescribing and infection prevention and control processes.</p><p>It also includes antimicrobial stewardship initiatives, public and professional awareness-raising with a significant emphasis on the education and training of healthcare professionals.</p><p>Ireland is also developing a National Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance in line with the World Health Organisation's 2015 Global Action Plan on AMR and the European Council&rsquo;s 2016 Conclusions : 'The next steps under a <i>'One Health'</i>approach to combat antimicrobial resistance'.</p><p>The National Action Plan is being developed with the oversight and guidance of the Interdepartmental AMR Consultative Committee.  The Committee was established in 2014 by my Department&rsquo;s Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in recognition of the need for a &lsquo;whole of Government&rsquo; approach to tackling the issue of AMR.  This inter-sectoral approach crosses the health, veterinary and environmental spheres to encompass all stakeholders&rsquo; efforts to address what is a world-wide concern.  It is intended that the National Action Plan will be published in 2017.</p><p>The Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) is Ireland's specialist agency for the surveillance of communicable diseases and is part of the Health Service Executive. HPSC works in partnership with health service providers and sister organisations in Ireland and around the world and collates, interprets and disseminates data and information on communicable diseases.</p><p>Tackling AMR will require the whole system to prioritise key initiatives, working with our international colleagues. Ireland is fully committed to and engaged in addressing resolution of the problem of AMR and will continue to collaborate at international, EU and national levels to this end. </p><p>Nationally, I expect that the HSE will place particular emphasis on prevention and management of healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in its service planning for 2017.</p><p>Protected disclosures received by the Minister for Health are managed in accordance with the requirements under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on such matters.</p><p>The Deputy&rsquo;s detailed queries in relation to the publication of an HPSC report into infection control at UHL, deaths due to infection at the hospital relative to deaths at other major hospitals, and regarding staff turnover are operational issues and have, therefore, been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The Statutory Instrument currently applicable is the Fishery Harbour Centres (Rates and Charges) Order 2012. The imposition of fees for swing moorings are included in the Order at Charge 9 of Schedule 2.  The Order provides for the payment and collection of dues but also for the penalties and remedies for non-payment. These measures include distress and sale of ships, boats and goods in respect of which the rate or charge is payable.</p>  <p>  Section 4 of the Fishery Harbour Centres Act 1968 also confers powers on me to make such bye-laws as I deem necessary or desirable for the management, control, operation and development of the Fishery Harbour Centres. Section 85 of the Fishery Harbour Centres (Management, Control, Operation and Development) Bye Laws 1979 provide that the Harbour Master may detain a vessel in a port until he is satisfied that all monies due in respect of the vessel and the cargo have been paid or sufficient security has been given.</p>  <p>  My Department is not responsible for charges levied for the use of facilities and services at other harbours throughout the country.</p></reply>

This sector is a very important area in the agricultural economy but it has been a challenging year both in terms of market returns and variable weather conditions experienced during the harvest.</p>  <p>  While there is no specific funding available for losses due to poor weather conditions I wish to confirm that at Agriculture Council I have repeatedly called for the situation on agricultural markets to be kept under ongoing review, and have said that we should be ready to deploy support measures if the circumstances require it. At the October Council Minister of State Doyle followed this up with a specific request that market support efforts be extended to the cereals sector.</p>  <p>  However, I know the Deputy will be aware that I recently chaired a meeting with the main stakeholders in the tillage sector.  As I said at the time and I wish to repeat here, again this meeting provided a platform for the stakeholders to express their views and concerns on the challenges they are facing but equally to discuss the opportunities that lie ahead for the industry.</p>  <p>  At that meeting and in direct response to the difficulties being experienced, I outlined that one of my chief priorities was to provide low-cost more flexible finance and in this regard I was happy to announce on Budget Day, my plans for a &euro;150 million Agri Cash Flow Loan Support Scheme. This has been developed in conjunction with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI), by leveraging EU and Exchequer funding totalling &euro;25 m from my Department, to deliver a total loan fund of &euro;150 million, which will support highly flexible loans for up to six years, for amounts up to &euro;150,000. The interest rate applying is 2.95% and the product will be available to livestock, tillage and horticulture farmers.  Loans to tillage and horticulture farmers will be provided in line with the EU&rsquo;s agriculture State Aid de minimis requirements.</p>  <p>  This is a cash flow support facility, to improve the working capital position of farmers and other viable primary agriculture SMEs. The loans will be unsecured and are primarily to pay down expensive forms of credit such as merchant credit and other short-term financing facilities such as overdrafts. I recently welcomed the SBCI &ldquo;Open Call&rdquo; for financial intermediaries to deliver the Scheme.  The SBCI is targeting that the loans will be available in the market by the end of January 2017. I am encouraging farmers to consider their cash flow and borrowings situation now and, if appropriate to their circumstances, to be prepared to apply for these loans when they become available.</p>  <p>  The loan scheme is part of a &ldquo;three pillar strategy&rdquo; in response to income volatility that I announced in the recent Budget, along with additional tax measures and farm payments. Among the tax measures, I agreed with my colleague the Minister for Finance, for an adjustment to the current &lsquo;Income Averaging&rsquo; system, which will allow for an opt-out in an exceptional year. This will be available immediately, for this year&rsquo;s tax liability, and this will go some way towards addressing current cash flow concerns.</p>  <p>  As an additional support to cash flow on farms, including Tillage farms, I also confirmed that advance payments would be made this year in respect of the Basic Payment and Greening Payment schemes. Advance payments commenced on the 17th October last, the earliest possible date by which payments can begin under the governing EU Regulations, with the addition of balancing payments from the 1st December.</p>  <p>  To date &euro;1,141 billion has been paid out to 121,508 farmers and payments are ongoing. I was also pleased to note that the processing of the Areas of Natural Constraints payment scheme is on schedule and payments have already commenced during the third week in September.  It is expected that approx 96,500 will fulfil the scheme eligibility requirements.  My Department will also be opening a measure under the TAMS Scheme specifically for the Tillage Sector.</p>  <p>  I also stressed at the recent Tillage stakeholders meeting and I want to restate my view that in this changing landscape we need to take a fresh look at our tillage industry to ensure that it is best positioned to withstand possible future threats and to avail of the new opportunities which may present themselves.</p></reply>

Ultimately, the pace of progress is determined by the receiving country.</p>  <p>  In relation to China, I am satisfied that we are making steady progress. The formal lifting of the BSE ban by the Chinese authorities in respect of Ireland in early 2015 was followed by the submission of a detailed questionnaire to the Chinese authorities.  In January 2016 my Department hosted a ten-day inspection visit by a team from the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ).  We received a copy of their report relatively recently and have replied to their findings.</p>  <p>  Assuming that our response to these findings is positive the next steps are to agree a protocol and a veterinary health certificate. It will also be necessary for Irish meat establishments to be individually approved by the Certification and Accreditation Administration (CNCA) before they are able to export to China. Although timelines are very difficult to predict in this process, I hope that such inspections will take place in 2017.</p>  <p>  Third country markets are an increasingly important alternative outlet for the industry.  I am acutely aware of the need to develop new and alternative markets, given the changing global demographics and emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere.  Indeed this is a crucial component of the Food Wise 2025 Strategy and has been given an added impetus by the outcome of the UK referendum on Brexit.  Having greater market access options to choose from is always an advantage as exporters are able to choose to export their products to a wider range of markets. However there are many other factors that will impact on the beef price including the global supply and demand dynamics, currency fluctuations and so on.</p>  <p>  While beef access to China is a very high priority, my department  is also pursuing beef access to a number of other Third Countries including Korea, Vietnam, Thailand and Ukraine, and is working to simplify certification procedures in a number of markets to which we already have access.  My Department will continue to work very closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs, Bord Bia, the industry and the European Commission on these issues.</p></reply>

With regard to County Clare, the implementation of the programme has reduced herd incidence in that county from 7.21% in 2008 to 4.10% last year. To date in 2016, herd incidence in County Clare is at 3.6%, slightly above the national average of 3.2%.</p>  <p>  In view of this very considerable progress in reducing the incidence of the TB, my Department believes that complete eradication of the disease by 2030 is now a practicable proposition.  However, notwithstanding the success of the current range of measures in the programme, the programme is not static and has and will continue to be reviewed and revised in light of developments in the disease situation, improvements in scientific knowledge etc. However, I have no plans to introduce two annual TB tests.</p></reply>

Some 8,000 farmers received an allocation of entitlements under the 2015 National Reserve. There was no National Reserve in 2016 as all available funding had been utilised under the 2015 scheme.  In order to provide for a National Reserve in 2017 funding is required to replenish the Reserve.  EU Regulations governing the scheme provide that funding for the replenishment of the National Reserve may be obtained by means of surrender of entitlements that remain unused by farmers for two consecutive years and by claw-back derived following the sale of entitlements without land. It is envisaged that funding derived from these two sources in 2017 will be very limited.  The Regulations also provide for the application of a linear cut to the value of all farmers&rsquo; entitlements to replenish the National Reserve.  Decisions in relation to the National Reserve for 2017 will be considered once the position on potential funding has been established.</p>  <p>  Consultation between Department officials and the Direct Payments Advisory Committee comprising members of the main farming organisations, agricultural education and farm advisory bodies takes place annually as part of the decision making process for the National Reserve. The consultation process in relation to the 2017 National Reserve will take place early in 2017.</p></reply>

Both reviews involved an examination of the latest scientific data and the conservation measures, the results of which were the subject of public consultation processes.  Based on management advice from Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) and having considered all aspects of the 2015 review, the existing conservation measures remain in place up to mid-2018 at which time a further review is required.  IFI have been provided funding for a new collaborative research initiative involving IFI scientists and a number of former eel fishermen to further develop national knowledge of the species and its medium to longer term potential for recovery. This scientific fishery was commenced this year and is expected to continue for three years to increase data and knowledge<font color="#FFFFFF"> </font>ahead of further review of eel management measures in 2018.</p><p>The latest advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) for 2016 (published October 2015) is that &ldquo;the status of eel remains critical and that all anthropogenic mortality (e.g. recreational and commercial fishing, hydropower, pumping stations, and pollution) affecting production and escapement of silver eels should be reduced to &ndash; or kept as close to &ndash; zero as possible. There is no change in the status of the stock as being critically endangered&quot;.</p><p>While I recognise fully the difficulty facing eel fishermen, there is no property right attaching to public eel licences and currently there are no plans to introduce a hardship scheme as outlined by the Deputy, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.</p></reply>

The review is due to be completed by July 2017.Incentivised pricing aims to encourage householders to prevent, reduce and segregate their waste and also facilitates the industry in providing householders with a range of options to manage their waste costs. Given that we are undertaking a broader review than was originally envisaged, there is no necessity for companies to now provide for &lsquo;dual billing&rsquo; and &lsquo;opt in/ opt out&rsquo; arrangements from January 2017 for the &ldquo;pay per kilogramme&rdquo; arrangement that had been envisaged in mid-2016.  </p><p>The charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, including contract and consumer legislation.  However, the waste collection industry in general has indicated that it will not increase regular charges for the 12 months to 1 July 2017 for the same level of service.</p><p>In advance of the planned introduction of per kilogramme pay by weight charging last summer, it was indicated that there would be no <i>mandatory</i>per kilogramme charge for mixed dry recyclate, effectively maintaining the status quo in terms of how collectors charge for this type of material.</p></reply>

ComReg monitors compliance in this regard by means of biannual drive tests.  I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect.  Any customer, including those in County Kerry, who experiences service difficulties should raise the matter with the service provider in the first instance. If this fails to resolve matters, customers can refer a complaint to ComReg, who will investigate the service provider&rsquo;s compliance with its contractual obligations.</p>  <p>  Mobile operators have invested significantly in rolling out improved services, following ComReg's multi-band spectrum auction. At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage. The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. </p>  <p>  Recognising this challenge, I specifically included in the Programme for Government, a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce. In July, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which aims to unlock barriers to investment in mobile and broadband services. The Terms of Reference of the Taskforce state that it will identify and recommend practical actions that can be taken to improve mobile reception and broadband access. The Taskforce has already met approximately twenty times, with a number of helpful initiatives emerging in the areas of planning, local authority engagement, and consumer information and engagement. </p>  <p>  The Taskforce involves Government Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecoms operators. I anticipate that we will bring a report later this month, on foot of its work. This report will set out specific timelines for the delivery of the recommendations and actions, including a key role for Local Authorities in supporting the rollout of telecoms infrastructure. </p>  <p>  Under the Programme for Government, Minister Humphreys has also established two regional action groups to work with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies in helping accelerate the rollout of broadband and mobile services at local level. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with an early 2017 allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz radio spectrum band.  This will provide an 86% increase in total spectrum available for mobile and fixed wireless services. </p>  <p>  In my Department's estimates for 2017 I have secured an &euro;8m provision for RT&Eacute; to allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band.  ComReg in turn will make plans to allocate this spectrum, to provide for significantly enhanced mobile coverage. The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.  </p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. </p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed broadband services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. </p>  <p>  The procurement process is underway and the three bidders in the process have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution for rural Ireland.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is ongoing, with a view to putting in place contract(s) that will deliver the NBP network and put Ireland to the forefront internationally in terms of connectivity.</p></reply>

The development and provision of SAORSAT, which is a &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; satellite system providing access to the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4, was undertaken by RT&Eacute; on its own initiative and, as in the case of the SAORVIEW DTT network, is not a matter in which I have a function.</p>  <p>  Ireland is not the only country to have introduced a national TV network on both a terrestrial and satellite platform. Many countries, including the UK, have developed their digital networks on both the traditional terrestrial platform and also over satellite. The reason for this is simple. It is technically and financially impossible to provide 100% coverage using a terrestrial TV platform. However, through SAORVIEW and SAORSAT, Ireland now has 100% &ldquo;free to air&rdquo; coverage of the RT&Eacute; channels and TG4.   I would advise the Deputy that any signal reception issues should be directed to 2rn in the first place. 2rn can be contacted at 2rntech@2rn.ie or at (01) 2082175.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department contacted 2rn on this individual&rsquo;s behalf, who in turn made contact to discuss the reception issues. She was advised that she would need to hire a competent local installer to fix any issue. </p></reply>

It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed. I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process. I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.</p>  <p>  The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the extent of the State Intervention area:  </p>  <p>  -  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services.</p>  <p>  -  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30Mbps when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.  </p>  <p>  The area referred to by the Deputy falls within the AMBER area and will therefore be included in the State intervention procurement process.  Over 750,000 premises are currently within the State intervention area. </p>  <p>  My Department is now in a formal procurement process to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area including approximately 34,000 premises in Co Limerick, covering 100,000km of road network and 96% of the land area of Ireland. </p>  <p>  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  Householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 megabits per second but potentially up to 1000 megabits per second with businesses potentially availing of symmetrical upload and download speeds. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, before I came into office, the Department announced that it would be June 2017 before contract(s) were awarded under the NBP.  The bidders in the process have recently indicated that they may need more time to conclude the procurement process.  The timing of each stage of the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  Bidders need adequate time to prepare detailed proposals and their final formal bids.  In addition, bidders need adequate time to get the relevant shareholder and funding approvals at key stages of the process.  It is also important to ensure that risks in this multi-million euro procurement are carefully managed.  I do not propose to comment any further on timelines at this juncture, given that discussions are on-going in the procurement process.  I can assure the Deputy, however, that the procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  The Government considers the NBP to be one of the most significant investments in rural Ireland for decades, and one which will transform society, akin to rural electrification in the last century. </p>  <p>  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP.  As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. </p>  <p>  The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p>  <p>  In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.

I have also secured &euro;8m for RTE which will allow it to free up the 700MHz spectrum band, to provide enhanced mobile services.  </p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.

Our Departments work together closely on matters of mutual interest.</p>  <p>  Ireland has expressed its intention, through a national policy position, to transition to a low carbon economy by 2050.  Switching to the use of alternative fuels and technologies will be an integral part of the transport sector's efforts to decarbonise.  This will be reflected in Ireland's first National Mitigation Plan, which is due to be published in 2017.  It is also reflected in my Department's recent draft policy framework on infrastructure for alternative fuels, on which a public consultation recently closed. </p>  <p>  Transitioning away from the use of oil over the coming decades will not only help to meet climate objectives but it will also have co-benefits in terms of air quality.  It is expected that the transport sector will move predominantly to electricity for passenger cars, commuter rail and taxis by 2030.  Natural gas, along with some electrification, will provide an interim alternative solution for larger road vehicles - freight and buses.  It is envisaged that biofuels will continue to play a role over the next ten years or so.</p>  <p>  In the future, to fulfill our national ambition for transition to lower emitting vehicles (LEVs), a wide range of measures will be required.  The potential benefits of introducing low emissions zones in urban areas will be considered in this context.  To date, the introduction of low emissions zones in other countries have been spearheaded by city authorities for air quality purposes.  It may also be necessary, in future years, to consider a ban on the sale or import of petrol and diesel fuelled cars, particularly if there is a need to accelerate the low carbon trajectory for transport or if a similar approach to restricting sales of such vehicles is being adopted across the rest of Europe.</p>  <p>  Such measures can be given consideration over time and as required to underpin the transition to alternative fuels.</p></reply>

As the Deputy will be aware, the National Transport Authority (NTA) recently launched a public consultation process on the Rail Review report which was jointly prepared by NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The purpose of the consultation exercise is to open up a public discussion on the role of rail in Ireland and the funding of the rail network and services.  The public consultation process will run until 18 January and the NTA will then prepare a report about the process which I intend to bring to Government.  No decisions will be made on the future of the rail network until the public consultation process has concluded and been evaluated.</p></reply>

While there is good progress on implementation of much of the Srategy, more recent trends are concerning and challenges remain in many areas.  I expect the RSA to submit the review to me early in the new year.  At a Ministerial Committee on Road Safety last month, we focused on the rise in fatalities in 2016 and all stakeholders undertook to explore what further measures can be taken to address these, including in the light of the mid-term review.  We agreed that there was a case for a more concentrated focus on the four principal causes of fatal accidents, namely speed, the presence of intoxicants, non-wearing of seatbelts and the use of mobile phones.</p>  <p>  In an effort to address some of these issues, I have been committed to progressing the Road Traffic Bill 2016 through the Oireachtas as a matter of urgency.  It contains relevant provisions to tackle speed and the presence of intoxicants.  It is hoped that this Bill will be signed into law within the coming weeks.</p>  <p>  I hope that the efforts by the RSA to launch renewed road safety campaigns including regarding low-level speeding, alcohol and driving, and the mid-term review of the Road Safety Strategy, together with greater enforcement by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will have an impact on road safety in 2017 and beyond.</p></reply>

It is in this capacity that they attend quarterly technical meetings of the Society of the Irish Motor Industry where evolving vehicle safety and other technologies are discussed.</p>  <p>  Improved vehicle safety standards is one of the key pillars of road safety, the importance of which is reflected in action 64 of the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020 which commits the RSA to research emerging in-vehicle road safety technologies and to make recommendations on their introduction.  The RSA is currently investigating the road safety effectiveness of such technologies, including pedestrian and cyclist detections systems, with a view to their possible introduction to the national fleet.  It must be noted though that mandatory EU-wide improvement in vehicle safety systems is regulated through EU Type Approval Regulations.</p>  <p>  ​Given that a comprehensive approach to improved road safety requires ever improving vehicle safety standards, the road safety benefits that can be accrued from the application of advanced vehicle technologies to both the national and EU vehicle fleet (passenger cars, light and heavy commercial vehicles etc.) are substantial.  It is with this in mind that I have joined with my European counterparts in requesting that the EU Commission speed up their review of the EU's General and Pedestrian Safety Regulations, and that they come forward with a proposal for ambitious new vehicle safety standards in 2017 to assist Member States to halve the number of road deaths across the EU by 2020.</p></reply>

Any future approach to the question of who would be responsible for an autonomous vehicle would have to be considered carefully, and I would anticipate that this would be addressed ultimately at EU level.</p>  <p>  Around the world, industry and research groups are working on technologies which are transferring driving functions from human drivers to computer systems.  While some of these new technologies are taking over certain parts of the driving function, others are intended to fully replace the human driver.  Transferring more of the traditional manual driving function to automated systems may mitigate the risks associated with human error as a factor in many road traffic collisions.  However, the potential impact of the deployment of autonomous vehicles raises many questions, the answers to which are multifaceted involving ethical, legal, technical and economic dimensions.</p>  <p>  The European Commission is looking to develop a European strategy on connected and automated driving and is currently in the process of developing Regulations to support its future implementation.  It is expected that the Commission's Connected Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) deployment platform will furnish EU Member States with various policy recommendations for the development of a roadmap for C-ITS and the identification of solutions for critical areas of concern in relation to such vehicles, as well as facilitating the development of a shared vision for the interoperable deployment of C-ITS.</p></reply>

With regard to existing infrastructure, my Department funds an on-going programme of accessibility improvement grants to upgrade existing public transport infrastructure and facilities.  This programme is being managed by the National Transport Authority (NTA) on behalf of my Department.</p>  <p> I understand that at present at least 84 out of the 143 railway stations on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network have received accessibility upgrades or were constructed new to accessibility standards.  Accessibility upgrades are planned for several stations in 2017 and recently construction works commenced at Rathdrum, Mullingar and Leixlip Louisa Bridge stations.  Some lightly used stations may not be fully upgraded and instead, passengers with mobility impairments within the catchment area of these stations will continue to be facilitated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann through the provision of a taxi or hackney to the nearest accessible station; this is arranged at a local level. </p>  <p>  Details regarding rail stations at which wheelchair users can access train services, the amount of advance notice required to access the train service and the hours during which certain stations are unmanned are operational matters for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.

I met with Northern Ireland's Infrastructure Minister, Chris Hazzard on Monday the 12th December under the auspices of the North South Ministerial Council.  This provided an opportunity to further develop co-operation between our respective Departments on strategic transport priorities.  The rail link between Belfast and Dublin was among the issues discussed.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Translink have established a joint Enterprise Board chaired by the CEO's of both companies aimed at implementing improvements to the Enterprise cross border Dublin/Belfast service.</p>  <p>  While the main emphasis of funding for the rail network in the Capital Plan is on the maintenance of the existing network to ensure it remains safe and fit for purpose, funding has been allocated for electrification of the Northern Line as far as Balbriggan.  Funding has also been allocated for the completion of the City Centre Re-signalling Programme and the construction of a new Central Traffic Control Centre which will enable the DART expansion projects to progress as well as generally improving national rail movements including the Enterprise service.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the National Transport Authority (NTA) recently launched a public consultation process on the Rail Review report which was jointly prepared by NTA and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  The purpose of the consultation exercise is to open up a public discussion on the role of rail in Ireland and the funding of the rail network and services.  The public consultation process will run until 18 January and the NTA will then prepare a report about the process which I intend to bring to Government.  No decisions will be made on the future of the rail network until the public consultation process has concluded and been evaluated.</p></reply>

The decision to proceed with new Metro North followed.  Funding for the project is provided under the Government's current Capital Plan, allowing initially for the planning and design phases of the project, followed by the construction phase which is expected to commence in 2021 with a view to delivering the project by 2026/27.</p>  <p>  The DART Underground project remains a key element of integrated transport for the GDA and implementation of the overall DART Expansion programme is proposed in the NTA's Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016 - 2035.  The Capital Plan provides funding for redesign and planning for the revised lower cost DART Underground.  It also funds other elements of the overall DART Expansion Programme including electrification of the Northern line to extend the DART to Balbriggan.  Subject to availability of funding and approval of the business case for the project, it is envisaged that the Balbriggan DART extension will commence in 2020.</p>  <p>  Obviously, I would like to see some of these projects progressed sooner, but funding remains quite constrained.  If additional funding becomes available in the next few years, although there will be many competing demands, I will be making a strong case for additional investment in public transport to support economic growth, social needs, and contribute to our climate mitigation targets.</p></reply>

There are reports of large increases for existing policy holders and significant difficulties in obtaining insurance for new operators.  The implications of the current insurance difficulties faced by those in the taxi sector are of serious concern to me.</p>  <p>  The Minister for Finance has established a task force to review policy in the insurance sector.  As part of its work, it is examining the factors which have led in recent times to the significant increase in motor insurance costs and will be recommending steps to influence the situation.  The difficulties of taxi and hackney operators in obtaining insurance have been highlighted to the task force by my Department and the National Transport Authority (NTA).  I am advised that the NTA has also had a bi-lateral meeting with the Department of Finance to apprise them of the situation pertaining to small public service vehicle (SPSV) licence holders in relation to both the availability and cost of SPSV insurance.  I understand that a report of the work of the task force will be completed in the coming weeks and the Government will then consider the appropriate actions to be taken.</p></reply>

The latest data available shows that at the end of quarter three this year there were eight site visits by potential investors to County Tipperary.  It is important to note, however, that data on site visits is not necessarily an accurate measure of the level of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) activity in a region or county, partly because approximately 70% of all FDI won by IDA Ireland comes from its existing client base, rather than new companies.</p>  <p>  As Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s core focus is supporting the internationalisation of indigenous companies, it does not arrange site visits of a similar type to IDA Ireland. However, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s regional executives frequently visit Tipperary. For example, Enterprise Ireland staff regularly meet with the Local Authority/LEO/Tipperary Economic Forum to discuss issues in connection with balanced regional development. Enterprise Ireland is also represented on the Tipperary Local Enterprise Office Evaluation Committee.  </p></reply>

There is a clear need to create other employment opportunities in the region and both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working hard with that goal in mind.</p>  <p>  As part of this work, IDA Ireland has developed a detailed brief on the former Suir Pharma facility which is helping to inform the Agency&rsquo;s intensive marketing of the site.  In addition, the remit and scope of the South Tipperary Interagency Group has been expanded to include Suir Pharma.  This group will help ensure that state agencies and relevant training bodies provide the maximum support possible to former employees of the company. </p>  <p>  The progress made by the wider South East region, however, has been heartening.  A number of Pharma companies, for example, have created new jobs there in recent years.  Unemployment in the South East has fallen from 20.1% in 2011 to 10.4% by the end of September 2016.  Efforts are continuing to reduce joblessness further, including through the Action Plan for Jobs for the South East.  This plan targets, in particular, the creation of new jobs in manufacturing and international financial services and I am confident that we will see continued investment in these sectors there in the future. </p></reply>

The company undertook then to work closely with IDA Ireland to find an alternative buyer for the site.  While such a buyer has not yet been identified, the Agency continues to actively market the facility for new investors as a going concern.  The IDA is aided in this by a detailed brief it has developed on the facility and its existing workforce.</p>  <p>  More broadly, the Agency has been very active in its attempts to secure new foreign direct investment projects for the Mid-West over the past 18 months.  IDA Ireland-sponsored site visits to the county, for example, have increased.  There were nine in 2014, which rose to twelve in 2015. By the end of September this year, there had already been thirteen.  Progress is also being made in terms of job creation. In 2015, employment in IDA Ireland client companies in the region increased by 6%, representing a net change of 1,052 jobs.</p></reply>

In the first three quarters of 2016, there were 489 site visits countrywide.  The breakdown of those visits by region and county is provided in the enclosed table, which also includes figures for 2015 for comparison.  Data on site visits for the final quarter of 2016 will be available early next year.</p><p>I want to stress that regional development is a priority of mine, as it is for this Government.  Growing and sustaining foreign direct investment outside of the country&rsquo;s main urban areas is a key part of our efforts in this context.  To achieve that, we have to continue to make the case to prospective investors that regional Ireland can be a suitable location for their businesses.  Increasing site visits to regional locations forms part of that approach.  In 2015, 57% of site visits were to locations outside Dublin, up from 43% in 2014.  The figures available for 2016 indicate that this trend is continuing.</p><p>We must remember, however, that a company&rsquo;s ultimate choice of location can be influenced by a number of factors.  This includes access to talent, proximity to transport hubs and the supply of suitable property.  IDA Ireland actively tries to encourage client companies to locate outside Dublin but the final decision of where to situate always rests with the company itself. </p><p><b>Site Visits by County and Region 2015 to end Quarter 3 of 2016</b><table><tr><th>Region</th><th>County</th><th>2015</th><th>2016 to Q3</th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>Dublin</td><td>242</td><td>204</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>Kildare</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>Meath</td><td>7</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-East</td><td>Wicklow</td><td>7</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>Cavan</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>Louth</td><td>20</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>North-East</td><td>Monaghan</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>North-West</td><td>Donegal</td><td>5</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>North-West</td><td>Leitrim</td><td>8</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>North-West</td><td>Sligo</td><td>15</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Laois</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Longford</td><td>2</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Offaly</td><td>8</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Midlands</td><td>Westmeath</td><td>28</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>Clare</td><td>12</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West</td><td>Limerick</td><td>40</td><td>39</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mid-West &amp;amp; South-East</td><td>Tipperary*</td><td>12</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Carlow</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Kilkenny</td><td>10</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Wexford</td><td>4</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>South-East</td><td>Waterford</td><td>31</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>South &ndash;West </td><td>Kerry</td><td>6</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>South &ndash;West</td><td>Cork</td><td>48</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>Galway</td><td>41</td><td>33</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>Mayo</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>West</td><td>Roscommon</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>565</td><td>489</td></tr></table>*Tipperary is divided into two ridings &ndash; north and south.

These regulations transposed the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU into Irish law and replaced the European Communities (Low Voltage Electrical Equipment) Regulations 1992 and 1994 which implemented the requirements of the previous Low Voltage Directive 73/23/EEC.</p>  <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of domestic and EU competition and consumer law in the State and, as such, is charged with enforcing S.I. 345 of 2016.  Section 9 (5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions, including carrying out investigations.  As investigations and enforcement matters generally are part of the day-to-day operational work of the CCPC, I, as Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have no direct function in the matter. </p>  <p>  However, I understand from the CCPC that it examined a number of consignments (including mobile phone chargers) that were referred by the Customs authorities under Regulation (EC) no 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 (setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products).  In these consignments where phone chargers were found to be unsafe or not compliant with the requirements of the regulations, the CCPC instructed the Customs authorities to suspend the importation and the products were detained in order to protect consumers.</p>  <p>  Matters relating to fake or counterfeit products do not come within the remit of the legislation enforced by the CCPC: they come under the remit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, or Revenue and Customs authorities.  However, where the CCPC receives information relating to fake or counterfeit products in the course of an investigation that information is forwarded to the relevant authority by the CCPC.  I understand that in July 2014 the CCPC uncovered information relating to the sale of possible counterfeit mobile phone chargers in the Cork area and forwarded that information to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in Cork. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na subsequently conducted their own investigation which resulted in the successful prosecution of the retailer in 2015. </p></reply>

The Commission has sufficient scope to examine both the issue of placing children for adoption at home and abroad, as well as to examine situations in which the child&rsquo;s parentage was concealed, either by omission or sometimes, by illegal means.</p>  <p>  However, it is important to be clear that a Commission of Investigation is not designed or structured to adjudicate on individual behaviours, nor impose penalties, as the legislative basis for a fact-finding Commission does not provide the same constitutional and legal protections for individuals as are present in the criminal justice system. Therefore, a Commission&rsquo;s investigations are not criminal investigations. That being said, if the Commission&rsquo;s reports reveal concerns of a potentially criminal nature these will of course be referred to the appropriate investigative and prosecution authorities for further any appropriate action.</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;51m for current expenditure is available from my Department in 2016 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.  The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people.  It is estimated that the voluntary youth services involve approximately 1,400 youth work staff in 477 projects and 40,000 volunteers working throughout the country.</p>  <p>  I am aware that in 2014, proposals were made to provide short-term funding towards the cost of a youth worker post in Mitchelstown, and that my Department was not in a position to provide funding at that time.   </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a number of funding schemes supporting youth services were the subject of a Value for Money and Policy Review in 2014.  The review involved an in-depth scrutiny of the impact youth service provision has on young people&rsquo;s lives.  The review made a number of recommendations for the future operation of the youth schemes and their development in the years ahead. </p>  <p>  Work on the development of a new funding scheme has been prioritised by my Department and consultations with youth services are continuing with a view to introducing the new youth funding programme in line with the review over the coming years. </p>  <p>  My Department has embarked on an exercise, in conjunction with Pobal and each Education and Training Board (ETB) Youth Officer, which will map youth service provision across the State.  This mapping exercise will assist my Department and the relevant ETB in developing a detailed socio-demographic profile in terms of both population numbers and deprivation levels.  It is my intention that this mapping exercise will inform future development and investment in youth services.</p></reply>

We have a number of commitments in the Programme for Government relating to enabling access to high quality and affordable childcare.  I am determined to deliver on these commitments. </p>  <p>  The introduction of the Affordable Childcare Scheme (ACS) in September 2017 will provide more accessible and more affordable childcare both on a universal and a targeted basis, to families.  This will represent a major milestone in childcare in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Since September 2016, the extension of ECCE had made free pre-school available, for 15 hours per week, to all children from the time they turn three, until they go to school.  Children can enter at three points in the year.  On average, children will benefit from 61 weeks, up from the current provision of 38 weeks.  Access to the average 61 weeks of ECCE can reduce the cost of childcare by &euro;4,000 per child.  The current ECCE programme is accommodating 67,000 children and this figure will increase to 127,000 next year.</p>  <p>  My Department extended the terms of the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) Programme in March 2016 so that it could be provided by private childcare providers across the country as well as community/not-for-profit providers.  This was to ensure that eligible families, regardless of where they live, can access this important childcare subvention.  The full rate of CCS reduces childcare costs by &euro;95 per week, and is available to parents in receipt of social welfare payments including the One Parent Family Payment or Family Income Supplement.  This Scheme will continue in existence until the new Scheme is introduced in September 2017.</p>  <p>  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to carrying out an independent review of the cost of providing childcare.  This review will be overseen by my Department and will include analysis of the potential benefits and risks of imposing price caps on childcare providers.  The results will be considered in the context of the new Affordable Childcare Scheme.</p>  <p>  The Department is committed to the provision of childcare options for families that reflect international evidence on how to attain the best outcomes for children.  The Inter-Departmental Group (IDG) on Future Investment in Childcare in Ireland was established in 2015 to identify and assess policies and future options for increasing the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.  The IDG examined international evidence on childcare provision, specifically those that addressed affordability and quality.  Supply side measures were found to be more optimal for reform and quality improvement.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme is an example of a supply side approach and reflects a core recommendation of the IDG to replace the existing targeted childcare schemes, which are administratively complex and inadequate in terms of accessibility, with a single, streamlined and more user-friendly scheme.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme responds to a specific need to increase the affordability, quality and supply of early years and school-age care and education services in Ireland.</p></reply>

The third ship in the programme, L&Eacute; William Butler Yeats was commissioned in to service in October 2016.  A contract for an additional sister ship was placed with Babcock International in June 2016 at a cost of &euro;54.3m, bringing investment in the new ships programme to over &euro;250 million since 2010.  The fourth ship is scheduled for delivery in mid 2018.</p>  <p>  This aligns with the project planning process in place under the White Paper on Defence which will determine the Defence Organisation&rsquo;s maritime capability requirements. </p>  <p>  The requirement for a fourth ship is regarded as urgent and expedient given the age of the older remaining ships in the fleet, L&Eacute; Orla, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Eithne all of which are over thirty years of age.  The additional ship will allow the Naval Service meet its patrol day targets with due cognisance to the significant additional operational requirements for the Naval fleet under Operation Pontus in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>  <p>  The White Paper provides for the replacement of the current flagship, L&Eacute; Eithne, by a multi-role vessel (MRV).  L&Eacute; Eithne was built in 1984.  It is the Government&rsquo;s intent that this new vessel will provide a flexible and adaptive capability for a wide range of maritime tasks, both at home and overseas.     </p>  <p>  In addition, the two existing Coastal Patrol Vessels, L&Eacute; Ciara and L&Eacute; Orla are due for replacement in the coming years (also built in 1984).  It is outlined in the White Paper that these ships will be replaced with similar type vessels with countermine and counter IED capabilities.</p>  <p>  Work has commenced in the Department of Defence on the next phase of the Naval Service Vessel Replacement Programme.  The specifications for the replacement vessels will be drawn up and a public tender competition will be instigated to cover the supply of the future ships within the overall available funding envelope.</p></reply>

Government Departments and other Public Bodies, including Westmeath County Council, have been invited to declare any interest in acquiring the property.  To date no interest has been identified. </p>  <p>  However, in the context of its potential future use contributing to the positive development of Mullingar, my Department remains open to viable proposals to these ends from Westmeath County Council.  Earlier this year, on my instructions, officials from my Department attended a public meeting in Mullingar on the future use of the barracks.  Both at that meeting and subsequently the position as outlined herein was clearly stated.  Following that meeting a local group was established in order to prepare a feasibility study on the future use of the barracks, to date no such report has been furnished to my Department.  Also Officials from my Department recently met with the CEO and officials of Longford and Westmeath Educational and Training Board regarding possible use of Mullingar Barracks.  To date I have received no proposals from the Board regarding their future use of the barracks.   </p>  <p>  As the Barracks is no longer required for military purposes the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the Barracks cannot be sustained.  The disposal of the property by public auction will now be actively progressed in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s policy and recent practice to dispose of surplus property no longer required for military purposes.  My officials will be contacting all existing occupants of the Barracks to discuss their future occupation of the Barracks.    </p></reply>

The current Irish contingent, the 54<sup>th</sup>Infantry Group, comprising 130 personnel, is based in UNDOF Headquarters in Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the Area of Separation.  It operates in the role of a Quick Reaction Force, which is on standby to assist with ongoing operations within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility.  Six (6) other Defence Forces personnel are also deployed in UNDOF Headquarters. </p><p>Since its temporary relocation from a number of positions in September 2014 and pending the time when UNDOF returns fully to the area of separation, UNDOF has, in line with its mandate from UNSCR 350, continued to maintain credible presence in the Golan and use its best efforts to implement its mandate.  On 14 November 2016, UNDOF completed the initial phase of the incremental return of the mission to Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the Area of Separation where Fijian and Nepalese troops are now based.</p><p>In this context, UNDOF continues to engage with the parties on practical arrangements to allow the Force to continue to maintain the ceasefire, monitor, verify and report on violations of the Disengagement of Forces Agreement and exercise its critical liaison functions with the parties in order to implement its mandate.</p><p>In the most recent report on UNDOF, the UN Secretary-General has stated that the continued presence of UNDOF in the area remains essential and that both Israel and the Syrian Arab Republic have stated their continued commitment to the Disengagement of Forces Agreement and the presence of UNDOF. </p><p>Participation by the Defence Forces in UNDOF is reviewed by the Government on an annual basis.  On 21 June 2016, the Government approved continued participation in the UNDOF mission for a period of twelve months up to June 2017.  The Defence Forces are making a valuable contribution to this important mission.  The presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring the continuing ceasefire between Israel and Syria and in the wider Middle East region.</p><p>Defence Forces have in the past been deployed to Darfur and South Sudan.

Leadership training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that personnel are prepared for exercising command authority across the full range of military functions both at home and overseas in international operations.  Skills training is the medium through which the Defence Forces ensures that its personnel have the requisite individual, specialist, and crew skills.  Career training and education provides the organisation with the necessary pool of leaders and commanders at all levels.  Collective Training allows military personnel to use their individual, crew, specialist and career training together to develop integrated and coherent combat forces. </p>  <p>  The scheduling of training in the Defence Forces, including the Reserve, is underpinned by an analysis of training needed to meet operational output requirements and capability development needs.  A long-term strategy is adopted with current planning horizons out to 2021.   </p>  <p>  The Defence Forces seek to constantly benchmark training across all three arms against best military and academic practice.  Military best practice is ensured by implementing a policy of standardisation that is in line with EU and NATO/Partnership for Peace partners.  Academic best practice is ensured by benchmarking courses through accreditation under the National Framework of Qualifications which is validated by Quality and Qualifications Ireland.  The Defence Forces delivers military programmes and modules meeting national and international standards.  The Defence Forces also engages with external educational institutions in order to facilitate organisational learning.  This engagement with national and international educational institutions, military and civilian, aims to ensure that the Defence Forces retains currency with regards to best international practice.  </p></reply>

As of the 31<sup>st</sup>October 2016, the strength of the PDF (whole-time equivalent) was 9,110 personnel and the total effective strength of the Reserve was 2,092.</p><p>The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services.  Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad.  The significant turnover of personnel that is the norm in military services requires targeted recruitment so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels.  It is envisaged that there will be a total intake of circa 700 inductees to the Defence Forces, consisting of General Service recruits and Cadets, in 2016.</p><p>With the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.  To that end, it is envisaged that momentum will be maintained to encourage new entrants with the anticipated launch in early 2017 of a series of Defence Forces recruitment competitions. </p><p>In terms of ongoing training standards for the Reserve, the 2015 White Paper on Defence sets out a developmental path for the organisation.  On a day to day basis, the Reserve undertakes training in preparation to assist the PDF, when required.  Training across all three arms of the Defence Forces is constantly benchmarked against best military and academic practice.  Training procedures are constantly reviewed in order to ensure that the men and women of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann are fully prepared to meet the challenges of the ever changing security environment. </p><p>With regard to RDF training, a key recommendation of the Value for Money Review of the RDF, published in November 2012, was to ensure that all effective members of the Reserve were afforded the opportunity to undertake annual training.  In 2015, a total of 1,475 Reservists utilised 22,548 mandays in pursuit of professional development through career courses at all levels, including recruit training, skills courses, continuous professional development seminars and participation in integrated exercises.  In 2016, Subhead A.5 provided for a budget of &euro;2.150m of which &euro;2.068m provides for a total of 30,000 Paid Training Mandays for members of the Reserve.  This provision is sufficient having regard to the existing strength of the RDF and the voluntary nature of Reserve training.</p><p>A key challenge is to recruit and train sufficient personnel to meet the Reserve establishment provided for in the White Paper.  Recruitment to the Reserve remains ongoing.  I am committed to accelerating induction into the Reserve, in tandem with expanded recruitment into the PDF.</p></reply>

Applications to join the Defence Forces are open to all persons who fulfil certain criteria.  The criteria that apply to all applicants for General Service Recruitment Competitions require that they must undergo psychometric tests, a fitness test, a competency based interview, a medical examination and undergo Security Clearance.  Applicants must be at least 18 years of age and under 25 years of age on the closing date of applications for the Army, and must be at least 18 years of age and under 27 years of age on the closing date of applications for the Naval Service. </p>  <p>  No formal education qualifications are required to join the Defence Forces as a recruit.  However, applicants must satisfy the Interview Board and the Recruiting Officer that they possess a sufficient standard of education for service in the Permanent Defence Force. </p>  <p>  Recruitment to the Army and Naval Service is ongoing from a General Service Recruitment competition which was launched in April 2016.  Cadetships competitions are normally held on an annual basis.   </p>  <p>  In line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment to a strengthened approach across the economy to social responsibility, the Programme for Partnership Government and the White Paper on Defence included a commitment to introduce a pilot Defence Forces employment support scheme with the direct involvement of the Defence Forces.  The pilot scheme successfully ran from Monday 20 June 2016 to Friday 26 August 2016 in Gormanston Camp, with 25 participants. </p>  <p>  The objective of the scheme is to help develop a path to economic independence for participants, aged between 18 and 24 years, who are at a serious disadvantage owing to their current socio-economic situation.  It encompassed an innovative training programme of 10 weeks duration, consisting of 5 weeks of training by the Defence Forces interspersed with 5 weeks of education-orientated training by the Baldoyle Training Centre of the Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire Education and Training Board.  The scheme provided participants with new skills, knowledge, competencies and self-development that have enhanced their capacity to pursue employment, work experience or further educational opportunities.  An evaluation of the pilot scheme has recently been completed and I expect to receive a report on this shortly.  When I have considered the report I will make a final decision on the roll-out of the Scheme, however it is expected that up to two programmes could be run in 2017.   </p>  <p>  For the duration of the programme participants were in close contact with a military environment.  Although this should help them become more familiar with what it is like to be a soldier and also help them to decide whether they might like to be one, it should be noted there is not a direct route from this programme into the Defence Forces.  Those who would like to join the Defence Forces would have to apply through the normal recruitment competitions but I would expect that their exposure to a military environment together with the skills they will attain through participation in the scheme and the improvement in their standard of physical fitness should be an advantage to them.</p></reply>

Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces in the White Paper on Defence is the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP) which, in practice, means to provide assistance and support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when requested to do so.  The Defence Forces retain a wide range of specialist skills which can be deployed in such circumstances, including for terrorist incidents.  </p><p>There is ongoing and close liaison between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Defence Forces regarding security matters, including ATCP deployments and a wide variety of military training activities are specifically designed to counter or respond to possible security emergencies.  Regular coordination and liaison meetings also take place between the Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in relation to ATCP issues. </p><p>  The full spectrum of Defence Forces personnel and equipment are available for deployment in response to any security and other emergencies that may arise.  Within the Defence Forces, both the Ordnance Corps and the Army Ranger Wing specialise in providing an immediate response to emergency incidents that might require their highly specialised capabilities. </p><p>  The Ordnance Corps consists of a number of Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams which are on standby 24/7 to respond when a request for assistance is received from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with suspect devices. </p><p>  The Army Ranger Wing is an integral unit of the Defence Forces whose roles include provision of specialist ATCP support to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The need for a high level of preparedness to deal with any requests for Special Forces operations is inherent in the unit&rsquo;s mission.  Members are trained to the highest levels of motivation, physical fitness and skill at arms for their specialist role.  The ARW is on standby 24/7 to be called upon to undertake duties in any part of the country. </p><p>  I can confirm that the Defence Forces keep their operational plans and response capabilities for dealing with a wide range of threats under constant review.  It is my priority as Minister with responsibility for Defence to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained to the greatest extent possible.  On an ongoing basis I receive advice in this regard from the Chief of Staff and he has confirmed to me that he is satisfied that the Defence Forces are equipped and resourced to respond as appropriate to any such events were they to occur in this State. </p></reply>

Where the capability exists, relevant training is delivered in-house by highly trained and knowledgeable training instructors.  Where appropriate, Defence Forces personnel are also sent on relevant external courses, both within Ireland and internationally. </p>  <p>  Ireland participates in NATO Partnership for Peace (PfP) which has provided the Defence Forces with the opportunities to enhance their capabilities for peacekeeping and preventative and crisis management operations under UN mandates.  Membership of the Partnership for Peace has allowed the Defence Forces to gain access to NATO standards &ndash; which are internationally recognised as representing best military practice.  The scope of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement is focused on enhancing interoperability and familiarity with operating procedures in a multinational environment and is but one means by which the Defence Forces liaise with other European Defence Forces on matters of mutual interest. </p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the Defence Forces, including access to equipment and modern technologies and training, enables the Defence Forces to carry out their numerous roles both at home and overseas, including any roles that are assigned to them by Government in any emergency situations that may arise in the role of Aid to the Civil Power.</p></reply>

However, on a routine basis the Air Corps monitors and communicates with foreign military aircraft where such aircraft are flying in the airspace in the vicinity of Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, where air traffic control is provided by the Defence Forces.  </p>  <p>  The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence (2015) provides for periodic updates to consider progress with implementation and any revisions required.  As stated in the White Paper, should additional funding beyond that required to maintain existing Air Corps&rsquo; capabilities become available, the development of a radar surveillance capability is a priority for the Air Corps.  Funding for this is not provided in the current resource envelope and any future decisions in this regard will be in the context of the ongoing security environment and any associated developments.  The Air Corps&rsquo; existing Pilatus PC9 aircraft provide a very limited air to air and air to ground capacity.  Whilst the development of a more capable air combat intercept capability will be considered over the lifetime of the White Paper, at this stage there are no plans in this regard.  However, these matters are kept under constant review.</p></reply>

Government Departments and other Public Bodies, including Westmeath County Council, have been invited to declare any interest in acquiring the property.  To date no interest has been identified.  However, in the context of its potential future use contributing to the positive development of Mullingar, my Department remains open to viable proposals to these ends from Westmeath County Council.</p>  <p>  Earlier this year, on my instructions, officials from my Department attended a public meeting in Mullingar on the future use of the barracks.  Both at that meeting and subsequently the position as outlined herein was clearly stated.  Following that meeting a local group was established in order to prepare a feasibility study on the future use of the barracks, several months have passed since that meeting to date no such report has been furnished to my Department. </p>  <p>  As the Barracks is no longer required for military purposes the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the Barracks cannot be sustained.  The disposal of the property by public auction must therefore be actively progressed in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s policy and recent practice to dispose of surplus property no longer required for military purposes.  My officials will be contacting all existing occupants of the Barracks to discuss their future occupation of the Barracks.    </p></reply>

Kildare in November 2010, the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP) was bilocated with offices in both Newbridge and Dublin.  The staff however, were located in Newbridge on a day to day basis but due to the operational requirements of the National Emergency Co-Ordination Centre (NECC) the staff moved back to the Dublin Offices in July 2012.   </p>  <p>  A National Emergency Co-Ordination Centre (NECC) was established in 2007 where Ministers and/or Senior Civil Servants can convene to co-ordinate national responses to a major emergency.  The NECC has been used on an ongoing basis since it was established and the NECC is equipped with robust communications systems and support facilities and is managed by the OEP.  The NECC is available to all Government Departments and Agencies for use in emergency planning and response.  It is the venue for meetings of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, Subgroups on Emergency Planning and the National Steering Group for the implementation of the Framework for Major Emergency Management.  The Severe Weather National Co-ordination Group and other similar National Co-ordination Groups for other emergencies meet in the Centre when the need arises.  The Centre is also used by a number of Departments and Agencies to hold meetings and briefings.  In 2012, in order to support the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and service the Departments and Agencies who avail of the Centre, the Office of Emergency Planning consolidated to one location in Dublin and is based permanently in the NECC, Agriculture House (2 East), Kildare Street, Dublin 2.   </p>  <p>  Cabinet approval was not sought for this relocation.  </p></reply>
