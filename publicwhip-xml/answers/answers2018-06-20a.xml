If a landlord is terminating the tenancy on the grounds that he or she intends to substantially refurbish or renovate the dwelling in a way that requires the dwelling to be vacated for that purpose, the notice of termination must include a statement:</p>  <p>  (a) specifying the nature of the intended works and providing a copy of any related planning permission. Where planning permission is not required, the notice or statement must specify the name of the contractor and the proposed dates for the works; and</p>  <p>  (b) that the landlord is required to offer to the tenant a tenancy of the dwelling if it becomes available for re-letting within a period of 6 months, subject to certain conditions. </p>  <p>  Notice periods for the termination of a tenancy by a landlord vary, depending on the duration of the tenancy, but periods of up to 224 days are required.  </p>  <p>  On 23 November 2017, the RTB published a comprehensive set of guidelines on what constitutes substantial refurbishment or renovation for the purposes of a section 34 ground for tenancy termination. These guidelines are available on the RTB website. I have asked my Department to keep the implementation of the guidelines  under review and I am open to placing them on a statutory footing, if experience suggests that this is necessary.</p></reply>

Just under 45,000 households have had their housing need met by the end of year 2 of the Rebuilding Ireland Plan &ndash; 33% of those targeted under the 6 year Plan as a whole.</p>  <p>  Last October, I made it clear that the orientation of local authority social housing delivery was to shift towards greater construction activity, including the utilisation of lands in local authority ownership.  Good progress has been made in this regard - at the end of 2017, the social housing construction programme included 846 schemes (or phases), delivering over 13,400 homes &ndash; a very substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the programme at end 2016. </p>  <p>  Earlier this year, I advised all local authorities of revised minimum Social Housing Targets both for 2018 and also for the multi-annual period to 2021. The targets  are based on the proportion of the Summary of Social Housing Assessments (SSHA) appropriate to each local authority. The results of the 2017 summary show that there were 85,799 households deemed qualified for, and in need of, social housing support, which is a decrease of 6.3% (5,801) in net need compared to the 2016 summary.</p>  <p>  In 2018, I expect to see nearly 26,000 households having their housing need met, with over 4,400 new build social housing homes to be delivered through local authorities and approved housing bodies, including through the Part V mechanism. As the ambition for social housing construction activity is targeted to continue to increase significantly, it is critical that local authorities, working with AHBs, focus on developing expanded pipelines of new social housing build projects. In order to support local authorities and AHBs to deliver, my Department has streamlined its approval processes, established a Delivery Office to provide technical advice, as well as supporting local authorities in acquiring additional staffing resources.  </p>  <p>  Homelessness, particularly family homelessness, remains a key priority of Government.  In 2017, 4,729 individuals exited homelessness, which was a 54% increase on the previous year. There are now 21 Family Hubs in place and these are the preferred first response in terms of emergency accommodation, rather than hotels. Through the dedicated efforts of exit teams, 2,080 families left hotels last year, the majority of them moving into homes rather than hubs. While the supply of social housing is ramping up, we will continue to work to find the most suitable and appropriate solutions for homeless families and individuals.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-20a.20.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1264" speakername="Damien English" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062000069#WRA01500"><p>The taking-in-charge of housing developments is a matter for the relevant local authority under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended). My Department launched the National Taking-in-Charge Initiative (NTICI) in April 2016 to trial new approaches and working methods in supporting and accelerating overall national and local action on the taking-in-charge process of housing estates, including estates with developer-provided water services infrastructure (DPI).</p>  <p>  Under the terms of the NTICI, which was underpinned by &euro;10m in funding, developments subject to valid taking-in-charge applications were eligible for inclusion in the associated call for funding proposals.  Ultimately, &euro;7.7 million of the allocated funding was paid to local authorities in respect of 330 developments, containing some 13,400 homes.</p>  <p>  Findings and recommendations from the NTICI process will be included in a report on the initiative that I intend to publish shortly. The publication of the NTICI report will be of value to local authorities and other stakeholders in applying the lessons from the pilot authorities, in a more general roll-out of a streamlined approach to taking-in-charge.  I expect that the initiative will contribute to further streamlining of the taking-in-charge process, through, for example, securing coordination with capital works by Irish Water. </p>  <p>  In addition, the recently published National Development Plan includes provision of &euro;31 million for the period 2018-2021 for developer-provided infrastructure. This is clear evidence of the Government's commitment to transition from the pilot phase under NTICI to a programme phase, commencing with an estimates provision of &euro;3m in 2018 on which further details will be announced in due course.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-20a.25.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062000069#WRA01900"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 59 and 84 together.</p>  <p>  A motion to refer the Eighth Report of the Convention on the Constitution, which dealt with economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to housing, to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, was passed by the D&aacute;il on 28 September 2017 and by the Seanad on 11 October 2017. This Committee will consider the issues raised by the Deputies. </p>  <p>  In relation to the delivery of social housing, strong progress on implementation of the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan is already being made.  Almost 26,000 households had their housing needs met in 2017- that is equivalent to 100 households each working day of the week. Furthermore, the number of social housing homes built in 2017 was more than three times the number built in 2016.</p>  <p>  Following a Review of the Plan in 2017, the overall target for social housing delivery was increased to 50,000 housing units and there is now an increased emphasis on direct builds under the Plan. To underpin the increased ambition, additional capital funding was secured under Budget 2018, increasing the overall funding from &euro;5.35 billion to &euro;6 billion.</p>  <p>  In relation to affordable housing, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes, and that analysis is progressing well.  </p>  <p>  With regard to cost rental, I am determined for it to become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. It is clear that there is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working to get our first cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly. In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development. The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly.   </p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I have decided to provide additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am re-directing the &euro;50m funding for Phase 2 of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced &euro;25m to &euro;75m.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  In order to drive early activity, I will be inviting applications for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund by the end of next week.</p></reply>

Recognising that people want a choice of affordable purchase and rental, depending on their stage of life and circumstances, both are being progressed through a range of initiatives.  </p>  <p>  In order to underpin progress in this area, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes, and that analysis is progressing well.  Significant progress has been made on individual projects, such as the O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road sites in the Dublin City Council area.</p>  <p>  With regard to cost rental, I am determined for it to become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. It is clear that there is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working to get our first cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly. In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development. The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly.   </p>  <p>  In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I have decided to provide additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am re-directing the &euro;50m funding for Phase 2 of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the Fund from the previously announced &euro;25m to &euro;75m.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  In order to drive early activity, I will be inviting applications for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund by the end of next week.   </p>  <p>  In relation to Adamstown, South Dublin County Council is the specified Development Agency for the Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) in that area and is committed to working with the landowners to ensure the successful implementation of the SDZ Planning Scheme.  This will contribute to the construction of a mix of tenure types, the creation of an attractive place for people to live at more affordable prices and rents, and the creation of a sustainable, integrated community.  Arising from agreements made under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, Adamstown will deliver 2,000 homes by 2021, including houses at more affordable price points.  </p>  <p>  While delivery from the State's land bank is a critical instrument in increasing the supply of affordable housing, the Government has also taken measures to incentivise development on privately owned sites and to discourage land hoarding. The planning process has been de-risked and streamlined through the new Strategic Housing Development process and the number of new homes granted planning permissions in Q1 2018 are up by 80% compared to Q1 2017.</p>  <p>  In addition, the vacant site levy is playing an important role in countering land hoarding and ensuring that key sites are developed without delay.  This will be strengthened shortly through new legislation to increase the maximum annual levy from 3% to 7% from 2019 and I will be continuing to keep the operation of the levy under review.</p></reply>

All three sites under the HLI are identified as strategic development and regeneration areas within the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022.</p>  <p>  Mixed-tenure developments are an important policy objective of Rebuilding Ireland and uphold the principle of sustainable mixed communities, where housing needs are not subject to rigid segregation based on income levels. They also provide an opportunity to see major sites developed more quickly, and integrated into existing communities and areas. </p>  <p>  The approach which the City Council is taking to the St. Michael&rsquo;s project envisages the potential to yield over 400 mixed-tenure homes and the City Council has determined that the homes will be provided on the basis of a 30% social, 20% affordable, and 50% private tenure mix. The council has also agreed the methodology for community consultation, as set out in the feasibility study presented through a community consultative forum.</p>  <p>  In line with good governance procedures, a project board, which includes representation from my Department and the National Development Finance Agency, has been established and is working to progress the development of this site.</p>  <p>  As regards the delivery of affordable homes from this site, while it is ultimately a matter for the City Council to decide whether these are to be affordable homes to purchase or are delivered as cost-rental homes, I firmly believe that there is a need to ensure that the rental sector, particularly in our cities and major urban areas, is accessible and affordable.  In order to do this, we need to invest in a different type of rental offering, a so called cost-rental sector which operates between the social and private market sectors. In that regard, we are learning from pilot projects and the examination of similar models operating elsewhere. </p>  <p>  Dublin City Council, my Department and the NDFA have at this point carried out detailed modelling and financial appraisal on this site, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development. The work of that multi-disciplinary team is at an advanced stage.</p>  <p>  In addition, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council has under consideration the development of in excess of 500 homes at their Shanganagh Castle site, comprising a mix of tenures, including social and affordable homes. This ambitious proposal can deliver a new residential neighbourhood, including houses, apartments and duplexes and all associated infrastructure, including roads, footpaths, services and landscaping on the site. </p>  <p>  My Department has met with the Council on a number of occasions over recent months with regard to progressing this development. It should be noted that I have also committed almost &euro;5m under the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) to build public infrastructure, which will assist in opening up the site for early development.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to engage proactively with the two local authorities involved in order to support early progress through procurement and onwards to construction on both of these significant sites.</p></reply>

The level of contribution, and the types of development to which development contributions should apply, is therefore determined at local authority level in accordance with the powers vested in elected members, having regard to the governing legislative and policy framework. </p>  <p>  In essence, the charging of such development contributions is intended to partly fund the provision of essential public infrastructure and the servicing of land for private development, without which development could not proceed. The money collected in this regard must be ring-fenced and used to fund public infrastructure and facilities servicing new development, for example, roads, footpaths, public lighting and open spaces.</p>  <p>  My role as Minister is to provide the necessary legislative and policy framework within which individual development contribution schemes are adopted by each local authority. In this context, my Department issued statutory guidelines to planning authorities in January 2013 under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 on the implementation of development contribution schemes to which planning authorities are required to have regard in the performance of their planning functions. The 2013 guidelines updated and supplemented non-statutory guidance previously issued to local authorities by my Department by way of Circulars PD 4/2003 and PD 5/2007. </p>  <p>  The 2013 guidelines, inter alia, emphasise the importance of promoting development through the application, where feasible, of reduced development contributions to facilitate development and promote economic activity and job creation in local areas with a particular focus on supporting town centre development and incentivising activity in the areas prioritised for development in the relevant core strategy.   </p>  <p>  In accordance with section 48(5) of the Act, planning authorities are required to forward a copy of any draft development contribution scheme prepared to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, who may make recommendations to the planning authority regarding the terms of the draft scheme. In this context, the development contribution system is monitored and kept under review by my Department and where the need for further planning guidance for development contribution schemes is identified, my Department will develop such guidance as appropriate.</p></reply>

With a fund of up to &euro;750 million, HBFI will have the capacity to fund the supply of approximately 6,000 additional homes in the coming years, thereby making a meaningful impact in addressing the supply shortfall.  The HBFI Bill was published on 18 June and is a priority piece of legislation for the Government. </p>  <p>  The establishment of HBFI has been modelled on the successful operation of NAMA&rsquo;s residential funding team which has facilitated the delivery of circa 7,300 homes since 2014.  Given this experience, I understand that existing NAMA staff may be reassigned to HBFI to ensure that HBFI can benefit from the considerable experience and skills in residential delivery amassed in NAMA. Once HBFI is operational, NAMA will no longer have any role and any staff reassigned from NAMA to HBFI will no longer have any reporting line to NAMA to ensure that there are no conflicts of interest. Ultimately, it will be for the Board of HBFI, once constituted, to determine its precise staffing requirements, having regard to its functions.</p>  <p>  HBFI will play an important part in the Government&rsquo;s overall strategy to increase the supply of new housing. Together with the comprehensive set of actions laid out in Rebuilding Ireland, I am confident that HBFI will help provide a further impetus for the continued increase in home building across the country.</p></reply>

This comprised 1,014 homes delivered by local authorities, 761 build homes delivered by approved housing bodies and a further 522 Part V homes were delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies. In addition, a further 1,757 social homes were provided for new tenants under the Department-funded voids programme. </p><p>The significant expansion of the social housing build programme is evident in the Quarter 4 2017 Social Housing Construction Status Report, which was published on 19 April 2018. The programme includes 846 schemes (or Phases) at the end of last year, delivering 13,400 homes, a very substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the programme a year earlier. At end 2017, 2,592 homes were completed, with another 3,646 under construction and a further 1,912 homes about to go on site.

Turnkeys are a good source of social housing that can often be quickly delivered, at value for money prices. In many cases, these projects would not go ahead without the certainty of the end purchaser and they are of particular use where the local Authority or approved housing body have limited or no lands available for housing in an area.</p></reply>

Of these valid applications, 876 had been assessed and 52% of the valid applications that had been assessed by the Agency had been recommended for approval.  </p>  <p>  Each local authority must have in place a credit committee which makes the final decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the Regulations, the statutory credit policy issued in accordance with the Regulations and having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the scheme is to enable credit-worthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range, where they have been unable to obtain sufficient mortgage finance from a commercial lender.  However, in accordance with the statutory credit policy, as with any other loan, potential borrowers must be credit-worthy and must demonstrate that they have the ability to repay the loan. It would be irresponsible to give individuals approval for loans that may see them placed under undue financial strain. The credit-worthiness checks that are part of the approvals process for the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan, and which may result in individuals being refused, help to safeguard against this eventuality and assist in protecting both the applicant and the Exchequer.</p></reply>

However, during the course of the compilation of the March and April reports, my Department identified that some individuals who had been reported as being in emergency accommodation were in houses and apartments, and a number of local authorities amended their figures to reflect this, following consultation with my Department. </p>  <p>  The long-term housing needs of families and individuals who are in emergency accommodation will be met through a range of social housing supports such as the Housing Assistance Payment scheme and through general social housing allocations.  Significant progress is being made and in 2017, 4,729 individuals exited emergency accommodation into independent tenancies, a 54% increase on the 3,079 recorded in the previous year.   </p>  <p>  My main priority and focus over the coming weeks and months, will continue to be to tackle and reduce the number of individuals and families experiencing homelessness.</p></reply>

With increased investment to deliver 50,000 new social homes by 2021, the significant expansion of the social housing build programme is evident in the Quarter 4 2017 Social Housing Construction Status Report, which was published on 19 April.  The programme includes 846 schemes (or phases) at the end of last year, delivering over 13,400 homes, a very substantial increase on the 8,430 homes in the programme a year earlier. The full report can be accessed at .</p><p>Work is ongoing to update the Rebuilding Ireland Housing Land Map to reflect the relevant elements of the Q4 2017 Social Housing Construction Status Report and the PPP Programme and details will be published on the Map, at the link referred to above, once finalised. </p><p>Details on the number of properties purchased and built in each local authority area are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .</p><p>I have also advised all local authorities of their minimum Social Housing Targets both for 2018 and also for the multi-annual period to 2021, details of which can be accessed on my Department's website at: . </p><p>In order to underpin progress on affordable housing delivery, I have now commenced the relevant provisions of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, the effect of which is to place the new Scheme for affordable purchase on a statutory footing.  From engagements with the local authorities in Dublin, the wider Greater Dublin Area, as well as Cork and Galway cities, their initial estimates suggest that they have lands with the potential to deliver some 4,000 new affordable homes.  My Department is continuing to work with the key local authorities and the Housing Agency to identify sites which would see the level of ambition increase to at least 10,000 new affordable homes, and that analysis is progressing well.  Significant progress has been made on individual projects, such as the O'Devaney Gardens and Oscar Traynor Road sites in the Dublin City Council area.</p><p>With regard to cost rental, I am determined for it to become a major part of our rental landscape in the future. It is clear that there is a gap between social housing and the rental market that needs to be filled, making a sustainable impact on housing affordability, national competitiveness, and the attractiveness of our main urban centres as places to live and work.</p><p>The Housing Agency, D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and a number of Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) have been working to get our first cost rental pilot, at Enniskerry Road, ready for tenders to issue shortly. In parallel, Dublin City Council, my Department and the National Development Finance Agency are undertaking detailed modelling and financial appraisal on a major site, at St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate in Inchicore, to assess its suitability for a significant cost rental development. The work of that multi-disciplinary team is progressing well and should be concluded shortly.</p><p>In order to support local authorities to get their sites ready for affordable housing, I have decided to provide additional funding for enabling infrastructure via the Serviced Sites Fund.  Given that housing-related infrastructure will now be able to avail of funding under the &euro;2 billion Urban Regeneration and Development Fund, I am re-directing the &euro;50m funding for Phase 2 of the Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund to the Serviced Sites Fund, increasing the scale of the fund from the previously announced &euro;25m to &euro;75m.  When local authority co-funding is included, an overall minimum investment of &euro;100 million will be provided to those sites that require infrastructural investment in order for them to be brought into use for affordable housing.  In order to drive early activity, I will be inviting applications for funding under the Serviced Sites Fund by the end of next week.</p><p>From a longer-term strategic perspective, as part of Project Ireland 2040, the Government announced on 16 February its intention to establish a new National Regeneration and Development Agency, which will have a role in managing the State's wider publicly-owned land bank to ensure that overall development needs, including housing, are met. The new Agency will work closely with local authorities, Government Departments, Agencies and other State and semi-State bodies to secure the best use of public lands and ensure the delivery on the objectives of the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan.</p></reply>

As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, i.e. the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p><p>While my Department has overall responsibility for establishing and maintaining an effective regulatory framework for building standards and building control, it has no general statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including dwellings, nor does it have a budget for such matters.</p><p>However, I and my predecessors, have supported homeowners through a number of expert reports and investigations into legacy problems such as the Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) and the Report of the Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks (June 2017). I also published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings (August 2017), which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. The Framework is also of assistance to professional advisors, both in developing strategies to improve fire safety and in developing strategies to enable continued occupation in advance of undertaking the necessary works to ensure compliance with the relevant Building Regulations.  </p><p>Where apartment buildings that are defective from a fire safety perspective come to the attention of the local authority fire services, they work with management companies and other stakeholders to ensure that appropriate levels of fire safety are achieved to minimise the risk to life. Actions are taken on the basis of case by case fire safety assessments.</p><p>Finally, following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department was tasked with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.  The Task Force's report, which was published recently, is available at the following link: </p><p>. </p><p>The report makes a number of recommendations in relation to fire safety in apartment buildings, including, including:</p><p>- the registration of fire stopping sub-contractors;</p><p>- the roles and responsibilities of Building Management Companies e.g. to review and maintain fire safety arrangements, to keep a Fire Safety Register, to advise residents on what to do in the event of a fire alarm (in particular the evacuation arrangements); and</p><p>- that local authority Fire Services should offer training to Building Management  Companies on key life safety issues.</p><p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has been mandated to carry through the recommendations of the report which are within my Department's remit and to oversee and report on the implementation of the report's other recommendations.</p></reply>

This is distinct from RAS, which is a different type of social housing support, where the tenant may not always find their own accommodation and instead are allocated a dwelling in accordance with Section 22 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009. Unlike HAP, where a RAS tenancy is ending, the local authority retains the responsibility to source further accommodation for that household.</p>  <p>  Both RAS and HAP provide over 56,000 households with more security than rent supplement and they also facilitate those households to increase their household income without the risk of losing their housing support. Both HAP and RAS supported households also have access to the local authority transfers lists, which form part of each local authority&rsquo;s Scheme of Letting priorities. This provides those in receipt of social housing support with the opportunity to transfer to another tenancy, including dwellings owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that the contractual arrangements underpinning RAS and HAP tenancies, which meet the social housing need of so many households across the country, serve those households well.</p></reply>

My Department does not directly collect information on the number of enquiries to local authorities regarding the loan or the number of loan applications received by local authorities.</p>  <p>  However, as is currently the case, my Department will continue to publish information on the overall number and value of (i) local authority loan approvals and (ii) local authority loan drawdowns.  Information up to Q3 2017 is available on the Department's website at the following link: http://www.housing.gov.ie/housing/statistics/house-prices-loans-and-profile-borrowers/local-authority-loan-activity, and this information will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional data is compiled.</p>  <p>  The Housing Agency provides a central support service which assesses valid loan applications that are made to the local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities as to whether loans should be offered to applicants.  I have asked the Agency to centrally compile figures of the numbers of applications that it has assessed and the most recent figures, as at the end of May, indicate that the Agency had received a total of 1,499 applications for assessment from local authorities, 1,150 of which were deemed to be valid. Of these valid applications, 876 had been assessed and 52% of the valid applications that had been assessed by the Agency had been recommended for approval.  </p>  <p>  Each local authority must have in place a credit committee which makes the final decision on applications for loans, in accordance with the regulations and having regard to the recommendations made by the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  With regard to the values of the loans approved to date, figures are not available concerning the breakdown of amounts approved in the manner referred to. However, the Housing Agency have advised that the average loan amount for the 458 applications recommended for approval by the end of May was &euro;189,133.</p></reply>

These measures include reductions in the use of fossil fuel systems and an increase in the use of renewable energy. </p>  <p>  It should be noted that my Department has lead responsibility for implementing the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. This Directive sets the requirements at an EU level for Member States to improve the energy performance of buildings and to make an important contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Article 9(1) of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. </p>  <p>  The Directive defines a Nearly Zero Energy Building, or &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo;, as a building that has a very high energy performance and that the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby. This definition was incorporated in the Building Regulations 1997 &ndash; 2017 last year through the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department has progressively updated Part L of the Building Regulations, relating to the Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Dwellings, over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to achieve these &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance levels. These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimized the additional effort required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.</p>  <p>  In 2007, Part L was revised to achieve a 40% improvement in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 performance levels for new dwellings and, in addition, a mandatory renewables requirement for new dwellings was also introduced. This review also introduced a requirement that new and replacement fossil fuel boilers should be energy efficient condensing boilers, where practical. </p>  <p>  In 2011, Part L of the Building Regulations was further revised to achieve an improvement of 60% in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standard for all new dwellings.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently published a public consultation on further improvements to Part L of the Building Regulations to achieve the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive NZEB performance requirements.  My Department is currently reviewing the results of this consultation, and when implemented,  it will represent an improvement of 70% in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standards for all new dwellings commencing construction from early 2019, subject to transition arrangements. </p>  <p>  Under current regulations a typical new dwelling is built to an A3 Building Energy Rating (BER). The new Part L performance requirement will equate to a typical new dwelling having a BER of A2.  The amended Part L Building Regulations will stipulate that new dwellings can achieve the new standards by making provisions that represent : - </p>  <p>- A 70% improvement in energy efficiency for new dwellings (relative to 2005 base year standards)</p>  <p>- A 70% reduction in CO2   emissions (again relative to the 2005 base year standards), and</p>  <p>- 20% renewables as a percentage of total building energy use.</p>  <p>  These requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from traditional fossil fuels. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 regulations requires 90% less energy than the equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.  Very significant progress has, therefore, been made in this area, even before the new initiatives outlined above.   </p>  <p>  Arising from further improvements to Part L, the move from fossil fuels to renewable energy is expected to accelerate and will contribute significantly to meeting Ireland's climate change commitments.</p></reply>

The programme provides for the funding of demonstration group sewerage schemes, through measure 4(d), where clustering of households on individual septic tanks is not a viable option, particularly from an environmental perspective.</p>  <p>  Local authorities were invited in January 2016 to submit bids under the programme. The invitation envisaged no more than two demonstration group sewerage projects being brought forward under the measure in any one year of the three-year programme. The demonstrations will allow my Department, over the course of the programme, to determine the appropriate enduring funding levels and relationship with the current grant scheme.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently addressing the recommendations contained in the April 2017 report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future Funding of Domestic Water Services as they relate to the rural water sector. In this regard, in April 2018, I established a Working Group to conduct a wider review of the investment needs of rural water services.  In addition to my Department, the Working Group comprises: the Department of Rural and Community Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Service Executive, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and the County and City Management Association.</p>  <p>  The Working Group, which has met twice to date, is considering how best to position and resource water services in rural areas so that they can contribute further to the development and long-term sustainability of a comprehensive and cohesive rural water sector that will have the capacity to produce quality outcomes comparable to those available to customers of public water services.  </p>  <p>  The Working Group is focusing on the actions required to improve and sustain rural water services, and will consider issues such as governance, supervision and monitoring of the sector, in addition to capital investment priorities and requirements across all elements of rural water services. In keeping with the Joint Oireachtas Committee&rsquo;s recommendation this Working Group is considering the investment needs of all elements of rural water services including Group Sewerage Schemes.</p>  <p>  The terms of reference of the review provide that there will be a two-strand approach to the considerations of the Working Group. Strand 1 will consider the composition and distribution of funding for the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme from 2019 up to 2021, while Strand 2 will consider the more complex longer-focus issues surrounding the long-term future resourcing of the rural water sector. It is intended that by the end of July the Working Group will produce a summary report on Strand 1 of its deliberations which will outline the rationale for funding priorities for the next cycle of the Multi-Annual Rural Water Programme up to 2021. At that time the Working Group will also set out time frames for its consideration of, and reporting, on the more complex longer-focus Strand 2 matters.</p></reply>

Where the Board does not consider it possible or appropriate to reach a decision within 18 weeks (e.g. because of the particular complexities of a case or the requirement to hold an oral hearing), it will inform the parties of the reasons for this, and will indicate when it intends to make its decision. </p>  <p>  The compliance rate with the statutory objective period has been reduced over the past year due to a number of factors. Firstly, there was a reduction in Board capacity in mid-2017, arising from a time interval between the departure of five outgoing Board members, whose terms of office had expired in April and May, and the five new replacement Board members taking up their posts.  While, by September 2017, the Board complement had been fully replenished, this time interval significantly impacted on the Board&rsquo;s case work output over the whole year.</p>  <p>  In addition, An Bord Plean&aacute;la is also implementing a major ICT strategy which will facilitate the introduction of on-line planning services as part of a complete upgrade and replacement of core systems.  In this regard, a new case management system was installed and became operational in Q4 2017.  As is to be expected with such a fundamental and integrated project, the transition to the new system has caused some initial disruption to the processing of cases, resulting in a further increase in the backlog of cases on hand. However, measures have been put in place to ensure that the new system is bedded down and becomes operational at an optimal level as soon as possible.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, during this period, there has been a general increase in cases received by the Board.  For example, there was an increase of almost 12% on normal planning appeals received in 2017 compared to 2016; this upward trend has continued into 2018. The intake of normal planning appeals in the four months to end-April 2018 was 17% greater than the intake over the corresponding period to end-April 2017.</p>  <p>  Now that the Board's full complement has been restored, combined with the measures that are being put in place in relation to the new ICT systems, it is expected that the backlog of cases will begin to reduce over the coming months, with an associated improvement in the compliance rate with the statutory objective period for the determination of cases.</p>  <p>  My Department liaises closely with the Board to ensure that it has appropriate resources in relation to the performance of its functions.  In mid 2017, the Board acquired additional functions in determining planning applications for strategic housing developments.  A new Strategic Housing Division of the Board was established to decide on these applications, involving the recruitment of an additional dedicated 10 professional and administrative staff members in 2017.  Two additional Board members have also been sanctioned to serve this Division, with the appointments being made in February and June this year.  </p>  <p>  The Board now has a complement of 11 members and has over 150 staff employed.  I am satisfied that the Board has sufficient and necessary resources to deliver effectively and efficiently on its important statutory mandate and functions.</p></reply>

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports has commenced.

The 4 stages are: </p>  <p>  Stage 1 &ndash; Capital Appraisal submission to establish the business case;</p>  <p>  Stage 2 &ndash; Pre-planning submission and cost check;</p>  <p>  Stage 3 &ndash; Pre-tender approval and cost check;</p>  <p>  Stage 4 &ndash; Tender approval.</p>  <p>  These approvals themselves represent only a small proportion of the time taken in advancing a construction project onto site. The approach that is followed means that local authorities forward design proposals and costings to my Department sequentially, as the local authorities advance the projects through their own planning work. Therefore, projects continue to be advanced while stages are cleared and the approval process does not negatively impact on the overall delivery.</p>  <p>  However, it is important that we continuously strive for efficiency in the delivery of social housing. Accordingly, a review was undertaken during 2017 of the procedures for such projects, involving both my Department and the County and City Management Association. This review identified an overall target programme of 59 weeks for progressing a typical social housing construction project from initial capital appraisal submission by the local authority (Stage 1), to construction contract award. Once the construction contract is awarded, the time taken to build and tenant the homes varies depending, in particular, on the size of the development, the site conditions and other construction-related factors.</p>  <p>  My Department and local authorities also operate a single-stage approval process for projects up to &euro;2m in value, while rapid build approaches are also increasingly being used which can save time in relation to design, procurement and construction of new social housing.</p></reply>

This allows people to remain in private housing while their housing need is met without increasing the strain on current social housing stock and also reduces the numbers of persons who might otherwise find themselves homeless. </p>  <p>  Exchequer funding meets 90% of the cost of DPG's/DPG Extensions and IWIL's, with the local authority providing the remaining 10%. While my Department has responsibility for setting the policy for this scheme, local authorities have delegated authority in respect of the use of the funding and they prioritise allocations based on need. </p>  <p>  Funding recouped to local authorities by my Department has steadily increased in recent years, from over &euro;7m in 2013, to over &euro;13m last year, when improvements in over 1,300 homes were supported.  Over 1,000 homes were improved or adapted in 2016; my Department did not compile central data on the number of units improved or adapted prior to 2016. The utilisation of allocated funding and managing needs, including waiting times, is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>  <p>  Local authorities have submitted to my Department details of their work proposals and related funding requirements for this scheme in 2018. These proposals have now been evaluated and funding allocations will be confirmed to the local authorities shortly. In order to ensure that there were no delays for priority and urgent cases, all local authorities were advised that they may undertake works of up to 65% of their 2017 allocation in advance of the notification of their 2018 allocation. This allowed them to plan and progress works under the scheme and allows for the full utilisation of the 2018 allocation throughout the year.</p>  <p>  It is open to local authorities to seek additional funding over and above this initial allocation and such requests will be facilitated where funding availability allows. I welcome the efforts being made by all local authorities to improve the quality of life for those with disabilities and those affected by over-crowding. These works will greatly improve the housing conditions for our older tenants and those living with disabilities and addresses issues of overcrowding in existing social housing stock. Improvement works on private homes in lieu of social housing will also provide an alternative for those currently experiencing overcrowding in private accommodation.</p></reply>

To facilitate this, in November 2016, the CRU (formerly known as the Commission for Energy Regulation) outlined a framework of 19 key performance metrics against which it would monitor Irish Water&rsquo;s performance and progress over time. The metrics cover customer service, environmental performance, quality of service for water supply, security of water supply and sewerage service. Monitoring Irish Water&rsquo;s performance relative to these metrics will facilitate an evaluation by the CRU in this regard. It also ensures that transparent data becomes available to customers through the publication of performance data. </p><p>The position therefore in relation to pre-connection applications for sewerage and water services, is that such applications are an operational matter for Irish Water, subject to independent oversight by the CRU as appropriate.  </p><p>If Deputies have any queries on specific issues in relation to water services, Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to <i>oireachtasmembers@water.ie</i>or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

However, on foot of a recent review of the on-line vacant site registers across all local authority areas, I understand that 14 authorities have populated their vacant site registers to date, of which 11 had sites on their registers in 2017 and before 1 January 2018, with three other authorities populating their registers during January 2018.   </p>  <p>  My Department has actively engaged with local authorities in relation to the implementation of the vacant site levy in order to ensure a consistent application of the levy provisions across all city and county areas and to facilitate the sharing of best practice. My Department has provided guidance and advice and also organised three separate information seminars for local authorities, most recently on 1 May 2018, which was attended by officials from every local authority.</p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor implementation of the levy to ensure that it is being fully used, in line with its intended purpose of incentivising the development of vacant or under-utilised sites in urban areas.</p></reply>

In addition, as the report was brought to the attention of all my Cabinet colleagues, its publication and findings are very timely, given the whole-of-Government focus on achieving a more effective, strategic approach to land management for residential and infrastructural development.   </p>  <p>  The report is very much consistent with the Government's approach to housing supply and land management, and in particular the Council's emphasis on the importance of not returning to the speculative and unstable system of home building that we have previously witnessed in this country. Moreover, the report addresses a number of challenges identified in the Government&rsquo;s long-term spatial strategy, Project Ireland 2040, including the provision of more affordable homes to buy or rent for a growing proportion of the population and a sustained increase in the level of investment in public infrastructure.</p>  <p>  NESC also points out that public institutions need a strong developmental mandate, political authorisation, and executive capacity to drive housing supply and sustainable urban development, and endorses the NPF commitment to establish new National Regeneration and Development Agency as a positive step in this direction.  It is envisaged that the Agency will act as a national centre of expertise, working with and supporting local authorities, public bodies and other interests, to harness public lands as catalysts to stimulate regeneration and wider investment and to achieve compact, sustainable growth, with a particular emphasis on complex regeneration projects. The Government is currently working on finalising arrangements for the establishment of the Agency.</p></reply>

These include:  </p><p>- a reduction in the minimum lease term required from 10 to 5 years; </p><p>- an increase in the proportion of market rent available to property owners where they take on more responsibilities under the tenancy, meaning that up to 92% of market rent will be available; and provision of additional funding for property owners, over and above the current &euro;40,000 limit, where the dwelling is a bedsit type dwelling being brought into compliance with the Standards forRented Houses Regulations and made available for social housing. </p><p>I am making &euro;32 million available for the scheme in 2018 and I expect local authorities and AHBs to continue to implement the scheme locally. </p><p>Over the period 2016 to 2021, the national target is for the delivery of an additional 50,000 social housing homes through Build, Acquisition and Leasing Schemes. The ambition is for 33,500 of these homes to be delivered through new build programmes including Part V; for 6,500 to be delivered through Acquisition programmes including the Housing Agency Acquisition Programme; and for the remaining 10,000 homes to be delivered under a range of leasing initiatives including the RLS. Out of the total 10,000 homes to be delivered under Leasing, it is expected that 2,000 will be leased by local authorities in 2018 under a range of leasing initiatives, including the Repair and Leasing Scheme, long term leasing and the new Enhanced Lease.</p><p>I wrote to all Local Authorities on 18 April 2018 setting out their social housing delivery targets for build, acquisition and leasing for 2018, and for the period 2018-2021. The targets are published at the following link: </p><p><i>.</i></p><p>The RLS data for end Q1 2018 are currently being collated and will be published shortly.</p><p>In the case of the Buy and Renew Scheme, funding is made available by my Department to facilitate local authorities in acquiring and remediating vacant properties that may be suitable for social housing. </p><p>As with standard acquisitions, local authorities have delegated responsibility to utilise the Buy and Renew Scheme, as part of the blend of property acquisitions, as appropriate to their area, given housing need and the availability of properties of different types. To date, my Department has supported the purchase and remediation of over 90 such homes under the scheme, details of which are set out in the following table.<table><tr><th>Local Authority</th><th>Number of homes</th></tr><tr><td>Clare County Council</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Fingal County Council</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry County Council</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare County Council</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Meath County Council</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan County Council</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly County Council</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary County Council</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford City &amp;amp; County Council</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>94</td></tr></table></p></reply>

This will not only mean a significant increase in supply of housing to the market but also increase the supply of social housing under Part V. In addition, 13 of the projects will support the development of housing on State-owned sites which will provide additional social and affordable housing.</p><p>Under Pillar 3 of the Rebuilding Ireland plan, LIHAF is designed to specifically address the issue of housing supply and that increase in supply is an important factor in terms of moderating house prices. In addition, the infrastructure being built is all public infrastructure for public use and the new roads, bridges and parks that are being built will bring benefits to the wider communities in those areas. I have also sought to leverage the State&rsquo;s investment in public infrastructure under LIHAF to achieve a dividend in terms of making the housing on the associated sites more affordable than it would otherwise have been. </p><p>The target referred to by the Deputy was part of the original circular letter which issued in August 2016 with the call for proposals.  However, this was subsequently amended in September 2016 to allow for project-specific cost reductions and affordability schemes. The clarification recognised that the original blanket requirement was quite narrow and did not allow for appropriate calibration against the level of investment in infrastructure and therefore could negatively affect the viability of housing projects, particularly in Dublin where the supply issue is most urgent.</p><p>Local authorities were required to secure local agreements with developers and landowners in advance of finalising grant agreements with my Department.  These local agreements set out commitments from developers and landowners with regard to housing delivery and an appropriate cost reduction on housing.  Summary details of these commitments were published on the Rebuilding Ireland website in March 2018 and are available to view, together with the circular and clarification, at the following link:<i>.</i></p></reply>

The Department&rsquo;s Management Board Sub Committee on Gender Equality, Equality, and Diversity was first established in 2012 to provide momentum and leadership to efforts to improve gender balance in the Department. In 2017, the Sub Committee&rsquo;s remit was formally expanded to include broader diversity and equality issues as outlined in the Employment Equality and Equal Status Acts, together with the issue of discrimination on socio-economic grounds.The Sub Committee (supported by a Gender Equality Action Plan Working Group and a Working Group on Equality and Diversity) is the governance structure for the consideration of equality and diversity issues; policy on these issues is of course led and managed by the Department&rsquo;s human resources team and informed by central Civil Service policies.  The Department also works closely with the Civil Service Management Board in the development of new approaches to gender equality.    Work on gender equality is structured through the Department&rsquo;s Gender Equality Action Plan which sets out a number of key objectives to help improve gender balance at all grades, at home and abroad. Important initiatives taken under the Action Plan include the roll-out of unconscious bias training, mentoring and coaching for women in leadership roles, and the establishment of a Gender Equality Network which organises seminars and discussions on gender open to all staff. </p>  <p>  Efforts have specifically been made to ensure gender balance in promotions and particularly at senior positions where inequalities are historically most evident. In 2012, at the establishment of the Sub-Committee, 27% of Counsellors/Principal Officers in the Department were female. As of 2018, the percentage of female Counsellor/Principal Officers is 34%, highlighting the success of efforts made by the Department to address inequalities, while also evidencing the need to continue efforts already being implemented. </p>  <p>  The Working Group on Equality and Diversity has now developed a complementary Action Plan which will be launched shortly and which will drive initiatives around inclusion, equality, and diversity in our human resources approach and in our external and internal communications. As part of the Action Plan, I will shortly be launching the Department&rsquo;s LGBT+ Staff Network. This Network aims to be a supportive space for LGBT+ staff, secondees and their spouses at home or overseas.</p>  <p>  There are regular events at the Department&rsquo;s Headquarters to promote gender equality, equality and diversity. In 2017, six events were held and to date there have been four events on issues on gender equality, equality and diversity in 2018.  Events have included topics such as &lsquo;Inclusion and Disability&rsquo;, &lsquo;Gender Equality in Leadership&rsquo;, &lsquo;LGBT+ History&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Diversity in the Diplomatic Service&rsquo;.   As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I am committed to communicating our values to our partners around the world and to visible demonstrations of our support for human rights and equality. The Department&rsquo;s diplomatic network and the Irish Aid programme work directly, and in cooperation with, other EU Member States to engage with Governments on a range of governance and human rights issues, including gender equality and the rights of the LGBT+ community. The Human Right Unit in my Department supports embassies in their engagement on these issues, including the provision of appropriate training to staff in advance of their postings overseas. </p>  <p>  In March this year Ireland also chaired the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, leading to the adoption of Conclusions which focused on gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls. </p>  <p>  In May 2018, to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, I launched a social media awareness campaign on Twitter reiterating Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the rights of LGBT+ individuals and encouraging our global network to show solidarity by supporting the hashtag #FollowTheRainbow. </p>  <p>  Many of our embassies have also participated in annual Pride events including most recently Embassies Warsaw, Washington and Zagreb.</p></reply>

She has been in administrative detention without trial for a year, having already been detained, under administrative detention and a conviction whose basis was very unclear, for much of the period since April 2015. I understand that she is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is an outlawed group in Israel and considered a terrorist group by the EU. However, no real and credible imputation of personal involvement in violent activities has been made against her.</p>  <p>  My view on this case, and on the practice of administrative detention generally, is very clear. While no-one can doubt the particular threats and security concerns which Israel faces, administrative detention should only be used, if at all, in the most serious of cases and in the face of serious and immediate threat. In all other cases, persons should be charged and tried in the courts, able to hear and challenge the evidence against them. No evidence of such a serious and immediate threat has been presented, in a way which would allow the person in question to address it, in this case. </p>  <p>  In general, there is serious concern that administrative detention is being applied on an increasingly routine basis against people who are politically active and critical of the occupation of the Palestinian territory, without any evidence being made available to indicate that these individuals constitute a security threat. Such periods of detention are often rolled over and extended indefinitely. </p>  <p>  All of these criticisms have been conveyed to the Israeli authorities, most recently in the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the Human Rights Council in January of this year, when Ireland reiterated that detainees must have the right to be informed of the charges underlying any detention, have access to legal assistance, and receive a fair trial. Ireland has also been instrumental in having them included in EU Council Conclusions on the situation in Israel and Palestine.</p>  <p>  It is incumbent on Israel to charge this person with credible and evidence-based offences, or to release her. I note that a leading article in one of the main Israeli newspapers yesterday made the same call.</p></reply>

I have no desire to become involved in a US domestic debate about immigration. Clearly, every state has the right, indeed the duty, to police its own borders and to enforce its immigration laws.  This duty should, however, be discharged in the case of all countries in line with their international obligations and with respect for the human rights of all involved, especially children.</p>  <p>  Ireland, as a State party to the Convention to the Rights of the Child, is of the view that in all actions that involve children, the best interests of the child should have primary consideration.</p>  <p>  I therefore urge the US government to immediately reverse this policy of separation.</p></reply>

A number of these issues are in the process of being implemented such as amending section 8 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 and linking sections 25 and 26 so that exaggerated and misleading claims are automatically referred to the Garda&iacute; for investigation. There are other recommendations however such as changing the approach to calculating the Book of Quantum where we have clearly indicated to the Alliance that there are constitutional issues which need to be first considered thus explaining why we have referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission for examination. </p>  <p>  I have also pointed out to the Alliance that reinstating the &ldquo;Blue Book&rdquo; is a matter for the Central Bank of Ireland and as Minister, this is not an issue I have any influence over.  Notwithstanding this, my Department remains open to maintaining constructive engagement with the Alliance on its key &lsquo;asks&rsquo;. </p>  <p>  Finally, it is important that the Cost of Insurance Working Group continues to focus on implementing the recommendations of the two Reports so we can see what impact  the completion of all the actions have on the cost of insurance before looking to introduce more changes.  As I have stated previously, I believe that the cumulative effects of the implementation of all the recommendations should include increased stability in the pricing of insurance for consumers and businesses and improved availability of insurance generally.</p></reply>

Businesses who make supplies that are charged to VAT are entitled to claim input VAT on their business expenses. VAT registered persons are entitled to claim the cost of VAT on the purchase of diesel used in the course of their business, as is the case with most business costs. However, section 60 of the VAT Consolidation Act 2010 prohibits VAT deductibility by businesses on certain goods and services which, by their ubiquitous nature, are not easily distinguishable from general non-business use. This is for anti-avoidance reasons.</p>  <p>  Expenditure on petrol, as well as expenditure on food, drink, accommodation, and entertainment, is specifically excluded from deductibility entitlement, even where the petrol or other goods and services are acquired or used for the purpose of a taxable business.  </p>  <p>  Under Article 176 of the EU VAT Directive, Ireland can retain certain restrictions on VAT deductibility that were in place before 1979. As VAT input deductibility has been restricted on petrol since 1972, Ireland can retain that block on deductibility. While it is legally possible to apply the normal rules of VAT deductibility to petrol, once the block on deductibility is eased or removed it would not be possible to re-introduce it. There is a case for petrol and diesel to be treated equally in terms of input deductibility entitlements as there is a greater level of diesel run personal motor vehicles in operation today than in the past. However, the provisions of Article 176 prohibit the application of a new deductibility restriction on diesel expenditure. As anti-avoidance concerns regarding petrol expenditure deductibility continue, the restriction on VAT deductibility remains valid.</p>  <p>  The information available on tax records does not allow petrol purchases by businesses to be separately identified. Therefore, it is not possible to furnish an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer of allowing a VAT reclaim on petrol for businesses.</p></reply>

Capitation related grants are issued to the majority of primary and post-primary schools to employ such staff.  Within the capitation grant schemes, it is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the grant funding to suit its particular needs. </p><p>Where a school uses the capitation grant funding to employ a secretary, such staff are employees of individual schools. My Department has no plans to develop an alternative scheme for schools to employ primary school secretaries separate to the current system of capitation grant assistance. </p><p>Notwithstanding that, in 2015 my Department agreed to engage with the union side in relation to the pay of school secretaries (and caretakers) who are employed using grant funding, and to enter an arbitration process. The Arbitrator recommended a cumulative pay increase of 10% between 2016 and 2019 for school secretaries (and caretakers) comprehended by the terms of the arbitration process and that a minimum hourly pay rate of &euro;13 for such staff be phased in over the period 2016 to 2019.  Grant funding used by schools to fund the salaries of ancillary staff is also being improved on a phased basis between 2016 and 2019 following the arbitration process.  These increases are in order to enable schools  implement the arbitration outcome for grant funded secretaries (and caretakers). </p><p>In December 2017, my Department published circular letter 0078/2017 for primary schools and circular letter 0079/2017 for voluntary secondary schools, setting out the application of the third phase increases of the Arbitrator&rsquo;s recommendations.  The circulars are available at: </p><p>Circular 0078/2017:<i></i></p><p>Circular 0079/2017:  <i></i></p><p>The increases recommended by the Arbitrator are binding and must be applied by all schools who employ staff to whom the Arbitrator's recommendation applies.</p></reply>

(SCPA).</p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service. The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring. Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximize positive outcomes for these pupils. NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties. Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process. Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  Should the parents of the child, the subject of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, have specific concerns about his educational progress they should, in the first instance, speak to the Principal of the school concerned, with a view to raising these concerns with the local NEPS service. </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

(SCPA).</p>  <p>  By way of clarification NEPs psychologists are recruited via regional panels formed from national recruitment competitions administered by the Public Appointments service. The assignment of a NEPS psychologist to the school to which the Deputy alludes in his question, was the subject of a vacancy and the school was given access to the SCPA process in relation to its pupils casework needs.  While every effort was made by PAS to fill the post from the existing panel in the region these ultimately proved unsuccessful and the panel has now been exhausted. </p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy however that a new national competition will be launched very shortly from which new regional recruitment panels will be formed with a view to filling vacancies in the coming academic year including the vacancy in the NEPS North-Western Region .</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The question of not returning a person to a place where certain fundamental rights would be breached (or non refoulement as it is referred to) is fully considered in every case when deciding whether or not to make a deportation order. This involves consideration of whether returning the person would result in the life or freedom of that person being threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, or whether the person would be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.</p>  <p>  I have met the family involved and am fully aware of the circumstances of the case.

Section 6 of the HSE Governance Act 2013 bars the Minister for Health from directing the HSE to provide a treatment or a personal service to any individual or to confer eligibility on any individual.</p>  <p>  The National Waiting List Management Policy, a standardised approach to managing scheduled care treatment for in-patient, day case and planned procedures, since January 2014, has been developed to ensure that all administrative, managerial and clinical staff follow an agreed national minimum standard for the management and administration of waiting lists for scheduled care. This policy, which has been adopted by the HSE, sets out the processes that hospitals are to implement to manage waiting lists.</p>  <p>  In relation to the particular query raised, as this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to the Deputy directly.</p></reply>

The Bill passed all stages in the Houses of the Oireachtas on 28 March 2018. </p>  <p>  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government made a Polling Day Order for a referendum to be held on 25 May 2018 and the referendum was passed. A certificate with the provisional result of the referendum was published in Iris Oifigiuil on Tuesday, 29 May 2018.</p>  <p>  Once the provisional result of the referendum was published, there followed a seven day period during which applications to make petitions could be received. Three applications for permission to challenge the result of the referendum have been made to the High Court under section 42 of the Referendum Act 1994. The High Court has fixed 26 June to hear the three applications. It is possible that the hearings may run over a number of days, after which a decision will be made by the Court.</p>  <p>  The bringing of the legal challenge by way of referendum petition has meant that, on a number of occasions, the introduction of proposed legislation into the Oireachtas has been delayed pending the determination of a referendum petition. For example, following the marriage referendum, the introduction of the Marriage Bill into the Oireachtas was delayed until the 15 September 2015 when the applications for leave to bring the referendum petitions to challenge the result of the marriage referendum were finally determined on appeal and leave to bring a petition was refused on 30 July 2015. </p>  <p>  It remains my absolute determination to have the legislation to regulate termination of pregnancy finalised by mid-July. However, it is not possible to initiate this legislation in the Oireachtas until the Court proceedings have concluded, the result of the referendum has been confirmed, and the President has signed the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018.</p></reply>

In the context of developing the General Scheme of the AHR Bill, officials in my Department engaged with colleagues from a number of other Departments, including the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, to ensure that the proposed legislation is developed in a coherent way within the existing legislative framework. </p>  <p>  The surrogacy provisions in the General Scheme set out a court-based mechanism through which the parentage of a child born through surrogacy may be transferred from the surrogate (and her husband, if applicable) to the intending parent(s). If a Parental Order is granted by the court, the intending parents would be declared to be the legal parents of the child and they would subsequently be issued with a "surrogacy certificate" that would replace the original birth certificate. This is a similar procedure to the mechanism which deals with the civil registration of children who are adopted, whereby an adoption certificate replaces the original birth certificate.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions. The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible. However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis. This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland. However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

This will help people meet the average annual cost for the disposal of medical incontinence products.  My Department is in discussion with the Department of Health, the Health Service Executive, and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner regarding the administrative details and arrangements of the support, as well as engaging with the relevant  stakeholders.  I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to finalising the details for this support as soon as possible. In line with the commitments set out in <i>A Resource Opportunity - Waste Management Policy in Ireland, </i>published in 2012, and in the interest of encouraging further waste prevention and greater recycling, flat-rate fees for kerbside household waste collection are being phased out over the period autumn 2017 to autumn 2018, as customers contracts come up for renewal. The necessary regulatory steps have been put in place to give effect to this measure. </p><p>It is worth noting that this measure is not &lsquo;new&rsquo; for about half of kerbside household waste customers, who are already on an incentivised usage pricing plan, i.e., a plan which contains a per lift or a weight related fee. </p><p>As announced in mid-2017, mandatory per kilogramme 'pay by weight' charging is not being introduced. Allowing for a range of charging options, which encourage householders to reduce and separate their waste, provides flexibility to waste collectors to develop various service-price offerings that suit different household circumstances. </p><p>The Price Monitoring Group has considered eight months of data to date. While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability. The Price Monitoring Group has reported that there are currently 9 different types of price models on the market. The main price examples include a service charge plus charge per bin lift, with an excess per kg charge, and a service charge plus per kg weight charge. The most popular service offering now is the &lsquo;service charge including weight allowance, plus per kg charge for excess above allowance'.</p></reply>

Recently the NTA and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) launched a public consultation on the details in relation to the "Emerging Preferred Route" for the MetroLink Project, which extends between Swords and Sandyford.</p>  <p>  The Emerging Preferred Route is the proposal which has been identified as the likely optimal scheme from a technical design perspective, without the benefit of public consultation and input. It is not a finalised and selected scheme &ndash; the final layout will only be determined after consideration and evaluation of the issues raised during the consultation process.</p>  <p>  Following receipt of all of the submissions, the issues and concerns identified will be carefully considered by TII and the NTA in determining the final scheme proposal and a report will be prepared on the consultation process.  It is envisaged that the public consultation report will be published later this year.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns raised by affected stakeholders including residents, local amenities and schools.  I believe there are many benefits the Metro project can bring.  The NTA and TII, through the consultative process they have underway, are working collaboratively to address concerns identified and to develop mitigating proposals.  Their aim is to find a way of delivering the MetroLink project, while maintaining good routes that interchange with other public transport and doing it in such a way that respects the social and community life of our city.</p>  <p>  Noting their responsibility with regards to this matter, I have referred your queries to TII and NTA for their consideration and direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.</p>  <p>  The current weekly maximum personal rate of jobseekers benefit is &euro;198.  Where a claimant has average weekly earnings of less than &euro;300 in the relevant tax year they are paid a graduated rate. The relevant tax year for 2018 is 2016. The estimated full year cost of equalising the personal rate would be approximately &euro;22 million. This cost would increase by a further &euro;10 million factoring in a &euro;5 increase.</p>  <p>  The estimated full year cost of increasing the jobseekers allowance under 26 rates for all recipients would be approximately &euro;94 million.  The Deputy should be aware that the reduced rates of jobseekers allowance do not apply to recipients with a qualified child, those making a linked claim within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied or those transferring directly to jobseekers allowance from disability allowance.  The reduced rates also do not apply to 18 to 24 year olds who were in care before they reached the age of 18. </p>  <p>  The costings provided are subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients for 2018.

Article 3 of the agreement/contract states that, &ldquo;The Sponsor shall at all times be an independent contractor for all purposes and the relationship of principal and agent shall not exist between the parties and all persons recruited by the sponsor shall be their/her/his sole responsibility.&rdquo;  The supervisor is legally in the employment of the local sponsoring organisation. Their contracts of employment list the sponsor as the employer.  They are not employees of my Department, nor are they public servants.  </p>  <p>  The focus on the development of individuals on schemes is captured by the supervisor in the Individual Learner Plan for each participant and this must be available for inspection by the Department as required along with the necessary back up documentation.  With this in mind, the Department provides funding for the employment of supervisors on a 39 hour week basis to provide adequate time to the sponsoring organisation to provide the necessary supports for the daily management of the scheme. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will appreciate that robust controls and monitoring are required to ensure that public monies are being spent in an effective and efficient manner.  In this regard there are at least two monitoring visits carried out by the Department to a scheme on an annual basis &ndash; financial monitoring and programme monitoring to ensure compliance with the CE operational procedures.  The scheme itself has no paperwork to complete.  The monitoring form is completed by officials from the Department.  </p>  <p>  As the deputy is aware, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) have taken the lead in addressing the entitlement of CE supervisors to occupational pensions.  A Community Sector High Level Forum, chaired by DPER is currently examining this issue.  Other Departments including my Department are represented on this group, as are the unions and Pobal and a number of meetings have been held. </p>  <p>  While I am very conscious that the issue relates to Community Employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, such individuals comprise of just one small group within the wider Community and Voluntary sector any provision of State funding for such a scheme in respect of those employees could potentially give rise to claims for similar schemes on the part of those in the broader sector, thus crystallising the potential level of liability.  Any solution to this issue will require careful consideration, in particular the implications for scarce Exchequer resources. </p>  <p>  I trust this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It will distinguish between operational and capital expenditure, and provide projections of income over the multi-annual period 2020-2024 inclusive, which will align with the next full regulatory period.  Subject to my approval of the Strategic Funding Plan, it will feed into the allowed revenue determination for Irish Water by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU), as the economic regulator of Irish Water, and ultimately feed into future annual estimates and budgetary processes. </p><p>Irish Water&rsquo;s next Investment Plan for the five year period from 2020 to 2024 will set out the financial plan for capital investments to support its strategic objectives, as set out in the Water Services Strategic Plan and the forthcoming Strategic Funding Plan, to deliver improvements to water services throughout Ireland where they are needed most.  Irish Water&rsquo;s Water Services Strategic Plan (WSSP) published in October 2015 already sets out a high level strategy over 25 years to ensure the provision of clean safe drinking water, effective management of wastewater, environmental protection and support for economic and social development. </p><p>Irish Water will also take account of developing subsidiary programmes within its investment plan to assist in implementing the National Planning Framework and the National Development Plan, including the forthcoming Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies as well as ongoing reviews of County Development Plans and Local Area Plans. </p><p>Irish Water continues to develop and implement a long-term investment perspective in order to strategically address the deficiencies in the public water and wastewater system.  The utility is implementing the capital investment programme which prioritises investment decisions to ensure that it utilises available funding most effectively by making investments that deliver the best possible improvements to water and wastewater infrastructure and services, while maximising value for money. </p><p>A substantial proportion of investment by the State through Irish Water over the next ten years will be focused on programmes to improve compliance with relevant public health and environmental standards.  This will involve implementation of the measures contained within the River Basin Management Plan for Ireland 2018-2021 and the achievement of the outcomes identified.  </p><p>Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives.  The team can be contacted via email to or by telephone on a dedicated number, 1890 578 578.</p></reply>

Once established, this expert group will assist me in establishing the designation of various types of MPAs by Regulation, including their geographical delineation and the provision of the necessary special protection measures required for each MPA.   </p>  <p>  A significant number of protected areas have already been designated under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. These include a number of special areas of conservation and special protected areas. The proposed legislation intends that new types of marine spatial protection measures will be added to the existing measures and, over time, provide for the designation of a coherent and representative network of marine protected areas.  </p>  <p>  I am not therefore in a position to advise on the exact timeline or total extent of MPAs to be designated at this point in time but confirm that once the immediate work in relation to the drafting and implementation of the microbeads legislation is complete, legislation on MPAs will be advanced.</p></reply>

Proposals for individual solar farm developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Act 2000 (as amended) in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</p>  <p>  Under the Act, each planning authority's development plan must set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the area concerned. Section 10 of the Act requires a development plan to include, inter alia, objectives for the provision or facilitation of the provision of infrastructure, including energy facilities, and many local authorities have developed renewable energy strategies for their areas in this context.</p>  <p>  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the local development plan, any submissions or observations received and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any relevant guidelines issued by my Department. Planning authorities must then make their own decisions based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications. </p>  <p>  While I am satisfied that the planning code is sufficiently robust to facilitate the assessment of individual planning permission applications for solar farm developments, I have indicated that I will keep the matter under review, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment, and his Department which leads on renewable energy policy.</p>  <p>  In this regard, our two Departments are exploring the potential for enhancing national planning guidance on solar energy, taking account of solar energy projects being assessed by planning authorities and the scope for future development of the sector in the context of developing renewable energy policy.  On foot of this engagement between our two Departments, where the need for specific planning guidance for solar farms is identified, my Department will develop such guidance as deemed appropriate.</p></reply>

My Department then recoups the land costs and any associated loan interest charges to the local authority, as part of the normal social housing project approval process. </p><p>In accordance with Section 106 of the Local Government Act 2001, as amended, the decision to borrow is a reserved function of the elected members of the local authority concerned, who have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions and are accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  As such, it is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to both locally identified needs and available resources. </p><p>Section 106 of the Act also provides that local authorities must obtain the consent of the appropriate Minister to undertake borrowing. In this regard, sanction to borrow for housing land acquisition is submitted by the local authority to my Department, who provide an assessment of the financial viability of potential loans insofar as individual local authorities are concerned, and an assessment as to whether the borrowing can be accommodated within the context of the fiscal rules. My Department is currently reviewing that loan approval process. </p><p>Finally, as regards housing delivery more broadly, the Residential Land Availability Survey 2014, published in February 2015, determined the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for residential development purposes at 31 March 2014 in each local authority area.  This survey measured the total amount of lands, whether owned privately or by the local authority, that have been identified for housing development in the various local authority development plans and that are the highest priority for development.</p><p>The area of such lands amounted to 17,434 hectares which, given a range of densities appropriate to whether the areas are in small villages or larger towns and cities and as determined by the relevant local authorities, could support the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.  On that basis, I am satisfied that adequate lands are available to facilitate residential development in line with Rebuilding Ireland. The Residential Land Availability Survey 2014 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at:  </p><p>A further Residential Land Availability Survey will be undertaken in due course.</p></reply>

This could yield in excess of 700 homes and my Department is working very closely with the Council to prioritise some of the larger apartment schemes, given the current demand.<b></b></p><p>To support delivery, the Office of Government Procurement (OGP) put in place a framework of Rapid Delivery contractors in 2017. This framework is available for all Local Authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) to use in the interest of accelerated delivery. In this regard, my Department has organised information seminars for Local Authorities, as well as visits to rapid delivery projects under construction. Local Authorities and AHBs have also been asked to consider, in particular, schemes which are suitable for early commencement, particularly in terms of their approved planning status.  </p><p>Many of the issues around delivery that &lsquo;standard&rsquo; social housing construction projects face, are also faced by rapid build projects, such as preparing sites, services/access to the site, community consultation, planning, etc.  There are, however, savings in terms of design and construction and these advantages are growing as more use is made of the Office of Government Procurement framework contract and contractors gain more experience in implementing these projects.

It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and also providing a degree of future-proofing.</p>  <p>  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports has commenced. The Housing Agency is carrying out the detailed statistical work on behalf of my Department and I expect the results of this review to be available for publication in late Summer 2018.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the two existing local authority home loan schemes, the House Purchase Loan and the Home Choice Loan, on 1 February 2018, a new loan offering, known as the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan was launched.  The new loan enables creditworthy first-time buyers to access sustainable mortgage lending to purchase new or second-hand properties in a suitable price range.  The low rate of fixed interest associated with the Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan provides first-time buyers with access to mortgage finance that they may not otherwise be able to afford at a higher interest rate.</p>  <p>  The income limits which are set out in the Housing (Rebuilding Ireland Home Loans) Regulations 2018 state that single applicants for the loan must not be earning greater than &euro;50,000 gross per annum.  The combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than &euro;75,000 per annum.  There are no set minimum income limits; however, applicants do need to have sufficient borrowing and repayment capacity and must be capable of repaying the mortgage in accordance with the statutory credit policy underpinning the loan.  These income limits are unchanged from the previous local authority loan offerings.</p>  <p>  Full details of the loan's eligibility criteria and other information is available from the dedicated Rebuilding Ireland Home Loan website: http://rebuildingirelandhomeloan.ie/.  </p>  <p>  Any person who meets the eligibility criteria may apply for a loan regardless of whether or not they are on the local authority housing list or qualified for social housing support.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-06-20a.573.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1295" speakername="Eoghan Murphy" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018062000078#WRK06000"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 238 to 241, inclusive, together.</p><p>In response to the emergence of building defects in dwellings, my Department and representatives from the local government sector reviewed the existing building control regulatory framework, in collaboration and consultation with industry stakeholders. This has led to a multi-faceted Building Control Reform Agenda, which commenced implementation in 2014 with the introduction of the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014.</p><p>Under these Regulations, the owner of a building must assign competent persons to design, build, inspect and certify building works he/she has commissioned. They in turn, must account for their contribution through the lodgement of compliance documentation, inspection plans and statutory certificates. The roles and responsibilities of owners, designers, builders, assigned certifiers, etc. during building works are set out in the Code of Practice for Inspecting and Certifying Buildings and Works, which is available at the following link: . This has brought clarity and accountability, a focus on compliance with Building Regulations and a new order to bear on construction projects.</p><p>Enforcement of the Building Regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities, who have extensive powers of inspection and enforcement under the Acts and who are independent in the use of their statutory powers. </p><p>The National Building Control Management Project (NBCMP) was set up to provide centralised oversight, direction and support for the development, standardisation and implementation of building control as an effective shared service in the 31 Building Control Authorities. Under this project, the Building Control Management System (BCMS) was developed and rolled out. A Framework for Building Control Authorities was prepared to standardise work practices. A compliance support facility has been established and a training programme is being developed. Also, and most fundamentally, steps are in place for the continued strengthening of the inspection regime in Building Control Authorities to carry out meaningful risk-based targeted inspections of building works. </p><p>The Government has also approved the General Scheme of the Building Control (Construction Industry Register) Bill to establish a mandatory statutory register for builders and specialist sub-contractors. The main objective of the Bill is to develop and promote a culture of competence, good practice and compliance with the Building Regulations within the Builder community of the construction sector. The establishment of a robust, mandatory, statutory register of builders and specialist sub-contractors provides consumers with assurance that they are dealing with competent and compliant operators.  </p><p>These reforms have already brought, and, through their full implementation, will continue to bring, a new order and discipline to bear on construction projects, creating an enhanced culture of compliance with the Building Regulations.</p><p>The reduced risk of defective buildings has provided insurance underwriters with sufficient confidence to introduce new latent defect type products in Ireland, despite a general retrenchment and conservatism in the wider insurance industry. These new products are first party insurance policies which cover damage and breaches of building regulations claims, to varying degrees. This means that the purchaser does not have to make a claim through the builder but can submit a claim directly to the insurer. This would be of particular benefit to a homeowner in circumstances where the builder or developer has ceased trading.</p><p>My Department is planning to engage further with Departments and Agencies with responsibility for insurance and consumer protection and industry stakeholders in order to ensure that homeowners and buyers are aware of products and options that are available to them when purchasing a new home. </p><p>However, it is important to note that under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the owners, designers and builders of buildings. As such, in general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, the homeowner, the builder, the developer and/or their respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. It is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and/or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p><p>My Department does not hold a central record of building failures that have emerged. However, the Government has supported homeowners through a number of expert reports and investigations into legacy problems such as the Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) and the Report of the Expert Panel on Concrete Blocks (June 2017). I also published a Framework for Enhancing Fire Safety in Dwellings (August 2017), which is intended to be used as a guide by the owners and occupants of dwellings where fire safety deficiencies have been identified, or are a cause for concern. </p><p>Where apartment buildings that are defective from a fire safety perspective come to the attention of the local authority fire services, they work with management companies and other stakeholders to ensure that appropriate levels of fire safety are achieved to minimise the risk to life. Actions are taken on the basis of case by case fire safety assessments.</p><p>Following the Grenfell Tower tragedy, and in recognition of fears expressed for fire safety, the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department was tasked with co-ordinating a high-level Task Force to lead a re-appraisal of fire safety in Ireland.  The Task Force's report, which was published recently, is available at the following link:</p><p>The report makes a number of recommendations in relation to fire safety in apartment buildings, including, including: </p><p>- the registration of fire stopping sub-contractors;</p><p>- the roles and responsibilities of Building Management Companies e.g. to review and maintain fire safety arrangements, to keep a Fire Safety Register, to advise residents on what to do in the event of a fire alarm (in particular the evacuation arrangements); and</p><p>- that local authority Fire Services should offer training to Building Management Companies on key life safety issues.</p><p>The National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management has been mandated to carry through the recommendations of the report which are within my Department's remit and to oversee and report on the implementation of the report's other recommendations.</p></reply>

These policies are informed by my Department&rsquo;s 2005 statutory Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Rural Housing, which are designed to ensure that planning authorities strike a balance between managing the future of rural areas from a development perspective and at the same time enabling housing requirements of rural communities to be met.  </p>  <p>  The Guidelines set out how planning authorities should frame their development plan policies for the different types of rural areas which may exist within the development plan area.  These types of areas range from rural areas close to cities and towns at risk of overspill development and more remote areas with low levels of development pressure and consistent patterns of population decline.  The Guidelines also set out policy advice on issues such as access to appropriate wastewater treatment facilities, potential impacts of the development on groundwater, landscape, natural and cultural heritage and addressing road safety issues (e.g. frontage onto national roads). </p>  <p>  Following engagement between the European Commission and my Department regarding the 2013 European Court of Justice ruling in the "Flemish Decree" case, a working group, comprising representatives from my Department and planning authorities, was established in May 2017 to review and, where necessary, recommend changes to the 2005 Guidelines, with a view to ensuring that rural housing policies and objectives contained in local authority development plans comply with the relevant provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. </p>  <p>  This Working Group concluded its deliberations in September 2017 and taking account of the Group's analysis and recommended outcome, my Department has been engaging with the Commission on the matter, with a view to issuing a further circular letter to planning authorities as soon as possible, setting out revisions to the 2005 Guidelines that take account of the relevant ECJ judgment.</p>  <p>  I am satisfied that a sufficiently flexible and robust policy framework is in place to ensure that rural communities can meet their housing needs and that the National Planning Framework  reinforces this.</p></reply>
