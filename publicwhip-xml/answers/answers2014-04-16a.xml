Employment rose by 61,000 during 2013, which represents a year-on-year increase of 3.3%. The Government&rsquo;s primary support for activation is through policies to create the environment for a strong economic recovery by promoting competitiveness and productivity. Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working. </p><p>Contrary to the impression given in the question that long-term unemployment has been increasing, it has in fact been doing the exact opposite. Long term unemployment, as measured by the QNHS, has fallen from 196,000 at the end of 2011 to 155,000 at the end of 2013, a decline of over 40,000 in less than two years. As a result the long-term unemployment rate had fallen to 7.2% down from a peak of over 9%.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that the both overall unemployment and long-term unemployment remain unacceptably high. Hence, the Government also recognises the need for additional activation measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s <i>Pathways to Work </i>strategy which is being led by my Department.</p><p>As one example of the impact of the strategy, <i>Pathways</i>set a target of moving 75,000 of the 180,800 people who were on the Live Register for over a year (long-term unemployed) at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2015. By the end of February this year, over 45,000 of this group had already moved into employment, 13,000 of whom had taken up part-time employment.</p><p><i>Pathways to Work</i>includes a wide range of programmes and services to help jobseekers back to employment. I will be making a table available to Deputies which sets out the level of provision on programmes for 2014, indicating also which programmes are particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed. These include programmes such as JobsBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum introduced by this Government and schemes such as Community Employment and T&Uacute;S where we have significantly increased the number of places available. </p><p>Furthermore, the Government is putting particular focus on tackling youth unemployment. A cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s strategy to get young people into jobs will be the implementation of the Youth Guarantee which was agreed by the EU during the Irish presidency and which will ensure that young people are prioritised for support on the pathway back to employment. This objective is to be achieved, over time, by fastracking Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, by allocating extra places on schemes such as T&Uacute;S, Momentum and JobBridge for young people and by reducing the qualifying time for access to JobsPlus for young people.  The Youth Guarantee is already being piloted in Ballymun involving a partnership of key national and local stakeholders. The findings from this pilot, which is being mainly funded by the European Commission, will feed into the national rollout of the Guarantee. </p><p>In summary, Pathways to Work sets out a strategy for the full rollout of a radically reformed public employment service by 2015.  I am happy to say that we are currently on target to meet this goal.</p><p><b>Table:  Expected participation in activation programmes, 2014</b><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th><div>Average participation</div></th><th><div>Inflow of new participants</div></th><th><div>Aimed at Long Term Unemployed ?</div></th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td><div>6,000</div></td><td><div>3,300</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)</td><td><div>7,700</div></td><td><div>13,300</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>T&uacute;s</td><td><div>7,500</div></td><td><div>7,500</div></td><td><div>Yes</div></td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td><div>4,000</div></td><td><div>2,000</div></td><td><div>Yes</div></td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td><div>6,500</div></td><td><div>6,500</div></td><td><div>Yes</div></td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td><div>18,500</div></td><td><div>9,300</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td><div>11,000</div></td><td><div>5,500</div></td><td><div>Yes</div></td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td><div>5,600</div></td><td><div>2,800</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td><div>10,300</div></td><td><div>25,000</div></td><td><div>40% target</div></td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports</td><td></td><td><div>700</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td></td><td><div>150</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td><div>250</div></td><td><div>250</div></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td><div>3,000</div></td><td><div>3,000</div></td><td><div>Yes</div></td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td><div>25,300</div></td><td><div>12,700</div></td><td><div>Yes</div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>105,650</div></td><td><div>92,000</div></td><td></td></tr></table></p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-16a.15.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041600069#WRB00400"><p>The aim of JobBridge is to help individuals break the vicious cycle whereby they can&rsquo;t get a job without experience but they can&rsquo;t get experience without a job.  An evaluation conducted by Indecon Economic Consultants found that 61% of interns who finish placements secure employment within five months.  These progression outcomes compare very favourably to those elsewhere in Europe which tend to be at around 30%.</p><p>  Accordingly I am very satisfied with the performance of JobBridge.  As at 10th April, 2014, 27,781 internship placements had commenced with over 6,600 participants in active internships and 2,482 internship posts advertised and available on the JobBridge website.  The total cost to the Exchequer of the top-up allowances paid to-date is &euro;29.3 million.</p><p>  I believe that this performance is due, at least in part, to the voluntary nature of the relationship between the host organisation and the intern.  A key feature of the scheme is that interns select and apply for internships which they themselves identify from the internships offered by employers.  In this way the internship is designed to be as close as possible to a real employment situation.  In addition host organisations must provide meaningful work experience to interns, commit to a standard agreement detailing expected learning outcomes for the intern, provide mentoring to each intern, submit monthly reports to the Department and, at the end of the internship, complete an evaluation questionnaire and provide each intern with a reference.  All of these factors taken together contribute to the high rates of progression of interns into employment.</p><p>  Even in those instances where interns are unable to move directly into employment from a JobBridge internship, the independent evaluation found that interns gain valuable skills and real-workplace experience through JobBridge and that participants themselves found that the scheme boosted their self-confidence and helped to establish useful labour market contacts and networks.  It is therefore a scheme which I am proud to have introduced and one which I would commend to all jobseekers and employers.</p><p>  As a further incentive to employers to take on people who are long-term unemployed I have recently launched JobsPlus.  Approved employers may qualify for up  &euro;10,000 cashback for recruiting a person who has been long-term unemployed. This cashback is paid in the form of monthly payments of  &euro;447 per month for each month the jobseeker is in employment for up to 24 months. This is a significant incentive to recruit people who are long term unemployed and I am pleased to report that it is being positively supported by employers with about 2,000 jobseekers, 60% of whom were more than 2 years unemployed, benefitting from the scheme.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-16a.23.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041600069#WRB01100"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15, 17, 24, 28 and 40 together.</p><p>  There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014.</p><p>  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme was introduced in 1977 which provided for the payment of additional supplements, including rent supplement.  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources. The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.</p><p>  The Department continues to monitor trends in the private rental market to determine the impact on rent supplement recipients and the maximum rent limits are comprehensively reviewed every 18 months. Following the most recent review of the private rental market revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. The purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide access to all housing in all areas while ensuring maximum value for money is achieved. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in Dublin, Galway, North Kildare and Bray areas. </p><p>  I am aware of the difficulties facing people in sourcing accommodation and the latest Daft.ie rental report indicates that the number of advertised rental units in Dublin has declined from 6,700 in 2009 to under 1,500 at the end of 2013.  This report also states that rent levels are static in areas outside Dublin, including Cork, Galway and Limerick cities. All prospective tenants, including those seeking to access rent supplement, are now finding it increasingly difficult to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties, particularly in Dublin, which impacts across a number of State services. Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty, due to the reduced level of supply, and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. I have no plans to change the revise the maximum rent limits at this time.   </p><p>  Department officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met and that the residence is reasonably suited to their residential needs. The fact that approximately 78,000 people are currently in receipt of rent supplement, of which almost 29,000 are in the Dublin area, 1,908 in Meath and 3,996 in Kildare of which 914 are in North Kildare, shows that a significant number of landlords are accommodating applicants of the scheme in these areas.</p><p>  The provision of homeless accommodation services and associated costs is a matter for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government. Officials in the Department&rsquo;s community welfare service, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit (HPU) and the Asylum Seekers &amp;amp; New Communities Unit, work closely with local authorities and other stakeholders to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation. This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports. Officials in the Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department to develop an inter-agency intervention system to identify vulnerable households who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy. I am satisfied with the level of engagement in place between officials from the Department and the local authorities.  </p><p>   The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-16a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/946" speakername="Joan Burton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041600069#WRB01300"><p>Reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients were first introduced in 2009. Budget 2014 further extended the reduced rates of jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance to recipients under 26 years of age. This measure aims to incentivise young jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients to avail of education and training opportunities.  If a jobseeker in receipt of the reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance rate participates on an education or training programme they will receive a higher weekly payment of &euro;160.</p><p>  Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment at a young age can lead to welfare dependency from an early age.  That is why I believe that it is necessary to provide young jobseekers with a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training or to take up employment.  If they do not improve their skills, it will be much more difficult for them to avail of job opportunities as the economy recovers and they are at risk of becoming long term unemployed from a young age.  </p><p>  The report &ldquo;Social situation of young people in Europe&rdquo; by Eurofound recognises the importance of enhancing the social inclusion of young people who are not in employment, education or training (NEETs).  The report found that individuals in a NEET situation are more at risk of isolation and having mental and physical health issues.  The changes introduced in Budget 2014 provide an additional incentive for young jobseekers to engage in a wide range of education, training or employment programmes.  This approach with the continued roll-out of the Intreo activation model in conjunction with the implementation of the Youth Guarantee will further assist young people make the transition to the labour market. </p><p>  It is too early to determine what the Department&rsquo;s spending will be for 2014.  However, the entire allocation for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance as provided for in the revised 2014 Estimate is expected to be fully utilised this year.  There are therefore no plans to change the current reduced rates for younger jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance recipients.</p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  However, the Government also recognises the need for additional measures to address long-term unemployment in the interim while the economy recovers.  This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work Strategy which is being led by my Department.</p><p>  As part of the Pathways Strategy, the Dublin North Activation and Employer Engagement Strategy has been developed which adopts a multi-faceted, pro-active approach to employment support programmes in order to assist Jobseekers re-enter the workforce.  There have also been a range of new initiatives undertaken across the Division, including Pathways to Employment, Education and Training Fairs, Recruitment events for individual employers and initiatives specifically aimed at tackling Youth Unemployment.</p><p>  With reference to the Pathways Fairs, several hundred jobseekers are invited to the events, at which they are presented with details on the types, and the range of progression opportunities that are available, from education, training, through work-experience, internships and employment. C.V. &ldquo;clinics&rdquo; are also typically available on the day.  Our experience is that employers are increasingly using these events as a vehicle to recruit. </p><p>  Further events will be held in every Intreo Centre/Local Office area during 2014.  A Youth Guarantee Showcase Event was held in Ballymun Civic Centre on 27th March 2014.  A Pathways to Employment, Education and Training Fair was held in Erin&rsquo;s Isle GAA club on 10 April 2014 for 1000 invited claimants from Finglas and neighbouring areas.  The event, which was organised by Finglas Intreo Centre, was also attended by the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton TD. </p><p>  In a further initiative, breakfast briefing sessions were co-hosted with the Chamber of Commerce at which Departmental managers highlighted the advantages of recruiting from the Live Register, particularly the Long Term Unemployed, e.g. Jobsplus Scheme.</p><p>  Furthermore, Employment Services in Dublin North have hosted a number of large-scale recruitment events to cater for the recruitment needs of individual employers.  Two events were held in July and November 2013 for Green Shield Security Employment Services, each of which resulted in the recruitment of over 60 jobseekers.</p><p>  In addition, my Department is currently in the process of evaluating tenders for JobPath, the Government&rsquo;s new labour market activation service aimed specifically at the long-term unemployed and those most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed.  There will be a separate JobPath contract issued specifically for the Dublin region.</p></reply>

It is paid to some 607,919 families in respect of 1.16 million children, with an expenditure of approximately &euro;1.9 billion in 2013. Safeguarding the child benefit budget is a priority and in this regard the Department has taken a proactive approach to ensuring that it is only paid to eligible families.  A policy of issuing continuing eligibility certificates to parents, such as the letters referred to by the Deputy, commenced in 2008.  The control policy for the scheme was reviewed in 2010 to ensure that controls in place to prevent fraud and abuse continue to be effective and relevant.  As a result of this review, additional enhanced and updated control measures have been devised and implemented, with the continuing eligibility certification programme remaining as a key component of the control policy.  When responding to the eligibility certificates, customers are asked to confirm their residence and which school, cr&egrave;che or doctor their children attend.  The information provided is examined to ensure that child benefit only continues to be paid where there is an ongoing entitlement.</p><p>  Information received on child care as part of the child benefit control programme is used only in the context of this control measure, that is to indicate an ongoing entitlement to payment of child benefit and is not made available to any other agency for consideration in any other context, in line with data protection requirements.</p><p>  Questions relating to any review of child care issues should be addressed to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.</p></reply>

The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period if the employee is retained in full time employment for two years.  JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed.  The value of the aggregate monthly payments is &euro;7,500 for employing a jobseeker 12 to 24 months on the live register and &euro;10,000 if the jobseekers were on the live register for over 24 months.  Since its launch in July 2014, JobsPlus has concluded arrangements to support some 2,000 jobseekers in full-time employment, 60% of whom were previously over 24 months on the live register.JobsPlus is one of the many schemes being promoted to employers at a series of well attended employer briefing sessions which I am currently delivering throughout the country.  The objective of the employer information sessions is to increase awareness of the supports available to employers and the role they can plan in tackling the level of unemployment both locally and nationally.  A dedicated Employer Engagement Unit was established in the Department in 2012 to co-ordinate the Department&rsquo;s engagement with employers. The unit includes staff dealing with JobBridge, the European Job Mobility (EURES) and the National Contact Centre, which hosts the Jobs Ireland website, as well as providing policy and coordination support to employer engagement across the country.</p><p>In addition, the Department&rsquo;s divisional teams provide opportunities for direct engagement with employers with dedicated officers at senior management level leading the engagement process.

The allocation of additional resources to the activation of long term unemployed people was the focus of an updated &ldquo;Pathways to Work&rdquo; policy statement published in July 2013 (PTW 2013).  The Department examined various resourcing and contracting options, and taking note of recommendations by the OECD among others, the Government decided to procure additional capacity from providers with expertise and experience in the provision of employment supports or related services. </p><p>  This additional capacity will complement and augment the Department&rsquo;s own activation capacity.

One of the primary objectives of this strategy is to reduce the number of cash payments where possible.  This will generate significant savings in fees paid for cash services and increase efficiencies in the payment cycles at both departmental and national levels.  The Payment Strategy is consistent with wider Government policies. It gives new impetus to the policy first agreed by Government in 2004 to move to a fully electronic payments environment.  It is also grounded in the wider agenda for better public services and more effective e-payments as set out in the Public Service Reform Plan and the eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015.  The Strategy is fully aligned with the objectives of the National Payments Plan which stresses the criticality of moving to electronic payments in order to reduce the exceptionally high levels of cash usage in the Irish economy with its consequential impacts on costs and competitiveness.  In supporting this agenda, the Payment Strategy aims to remove the limits that cash payments impose on clients in terms of making onward financial transactions, availing of cheaper prices online and through electronic payment transfers, and building levels of financial inclusion.  However, I have consistently stressed that those most vulnerable in our society will be protected and that no client will be left without payment if they are not in a position to accept that payment electronically.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is fully aware of the Department&rsquo;s Payment Strategy.  The Deputy will be aware that these matters were addressed by Minister Rabbitte in this House and the Seanad recently. </p><p>  We are all conscious of the clear trend towards electronic payments which are being adopted by consumers generally as a matter of choice.  These behavioural choices are very apparent among the Department&rsquo;s clients also.  The Department is willing to accommodate its clients in exercising their choice for electronic payments where this is possible in the interests of economy, efficiency and national competitiveness. </p></reply>

There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided in excess of &euro;344 million in 2014.In Waterford City and East Waterford, approximately 1,280 rent supplement applications are administered in a centralised unit, based at the Intreo Office.</p><p>  The timescale for determining applications for rent supplement is dependent, among other things, on the availability of the required information, such as confirmation of a Housing Needs Assessment (HNA) by the relevant Local Authority, where applicable; details of the applicant&rsquo;s income and bank statements. Some aspects of the application process are inevitably time-consuming and delays can occur where investigations such as home visits or third party evidence are required.  </p><p>  The most common reason for the delay in processing applications in the Waterford office is the waiting period for the completion of a HNA by the Local Authority and a failure or delay on the applicant&rsquo;s part, to respond to written requests for additional information or documentation to support the application for rent supplement. </p><p>  There have been significant staff changes in the unit administering rent supplement claims over the past year and it has recently relocated from a Health Services Executive premises to the Intreo centre. The relocation is now complete and the introduction of a new file management system is improving efficiency. Rent supplement applications that are fully completed and where all necessary supporting documentation is provided are currently being processed within 5 to 10 working days of receipt.  </p><p>  Following the relocation of this office, customers can avail of a one to one personal service from the officers dealing with their rent supplement claim. Any customer requiring such assistance will be provided with an appointment within two working days and on the same day in case of emergency or crisis.</p><p>  The provision of a prompt and efficient service is a major objective for the Department&rsquo;s staff dealing with rent supplement applications, subject to the necessity to ensure that each case is fully investigated and dealt with in a consistent and fair manner.</p></reply>

A budget of &euro;19m has been earmarked for the initiative in 2014.  Taken together, some 40,000 work placements will be provided in 2014 under the various schemes funded by the Department.  </p><p>  Additionally in 2014, jobseekers may access in excess of 30,000 full and part-time training and education opportunities and over 11,000 opportunities to pursue self-employment options &ndash; all on a voluntary basis.  In the context of this level of provision, there is a good case to be made to pursue a policy of randomly selecting jobseekers who have been unemployed and not sought to access the range of opportunities provided by the Department and other agencies.  Pathways to Work introduced a new code of rights and responsibilities whereby, in return for welfare support, jobseekers must actively seek employment or engage with employment or training services.  The Social Welfare Acts have been strengthened to provide a number of sanctions if a jobseeker refuses without good cause or fails to avail of any reasonable offer of training or participation in a work placement.  This is considered a necessary part of the efficient and effective functioning of any activation policy.</p><p>  Deputies are fully aware of the positive benefits schemes like community employment, T&uacute;s and the rural social scheme have on both participants and the services they deliver to communities around the country and the wellbeing that results.  In particular, I would highlight the personal benefits to the jobseeker of being able to engage in worthwhile work in their community borne out by their own testimonies and by evaluations conducted by implementing bodies.  Gateway is modelled on these successful schemes with the same level of pay and similar conditions.  In addition to providing short-term working opportunities for people who are unemployed, it will contribute to the management of the Live Register and act as a deterrent to those not eligible for welfare benefits.  A pilot study is currently underway to develop voluntary access to Gateway.

The Pensions Ombudsman continuously monitors the response time to queries regarding pension complaints and has done so since the establishment of the Office.  The Pensions Ombudsman has been proactive in introducing streamlined procedures aimed at reducing the number of cases which go to a full investigation.  This involves seeking to resolve cases by means of mediation between the parties with a view to producing a satisfactory outcome.  However, due to the complexity of many of the issues raised by clients in relation to their pension complaints, a detailed investigation is often required and this in turn adds to the time it takes to arrive at a Final Determination by the Pensions Ombudsman. The emphasis of the Pensions Ombudsman continues to be on resolving older cases and shortening the duration of investigations.   The Pensions Ombudsman is an independent and impartial statutory officer who exercises his functions independently of Government and of the pensions industry.  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman is an agency under the aegis of my Department.</p></reply>

In-built in the Strategy is a strong monitoring component, including a set of key performance indicators (KPIs) for this purpose.  Progress in implementing the priority actions and performance against the KPIs are reported publicly, on a quarterly basis.  In addition, I have set up an independent Labour Market Council composed of non-governmental representatives.  The Labour Market Council was established to monitor and advise on the implementation of the reforms contained in the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work (PTW) strategy.  The Council has a particular focus on Employer Engagement, JobPath and the Youth Guarantee.  To date, the work of the Council has centred on reviewing the performance of PTW 2013 and advising the Department on measures to improve employer engagement.  I eagerly await the Council&rsquo;s Interim Report, which is due to be published later this month.  Once I have read the report, I will consider adjusting the Pathways to Work Strategy in light of its findings.  Thus far, most of the targets/milestones set out in PTW 2013 are either being met or ahead of target.  The key achievements to date are outlined below: A further 26,600 people who had been long-term unemployed at the beginning of 2012 moved into employment in 2013 (exceeding the target of 20,000).  The total number of people from this group who have moved into employment since PTW was launched in 2012 is now over 40,000; 44 Intreo ["one stop shop"] offices have been officially opened, with the remaining 16 to launched by the end of this year; Last year, 130,100 unemployed jobseekers attended group engagements, up from 68,600 in 2012.  156,700 people attended initial one-to-one interviews and a further 136,900 follow up one-to one interviews were also completed.  The Department of Social Protection is now offering Group Engagements to all new jobseekers registering with its services; The number of staff deployed on front-line case work duties was doubled at the end of 2013 from c 300 to c 600, leading to an increase in the caseworker/client ratio from c 1:800 to c 1:400.  The introduction of JobPath, commencing later this year, will further improve this ratio to c 1:200; Every jobseeker client on the Live Register has been profiled to help prioritise and direct interventions.</p><p>  With specific reference to youth unemployment, the main strategy of the Government is set out in the Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan which was launched in January.  Key to our Youth Guarantee is a gradual, targeted approach focusing resources first and foremost on those with the greatest need.  This will include adjustments to the existing engagement process and schemes such as JobBridge and JobsPlus.  These adjustments are designed specifically to address the needs of young people at risk of becoming or remaining long-term unemployed.  As part of the implementation of the Youth Guarantee it is proposed, subject to labour market and economic developments, to review the targeted nature of the Youth Guarantee offer, before the end of 2015.</p></reply>

FIS is designed to prevent child and family poverty and to offer a financial incentive to take-up employment as compared to social welfare payments.  Expenditure on FIS for 2014 is estimated to be of the order of &euro;280 million and it is currently paid to some 44,000 families in respect of some 97,000 children.  An integral part of the FIS scheme is that once the level of payment is determined, it continues to be payable at that rate for a period of 52 weeks, provided that the person remains in full-time employment.</p><p>  However, in the following two circumstances, the weekly rate of FIS can be revised during the year: If a claimant starts to care for an additional child in the course of the 52 weeks; If a claimant was getting a one-parent family payment and this payment was stopped because their youngest child reached the relevant age limit, then the FIS rate can be reassessed to take account of the loss of their one-parent family payment.</p><p>  The rate of payment will not change if there is an increase or decrease in the recipient&rsquo;s earnings.  A key advantage of this approach, which is unique to the FIS scheme, is that claimants can be certain that they will receive a guaranteed level of income support throughout the period.  This certainty is important to the success of the scheme as it provides a real incentive to workers with families to avail of employment opportunities.  For those who experience a reduction in their income over the course of the year, the rate of payment will be reassessed at the end of the 52 weeks upon renewal of a FIS claim.  </p><p>  Creating jobs and reducing unemployment are key challenges facing the Government.  The tax and social protection systems have a part to play by ensuring work is remunerative.  I established an Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare with the aim of harnessing expert opinion and experience to develop cost-effective proposals for improving employment incentives and achieving better poverty outcomes.  The Group is currently examining the issue of working age supports, including in-work supports such as FIS.  I expect to receive the report of the Advisory Group in the coming months and look forward to considering its recommendations in relation to FIS and other in-work supports.</p></reply>

I should also emphasise that the Department takes its responsibilities in relation to data protection and protecting the data of its clients very seriously.  Every effort is made to ensure that personal customer data is used solely for business purposes and that it is not compromised in any way.  The Department has data protection and information security policies, standards, procedures and guidelines in place governing the use of its computer systems and customer data.  As I have indicated the Department&rsquo;s policies, procedures and guidelines are kept under constant review and are updated as appropriate.  Staff members are regularly reminded of their obligations under data protection and information security policies and of the penalties that are applicable in respect of any breach of these policies.  Data protection obligations are also covered on induction programmes for new staff members and on management development programmes and in presentations given by the Department&rsquo;s Business Information and Internal Control Support Units.</p></reply>

There has been a steady growth both in the number of families supported by FIS over recent years and associated expenditure as set in the table below.  Expenditure on the FIS scheme is estimated to be &euro;281.7 million in 2014, up &euro;20 million on 2013.</p><p><table><tr><th>Year </th><th>Number in payment  (approx.) </th><th>Expenditure  (&euro; Millions) </th></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>28,875 </td><td>204.5</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>32,310</td><td>223.6</td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>44,160</td><td>261.5 (provisional) </td></tr></table></p><p>The Department avails of every opportunity in its engagement with employers and jobseekers to build awareness of the availability of FIS and how this payment may benefit potential employees with children.  The increasing numbers of families in receipt of FIS is testament to the effectiveness of the Department&rsquo;s information strategy for the scheme and the significant improvements in customer service and processing times for FIS customers.</p><p>The Departments web site www.welfare.ie has full information on the FIS scheme and provides typical family scenarios to aid understanding and provide comparisons.  This information is also available in all the Department local offices, CICs and information offices.</p><p>In addition a series of road-shows have also been held around the country designed to inform employers about the wide range of employment support services provided by the Department, including FIS.  Case Officers in each locality will specifically use FIS as an incentive to move people from the long-term Live Register to employment.</p><p>Furthermore, the Department launched a Benefit of Work ready reckoner in December last year.  The ready reckoner gives an indication of the difference between a person&rsquo;s potential in-work payment, including FIS, and current out-of-work payments.</p><p>The Department will shortly be launching a poster campaign in its Intreo centres and local offices to further promote FIS.  In conclusion, I am satisfied that the FIS scheme is being  promoted and evidence shows that it is fulfilling its role in assisting employees to take up employment opportunities and to remain at work.</p></reply>

This objective is to be achieved over time by enhancing the Intreo engagement with newly unemployed young people, and by maintaining and developing the current range of education, training and employment interventions for young people. It will also be supported by the recovery in the economy, which has seen employment grow by 61,000 over the last year, and youth unemployment fall from a peak of over 80,000 in early 2009 to an estimated 54,000 at present (Eurostat estimate for February 2014, seasonally adjusted)  Based on current planned provision, the estimated uptake of programme places by young people in 2014 is set out in detail in the table below.<table><tr><th>#</th><th>#</th><th>#</th><th>Expected participation, activation programmes, 2014</th></tr><tr><td>Programme</td><td>Average participation</td><td>Inflow of new participants</td><td>Expected inflow<br /><br />of young people</td></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td>6,000</td><td>3,300</td><td>3,300</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)</td><td>7,700</td><td>13,300</td><td>5,000</td></tr><tr><td>Tus</td><td>7,500</td><td>7,500</td><td>1,000</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>4,000</td><td>2,000</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>6,500</td><td>6,500</td><td>2,000</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>18,500</td><td>9,300</td><td>3,300</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>11,000</td><td>5,500</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>5,600</td><td>2,800</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td>10,300</td><td>25,000</td><td>9,500</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports</td><td>#</td><td>700</td><td>700</td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td>#</td><td>150</td><td>150</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td>250</td><td>250</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>3,000</td><td>3,000</td><td>450</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>25,300</td><td>12,700</td><td>500</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>105,650</td><td>92,000</td><td>28,350</td></tr><tr><td>PLCs<br /><br />Apprenticeship</td><td>35,000<br /><br />8,000</td><td>32,000<br /><br />2,500</td><td>22,000<br /><br />2,000</td></tr><tr><td>Vocational Third Level</td><td>#</td><td>#</td><td>It is estimated that at least 50% of the 41,000 entrants to third level each year are entering courses leading towards defined occupations</td></tr></table></p><p>While the resources under the Youth Guarantee are targeted more towards those with the highest risk of becoming long-term unemployed, all young people signing on enter the engagement process (via Group Engagement sessions) within the first two weeks of signing on. Effectively, therefore, all persons under the age of 25 who become unemployed and join the Live Register represent the target group at whom policies developed under the Guarantee are aimed. </p><p>Given the range of programmes and approaches envisaged under the implementation plan, it is not possible, at any given time, to identify a specific group of young people as being qualified for the guarantee. However, the published implementation plan notes that in 2012 some 56,000 young people joined the Live Register as wholly unemployed, and some 35,000 (63%) of these remained unemployed for four months or more. The target of the guarantee approach will be to lead to a significant reduction in this number over time.  The number of staff deployed on front-line case work duties was doubled in the last quarter  of 2013 from approximately 300 to about 600. This allocation of staff is being facilitated by significant process and organisational changes within the Department of Social Protection, and is leading to an increase in the caseworker/client ratio from about 1:800 to about 1:400. The introduction of JobPath, commencing later in 2014, will further improve this ratio to 1:200.</p></reply>

As they were not engaged by my Department, I am not in a position to comment on how much they were paid to research possible changes to the tax treatment of pensions or the duration of any consultancy in this regard. Nor would it be appropriate for me to do so.</p><p>  The Standard Fund Threshold (SFT) is the maximum allowable pension fund at retirement for tax purposes. I received proposals in late 2012 from the TPPG for changes to the SFT regime, as an alternative to standard rating of pension tax relief, which it was claimed would yield savings and tax revenues in the region of &euro;400 million.</p><p>  I announced in Budget 2013 that changes would be put in place in 2014 to the SFT together with other possible changes to give effect to the commitment in the Programme for Government to cap taxpayers  subsidies for pension schemes which deliver pension income of more than &euro;60,000 per annum. At that time and pending further analysis of the TPPG proposals, I included a much lower savings figure of &euro;250 million in the Budget 2013 arithmetic. That analysis ultimately revealed significant downside risks to the achievement of even this lower level of yield or savings.</p><p>  The estimate of the yield from the changes to the SFT regime which I actually announced in Budget 2014 and provided for in Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 is &euro;120 million. These changes differ in some respects from those proposed by the TPPG; for example the introduction of age-related valuation factors for the purposes of placing a capital value on Defined Benefit pension rights for SFT purposes which vary with the age at which the pensions are drawn down, thereby improving equity within the regime. They also reflect the requirement, on legal advice, to protect pension rights already accrued at the date of change (i.e. 1 January 2014).</p></reply>

The Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) applies to the mortgage lending activities of all regulated entities, except credit unions, operating in the State, including, inter alia, a financial services provider authorised, registered or licensed in another EU or EEA Member State and which has provided, or is providing, mortgage lending activities in the State. </p><p>  Tanager Ltd is not a regulated financial service provider. </p><p>  In March 2013 the Central Bank published the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) framework, which set out performance targets for mortgage arrears resolution at six Irish mortgage lenders. The six lenders, Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Permanent tsb, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank are required to meet targets at quarterly intervals. The mortgage arrears resolution targets cover both proposed and concluded sustainable solutions, with respect to the lenders 'Republic of Ireland principal dwelling home / primary residence ('PDH') and buy-to-let ('BTL') mortgagees. </p><p>  The Central Bank has informed me that Tanager Ltd is not one of the six lenders subject to MART. </p><p>However, Tanager Ltd has indicated clearly   that it intends to voluntarily adopt the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA) to manage the acquired loans as it believes following the CCMA is in the best interests of all and forms part of its core strategy.</p><p>  A number of the purchasers of mortgage loan books are abiding by the Central Bank Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears on a voluntary basis. I accept that this is not the same as the consumer having the right to the free service provided by the Financial Services Ombudsman; such a consumer would have recourse to the Courts in the usual manner. However, voluntary adherence to the Code seems to be in the interests of both the consumer and the purchasing entity.</p><p>  In March 2014 the Government affirmed its commitment to bringing forward legislation to protect consumers whose mortgages are sold to unregulated entities. The Department of Finance recently sent draft heads of the legislation to the Central Bank for its consideration in advance of more detailed engagement with the Attorney General's office. I do not consider it appropriate to discuss the details of these draft heads because we are at a very preliminary stage and the heads have not been cleared from a legal viewpoint. However, I can assure you that we are committed to bringing forward this legislation.</p></reply>

The payment of this allowance was later extended to those persons in receipt of social welfare disability payments to introduce equality of treatment for all people in training.  The payment was reduced from &euro;31.80 per week to &euro;20 per week as part of Budget 2011. In the present economic and employment situation this incentive is no longer considered appropriate and as part of Budget 2014 it was decided to cease this payment for all SOLAS participants commencing courses after 1 January 2014. This change does not apply to persons who commenced a course prior to January 2014 who will continue to receive the long term unemployed bonus payment for the duration of their course. Travel supports continue to be available to participants on SOLAS training courses.  This is a decision taken in the context of the overall savings this Department had to find for 2014 and future years.

There is an Irish language school already located in that area. The question of location for the new Irish language school was, therefore, considered in the context of providing access to both Irish language schools to the greatest number of pupils across the area.  In relation to demographics, over an 8 year period, the junior infant intake into schools in the area increased from 83 pupils to a current enrolment of 239 pupils. The primary school specifically within the Ballyogan area itself has seen a growth in its enrolments from 103 pupils in 2008 to 350 pupils in the current school year.</p><p>  The Department is satisfied that the site location for the school in question is consistent with its published technical guidance documents on the identification and suitability assessment of sites for primary and post-primary schools, which sets out the criteria to be used in assessing potential school sites and includes criteria relating to safe access, traffic management and mobility. The Deputy is probably aware that An Bord Plean&aacute;la recently granted Planning Permission for the development of the school.

However, the Department does not accept, based on research, advice and best practice, that ABA should be the only approach used.  While ABA helps to improve behaviour, other approaches, such as Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) are just as important in developing children's communication and speech skills.  It is important that children have access to a range of approaches so that their broader needs can be met.  As children differ significantly from one another and as children's needs vary and change over time, it is not possible to impose a method or approach that will work for all children with autism.  This child centred approach is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism.</p><p>  The Deputy may be aware that the National Council Special Education (NCSE) is currently preparing policy advice on the education of children with autism. The NCSE have advised my Department that the Policy Advice will be delivered in the spring of 2015 and will draw upon findings gathered from an extensive consultation process which has already commenced.  The advice will also draw upon the research commissioned by the NCSE as well as any other research which may be available and which the NCSE considers merits consideration.  It will be open to all interested parties to contribute to the consultation process and I expect that the NCSE final report will reflect the broadest possible range of views and provide recommendations which will assist the development of policy for future years.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September.  The staffing arrangements include the provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional permanent mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment for September 2014.  The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria, including developing grounds, to an independent Appeals Board.</p><p>  In addition, the staffing appeals process at primary level has been extended for the coming school year to allow schools that are not gaining an additional teaching post under the developing schools criterion to submit an appeal to the Primary Staffing Appeals Board.  This appeal criterion is targeted at those schools that make a significant contribution to the provision of school places and so assist the response to demographic growth within their area and, as a result, are under significant pressure on their class sizes at infants level.  Circular 0007/2014 provides details for schools wishing to make an appeal.</p><p>  The next meeting of the Primary Staffing Appeals Board will be held in June, 2014.  The closing date for schools to submit an appeal application to the Department's Primary Allocations Section is Friday 30 May, 2014.  It is open to the school referred to by the Deputy to submit an application(s) to my Department as outlined above. </p></reply>

An additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  This additional levy will continue to help fund the<i>Jobs Initiative</i>, including the continuation of the reduced 9% VAT rate in the hospitality sector and to make provision for potential State liabilities which may emerge from pre-existing or future pension fund difficulties.  </p><p>The revenues arising to the Exchequer from the levy are, in common with Exchequer revenues generally, not hypothecated to any particular item of expenditure or liability but have been used to help fund the various measures introduced by the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>. </p><p>In relation to DB schemes and double insolvencies, agreement has been secured for certain liabilities to be met by the Exchequer, where they arise.  However, it must be stressed that I am not aware of any double insolvencies 'in the pipeline'.  I see this as providing an insurance and it is not expected that there will be a significant draw on contingency funds available.  Rather, the regulatory measures now in place are intended to move underfunded schemes towards an appropriate funding position and further minimise the risk of a requirement to utilise funds raised through the pension levy.  The legislation which I introduced late last year to provide funding in the event of a double insolvency does not provide for the imposition of penalties on the trustees of a scheme in the event of a double insolvency.</p><p>You will be aware that I published a 'Report on Pensions Charges' in October 2012.  This is the first comprehensive Government report on this subject.  The purpose of the report was to gather information on the level of pension charges levied to assess whether charges are reasonable and transparent, to report on the findings and make recommendations.  The report highlights a wide range of issues in relation to pension charges and identifies a number of serious problems.  While the provision of pension schemes cannot be cost free, it is clear that there are major challenges to be addressed in the two main areas of reasonableness and transparency of charges.  </p><p>A Pension Charges Working Group is in place to initiate actions that follow up on the recommendations of the report.  This group comprises the Department of Social Protection, the Pensions Board and the Central Bank.   Each has a core role to play in delivering on the recommendations contained in the 'Report on Pension Charges' and work is progressing in this regard.  Improvements in disclosure requirements, including those for pensions, were introduced in the Central Bank&rsquo;s 2012 Consumer Protection Code and these should enhance transparency for those consumers covered by the Code.  There are also various ongoing developments at EU level which should lead to stronger consumer protection over time.  </p><p>The imposition of a statutory limit on the amount of fees that a pension fund can charge was not recommended in the report.  The focus of the recommendations is on measures which would increase consumer understanding and provide a better result for the consumer.  The view is that, in principle, it is not good practice to interfere in the price fixing mechanisms of the market, particularly since this could result in unintended consequences which may impact on competition.  However, this will be kept under review with further consideration being given to more stringent options in the future.  </p><p>Developments in broader pensions policy needs to be taken into account addressing the issues of pension charges, given that the research clearly identifies the importance of economies of scale in driving down charges.  The proposed introduction of an auto-enrolment pension scheme for all employees may be the most effective way to introduce change and could have a major impact in reducing charges, particularly for those people with small pension funds and reduced pension expectations.  International experience has shown that this type of scheme is extremely successful in providing a simplified and lower cost charging structure and a consistent application across employer.</p><p>Last month I announced key appointments to the Pensions Authority and Pensions Council.  These new bodies will strengthen governance of occupational pensions and give consumers greater input into pension provision.  Under the strengthened arrangements, the Pensions Board was renamed the Pensions Authority to better reflect its key role of safeguarding the pensions of occupational pension scheme members and also the provision of information on occupational pensions.  The changes will ensure the system has a far stronger consumer focus, with the Pensions Council there to represent and protect the consumer.  As its first task, I will be asking the Council to monitor the implementation of the recommendations in the Report on Pension Charges to tackle excessive fees, and advise me if further actions are needed.<b></b></p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  (For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer&rsquo;s PRSI is 8.50%).  </p><p>  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  It is recognised that the downturn in the economy had an impact on many self-employed persons and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels.  This may be reflected in any assessment of their means from self-employment for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance purposes.  As in the case of a non-self-employed claimant for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or disability allowance, the means of husband/wife, civil partner or co-habitant will be taken into account in deciding on entitlement to a payment.</p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  As part of the consultation process the Group invited organisations, stakeholders or individuals who had registered an interest in doing so to make written submissions. Submissions were received from ISME and from the Small Firms Association. </p><p>  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p><p>  The Group also found that extending social insurance for the self-employed was warranted in cases related to long term sickness or injuries.  To this end, the Group recommended that Class S benefits should be extended to provide cover for people who are permanently incapable of work, because of a long-term illness or incapacity, through the invalidity pension and the partial capacity benefit schemes.  The Group further recommended that the extension of social insurance in this regard should be on a compulsory basis and that the rate of contribution for Class S should be increased by at least 1.5 percentage points.  </p><p>  This recommendation will require further consideration in conjunction with the findings of the most recent Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund which indicated that the self-employed achieve better value for money compared to the employed when the comparison includes both employer and employee contributions in respect of the employed person.  </p><p>  My colleagues in Government and I will reflect on the findings of the Advisory Group on this issue and will further consider the recommendations contained in the report taking into account future developments in terms of the budgetary and fiscal situation.</p></reply>

The principal conditions for receipt of the allowance are that full-time care and attention is required and is being provided and that the means test is satisfied. The carer must not be working/self employed outside the home in excess of 15 hours per week.  If the carer qualifies for carer's allowance they may also qualify for free household benefits (if carer is residing with the person being caring for) and a free travel pass. The household benefits package incorporates the electricity allowance, cash electricity allowance, natural gas allowance, cash gas allowance and the free television licence. This is a package of allowances which helps with the costs of running a household.  Only one person in a household can qualify for the package at any time.  Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance is determined by the completion and submission of an application form to carer&rsquo;s allowance section, Social Welfare Services Office, Ballinalee Road, Longford.</p><p>The carer&rsquo;s benefit scheme is a weekly income support payment.  It is specifically intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention.  Entitlement to carer&rsquo;s benefit is based on applicant satisfying medical, employment and PRSI contribution conditions.  The maximum duration of the scheme is set at 104 weeks.</p><p>The respite care grant is an annual payment made to full-time carers who satisfy certain conditions.  The grant is payable automatically to carers who are in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance or benefit, domiciliary care allowance or prescribed relative allowance on the first Thursday in June of the relevant year.  Carers who are not in receipt of one of the payments listed above should apply separately for a respite care grant.</p><p>If carer qualifies for carer's allowance, they may be awarded credits (credited PRSI contributions) for the period of caring. However, if a carer is not entitled to credits, they may qualify to have 'homemaking years' taken into account for State Pension (Contributory) purposes.</p><p>Further information on all of the above is available on the Department&rsquo;s website .</p></reply>

In doing so they must satisfy all relevant conditions and many social welfare schemes do not preclude a customer from engaging in unpaid work.</p><p>Where a person is in receipt of a jobseeker payment they are required to be unemployed, available to accept an offer of full-time work and be actively engaged in seeking such work.  A person who is engaged in employment, either paid or unpaid, would not be considered to meet these requirements.</p><p>Due to the conditionality attached to jobseeker schemes, the Department has introduced a number of options which are specifically aimed at jobseeker customers.  Under the Voluntary Work Option, a person who engages in voluntary work within the State may continue to be entitled to jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit or allowance provided that, in engaging in the voluntary work, the customer continues to satisfy the statutory conditions of being available for full-time employment and genuinely seeking work.  The groups or organisations involved may be national or local voluntary or community groups and it would be usual for the organisation to be a registered charity or a not-for-profit organisation.   Examples of voluntary work in which jobseekers may engage include helping the sick, elderly or persons with a disability, assisting youth clubs, church groups, sports groups, cultural organisations, or local resident associations.</p><p>JobBridge is the National internship scheme which provides work experience placements for interns for either a six month or a nine month period.  Time spent on back to education allowance can be taken into account to qualify for JobBridge provided that the person has first completed the relevant course of education. </p><p>Information on JobBridge and on the voluntary work option is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at and in all of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo centres and local offices.</p></reply>

However, over 12,000 host organisations have participated in the scheme since its inception on 1<sup>st</sup>July, 2011.  As at 10<sup>th</sup>April 2014, 27,781 interns had participated in JobBridge, of whom 6,666 are currently on internships.  </p><p>The independent evaluation conducted by Indecon found that 61% of interns moved into employment 5 or more months after completing their internship.  This figure compares favourably with similar schemes across the OECD.</p><p>Host organisations are precluded from filling a position with a JobBridge intern that would otherwise be filled by a paid employee. On the other hand, host organisations are required to provide the intern with a high quality real-workplace experience. To ensure that JobBridge interns do not displace employees, the Department maintains rigorous monitoring and control measures, including at the point of registration and advertisement, review of monthly online compliance reports,  random on-site monitoring visits including discussions with both host organisation and intern, and the investigation of complaints received from interns or concerned individuals.  The Department treats such complaints very seriously and remedial action is taken in all cases of non-compliance.  </p><p>However, it is important to highlight that the overwhelming majority of companies are abiding by the terms and conditions of the JobBridge scheme.  Over 3,000 monitoring visits have been conducted to-date and 98% of these visits are of a satisfactory nature.  In addition, the independent evaluation of JobBridge found there to be only minimal deadweight and displacement.</p></reply>

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are currently approximately 78,000 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;344 million for 2014. </p><p>  Following the most recent review of the private rental market undertaken by the Department revised maximum rent limits were introduced from Monday 17 June 2013 until 31 December 2014. Despite the overall pressures on the social protection budget, there have been increases in the rent limits in some areas including Dublin and North Kildare. The purpose of the review is to ensure availability of accommodation for rent supplement tenancies and not to provide access to all housing in all areas while ensuring maximum value for money is achieved. </p><p>  I am aware of the difficulties facing prospective tenants to secure appropriate accommodation due to the reduced availability of rental properties, particularly in Dublin. Increasing the maximum rent limits for rent supplement will not resolve this difficulty and would result in further increases in rental costs for all persons renting including those on reduced incomes and students. I have no plans to revise the maximum rent limits at this time.   </p><p>  The Dublin local authorities are currently engaging with the Department in developing an inter-agency intervention system to identify vulnerable families who are in receipt of rent supplement and at risk of becoming homeless due to the imminent loss of their tenancy.  These cases will be assessed on an individual basis having regard to the individual circumstances of the families involved. </p><p>  Department officials administering rent supplement have considerable experience in dealing with customers of the scheme and will continue to make every effort to ensure that their accommodation needs are met.  </p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategic policy direction is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of a short term income support. In July 2013 the Government approved the introduction of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP). Under HAP, responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from the Department of Social Protection to local authorities.  Officials in the Department are working closely with those in the lead Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, in piloting HAP in Limerick City and County Council with further roll out to selected local authorities during the year. </p></reply>

Economic recovery will underpin jobs growth.  This strategy is working. Employment rose by 61,000 during 2013, which represents a year-on-year increase of 3.3%. The unemployment rate has fallen to 11.8% &ndash; the lowest rate in 5 years &ndash; and is down from a peak of just over 15% in 2011.</p><p>Long-term unemployment has fallen from 196,000 at the end of 2011 to 155,000 at the end of 2013, a decline of over 40,000 in less than two years. As a result the long-term unemployment rate had fallen to 7.2% down from a peak of over 9%. Similarly, youth unemployment has also fallen, from 67,700 at the end of 2011 to 48,800 at the end of 2013. As a result the youth unemployment rate had fallen to 24% down from a peak of 33%.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite the progress that has been made, the Government recognises that both youth unemployment and long-term unemployment remain unacceptably high. Hence, the Government also recognises the need for additional activation measures in the interim while the economy recovers. This is the rationale behind the Government&rsquo;s Pathways to Work strategy and the Youth Guarantee, both of which are being led by my Department.  </p><p>Pathways set a target (among others)  of moving 75,000 of the 180,800 people, who were on the Live Register for over a year (long-term unemployed) at the beginning of 2012, into employment by the end of 2015. By the end of February this year, over 45,000 of this group had already moved into employment, 13,000 of whom had taken up part-time employment. </p><p>Pathways to Work includes a wide range of programmes and services to help jobseekers back to employment. Below is a table which sets out the level of provision on programmes for 2014, indicating also which programmes are particularly targeted at the long-term unemployed. These include programmes such as JobBridge, JobsPlus and Momentum introduced by this Government and schemes such as Community Employment and T&Uacute;S where we have significantly increased the number of places available. </p><p>In summary, Pathways to Work sets out a strategy for the full rollout of a radically reformed public employment service by 2015.  The Government is currently on target to meet this goal.</p><p>The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the unemployment problem is to focus resources on those individuals most at risk of long-term unemployment.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection keeps a detailed breakdown of the profiles of jobseekers. Data on each client&rsquo;s age, past occupation, and his/her education, is collected at the point of registration for job-seekers&rsquo; payment; these and other relevant data are processed and the probability of exiting the live register is calculated (PEX). This is essentially a predictor of whether or not someone will become long-term unemployed.  The roll-out of the profiling system at the Department&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop-shop&rsquo; Intreo offices implicitly involves age profiling of the long-term unemployed, as age is one of the main determining variables in predicting if someone will become long-term unemployed. As a result, if someone is in an age category that is more likely to experience long-term unemployment, s/he will, all other things being equal, receive more targeted assistance.  </p><p>Summary statistical information on the clients&rsquo; age, duration of unemployment, and last held occupation together with other demographic and regional information is published on the Central Statistics Office website.  </p><p>In addition, the Youth Guarantee initiative is specifically aimed at those under 25 who are unemployed with specific targeting of those who are either long-term unemployed or are most at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. The implementation of the Guarantee is a medium-term policy of the Irish Government. The guarantee of an offer of training, education or work experience for those aged 18-24 years after a four month period should be implemented on a phased basis. </p><p>Starting in 2014, and for completion by the end of 2014, processes and programmes will be progressively rolled out to ensure that all of those young unemployed people who need most support (i.e. are assessed as having a low probability of securing employment in the absence of support from the Public Employment Services) will receive a Youth Guarantee offer within four months. </p><p>During 2014 &ndash; 2015 all long-term unemployed young people under 25 will be engaged by the Public Employment Service and will receive a Youth Guarantee offer if still unemployed after four months of this engagement process commencing. </p><p>A breakdown of likely activation places available for 2014 is presented in the table.  The programmes where being long-term unemployed is an eligibility requirement are indicated, as well the expected inflow of young people.</p><p>The cost of the Youth Guarantee will be funded, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer.  However, it is expected that a number of these programmes will meet ESF eligibility criteria and will be included in the Youth Employment Initiative application for Ireland.  This should permit EU funding to be drawn down in respect of expenditure in 2014 and 2015 to a level that should enable the full YEI allocation for Ireland of &euro;68.1 million in current prices (with a further similar amount in ESF funding) to be taken up over those two years.</p><p><b>Expected participation, activation programmes, 2014</b><table><tr><th>Programme</th><th>Average participation</th><th>Expected inflow of young people</th><th>Inflow of new participants (all ages)</th><th>Aimed at Long Term Unemployed ?</th></tr><tr><td>Youthreach/CTC</td><td>6,000</td><td>3,300</td><td>3,300</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>JobBridge (including planned reserve)</td><td>7,700</td><td>5,000</td><td>13,300</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Tus</td><td>7,500</td><td>1,000</td><td>7,500</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>JobsPlus</td><td>4,000</td><td>1,500</td><td>2,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Momentum</td><td>6,500</td><td>2,000</td><td>6,500</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>BTEA (excl Momentum)</td><td>18,500</td><td>3,300</td><td>9,300</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>BTWEA</td><td>11,000</td><td>200</td><td>5,500</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>VTOS</td><td>5,600</td><td>500</td><td>2,800</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>FAS/Solas</td><td>10,300</td><td>9,500</td><td>25,000</td><td>40% target</td></tr><tr><td>CEB youth Entrepreneurship Training and Mentoring supports</td><td>-</td><td>700</td><td>700</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>CEB/MFI micro-loans for young people</td><td>-</td><td>150</td><td>150</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>International Work Experience and Training</td><td>250</td><td>250</td><td>250</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Gateway</td><td>3,000</td><td>450</td><td>3,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Community Employment</td><td>25,300</td><td>500</td><td>12,700</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>105,650</td><td>28,350</td><td>92,000</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>PLCs<br /><br />Apprenticeship</td><td>35,000<br /><br />8,000</td><td>22,000<br /><br />2,000</td><td>32,000<br /><br />2,500</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Vocational Third Level </td><td>It is estimated that at least 50% of the 41,000 entrants to third level each year are entering courses leading towards defined occupations</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>The cost of the Youth Guarantee will be funded, in the first instance, by the Irish Exchequer.

JobsPlus provides a direct monthly financial incentive to employers who recruit employees from those who are long term on the live register.  The incentive is payable, on a monthly basis, over a two year period if the employee is retained in full time employment for two years.  JobsPlus is biased in favour of those who are longer term unemployed.  The value of the aggregate monthly payments is &euro;7,500 for employing a jobseeker 12 to 24 months on the live register and &euro;10,000 if the jobseekers was on the live register for over 24 months.  At the end of March 2014, payments under the JobsPlus scheme had been made in respect of 1,874 new jobs with expenditure totalling &euro;2.83 million to date. Progress is detailed on the table below.  The Deputy should note that 60% of beneficiaries were previously over 24 months on the live register.  <table><tr><th>Table: JobsPlus - Number of Employee Supported</th><th>-</th></tr><tr><td>Month</td><td><div>Total </div></td></tr><tr><td>August 2013</td><td><div>85</div></td></tr><tr><td>September 2013</td><td><div>235</div></td></tr><tr><td>October 2013</td><td><div>517</div></td></tr><tr><td>November 2013</td><td><div>844</div></td></tr><tr><td>December 2013</td><td><div>1,114</div></td></tr><tr><td>January 2014</td><td><div>1,286</div></td></tr><tr><td>February 2014</td><td><div>1,589</div></td></tr><tr><td>March 2014</td><td><div>1,874</div></td></tr></table></p></reply>

Up to 2009 the average number of appeals received was 15,000 per annum, whereas in 2012 the number of appeals received peaked at 35,484, reducing to 32,777 appeals in 2013.  This has placed considerable pressure on the office.</p><p>  Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process to manage this increased workload, reduce backlogs and improve appeals processing times for appellants, while, at the same time, recognising the need to ensure that quality and fairness are not compromised.  An additional 15 Appeals Officers have been assigned to the office over the past three years, in addition to 10 former Community Welfare Service Appeals Officers who joined the appeals office in 2011, bringing the total number to 41. In addition, a new operating model has been introduced in the appeals office.  </p><p>  These measures have achieved significant improvements. The number of appeals cases processed in 2013 increased by 18%, to over 38,400. The average processing time for appeals peaked in 2011 when the average time for an oral hearing was 52.5 weeks and for a summary decision was 25.1 weeks.  In 2012 the average time for an oral hearing dropped to 39.5 weeks and the time for a summary decision increased slightly to 27.8 weeks.  This overall improvement has continued in 2013 with the processing time reducing to 33.9 weeks for an oral hearing and 25.8 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>  In the case of carer&rsquo;s allowance appeals, the average processing time for an oral hearing reduced from 47.3 weeks in 2010 to 33.5 weeks in 2013 while the average processing time for a summary decision increased slightly from 26.9 weeks to 27.9 weeks.  </p><p>  In addition to improvements in processing times, the measures which have been introduced in the appeals office have also led to a significant increase in the number of appeals finalised in recent years from 17,787 in 2009 to 38,421 in 2013.  An additional 5,863 appeals were finalised in 2013 compared to 2012.  Good progress also continues to be made in reducing the number of appeals on hands from 20,414 at 1 January 2013 to 13,695 at 14 April 2014.</p><p>  A major programme of process redesign and modernisation is also underway in the Department in relation to many of its scheme areas aimed at reducing backlogs and reducing the time taken by the Department to respond to requests from the appeals office for submissions in relation to appeals. It is anticipated that with these improvements, the processing times for appeals will continue to improve throughout 2014.</p><p>  Appeal processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent awaiting clarification from the appellant, time in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer and further investigation or medical examination, if deemed necessary.</p></reply>

Ordinary employees who have access to the full range of social insurance benefits pay Class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI Class A.  </p><p>  Any person of working age who does not qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit may claim means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.  Subject to means and other qualifying conditions, self-employed persons may claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance if their business ceases or there is reduced demand for their services.  In assessing means from self-employment, income from the previous twelve months is used as an indicator of likely future earnings.  Given the variety of self-employment situations, the means assessment procedures are applied in a flexible manner to ensure that any circumstances that would be likely to lead to a significant variation, either upward or downward, in the level of a person&rsquo;s income from one year to the next are taken into consideration.  </p><p>  In September 2013, I published the report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed.  The Group was asked to examine and report on issues involved in extending social insurance coverage for self-employed people in order to establish whether or not such cover is technically feasible and financially sustainable, with the requirement that any proposals for change must be cost neutral.  The Group found that the current system of means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payments adequately provides cover to self-employed people for the risks associated with unemployment.  In this context, the Group noted that almost 9 out of every 10 self-employed people who claimed the means tested jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance during the three-year period from 2009 to 2011 received payment.  Consequently, the Group was not convinced that there was a need for the extension of social insurance for the self-employed to provide cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.</p></reply>

There are 25,300 places available on the programme for 2014 and a budget of &euro;358m has been earmarked for it this year.  </p><p>  An integral part of a participant&rsquo;s CE experience is the provision of accredited training under the CE Individual Learner Plan (ILP).  All CE participants have an ILP drawn up for them on commencement of the programme in conjunction with their CE Supervisor, tailored to their specific requirements and career goals.  This training is available until they exit the scheme.  The training budget for CE currently stands at &euro;5.9m for 2014.

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) available at 65, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  State pension age will increase further to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.   </p><p>  The State pension (transition) was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age.  Over time, the age for State pension (contributory) was reduced to 66 years. </p><p>  All short term social welfare schemes are payable to age 66.  The main social welfare payment available to those who leave employment before pension age is jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit.  Persons aged between 65 and 66 years who qualify for a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit are generally entitled to receive payment up to the date on which they reach pensionable age (66 years).  In the case of a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit recipient aged under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of the job seekers entitlement relating to the second benefit year.  A further provision states that 3 waiting days do not have to be served for jobseekers assistance in the case of certain people aged between 65 and 66 years who have been in receipt of job seekers benefit within the past year.</p><p>  I was happy to be able to introduce new arrangements in Budget 2014 for older jobseekers, i.e., those aged 62 and over who have left work before reaching the State pension age of 66 and who wish to claim a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  With effect from 1 January 2014, fully unemployed jobseekers aged 62 or over will be placed on yearly signing and will be given the option of transferring to EFT payments.  Furthermore, they will not be subject to mandatory activation measures or activation-related sanctions but may avail of employment supports which will continue to be available to them. </p><p>  Finally, social welfare supports will continue to be available to those who need it most and where a person fails to meet the qualifying conditions of an insurance based scheme, a means tested assistance payment may be available provided they satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p></reply>

In 2012, 19.6% of electricity demand was met by renewable generation, with 5.2% of heat and 2.4% of transport energy requirements coming from renewable sources.  Overall, at the end of 2012, 7.1% of our energy was provided from renewable sources.  The REFIT (Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff) schemes currently in place are the primary supports for the development of renewable electricity and which will deliver on Ireland's 2020 targets.  These schemes have received State Aid approval from the European Commission and will not, therefore, be affected by the new rules adopted by the Commission last week.  Any new support schemes that may be introduced for energy from renewable sources will be evaluated in the context of the Commission's guidelines.</p></reply>

When taking an estate in charge under the terms of this provision, a local authority must take in charge any roads, open spaces, car parks, sewers, water mains, or drains within the attendant grounds of the development.</p><p>  The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides for the transfer of responsibility for the provision of public water services from local authorities to Irish Water. In addition, it provides a mechanism whereby water services infrastructure may be transferred by Ministerial Order to Irish Water. Accordingly, from 1 January 2014, local authorities should continue with the existing taking in charge process under the planning legislation but engage with Irish Water in relation to water services infrastructure such as water mains, water connections and sewers which will subsequently be transferred to Irish Water by Ministerial Order. Contrary to certain misunderstandings that may exist, there is no specific legal impediment to the taking in charge of water services infrastructure by local authorities. The potential to streamline this process for the future is currently under review.</p><p>  As stated in Circular Letter PL 21/13 issued by my Department to planning authorities on 30 December 2013 in the light of the transfer of certain statutory water services functions from local authorities to Irish Water with effect from 1 January 2014, legislative amendments to further clarify the existing provisions on the taking in charge of housing estates will be made in 2014. As part of this process, my Department will also consider, in consultation with local authorities, whether it is appropriate to make further amendments to section 180 of the Planning and Development Act in relation to the taking in charge provisions generally in the context of the forthcoming Planning Bill, for instance in relation to the time limits for the taking in charge of estates.</p><p>  Following the enactment of any amendments to section 180, my Department will issue Guidelines for Planning Authorities in relation to the revised taking in charge provisions and will update the Framework for a Comprehensive Taking in Charge Policy set out in Circular Letter PD 1/08, issued by my Department to planning authorities in February 2008.</p></reply>

It is a matter for individual authorities to prioritise the housing projects to be advanced under each of these measures.</p><p>  My Department liaises closely with all housing authorities in determining the annual allocations under the SHIP. In the case of South Dublin County Council, allocations under the local authority housing construction and acquisitions programme and the voluntary housing programme, amounting to &euro;5.925 million and &euro;1.229 million respectively, were notified to the Council in February.</p><p>  The financial parameters within which we continue to operate will not facilitate a return to large-scale capital funded construction programmes. Earlier this year, I signalled a return to modest levels of new social housing construction with an announcement of 1,000 new housing starts over the 2014-2015 period. Based on the submission received from South Dublin County Council, an allocation of &euro;3.406 million was approved on 11 March in respect of three projects, including the construction of 3 new houses at Belgard Road, Tallaght and 10 houses at Suncroft, Tallaght.</p><p>  On Budget Day 2014, I announced details of a new measure with funding of &euro;15 million which will be invested in bringing some 400 vacant and boarded-up local authority houses back into productive use. My Department is currently assessing the proposals recently received from local authorities under this programme, including proposals for some 40 houses in South Dublin. I will announce details of the funding allocations as soon as possible.</p><p>  I also intend to announce details shortly of the allocations to local authorities under my Department&rsquo;s Capital Assistance Scheme for the construction and acquisition of housing for persons with specific categories of need over the 2014-2015 period. Some &euro;35 million is being set aside for this programme which is intended to deliver in the region of 230 new homes.</p><p>  My Department, the Housing Agency and NAMA continue to work together with housing authorities and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs) towards bringing suitable NAMA units into social use and to ensure continued delivery of housing units for social purposes. AHB&rsquo;s will also play a key role in the delivery of social housing, particularly, having regard to their capacity to attract external financial investment. It continues to be my objective to maximise the delivery of social housing using all of the resources available.</p><p>  At the end of February 2014, the Social Housing Leasing Initiative (SHLI) has delivered over 4,700 (4,736) nationally housing units for social housing purposes. Of these, 463 are in the South Dublin County Council area. A further 159 units in South Dublin have been approved for inclusion in SHLI. In addition, repayable capital advances in the form of the Capital A Advanced Leasing Facility (CALF), are available to AHBs to support the acquisition of new units for social housing purposes. Funding of some &euro;3.3 million has been approved by my Department under CALF, to provide social housing in the South Dublin County Council area.</p></reply>

BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m, plus &euro;30m contingency, and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives. In addition, Irish Water has progressed the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT.</p><p>  All costs incurred by Irish Water in 2013 were financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), with the exception of a grant of &euro;0.57m for a pilot metering study funded by my Department. No other Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure was provided to Irish Water in 2013.</p><p>  The establishment costs will be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water; accordingly, they will also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. I also expect that establishment costs and metering costs will be included in the regulatory asset base for Irish Water.</p><p>  In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in equity from the Minister for Finance and &euro;486.5m from the Local Government Fund. No funding will be provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote. It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate ministerial consents in due course. The subvention to Irish Water from the Local Government Fund in 2014 will fund water related expenditures incurred heretofore by local authorities; operational costs of providing water services, estimated at just under &euro;730 million, have been removed from the local government sector in 2014. These expenditures were previously met by local authorities from their own resources, non- domestic water charge revenues and general purpose grants from the Fund.</p><p>  The level of State subvention to Irish Water from the Fund in 2014 reflects the fact that the costs of operating water services now have to be met by Irish Water and that there will not be revenue from domestic water charges in 2014 as first bills will not issue until 2015.</p></reply>

Technical Guidance Documents (TGDs) are published to accompany each of the parts and provide guidance indicating how the requirements of that part can be achieved in practice. Where works are carried out in accordance with the relevant technical guidance such works are considered to be, <i>prima facie</i>, in compliance with the relevant regulation(s).</p><p>Part A of the Second Schedule to the Building Regulations<b></b>sets out the legal requirements in relation to Structure. The accompanying TGD A provides guidance on how compliance can be achieved and in the context of block work in houses reference is given to the appropriate masonry design and construction standards. The materials to be used e.g. concrete blocks, wall ties etc. are required to meet the specified minimum designations, strengths and other qualities, as set out in TGD A and the referenced standards.</p><p>Part D sets out the legal requirements for Materials and Workmanship. It requires that all works must be carried out using <i>&ldquo;proper materials&hellip;which are fit for the use for which they are intended and for the conditions in which they are to be used&rdquo;</i>and in a workmanlike manner to ensure compliance with the Building Regulations.</p><p>Primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings.</p><p><i>Irish Standard (I.S) 20 Part 1, concrete building blocks</i><i>and normal density blocks</i>was the relevant standard for concrete blocks in place from 1987 until 2003 when it was replaced by a harmonised European product standard for concrete blocks - <i>EN 771-3</i><i>aggregate concrete masonry units (dense and lightweight aggregates</i>). EN 771-3 was published by <i>the National</i><i>Standards Authority of</i><i>Ireland</i><i>(NSAI</i>) on 17 March 2003 <i>and came into effect on</i><i>15</i><i>October 2003. However, as is normal in such circumstances,</i><i>the provisions in </i>I.S. 20, Part 1 continued to apply for a period of time (known as the co-existence period) to allow for transition from national standards to harmonised European standards.</p><p>Harmonised European product standards provide the methods and the criteria for assessing the performance of construction products in relation to their essential characteristics, the harmonised standard includes the technical data necessary for the implementation of a system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance including third party oversight (determined as proportionate to the level of risk involved) which the manufacturer is required to comply with. NSAI <i>has also produced additional guidance to some harmonised European product standards</i><i>in the form of National Annexes or Standard Recommendations (SRs) which set out appropriate minimum performance levels for specific intended uses of certain products in Ireland.</i></p><p><i><i>Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC</i></i><i>requires manufacturers to provide robust and reliable information in a consistent way for construction products</i><i>which are covered</i><i>d by a harmonised standard or a</i><i>European Technical Assessment. From 1 July 2013, manufacturers of construction products which are covered by harmonised European product standards are required, when placing a product on the market, to make a Declaration of Performance for the product, and affix the CE mark.</i></p><p>I fully appreciate a and acknowledge the extremely difficult and distressing situations that householders have to deal with when faced with the consequences of poor workmanship or the use of defective materials. In general, building defects are matters for resolution between contracting parties, ie the homeowner, the builder, the supplier and/or their respective insurers and in the event that the parties cannot reach a settlement by negotiation the option of seeking redress in the Courts can be considered. I believe that the responsible parties should face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate actions to provide remedies for the affected homeowners.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-04-16a.326.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/967" speakername="Phil Hogan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014041600085#WRS00500"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 122 together.</p><p>The Programme for Government sets out a commitment to the introduction of water charges based on usage above a free allowance. The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has, therefore, decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies. The Water Services Act 2013 provide for the establishment of Irish Water as an independent subsidiary within the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann Group and assigned the necessary powers to allow Irish Water to undertake this metering programme.</p><p>Local authorities are in the final stages of a pre-installation survey of households connected to public water supplies. The survey is providing information to Irish Water on the properties that can be metered. The intention is that a meter will be installed in any household connected to a public water supply where it is technically feasible to do so. Where a suitable boundary box for a water meter has already been installed in a property, this will be identified in the survey. Irish Water has also recently commissioned a study on possible approaches to metering properties that are not part of the current metering programme, including apartments and properties with shared service connections. This report was recently submitted to my Department for consideration. Any proposals for the metering of such properties would need to be considered by the Government in the first instance.</p><p>It was always anticipated that in the course of installing a meter, pre-existing leaks and other latent defects due to the age or condition of the water pipes would be discovered. Accordingly, where a leak occurs, it is not necessarily the case that it was caused by Irish Water&rsquo;s contractors.  The meter installation programme gives Irish Water a strong starting point for mains rehabilitation by enabling the discovery of pre-existing leaks and helping to target more effective investment in leak repair.  Where a leak is identified on the public water mains, the repairs are undertaken by the local authority, acting as agents for Irish Water, as agreed under the Service Level Agreements. In order to ensure that there was no delay to the metering project and to ensure that no Local Authority was financially disadvantaged by having to redeploy resources, my Department provided funding to contribute towards this expenditure incurred between the start of the metering programme and 31 December 2013. In 2014, the cost of these repairs is part of the operating costs of Irish Water.</p><p>Where the leak is identified as being within the boundary of the property (i.e. is identified as being on the customer side of the property) under the 2007 Water Services Act, the repair of the leak has been, and remains, the responsibility of the individual householder. As part of the metering programme, my Department, in conjunction with Irish Water, is currently working on a proposal regarding customer-side leakage, the implementation arrangements for which will have to be worked out with Irish Water.</p><p>Domestic water charges will commence with effect from 1 October 2014 and Irish Water will issue the first bills to domestic customers from January 2015. The approach to charging will be outlined by Irish Water in a water charges plan to be submitted by it to the CER in line with the provisions of the Act. The CER will be responsible for approving the water charges plan which will set the approaches to charging domestic and non-domestic customers. The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and has indicated that it will be carrying out further public consultations this month . These will include consultation on the approach to the design of domestic water tariffs for both metered and unmetered properties. Further consultations are planned for June 2014 in relation to the water charges plan to be submitted to the CER by Irish Water. Full details of the CER&rsquo;s public consultation plans are available on its website ().</p><p>The attendance of Irish Water at the public meeting in question is a matter for Irish Water. I would also like to inform the Deputies that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. They may be contacted via email to or by telephone on 1890 278 278.</p></reply>

In view of the quasi-judicial nature of the functions of the Property Registration Authority in approving the title presented, the Authority is precluded from advising or assisting applicants in the preparation of applications for registration. As these matters can be legally complex, it is generally in the applicant&rsquo;s best interests to consider consulting a solicitor who would advise on the matter.</p></reply>

As such they demand rigorous procedures to ensure their integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of them.</p><p>  A full vetting check is conducted for each new application received to ensure that the most recent data available is taken into account. The non-transferability and contemporaneous nature of the certificate protects against the risk of fraud or forgery and is a guarantee of the integrity of the vetting service. It also affords the registered organisation the facility to assess suitability based on the most up to date information available on the applicant. The Deputy will appreciate that the safety of children and vulnerable adults is the primary consideration and this must remain the case.</p><p>  Elements of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012 relating to the disclosure of convictions are under review at present. While I intend bringing proposals before the Oireachtas to provide that certain old minor convictions will not be disclosed under the provisions of the 2012 Act, I do not intend making provisions in the Act to provide that a person who has been Garda vetted with one organisation can move to a different organisation without having to reapply for a new clearance from the Garda vetting section.</p><p>  This is because once there has been any significant time lapse between one employment and another, the original Garda Vetting Disclosure would not include information regarding any recent criminal convictions, and the second employer could not safely rely on it. Under the Data Protection Acts, any sensitive personal data which employers use in regard to their employees must be current, accurate and up-to-date. Separately, employers would be exposed to civil liability if they knowingly recruited staff based on out-of-date criminal records information where the person in fact has a more recent criminal conviction.</p><p>  The Deputy may also wish to note that the current average processing time for vetting applications is four weeks which is a significant improvement on this time last year when it stood at 12 weeks.</p></reply>

As of 31 March, 8,687 persons have been arrested and 4,954 persons have been charged with burglary offences under Operation Fiacla.</p><p>  Operation Fiacla has proved to be a robust and effective response to those who seek to prey on law abiding householders and this is borne out by the full year Crime Statistics for 2013 which are the latest figures published by the Central Statistics Office. These show a welcome reduction of 7.2% in burglary and related offences over the 12 month period and continue a trend which has been evident since the introduction of Operation Fiacla.</p></reply>

This joint Strategy recognises the particular value of interagency co-operation, involving the customs and criminal assets recovery services in both jurisdictions.  This approach is a key factor in combating the activities of those criminal gangs who seek to exploit the border for their own gain.</p><p>  I would point the Deputy, for example, to the successful actions that have been taken against a number of groups involved in the laundering and distribution of illegal fuels, and in tobacco fraud.  These groups, operating in both jurisdictions, have been identified and disrupted, and are now being specifically targeted for investigation by all the enforcement agencies concerned.</p><p>  These actions have been underpinned by a Cross-Border Task Force on Fuel Laundering and Smuggling, comprising representatives from the two police forces, the two customs services, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency.  A similar group, the Cross Border Tobacco Enforcement Group,  is also in place to support the fight against the activities of gangs engaged in tobacco fraud.</p><p>  I would point out to the House that each year my Department and the Garda authorities, in conjunction with their counterparts in Northern Ireland, organise a Cross-Border Organised Crime Seminar.  This provides an opportunity to assess and address changing trends in crime, and to build upon and enhance the operational actions already being undertaken.  The fact that the Seminar is now in its twelfth year is testimony to the excellent co-operation that exists between the law enforcement agencies on the island in terms of exchanging knowledge and experience, and seeking to further enhance and deepen co-operation and joint-working in the fight against crime.</p></reply>

These reductions reflect the continued impact of Garda operations on the incidence of burglary and build on earlier reductions which we have seen since the end of 2012.  Garda actions to counteract burglary under Operation Fiacla have led to the arrest of 8,687 persons with 4,954 persons being charged as of 31 March 2014.</p><p>  Operation Fiacla is an intelligence driven operation and includes analysis led policing and patrols to target specific areas and case manage targeted offenders.   There can be local and regional fluctuations in relation to particular crime categories and in this regard I am advised that the arrangements for Operation Fiacla are kept under review and local Garda management closely monitor all trends in the incidence of burglary, with adjustments being made on an ongoing basis to maintain the effective focus of the operation. </p><p>  In relation to the deployment of Garda resources in the area, the Policing Plan for 2013 outlined the Garda Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda Station and District network throughout the country.  In preparing that plan, the Commissioner reviewed all aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s policing model, including the deployment of personnel, the utilisation of modern technologies and the operation of Garda stations, both in terms of opening hours and possible closures. </p><p>  The Commissioner determined as a result of that review that a number of Garda stations should be closed and concluded that the communities covered by the areas in question could be better served, and crime confronted more effectively, by having Garda&iacute; patrolling the areas rather than being confined to a specific premises.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that it is the Government's intention to ensure that the best possible policing service is provided within the resources available to it and to the Commissioner. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is an extremely capable and talented force, as is evident from the impact of Operation Fiacla, and I am confident of its ability to continue to effectively combat crime in all its forms.</p></reply>

Teagasc forestry advisers are available to discuss the issue with forest owners affected and Teagasc, in association with Coillte and my Department, have organised a number of field events for forest owners.  Forest owners are also urged to get professional advice from qualified foresters to guide them through this process and to attend these windblow field days. </p><p>  Whilst direct financial support is not being provided to those whose forests were destroyed in the storm, I can confirm that any premium payments that have not yet been paid for 2014 will be paid even if these forests have been affected by this windblow event.</p></reply>

Many youth organisations are working closely with relevant Government Departments and delivering measures to implement the Guarantee for young unemployed people.</p><p>  My Department, in consultation with the youth sector, has developed a 'Youth Employability Initiative' which involves the expansion of proven youth work initiatives that increase the employability of marginalised young people in the 15 to 24 age group.  It aims to target the hardest to reach young people who are at risk of becoming NEET (i.e. not in employment, education or training) for intensive support to prevent unemployment.  The development and expansion of the Youth Employability Initiative is a priority for me, should additional resources become available to my Department for youth services.  In this regard, my Department continues to make efforts to secure the necessary resources for the initiative including exploring the potential of the initiative for ESF funding and is liaising with the relevant Government Departments in this regard. </p><p>  My Department will develop a new Youth Strategy in 2014.

GP commitment to sharing accommodation with HSE staff and delivering health care services from these facilities is essential for primary care centre delivery.  All potential primary care centres are also subject to suitable locations being offered/provided/available and to successful planning processes.  In addition the operational lease mechanism is subject to market pressures such as the developers' access to sufficient financing.  Delivery of primary care infrastructure is a dynamic exercise, constantly evolving to take account of changing circumstances including the feasibility of implementation.  </p><p>  As with all capital projects the primary care infrastructure programme including this location must be considered within the overall capital envelope available to the health service.  There will always be more projects than can be funded by the Exchequer.  There is limited funding available for new projects over the period 2014-2018 given the level of commitments and the costs to completion already in place.</p></reply>

This morning I met with my colleague in the Northern Irish Executive, Minister Mark Durcan to discuss this matter.  While this is a function that is not devolved to the Northern Executive from Westminister, he and his officials are working with us to ensure an appropriate resolution to the difficulties the UK road user levy is creating on our island for hauliers, in particular those from Donegal.  The upgrade of the A5 is expected to bring significant benefits to both economies in the region and I would have concerns that any increased costs levied on Irish operators who are simply transiting Northern Ireland would have a detrimental impact on this economic benefit.  I will continue to pursue what I believe to be a compelling case for the exemption.</p><p>  For the exemption to be effective, it will of course be necessary to also exempt any approach roads that must be used in order to access the A5.  As the Deputy will be aware, the management of road closures on the A5 and the issue of how resulting diversions may affect the administration of the levy are matters entirely for the UK and NI authorities.  The Deputy refers again to the possibility of Irish HGV operators relocating to other jurisdictions.  While operators are free to make this choice, I believe that when the costs of establishment and the severe limitations imposed by cabotage regulations on operations in Ireland are considered the number of operators who choose to relocate will be limited.  The Deputy will further appreciate and be aware that the Government has made consistent efforts to support the Irish haulage industry.  For example the introduction of the fuel rebate for licensed hauliers was a significant boost for the industry and makes fuelling in Ireland even more attractive for hauliers.  Furthermore, my Department is chairing an inter-departmental working group looking at the issues involved with developing road charging for HGVs in Ireland and this group will be reporting in the summer on the feasibility of such.</p></reply>

There was also additional investment of some &euro;40,000 for an equipment cabin and &euro;553,000 for technological equipment located in the Malin Head station to upgrade the wider Coast Guard national communications network to integrated digital technology.</p><p>  In 2012 construction work commenced on a new Coast Guard station at Killybegs. I officially opened the new purpose built station on 28 March 2014. The total cost for the completion of this project was over &euro;1.570m.</p><p>  During the period some &euro;956,000 was invested in provision of four new rescue boats (RIBs), one for each of the Donegal Coast Guard volunteer units. Three tractors for launch and recovery of the RIBs costing a total of &euro;145,000 were provided, &euro;116,000 was invested in vans for transportation of cliff rescue equipment and a further &euro;25,000 was provided to replace a 4x4 wheel vehicle.</p><p>  This expenditure identified above is in addition to the routine operating costs associated with servicing, equipping and training approximately 100 Coast Guard volunteers who operate the four Coast Guard stations in Donegal.</p></reply>
