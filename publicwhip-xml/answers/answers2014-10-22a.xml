This process will build on the contacts that have been made, as part of the ongoing commemorative programme since 2012, with a wide range of bodies and community groups throughout the country, who are already engaged in preparing their own projects and contributions to the 2016 commemorations.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-22a.14.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/973" speakername="Heather Humphreys" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102200030#WRA01000"><p>The 2013 Comptroller and Auditor General Report contained a recommendation that the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht, in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, should consider including all resources of the National Gallery within the appropriations process and that restricted funds from non-Exchequer resources (such as fundraising) should be accounted for within existing appropriation accounting rules.  The C&amp;AG recommendation went on to say that, alternatively, consideration should be given to treating the National Gallery, like other national cultural institutions, as a grant subhead within the estimate for the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, with appropriate and timely financial reporting on a comprehensive basis.     </p><p>  My Department consulted with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this issue and agreed that, in the interest of transparency, Exchequer funding should in future be provided through a subhead of the Vote for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. In addition, an agency statement setting out expected receipts and payments for the coming year will be provided in the Revised Estimates for 2015 prepared by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. On this basis, the separate Vote for the National Gallery will cease to operate on 31 December 2014.</p><p>  This means that the National Gallery will, like all other national cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department such as the National Museum and the National Library, be included in future as a grant subhead within the estimate for my Department from 2015 onwards. This will not affect the amount of funding that will be provided to the Gallery. Similarly, there is no change whatsoever to the powers of the Board of the Gallery, which, along with the executive of the Gallery, will retain full control over the management of the institution's funds.  </p><p>  This change, as recommended by the C&amp;amp;AG, will have no impact on the independence of the National Gallery. My Department will, of course, be working with management at the Gallery to ensure that the transition process takes place as smoothly as possible.</p></reply>

I understand that project costs in this case are estimated at over &euro;5m and that Na P&iacute;obair&iacute; Uilleann is seeking &euro;2.5m of this from the public purse.   My Department does not have a capital budget to support new projects of this magnitude. The limited capital funding available at present for cultural infrastructure and development is being used to complete projects that were approved for funding a number of years ago. Indeed, due to budgetary constraints, no major capital projects of this nature have been approved by my Department in recent years and there are no plans at present to introduce a new cultural infrastructure capital development programme. </p><p>  I should say that Na P&iacute;obair&iacute; Uilleann received a grant of &euro;1m in capital funding from my Department in the period 2007 to 2013 towards the cost of restoring its headquarters at 15 Henrietta Street, Dublin 1, and towards the costs of an uileann pipe making project.</p></reply>

Although the Arts Council is funded by my Department, it is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, as provided for in the Arts Act 2003. This specifically includes independence in its decisions on who it funds and the amounts it allocates. Full information on the Council's funding decisions is made available on its website at As a public body, the Arts Council is required to adhere to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's <i>Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies</i>and other practices of good governance and transparency.  Disbursal of funding is required to be fully in line with public service financial and accountability requirements. I understand that the Arts Council also requires the organisations it funds to comply with similar standards.<br/><br/>The Deputy will note that, on its website, the Arts Council commits to operating to the highest standards of corporate governance and has adopted a corporate governance regime in accordance with best practice, which includes a section on conflicts of interest. <br/><br/>I am confident that the Arts Council continues to discharge its duty as the principal State agency for the promotion and development of the arts in Ireland, in a strategic but transparent manner.</p></reply>

Raised bog habitats are in danger of disappearance in Ireland and in the EU. 53 SACs, including Coolrain Bog, were nominated for designation as SACs to meet our legal obligations and safeguard a relatively small number of our raised bogs for future generations.   My Department has engaged a consortium of ecological and hydrological experts to undertake a comprehensive assessment the current status and future conservation prospects of the 53 SACs. Led by RPS consultants, the results of their analysis for each site are contained in the appendix to the National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan, which was issued for public consultation earlier this year.  The assessment shows that Coolrain is a small bog that contains a significant area of active raised bog habitat. This is the area of the bog which is actively forming peat and which is a habitat in particular danger of disappearance within the European Union. As such, it is deemed a priority habitat and afforded particular protection under EU law. Active raised bog is very sensitive to the drainage impacts of turf-cutting.</p><p>  The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan provides for the future restoration and management of the 53 raised bog SACs, including Coolrain. The draft sets out the approach to how each of the raised bog sites is to be conserved and restored, in partnership with the local community, and how the needs of turf-cutters are to be addressed.</p><p>  I note that 62 turf-cutters from Coolrain Bog have engaged with my Department under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme. Of these, 11 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to a non-designated bog. Relocation options are being actively explored by my Department and Bord na M&oacute;na.</p><p>  Coolrain Bog is a site of considerable conservation value, containing significant areas of active raised bog. Restoration efforts by Coillte under the EU LIFE programme have already partly secured the future of this site.  My Department will work with other land-owners and with the local community to manage and restore the remainder of what is an exceptional bog. Our first priority is to ensure that turf-cutters are looked after and we are doing this through providing them with financial compensation or in helping them to continue to cut turf in an alternative bog, if that is their preference. </p></reply>

On the basis of these assurances, I decided not to impose sanctions against Mallow Coursing Club on this occasion.  At the same time, the club has been issued with a written warning that any further transgressions, especially relating to lack of co-operation with National Parks and Wildlife officials of my Department, would result in my Department imposing future sanctions against the club.The meeting of Mallow Coursing Club, which is due to take place this week, will be monitored by officials from my Department.</p></reply>

It is appropriate, therefore, that John Redmond's leadership has been, and is being, remembered with events, exhibitions and lectures in Wicklow, Wexford, Waterford, Dublin and London. In particular, the restoration of John Redmond's vault in Wexford is being addressed as part of the centenary commemorative programme.   Recognition of the place of John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party was marked with a debate to mark the centenary of the Home Rule Act, hosted in the Irish Embassy in London, on 1 July last. The panel of guest speakers comprised former Taoiseach John Bruton, Lord Paul Bew, Professor Michael Laffan and Professor Richard Toye, and the debate was moderated by broadcaster Fergal Keane. The audience included a range of Westminster parliamentarians, academics, community, business and cultural representatives, officials, advisers and media. BBC Parliament filmed the debate, which was broadcast on 5 July and on additional dates later. </p><p>  On 18 September last, the Wicklow War Memorial Committee hosted a commemorative event in Woodenbridge, County Wicklow, a location long associated with John Redmond due to his historic speech of 18 September 1914. My colleague, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Charlie Flanagan, unveiled a memorial to honour the dead of World War One from Co Wicklow.</p><p>  In our centenary commemorative programme this year, we reach the passing of legislation for Irish Home Rule. Building on the work of Charles Stewart Parnell and the Land League, John Redmond and his party ultimately delivered the Home Rule Act, which was finally passed on the eve of the Great War.</p></reply>

Of these, 814 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.Relocation is a complex process in terms of:<br/><br/>- investigating suitable sites for turf quality and quantity;<br/><br/>- the infrastructure/drainage works required;<br/><br/>- establishing the number that can be accommodated on the site;<br/><br/>- the cost and feasibility of land purchase or lease; and<br/><br/>- possible planning and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding this complexity, progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases and arrangements have been made to date as regards:<br/><br/>- Clara Bog special area of conservation in Co Offaly, where 25 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on Killeranny Bog; and<br/><br/>- Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog special areas of conservation in Co Galway, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on the Islands Bog and Killasolan Bog.<br/><br/>Works have been undertaken on Lemanaghan Bog in County Offaly with a view to facilitating turf cutters from Moyclare Bog. Works are also underway in Cloonabricka Bog in County Galway to facilitate additional cutters relocating from Carrownagappul and Curraghlehanagh Bogs.<br/><br/>It is expected that 12 turf cutters can be accommodated on Lemanaghan Bog and 8 turf cutters can be accommodated on Cloonabricka Bog.<br/><br/>Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the remaining raised bog special areas of conservation where relocation may be required. When relocation sites have been assessed as suitable, my Department has been seeking expressions of interest from turf cutters with a view to them moving to these sites. Since July of this year, my Department has written to 184 turf cutters from 13 special area of conservation bogs seeking expressions of interest in relocating to non-designated bogs. As many of the factors involved in finalising relocation projects are outside my Department's control, it is not possible to give definitive figures on how many cutters will be facilitated within a given time period.</p></reply>

Consent has been granted to the owners under those Acts for the full repair and conservation of the monument buildings. Consent had previously been refused for the demolition of any structures or the removal of any material from the site that dated from or before 1916. Plans for an underground car park within the boundary of the national monument site or for the demolition of the Moore Lane facades of Nos. 15 and 16 were also ruled out. </p><p>  I believe that the decision made on the revised designs provides the means to secure the future of the national monument. The conditions attaching to the consent will also ensure that the restored buildings will have a standard of finish and appearance that befits their historical importance.

I wish to acknowledge the part that the institutions played in that difficult process, and the difficulties that they had to overcome in dealing with cutbacks whilst still providing excellent services to the public and protecting our national collections. The staff of our national institutions are to be commended for their commitment in such straitened times. <br/><br/>I am pleased that we have now been able to bring an end to the cycle of cuts.

I am committed with my Government colleagues to ensuring that the commemorations to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising will be inclusive, appropriate and respectful.</p><p>  As I have previously outlined to the House, the commemorations to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising will be a major event in a programme that has been developing since 2012 to commemorate the key events leading to the proclamation of the Irish Republic.  These have included:</p><p>- the introduction and progress of the third Home Rule Bill in the Westminster Parliament;</p><p>- the formation of Volunteer movements;</p><p>- the 1913 Lockout and the role of suffragettes; and</p><p>- the outbreak of World War I. </p><p>  In the coming year, alongside the continuing experience of World War I, the programme will address the Cultural Revival in Ireland, which reflected the strengthening sense of national identity and determination to achieve autonomous government.  </p><p>  As part of the 2016 commemorations, arrangements have been made for a number of flagship capital projects for which funding of &euro;22 million is being provided in 2015. These projects include the new GPO visitor facility, the restoration of Kilmainham Courthouse, a dedicated facility for the Military Pensions Archive at Cathal Brugha Barracks, the provision of visitor facilities at Pearse's Cottage in Ros Muc, refurbishment works at Richmond Barracks and the development of a Tenement Museum in Dublin - as well as the commencement of refurbishment and development works at the National Archives and the National Concert Hall's Kevin Barry Rooms.</p><p>  This capital programme will be complemented by an integrated national plan focused on the 2016 Commemorations, for which an allocation of &euro;4 million is being provided to my Department in 2015. This allocation will help support a wide range of activities and events by interested groups, including local community groups and the arts. There will also be a special emphasis on education projects, as recommended by the Expert Advisory Group. There will also, of course, be an appropriately solemn component to the commemoration.</p><p>  My Department has been working to finalise the draft programme for 2016, which it is intended to publish in the coming weeks to allow for widespread public consultation. The overall programme will be brought forward in partnership with government departments, State agencies, local authorities and other key players, including 1916 Relatives' Groups.  </p><p>  I will be keen to encourage and facilitate the involvement of &lsquo;ground-up&rsquo; initiatives to ensure local communities can put their own shape on the commemorations as we move towards 2016.

In addition, I expect to be able soon to bring Regulation 50 of these Regulations into effect, which deals with the sale of invasive species. In this regard, my Department has been carrying out risk assessments of those species which may currently be traded but which are considered to be invasive. My Department is active in the control of invasive species on its own land, for example through the control of rhododendron in National Parks and also through supporting local efforts, where appropriate. Inland Fisheries Ireland has been very active in recent years in prevention and control of aquatic invasive species.  The National Roads Authority has produced guidelines, which can assist local authorities, on &ldquo;<i>The Management of Noxious Weeds and Non-Native Invasive Plant Species on National Roads</i>&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Combating and eradication of invasive species are key targets in the National Biodiversity Plan <i>&ldquo;Actions for Biodiversity 2011 - 2016&rdquo;</i>and the EU Biodiversity Strategy.  My Department has also worked with the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA) to fund and manage the <i>Invasive Species Ireland Project </i>since 2006. This initiative provides advice and guidance on the management of a range of invasive species which can negatively impact on the environment and on property on the island of Ireland. <br/><br/>Information on the distribution of invasive species can be found on the National Biodiversity Data Centre website at <br/><br/>My Department will continue its efforts to engage with stakeholders and work to the prevention of escape of invasive species into the Irish environment, as well as enhancement of measures for control and eradication, where necessary.<br/><br/>In should be noted that a new EU &ldquo;<i>Regulation on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of invasive alien species&rdquo; </i>will also commence in January 2015, although many of its provisions will not take effect until the following year.  <br/><br/>My Department will commence the development of policy in relation to the implementation of this Regulation, in conjunction with other relevant public authorities and stakeholders, over the coming months.</p></reply>

The estimated expenditure on child benefit in 2014 is around &euro;1.9 billion and it is currently paid to around 613,000 families in respect of some 1.17 million children.<br/><br/>Child benefit is paid up to and including the month of the child&rsquo;s 16<sup>th</sup>birthday and continues to the month of the 18<sup>th</sup>birthday provided the child is in full-time education.  In order for payment to continue after the age of 16, it is necessary for the school to certify that the child is in full-time education and will be until the age of 18.<br/><br/>The Department does not hold a record on the number of children where child benefit isdiscontinued at age 16 or 17 due to them not being in full-time education.  The number of claims refused on this basis would be very small, but there would also be a number of cases where parents do no claim child benefit as they know that continuing in education is a qualifying factor.</p></reply>

The strategy outlined in Pathways is devised to ensure new job opportunities are made available to people on the live register with particular focus on the longer-term unemployed and that jobseekers are prepared to avail of work opportunities.  This strategy has been reinforced with the additional measures I announced in Budget 2015 to provide for an expansion of JobsPlus and a new incentive for long-term unemployed jobseekers with children to return to work. JobsPlus will remain exclusively targeted at jobseekers who have been out of work for over 12 months.  While I plan to announce a broadening of the eligibility criteria for JobsPlus in the near future, this will not include farmers in receipt of a Farm Assist payment from the Department on the basis that farmers are self-employed in their farming occupation, notwithstanding the fact that some income support is required.</p><p>  At the end of September 2014, 2,273 employers received payments in respect of 3,000 employees who were previously long-term jobseekers.  Further details of the JobsPlus incentive, including how to apply, are available on www.jobsplus.ie.</p></reply>

Accordingly, he does benefit from social protection measures announced in the recent Budget. He may, however, depending on his level of income benefit from USC and income tax measures announced by my colleague, the Minister for Finance. <br/><br/>Persons on low income, such as income from an occupational pension, may qualify for a means tested payment from my Department subject to satisfying the statutory conditions for the relevant scheme. In addition, persons who are looking after another person who requires full time care and attention because of age, disability or illness may be eligible for a carer's allowance payment. The latter payment is means tested. The first &euro;332.50 of gross weekly income (&euro;665 per week in the case of a couple) is not taken into account in determining entitlement. Reduced rates may also be payable where income exceeds the amount disregarded in full.  <br/><br/>In addition, recipients of carer&rsquo;s allowance are automatically entitled to the respite care grant (RCG). Other people who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment but who are providing full time care and attention are also eligible for the grant. <br/><br/>I announced, on Budget Day, a number of welfare initiatives which will benefit pensioners, carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of a welfare payment. There will be an increase in the living alone allowance of &euro;1.30 per week, bringing the rate up from &euro;7.70 to &euro;9 for pensioners and people with disabilities.  The living alone allowance is a payment made to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone and was last increased in 1996.<br/><br/>In line with the Government&rsquo;s <i>Statement of Priorities, </i>I have introduced a water support payment of &euro;100 to recipients of the Household Benefit Package, to help older people and other vulnerable groups meet the cost of water services. In addition, I also introduced a payment of &euro;100 per annum to fuel allowance recipients who are not in receipt of the Household Benefits Package. This measure will also work to alleviate the impact of water costs.<br/><br/>The Christmas Bonus was abolished by the previous Government in 2009. I am pleased to say that I am in a position to partially restore the Bonus this year. A bonus of 25% will be paid in early December to all long-term welfare recipients including pensioners and carers. This will cost over &euro;63 million and is in recognition of the position of vulnerable households.</p></reply>

This VAT exemption is based on a derogation from EU VAT which provides that we can exempt the supply of water, as it has been exempt since 1978.  It is worth pointing out that most EU Member States charge VAT on the supply of water.</p><p>  While there is no tax exemption for other utilities, the supply of gas, electricity and other domestic fuels is chargeable at the reduced VAT rate of 13.5% in Ireland under a separate EU VAT law derogation.</p><p>  Given the special circumstances that apply to the supply of water, the provision of some relief for water charges has merit.

The Central Bank has advised that it will commence a review of CCMA compliance later this year.</p><p>  Where the purchaser of a loan book is not a regulated entity in Ireland, the purchaser may voluntarily apply the codes when managing the loan books. Of course, voluntary compliance is not enforceable and ultimately it is the aim of this Government to ensure the same protections are available for all consumers whose loans have been sold.</p><p>  Therefore, as Minister for Finance, I am committed to bringing forward legislation that protects consumers whose mortgages are sold to unregulated entities. The Government has reiterated this commitment on several occasions. In July and August of this year, my Department undertook a public consultation process seeking views on its proposed legislation to protect consumers whose loans are sold to unregulated entities.  </p><p>  The Department of Finance received 18 submissions from a range of respondents from the financial services industry, consumer groups, public representatives and individuals and other stakeholders. Officials in my Department are carefully considering the submissions and it is anticipated that legislation will be published by the end of this year. </p><p>  There have been recent discussions on sovereign debt restructuring at IMF level but there are no proposals at an EU level to legislate regarding the actions of so called &quot;vulture funds&quot; in the case of sovereign debt crises. Ireland along with all Eurozone members now includes Collective Action Clauses in the sovereign bonds it issues.

When account is taken of cumulative impairment charges of &euro;4.1 billion over the same period, and dividends the cumulative loss has been &euro;342m.  These impairment charges largely reflected the impact of the decline of 25%-30% in Irish property prices in the period after NAMA acquired its loan assets from the participating institutions; loans had been valued by reference to property valuations extant on 30 November 2009.</p><p>  When international private equity companies make investment decisions, they typically aim for an Internal Rate of Return ('IRR') target in the range of 12%-15% on their equity.  Amongst other considerations, there are two fundamental criteria that must exist in order for an IRR or other rate of return measure to be appropriate for an entity that has acquired and holds investment assets:</p><p>1. The entity must have control and discretion, without imposed restrictions, over the timing, pricing and composition of what it acquires.</p><p>2. The entity must have control and discretion, without imposed restrictions, over the timing and pricing of its asset disposals.</p><p>  Not only did NAMA have no control or discretion over the assets which it acquired or the timing of the acquisition, it was also faced with many imposed restrictions, including the acquisition price of the assets whereby it was required to pay the banks a price based on the long-term economic value of assets.  It was required by legislation to acquire a designated portfolio of assets from five participation institutions at a time when the Irish property market was highly distressed.  Unlike the position currently prevailing whereby there are numerous investors interested in acquiring Irish assets, there were no such buyers in 2009 and 2010 when NAMA was being established.</p><p>  The valuation methodology which was approved by the European Commission required NAMA to acquire assets at 'long term economic value' which incorporated a State Aid uplift averaging 22% above market values.  In addition, NAMA acquired assets by reference to a valuation date of 30 November 2009 which meant that it was required to absorb any losses which arose from the 25% - 30% decline in Irish property prices which occurred over the four-year period after the November 2009 acquisition valuation date.</p><p>  Nor does NAMA now have full control over the timing of its asset disposals.  While NAMA is required to obtain the best financial return on its assets, it is also required to carry out its work expeditiously so as to redeem as soon as is commercially feasible the &euro;30.2 billion in senior debt which it issued to acquire loans.  This senior debt will remain a contingent liability on the State until it is eliminated . NAMA is not, therefore, in a position where it can hold assets for a long-term horizon as would be the case, for instance, with a pension fund.</p><p>  For the reasons outlined above, it is entirely invalid to suggest that NAMA should be judged by the same IRR criteria as private equity investment funds which are free to operate without the asset acquisition, pricing or asset disposal restrictions applicable to NAMA.</p><p>  Unlike NAMA, these funds are free to acquire assets across a broad range of asset classes and jurisdictions and to dispose of them freely. In order to generate double-digit investment returns, it is necessary for private equity investors to have a much higher appetite for risk than would be appropriate for NAMA and any other State entity which is responsible for the management of public funds.  NAMA, by contrast, has been tasked with de-risking the State's exposure to property-related assets.</p><p>  It is also the case that such funds are not required to take into account the various public, social and economic objectives which are addressed by NAMA.</p><p>  NAMA is obliged under Section 10(2) of the NAMA Act to obtain the best achievable financial return by reference to</p><p>(a) the cost to the Exchequer of acquiring bank assets and dealing with acquired bank assets,</p><p>(b) NAMA's cost of capital and other costs, and</p><p>(c) any other factor which NAMA considers relevant to the achievement of its purposes.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the various considerations outlined above, NAMA is satisfied that it is well placed to redeem its senior and subordinated debt and, if possible, to generate a surplus for the Exchequer by the time it completes its work.  The suggestion in the question that NAMA operates to a target annual rate of return of 0.5% is untrue.  NAMA's objective is not only to maximise the commercial return from its activities both annually and over its lifetime but also to maximise the wider public and social benefits that its activities generate.</p><p>  NAMA has designed and implemented a highly robust Management Information System and has clearly defined key performance indicators (KPIs) in place, which form the basis of its internal reporting and monitoring framework.  NAMA is currently reviewing how it can best utilise a rate of return performance measure in this context and will have this review completed by the end of the year.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-22a.141.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102200035#WRF01000"><p>The Deputy's question assumes that NAMA is in a position to retain assets over a medium-term horizon with a view to maximising the return which it can generate from them.  This assumption is not in line with the requirement in the NAMA Act that NAMA deals expeditiously with the assets acquired by it and it is not in line with the strategy which has been set out by the NAMA Board and endorsed by me at the conclusion of the Section 227 review which was completed this year.</p><p>  In interpreting its statutory mandate, the NAMA Board, with my endorsement, has taken the view that the best financial outcome for the State would be achieved through a managed process of disposals in an orderly way with the target of redeeming 80% of senior debt (a cumulative &euro;24 billion) by end-2016 and a growing expectation of being  in a position to redeem all senior debt by the end of 2018.  NAMA's senior debt is a contingent liability of Irish taxpayers and reducing and ultimately eliminating it has to be a major priority at a time when Ireland's sovereign indebtedness is still at very high levels.  Indeed, this leveraged condition fundamentally contrasts that of an investment market awash with liquidity, which goes some way towards explaining the diverging motives of sellers and acquirers.  NAMA deliberately withheld from significantly divesting of its Irish positions until the end of 2013 until this market liquidity appeared, thereby providing an opportunity for the State to de-risk itself of property exposures at strong pricing levels.  To draw comparisons with those purchasing the assets would be to infer that NAMA should prolong the State's exposure to the property market, adopt a speculative risk profile, ignore the requirement to reduce the State's debt burden and add uncertainty to the market's perception of Ireland's recovery process.  For that reason, given that it is engaged in a process of deleveraging, I do not expect NAMA to measure its performance by reference to investment entities which have full commercial autonomy in terms of seeking and generating returns.</p><p>  When international private equity companies make investment decisions, they typically aim for an Internal Rate of Return ('IRR') target in the high single digits given the low returns generally prevailing in the bond markets.  Amongst other considerations, there are two fundamental criteria that must exist in order for an IRR or other rate of return measure to be appropriate for an entity that has acquired and holds investment assets:</p><p>1. The entity must have control and discretion, without imposed restrictions, over the timing, pricing and composition of what it acquires.</p><p>2. The entity must have control and discretion, without imposed restrictions, over the timing and pricing of its asset disposals.</p><p>  Not only did NAMA have no control or discretion over the assets which it acquired or the timing of the acquisition, it was also faced with many imposed restrictions, including the acquisition price of the assets whereby it was required to pay the banks a price based on the long-term economic value of assets.  It was required by legislation to acquire a designated portfolio of assets from five participation institutions at a time when the Irish property market was highly distressed.  Unlike the position currently prevailing whereby there are numerous investors interested in acquiring Irish assets, there were no such buyers in 2009 and 2010 when NAMA was being established.</p><p>  The valuation methodology which was approved by the European Commission required NAMA to acquire assets at 'long term economic value' which incorporated a State Aid uplift averaging 22% above market values.  In addition, NAMA acquired assets by reference to a valuation date of 30 November 2009 which meant that it was required to absorb any losses which arose from the 25% - 30% decline in Irish property prices which occurred over the four-year period after the November 2009 acquisition valuation date.</p><p>  Nor does NAMA now have full control over the timing of its asset disposals.  While NAMA is required to obtain the best financial return on its assets, it is also required to carry out its work expeditiously so as to redeem as soon as is commercially feasible the &euro;30.2 billion in senior debt which it issued to acquire loans.  NAMA is not, therefore, in a position where it can hold assets for a long-term horizon as would be the case, for instance, with a pension fund.</p><p>  For the reasons outlined above, it is entirely invalid to suggest that NAMA should be judged by the same IRR criteria as private equity investment funds which are free to operate without the asset acquisition, pricing or asset disposal restrictions applicable to NAMA.  Unlike NAMA, these funds are free to set their own risk profiles and acquire assets across a range of asset classes and jurisdictions and to dispose of them freely.  It is also the case that such funds are not required to take into account the various public, social and economic objectives which are addressed by NAMA.</p><p>  If, as part of a hypothetical exercise, NAMA were to assume that (a) instead of deleveraging, it had scope to hold its end-2014 loan portfolio and (b) it had the same flexibility to manage assets as have investment firms, the estimated annual returns up to end-2017, based on 5%, 10% and 15% simple rates of return would be &euro;2bn, &euro;4bn and &euro;6bn respectively and cumulatively.  However, as I have pointed out, these measures are irrelevant in the context of NAMA's deleveraging strategy.</p></reply>

NAMA has confirmed that statements of account are being sent to the authorised recipients on the relevant account in the Flynn case.

This includes the need to deliver on a demanding strategic plan which involves acceleration of asset disposals and the redemption of 80% of its senior debt by end 2016. Combined with this, NAMA is committed to delivering 4,500 residential units by 2016 in the Dublin area and also delivering Grade A commercial office space in the Dublin Docklands Strategic Development Zone.  The 66 new appointments to NAMA during 2014 reflect these strategic objectives and the need to fill existing positions  due to increased turnover of NAMA staff during this year.</p><p>  All NAMA staff are employees of the NTMA under Section 42 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, 2009 and the NTMA assigns staff to NAMA. On that basis, recruitment is conducted by the NTMA.  Vacancies in NAMA are openly advertised via the NTMA website. It is the case that a role may be advertised via the NTMA website and subsequent vacancies for similar positions may be filled from that competition rather than re-advertising. Of the 66 positions filled in NAMA, 63 were advertised on the NTMA website and 3 were filled by staff who moved to specified purpose or fixed term contracts. </p><p>  Given improved market conditions, certain of these roles have been difficult to fill and the NTMA has had to incur agency fees in order to fill these roles. &euro;291,625 has been paid to recruitment agencies in this respect so far in 2014.</p></reply>

The Setanta Liquidator is currently examining a range of factors in order to estimate the cost of claims and the extent to which claims can be met in the Setanta liquidation.  The Liquidator has advised that settlements can only be paid out after all of the company's liabilities are quantified, including claims.<br/><br/>The Insurance Compensation Fund (ICF) provides for payments to meet the liabilities of insolvent insurers in certain cases where it is unlikely that claims can be met otherwise than from the ICF.  Under the Insurance Act 1964 claims by bodies corporate or unincorporated bodies are not covered by the ICF, except where there is a liability to or by an individual.  In addition, all ICF payments are subject to a limit of 65% of the amount due or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  Management and administration of the ICF is under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  The Accountant of the Courts of Justice is currently engaging with both the Setanta Liquidator and his legal advisors to put in place an appropriate mechanism to commence making applications to the High Court in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964.  I understand that at the moment the Accountant is not in a position to put a timeline on when the first applications will be made.  Procedures for processing claims and the timing of payments, including the question of advance payments from the ICF, is a matter for the President of the High Court.<br/><br/>In the event that the amount distributed by the Liquidator following the completion of his assessment of Setanta's liabilities, in combination with the compensation amount available from the ICF, is insufficient to pay the full value of a claim, the policyholder would be liable to pay the balance. I appreciate that the current position is causing uncertainty for the former customers of Setanta Insurance and I have asked that information on ICF procedures is made available publicly as soon as possible.  While this process is still ongoing, the Setanta Liquidator has advised that policyholders and brokers should send correspondence in relation to individual claims or other claims matters as soon as is possible to Setanta Insurance Company Limited (in liquidation) at:<br/><br/>Deloitte &amp;amp; Touche,<br/><br/>Earlsfort Terrace,<br/><br/>Dublin 2.<br/><br/>Tel: 0818 255 255.<br/><br/>Email: .</p></reply>

This includes a specific provision in relation to the retroactive application of the instrument.  Therefore, the agreement, that we were active in negotiating, keeps open the possibility to apply to the European Stability Mechanism for a retrospective direct recapitalisation of the Irish banks, should we wish to avail of it.</p><p>  What is now required is a decision by mutual agreement of the ESM Board of Governors to create a new ESM instrument in accordance with Article 19 of the ESM treaty.  The aim is to have this process completed by early November this year, subject to completion of national approval procedures.  For Ireland the European Stability Mechanism (Amendment) Bill 2014, which is currently passing through the Houses and is expected to be enacted by the end of this month, will fulfil this purpose.  Once the Single Supervisory Mechanism is in place and operational, on 4 November this year, it is expected that the ESM Board of Governors will then take a decision to include the DRI among the list of ESM instruments.</p><p>  In relation to retrospective recapitalisation, the draft guideline states that the potential application of the instrument for this purpose should be decided on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.  As I have stated previously, it will not be possible to make a formal application to the ESM for retrospective recapitalisation before the Instrument is in place as expected in November.</p><p>  However I would remind the Deputy that unlike back in 2012, the ESM is no longer the only option open to us to recover the money provided to recapitalise our banks.  Investors are now willing to invest in Irish banks again and the market value of our investments has improved accordingly.</p><p>  The decision on any application once the instrument is in place is a matter of timing.  I believe that in Europe a strategic approach tends to deliver and I therefore intend to keep the option of a retroactive recapitalisation  on the table with the timing of any application to be decided in due course.</p></reply>

Therefore, the debt component relating to the recapitalisation of the banks can only be estimated.</p><p>  The previous parliamentary question provided in detail the type and level of capital injections injected into Irish banks since the start of 2009 and indicated that they can be separated into three categories.</p><p>(1) Capital injections that were made under Ministerial direction by the NPRF Commission amount to &euro;18.8 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland preference shares in 2013). There is no debt effect associated with these payments as they did not require borrowing.</p><p>(2) The promissory notes to IBRC and EBS added &euro;30.85 billion to the general government debt, but not the national debt, in 2010.  The IBRC promissory notes were cancelled and replaced with a portfolio of eight floating rate Government bonds for a total amount of &euro;25 billion which will lead to a reduction in general government debt over time.</p><p>(3) By the end of 2013, &euro;10 billion (net of the sale of Bank of Ireland equity in 2011, the sale of Irish Life and the sale of contingent capital notes in 2013) is estimated to have been paid through direct payments from the Exchequer account to the banking sector.  Although no specific borrowing was made in the cases of interventions paid through the Exchequer they would have impacted on the cash reserves held by government.</p><p>  In addition to the recapitalisation payments made to these institutions there have been some developments which have offset these measures.  These include the aforementioned sale of Irish Life and the BOI contingent capital notes.</p><p>  There have also been fees paid to the Minister under the Credit Institutions Financial Support and Eligible Liabilities Guarantee schemes amounting to &euro;4.4 billion from 2008 to 2014.</p><p>  On the basis of the continued progress in relation to the liquidation of IBRC the overall debt figure has continued to reduce.</p></reply>

The application was not approved as it is OPW's view that other factors may be contributing to flooding at this location.  The identification of these factors is being addressed in the context of the ongoing Western Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study to ensure that any mitigation measures that are proposed will deal effectively with the flood problem.<br/><br/>In the initial phase of the CFRAM Programme, referred to as the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA),Ballina was identified as one of 300 Areas for Further Assessment (AFA's).  Hazard mapping, indicating the river and coastal flood risk in Ballina, is at draft stage and is to be finalised shortly and a Public Consultation Day is scheduled for 11<sup>th</sup>November 2014. This will give interested parties and individuals the opportunity to contribute their knowledge of flooding in Ballina to the Western CFRAM study team.<br/><br/>The next stage in the CFRAM process is an option assessment exercise to assess management options for any river and coastal flood risk in Ballina.  The OPW estimates that this report will be completed by 2016.  Further information is available on which also contains links to the individual CFRAM Study websites.<br/><br/>The Government Decision of 11 February, 2014 which made available funding for the repair of existing public infrastructure damaged by storms in the period of 13th December to 6th January 2014, allocated a sum of up to &euro;4,205,000 for repair works in County Mayo based on estimates provided by Mayo County Council. T he Council submitted to the Office of Public Works a programme of works detailing how it proposes to spend the allocation of &euro;4,205,000.  The programme included an amount of &euro;176,000 for repairs to parts of a flood defence wall on the right bank of the River Moy at Ballina.  The programme of works was approved and it is a matter for the Council to prioritise and progress these works and to draw down the funding that was allocated.  The Council has recently drawn down some of the funding available to it but has not yet applied to draw down funding in respect of works in Ballina.</p></reply>

These increases are reflected in the Departmental expenditure ceilings (both capital and current) for the period 2015 to 2017 which are set out in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report. It is, of course, the changes to the capital budget which will have the greatest impact on the construction sector. While the primary purpose of public capital investment is the provision of infrastructure that can aid economic growth and address social requirements, the positive employment impact in the shorter term is a notable benefit.</p><p>  The capital budget for 2015 is &euro;3,549 million, an increase of &euro;297m over the 2015 ceiling as published in the 2014 Expenditure Report. Furthermore, a &euro;307m contingency, which formed part of the ceiling as per the Expenditure Report, was released to Departments to support expenditure in key areas. Overall, therefore, an additional &euro;600m was allocated to Departments for spending in 2015. As the majority of this will be focused on construction the additional allocation will have a positive affect on the sector.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, one of the Government's main priorities in Budget 2015 was on addressing emerging Social Housing needs.  On the expenditure side, I announced an overall capital investment of &euro;2.2bn for the housing programme over the next three years. This will comprise  &euro;1.5bn in Exchequer investment (included in the 2015 to 2017 ceilings referred to above) along with private financing through a social housing PPP of &euro;300m and at least &euro;400m to be provided to the Approved Housing Bodies by way of an off-balance sheet financial vehicle. This significant level of investment will see activity in residential construction increase and will lead to additional employment for the sector. My Department estimates that approximately 10 jobs are sustained or created for each &euro;1m invested in residential construction.</p><p>  Activity in the housing sector will be further enhanced by taxation measures which my colleague, the Minister for Finance, announced in his Budget speech. These include extension of the home renovation scheme to the rental sector, full roll out of the Living Cities Initiative in 2015 and Deposit Interest Retention Tax (D.I.R.T.) refunds for first time buyers who use their savings to purchase their home. Minister Noonan also noted that the Ireland Strategic Infrastructure Fund (ISIF) is looking at ways to support financing projects that will enhance supply of housing.</p></reply>

The Office of Public Works (OPW) has no flood defence assets in Ballylongford and, therefore, has no direct responsibility for maintaining or improving existing flood defences.  However, Ballylongford was identified through the national Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment as an area where the flood risk was potentially significant. It is therefore designated as an area for which detailed analysis is being carried out under the Shannon Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Study, which the OPW is currently undertaking in partnership with the relevant local authorities including Kerry County Council.</p><p>  The analysis under the CFRAM project will enable flood maps to be produced in 2014 and the identification of flood risk management options for this area in 2015.  There will be public consultation on the draft flood maps within the next couple of months and this will be advertised locally. </p><p>  Following the significant flood events earlier this year, on site at Ballylongford data on flood extents, levels and flood mechanism was collected.  This information will contribute to calibrating any flood modelling being produced for the town and thus ensuring any future mitigating measures proposed are robust and effective.</p><p>  On a recent visit to Ballylongford, I met with local residents, Councillors and County Council officials and had the opportunity to see the flood prone areas and hear of the problems at first hand.  At that meeting Kerry County Council indicated that it would be making a submission shortly to the OPW for funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to undertake some interim flood protection measures that could be carried out pending the completion of the CFRAM process.  Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria of the Scheme, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of funding.  It is also open to local authorities to carry out flood mitigation and coastal protection works using their own resources.</p></reply>

This funding has now been drawn down by the Council.  </p><p>  The Government Decision of 11 February, 2014 specifically addressed the allocation of funding for the repair of existing public infrastructure damaged by storms in the period of 13 December to 6 January 2014. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (DoECLG) wrote to Kerry County Council indicating that, based on the estimate submitted by the Council to that Department, up to &euro;1,226,920 was being made available to the Council via the OPW to undertake the necessary repair works to damaged coastal protection and flood defence infrastructure.  </p><p>  The estimates submitted by Kerry County Council to the DoECLG included for strengthening works at Incherea, Glenbeigh and both repair and strengthening works at Cromane Lower However, strengthening works fall outside of the scope of the Government Decision. Only the repair element of projects such as that at Cromane Lower are covered under the allocation. The programme of works the Council submitted to the OPW detailing how it proposes to spend the total allocation of &euro;1,226,920 included an amount of &euro;30,000 for repairs to a coastal embankment at Cromane Lower. This programme was approved and it is a matter for the Council to prioritise and progress these works and to draw down the funding that was allocated. An application to draw down part of the funding was submitted by the Council last week and it is currently being processed.  The application did not include an amount for drawdown in relation to the repair work for the embankment at Cromane Lower. </p><p>  The strengthening works at Cromane Lower and Incherea identified by the Council are a matter to be addressed separate to the current Government approved process aimed at repairs and emergency works.</p></reply>

Kerry earlier this year, following the tidal storm surge of 3 January.  These flood defences are within the Maine Catchment Drainage Scheme, which is under the care of the OPW. </p><p>  The Office hopes to have four excavators carry out works on OPW flood defence embankments at Callinafercy West within the next three weeks. Two of the excavators are fitted with mechanical mulchers, which are deployed to clear excess vegetation from the cross section of the flood defence.  The other two machines will be undertaking embankment strengthening works on the aforementioned embankments.  </p><p>  An engineer from the OPW met one of the landowners concerned last Thursday at the Milltown Public Information Day for the South Western Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) programme and updated him on progress being made in the region, assuring him that the OPW crew will be arriving to his property within the next few weeks.  The landowner expressed his gratitude for the OPW's endeavours throughout the year and commended the emergency response last January in securing his property.</p><p>  As there is no requirement to purchase materials the cost of the works will consist of the cost of the machine and two operatives for the duration of the works and this is factored into the OPW's yearly expenditure on arterial drainage maintenance.</p></reply>

Two of these are fitted with mechanical mulchers, which are deployed to clear excess vegetation from the cross section of the flood defence. The other two machines will be undertaking embankment strengthening works on the aforementioned embankments.</p><p>  OPW currently has a machine operating on lands adjoining the specific property to which the Deputy refers at Coolinch, Callinafercy, Co Kerry. This machine was mobilised to this site last Wednesday.  The Office is currently addressing erosion issues along this section of flood defence embankment.  Following completion of these repairs the crew hope to address the specific landowner's concerns within the next week or so. </p></reply>

Ratification by Ireland is therefore subject to prior approval of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  It is my intention to shortly seek the necessary approval so that Ireland is in a position to ratify the Agreement.  So far, 17 EU Member States have ratified the Agreement.</p><p>  Article 1 of the Agreement stipulates that respect for democratic principles and fundamental human rights and for the rule of law is an essential element of the Agreement. During the negotiation of the Agreement, Ireland strongly promoted the inclusion of provisions to reflect this essential element.  </p><p>  The inclusion of a sustainable development chapter in the Agreement provides the EU with an important means to contribute to supporting positive social reforms and to the greater protection of human rights in Colombia. Furthermore, the setting up of a special committee, with representatives from Colombian civil society, to monitor implementation of the sustainability provisions demonstrates how the EU can develop real leverage for promoting its values and expectations through this agreement.</p><p>  The elaboration by Colombia and Peru of roadmaps on human rights, labour rights and environmental protection in October 2012 clearly demonstrates how the Agreement can incentivise an agenda for change. Against this background, I believe the Agreement with Colombia will be instrumental in encouraging economic and social progress reinforced by arrangements that strengthen the voice and role of civil society in favour of the progressive development human and labour rights. This is also recognised by the European Parliament that last year voted to approve the Agreement.</p></reply>

Staffing of all business units is managed in that context, utilising available resources in the most effective and efficient manner as appropriate to business needs, which are discussed on an ongoing basis within my Department, in light of my Department&rsquo;s overall mission and goals. </p><p>  At the end of 2011 there were 66 Labour Inspectors assigned to NERA, which represented a little over 7% of my Department&rsquo;s overall staffing complement. There are currently 57 Labour Inspectors in post, which again represents just over 7% of my current Departmental staffing cohort. Strategic deployment of limited resources in response to Workforce Planning reviews, ongoing prioritising and reprioritising of work and advocating for key or mission-critical posts to be filled to enable the Department meet its current mission are the key tools at the Department&rsquo;s disposal regarding staffing resources at this time - with the challenge remaining to do so in a resources-constrained environment.</p><p>  My Department continues to proactively and productively engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on resources for the Department, its Offices and its Agencies.    The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has, like so many of the Irish businesses and enterprises it supports, had to do more with less to achieve its objectives in the face of seriously reduced resources.  While the Department engages with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on sanctioning the filling of key vacancies within the ECF/Moratorium framework, the respective management of each agency has had to reconfigure their organisation and adapt to a constrained-resources environment.  Notwithstanding these constraints, through a comprehensive series of reforms and changed work practices, the Department and its agencies have been able to deliver a comprehensive range of services and supports.  </p><p>  In light of the foregoing, resources for all Business Units in my Department are reviewed periodically and local managements advocate on behalf of their Units in terms of resource allocation.  In this context, there would be ongoing dialogue between the management of NERA and the Personnel Unit of my Department regarding resources.  In that regard, I am satisfied that in the ongoing resource-constrained environment we must operate, adequate resources are allocated to NERA although that will be kept under review as needs dictate.  </p></reply>

This ensures that both the private information of individuals and the commercial affairs of companies or organisations are treated in accordance with legal obligations. Only where a Court adjudicates on a case does such information become a matter of public record.<br/><br/>However I can state that publicly funded construction projects are a matter of interest to NERA and the sector is subject to ongoing monitoring by NERA.  NERA&rsquo;s inspection remit encompasses the enforcement of certain statutory employment rights and obligations under employment legislation, including the following Acts:<br/><br/>- National Minimum Wage Act 2000<br/><br/>- Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 <br/><br/>- Payment of Wages Act 1991<br/><br/>- Employment Permits Acts 2003 &amp;amp; 2006<br/><br/>- Employment Agency Act 1971<br/><br/>Failure or refusal to comply with legal obligations under the above Acts can result in a criminal conviction for an employer. <br/><br/>Where in the course of an investigation NERA encounters a question as to whether a person is self-employed, such claimants are directed to seek clarification of their status with SCOPE Section of Department of Social Protection or to the Revenue Commissioners to deal with the issuing of certification regarding self-employment. When this issue is clarified any claims under employment legislation can then be investigated. </p></reply>

Kerry, which took place prior to the end of June 2014.<br/><br/>The final decision on where to locate and indeed where to visit resides with the client company.  That having been said, the addition of grant aid in Kerry will, of course, add a positive element to the value proposition of Kerry as a destination for FDI. <br/><br/>At the end of<b></b>2013, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 12 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kerry employing 1,638<b></b>people.  IDA Ireland has strong relationships with all these companies and works closely with them to ensure their long term sustainability and to encourage their growth, development and continuing re-investment in their sites.  The primary opportunity for regional locations is in respect of the existing client base and potential further investment opportunities from same.  Approximately 70% of all FDI investments won by IDA Ireland are from the existing client base.  <br/><br/>The Action Plan for Jobs 2014 includes a commitment to develop a framework for a Regional Enterprise Strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.

The role which other public bodies in the region can play in working towards this objective will also be examined as the project develops.  The aim is that this framework will serve as a model for other regions of the country.</p></reply>

It has also since been decided, on 24 June 2014, that Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na should work towards a partial merger of their businesses, focusing on the areas of overlap between the two companies and that a joint venture between the companies will manage their common business activities in biomass, wind energy, shared services and recreation and tourism.

The PSA, an independent body under the remit of my Department,  has adopted a phased approach to licensing and currently licences in the region of 960 contractors and 28,000 individuals in a range of sectors including Cash In Transit, Door Supervisor and Security Guarding.  <br/><br/>I am aware of concerns at the <i>modus operandi</i>of some private investigators, as indicated by recent court cases taken by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner.  I am informed by the Authority that in preparation for the licensing of this particular sector, the PSA issued a questionnaire to gather information on the scope of the private investigator sector.  The results of this consultation have now laid the foundations for the development of licensing in the area.  Furthermore, the Authority's Strategic Plan 2014-2017 provides for the completion of a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the licensing of private investigators. I am also informed by the Authority that this RIA is now at an advanced stage of development and will be completed before the year end.  The Strategic Plan also provides for the licensing of contractors in the private investigator sector by the end of 2015 and the licensing of individuals in 2016. </p></reply>

These proposals are subject to co-decision between the Council and the European Parliament. While the Parliament has already adopted positions in respect of both instruments, the JHA Council has not yet reached agreement on all aspects of the Commission's proposals and expert-level discussions are ongoing under the current Italian Presidency of the Council.</p><p>  Following completion of the co-decision procedure, it will be necessary to review the contents of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 in order to ensure compliance with the revised data protection standards in the new Regulation and Directive. While many of the Regulation's provisions will be directly applicable without the need for domestic legislation, the Directive's provisions may, depending on the final content, need to be transposed into domestic law. It is likely that some amendments to the 1988 and 2003 Acts will be required. </p><p>  The Government strongly supports the important work of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner. As indicated on previous occasions,   it is the Government's intention to keep the resources of the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner under review in order to meet the increasing demands of this expanding sector. Following a Government Decision on 7 October, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will be upgraded to the status of a separate Office of State under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. From 2015, the Office will have its own Vote, with increased resources to support these reforms.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner will open a new office in Dublin in addition to the existing office in Portarlington. </p></reply>

In this regard an offender is liable on summary conviction to a fine or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or to both.<br/><br/>The offences in section 19 were extended to hospital, ambulance and fire brigade personnel by means of section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in order to address the problem of assaults and obstruction of personnel engaged in providing emergency services.  In addition, in the case of an assault causing serious harm against emergency workers, an offender can be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 and could be subject to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  <b><font color="#000080">  </font></b><br/><br/>I hope the Deputy will agree that the law already recognises the gravity of any attack on emergency service personnel and members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who are carrying out their duty, and that the penalties which are in place clearly underline the seriousness with which such attacks are viewed .<br/><br/>In relation to the other issues referred to, the Deputy will appreciate that the fire services do not come within my remit, but I am assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide every appropriate assistance to emergency service personnel when they are requested to do so.Particular liaison is maintained with fire services and local authorities in the run up to Halloween and on Halloween night itself, in the context of overall policing plans to respond to issues of public safety and anti-social behaviour which can arise during this period.</p></reply>

The GP would also be entitled to claim the maximum applicable contribution towards locum costs for periods of sick leave, annual leave, study leave, maternity leave and adoptive leave.  In remote areas, where an alternative to dispensing by the GP is considered not to be feasible by the HSE, a dispensing GP is entitled to receive payment for dispensing to his/her GMS patients.</p><p>  The Rural Practice Allowance has not been abolished.  Since 2009, a number of reductions have been applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 (FEMPI) to the fees and allowances paid to health professionals, including GPs who provide services under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme.  Over this period, the Rural Practice Allowance under the GMS capitation agreement has been reduced from &euro;20,712.29 to the current annual rate of &euro;16,216.07.  This has resulted in an overall reduction in the payments made by the HSE for this allowance from some &euro;3.762 million in 2009 to approximately &euro;3.121 million in 2013.    </p><p>  GPs contracted under the GMS Scheme are paid an annual capitation payment in respect of each patient on their GMS list.  Up until 2010, this capitation payment was based on the patient's age, gender and the distance they lived from the GP's surgery.  In 2010, under FEMPI, the aspect relating to distance from the GP's surgery was removed as a factor in calculating capitation fees.  In this context, it should be noted that the 2010 Regulations imposed a variety of reductions across a range of fees and allowances averaging just over 9% in total.  While the reduction in certain fees was more than 9%, the reduction in others was less than 9%.  In making such determinations, the Department was mindful of information from the HSE which indicated that 90% of GP consultations take place at the GP surgery and do not involve a home visit &ndash; also many of the home visits are undertaken out-of-hours by GPs in co-ops, where the GP has the use of a car and driver funded by the HSE, which they can also use for home visits to private patients.  The Department, in arriving at its final determination in relation to the range of percentage reductions also ensured that the reduction in relation to the superannuable fees was kept to a minimum, thus minimising the reduction in the GPs&rsquo; pensions at a later stage (superannuable fees were only reduced by 3.5%).  In relation to the removal of &ldquo;distance&rdquo; as a factor in calculating certain fees, the total estimated full year saving for this measure in 2010 was &euro;5.2 million.</p><p>While GP   numbers are keeping pace with overall demographics, this does not always prevent shortages occurring at local level.  GPs once qualified tend to work for existing GP practices or as self-employed contractors - and are free to decide where to establish practice.  Isolated rural areas and deprived urban areas, very often with limited private practice opportunities, may sometimes find it difficult to attract GPs to fill vacant posts.</p><p>The HSE is actively seeking to address this issue at present with the medical organisations with a view to developing practical measures - including reorganising lists with existing doctors in local areas, and through the development of more flexible contractual arrangements which would encourage young GPs to work in such areas.  This will be examined as part of the overall GMS contract discussions between the Department, HSE and the Irish Medical Organisation, which will begin shortly.</p><p>  In relation to the particular aspect relating to the breakdown of spend by County for the Rural Practice Allowance, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy on this matter.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2014-10-22a.346.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/982" speakername="Kathleen Lynch" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2014102200046#WRR00300"><p>The Government is committed to introducing, on a phased basis, a universal GP service without fees within its term of office, as set out in the Programme for Government. As announced previously, it was decided to commence the roll-out of a universal GP service by providing all children aged 5 years and under with access to a GP service without fees. &euro;37 million (full year) is being made available for the provision of GP care without fees to children under six years.</p><p>  On 4th   June 2014, a Framework Agreement was concluded between the Department of Health, the HSE and the IMO in relation to the draft contract for the provision of services to children under 6 years of age. The Framework Agreement sets out a process for engagement concerning the GMS/GP contract and other publicly funded contracts involving GPs. A number of meetings have already taken place between the parties.  The objective is to have universal GP care without fees for children under 6 years in place in the coming months, subject to the conclusion of the present discussions and the completion of a fee-setting process.</p><p>  Regarding additional workload, research carried out for the Department in 2013 indicates that fee-paying children under 6 years of age have an annual GP visitation rate of 2.7, whereas, medical card/GP visit card holding children in the same age cohort have an annual visitation rate of 3.1. It is not expected that such an increase in visits will result in an intolerable workload for GPs.</p></reply>

The HPSC is presently involved in establishing a Lyme Borreliosis Sub-Committee with the primary aim of examining best practice in prevention and surveillance of Lyme Disease and to develop strategies to undertake primary prevention in order to minimise harm caused by Lyme Borreliosis in Ireland.  A major focus of the Committee&rsquo;s work will be on raising awareness of Lyme Disease among both clinicians and the general public.  </p><p>  With a view to this, in preparing for the establishment of the Committee, the HPSC has extended the information available on its website to ensure that diagnosticians remain increasingly aware of the issue of Lyme Disease.  Each year, as part of its ongoing awareness raising about Lyme disease and methods of preventing or minimising potential exposure through tick bites, HPSC holds a &quot;Lyme Disease Awareness Week&quot;, in which media releases are sent out with the intention that media outlets would take up the important Lyme prevention messages.  This year, &quot;Lyme Disease Awareness Week&quot; took place in late May.</p><p>  As part of the Lyme Disease Awareness Week a supply of information was made available to the public and attention was drawn to a &ldquo;Tickborne Disease Toolkit&rdquo;, developed by the European Centre for Disease Control, which is available on the ECDC website.  In addition, this toolkit was modified for use in Ireland and posted on the HPSC website.  The ECDC has noted that Ireland is the first European Member State to make such extensive use of this material.  Following the Awareness Week a 100% increase of web traffic to the various Lyme Disease sections of the HPSC website was noted.</p><p>  Preparatory work in drawing this group together began before the summer and relevant experts and officials were identified and invited to participate.  The Unit within HPSC responsible for surveillance and provision of expert advice in relation to Lyme borreliosis is the Gastrozoonotic and Vectorborne (GZV) Unit.  This work will be advanced over the next few months.</p></reply>

Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for the provision of public water services. </p><p>  The EU (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014 require that where Irish Water or a local authority, having consulted with and subject to the agreement of the Health Service Executive, consider a supply of water intended for human consumption constitutes a potential danger to human health they must ensure that appropriate restrictions are put in place, that consumers are given necessary advice and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is informed. </p><p>  In practice the local authority engineer, acting on behalf of Irish Water contacts the Principal Environmental Health Officer (PEHO) of the HSE to consider whether an exceedance of a parametric value and the initial investigation into the exceedance warrant restrictions and/or notification of consumers. Where a potential danger to human health exists the PEHO liaises with the Specialist in Public Health Medicine (SPHM) before agreeing appropriate actions with Irish Water and/or the local authority as appropriate.  Irish Water and the local authority are responsible for taking the necessary steps to bring the public water supply back into compliance and for issuing information and advice to consumers.</p><p>  The Regulations also provide the EPA with supervisory powers for public water supplies. The EPA can direct Irish Water to improve the management or quality of a public water supply. The local authorities have a similar supervisory role in relation to group water schemes and private supplies. Under the regulations Irish Water must notify the EPA of drinking water non-compliances or risks to public health from a public water supply. </p></reply>

It is the firm policy of the Government that depleted uranium munitions will never be used by the Defence Forces.  Research carried out to date by the relevant international organisations, including by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), has concluded that depleted uranium does not pose a significant radiological risk.  Other research has consistently returned inconclusive results.  Ireland has voted in favour of the four resolutions on depleted uranium taken at the United Nations General Assembly since 2007, most recently in December 2012 when General Assembly Resolution 67/36 was supported by 155 States.  These resolutions requested the UN Secretary-General to seek the views of member States and relevant international organisations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunition containing depleted uranium.  I have instructed my delegation to again vote in favour of the resolution at the General Assembly this year.</p><p>  Following consultations with the Department of Defence, Ireland provided a national report to the UN Secretary-General in 2009.  Ireland&rsquo;s submission confirmed that while there is no practical method of testing people that may have been exposed to depleted uranium, thorough medical examinations are carried out on all Defence Forces personnel returning from deployment overseas.  These include tests intended to detect signs of those disease processes most likely to arise in cases of contamination with depleted uranium.  To date, no evidence of an unusual incidence of disease has been found. </p><p>  At present, there is no international framework or treaty relating to depleted uranium munitions and, consequently, no internationally agreed definition or prohibition.  To achieve the political momentum required for implementing an international ban, a necessary condition would be to establish conclusively the negative impact of depleted uranium on human health and on the environment. </p><p>  The Government supports further study and research by relevant international organisations and the scientific community and welcomes the undertaking to do so in this year&rsquo;s UN Resolution.</p></reply>

For the most part we do so in relation to the type of activity or human rights abuse which is of concern, rather than on specific cases.  This is both because we wish our remarks to apply to all relevant cases, but also because we do not have the resources to track individual cases and confirm the basis of reports received, prior to raising them.  I am aware of the case in question, but only from a single social media report which has been repeated elsewhere many times.  The person involved was not previously known to my Department, and we have no information at this point as to whether she is still in custody or on what basis or charge.

The apparent arrest, detention and prosecution of Mr Rajab for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of expression is of great concern.  Reports indicate that his trial, which commenced on Sunday, will continue on 29 October.  Mr Rajab was released from prison earlier this year, and, since then, has been continuing to act as an important voice on human rights matters in Bahrain, including, inter alia, by his participation in the work of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  Officials from my Department have met with Mr Rajab since his release to discuss with him the circumstances of his previous detention and the human rights situation in Bahrain more generally.  In 2013, the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that Mr. Rajab&rsquo;s previous detention was arbitrary.  Ireland has always attached priority to safeguarding the position and rights of human rights defenders and has continually advocated that civil society actors must be free to operate in a safe and enabling environment, free from repression.  Ireland&rsquo;s concerns on such human rights issues in Bahrain have been conveyed regularly to the Bahraini authorities.</p><p>  Ireland was one of 47 member states who delivered a joint statement expressing serious concern over the human rights situation in Bahrain at the 26th Session of the UN Human Rights Council in June of this year.  In the statement, the signatories expressed their concern regarding the protection of human rights in Bahrain and called on the government to expedite the implementation of the recommendations received from the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry in this regard.</p><p>  At the 27th session of the Human Rights Council last month, in a national statement, Ireland welcomed the positive steps taken by the authorities in Bahrain with respect to cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights while again expressing our serious concerns about the human rights situation, in particular condemning &lsquo;the continuing arbitrary detention of human rights defenders, detained for peacefully exercising their human rights&rsquo;.  The current situation of human rights defenders in Bahrain will also be raised with the UN Special Rapporteur on this issue during an interactive dialogue which Ireland and other like-minded countries will have with him later this week in New York.</p><p>  Human rights defenders, whether in Bahrain or elsewhere, should not be detained for simply exercising their rights, and all those arbitrarily detained in such circumstances should be immediately released.  As noted by the spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the detention of high profile human rights activists like Mr Rajab &lsquo;sends a chilling message to other lesser-known activists of the consequences they may face for any criticism of the authorities&rsquo;.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to follow closely the human rights situation in Bahrain and to monitor the case of Nabeel Rajab in this context.</p></reply>

Discussions were largely dominated by the Ebola crisis in West Africa, as well as by developments in the EU&rsquo;s Southern and Eastern Neighbourhoods.  In opening remarks, High Representative (HR) Ashton gave a short update on the progress of the negotiations with Iran on the nuclear dossier.  In addition, HR Ashton welcomed the orderly conduct of elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 12 October. Council Conclusions on Bosnia-Herzegovina were adopted without discussion.  The first formal agenda item for discussion was the Ebola crisis and there followed an extensive exchange of views, involving the participation of European Commissioners Georgieva (International Cooperation, Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Response) and Borg (Health).  Clearly the outbreak and spread of the disease is a cause of great concern to all EU Member States. During our discussions there was a strong commitment to step up efforts to prevent the spread of the disease, and to increase efforts to improve the coordination of efforts on the ground, including in terms of providing appropriate support to medical personnel. In my intervention, I welcomed the discussion, stressing both the leading role of the UN, as well as the importance of EU coordination. I also provided the Council with a read-out from Minister of State Sherlock&rsquo;s recent visit to Sierra Leone. The Council Conclusions received strong support and draw together the key aspects of cooperation and coordination at EU and the wider international level.</p><p>  Ministers were later joined by the UN Special Representative on Libya and Head of UNSMIL (United Nations Support Mission in Libya) Bernadino Leon who updated us on recent developments in Libya and ongoing mediation efforts. Council Conclusions on Libya were adopted by the Council.</p><p>  The Council adopted conclusions on the situation in Iraq and Syria. These Conclusions unequivocally condemn atrocities, killings and human rights abuses perpetrated by ISIS and other terrorist groups in both Syria and Iraq, as well as by the Assad regime in Syria. The Conclusions also highlight the ongoing humanitarian challenges, and the need to implement UN Security Council resolutions 2139 and 2165 which provide for the lifting of restrictions on humanitarian relief and cross-border assistance. The Council also agreed to expand restrictive measures against the Assad regime, including a new ban on the export of aviation fuel to Syria.</p><p>  Ministers then had a short exchange on Ukraine. The Conclusions adopted by the Council noted the decreased level of violence while regretting and condemning the continued numerous violations of the ceasefire. The Council called for all parties&rsquo; full engagement and swift implementation of the Minsk document.</p><p>  Finally, the Council turned its attentions to the Middle East Peace Process and the situation in Gaza where there was a useful exchange of views.  High Representative Ashton debriefed Ministers on the outcome of the donor's conference for Gaza on 12 October in Cairo, which I attended. My comments welcomed the outcome of the Conference &ndash; where Ireland pledged &euro;2.5 million in humanitarian assistance and reconstruction aid &ndash; while emphasising that this funding could only be effective in an environment where the conflict was not going to resume. As I have stated before, it is imperative that the underlying issues in Gaza are addressed and resolved politically. Ireland&rsquo;s support for a two-State solution is well known and resuming substantive negotiations to bring this about represents only effective means of ending the conflict.</p></reply>

At the Council, we reviewed the overall situation in West Africa as the Ebola virus continues to spread in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.  The Council recognised that a united and increased effort is needed to contain the outbreak and to provide the necessary assistance to the countries affected.  In this respect, we stressed the importance of reinforcing regional and international cooperation and welcomed, in particular, the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s decision to establish the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER).  It represents an important step in the global efforts to contain the outbreak; to assist with the management and coordination of the international response; and to take a strong leadership role at national levels.  The Council recognised also the need to support international health workers who are essential in responding to the emergency and agreed that the EU will provide appropriate care for them, including the possibility of medical evacuation if necessary.</p><p>  During the discussion, I reiterated the urgent need to intensify support for the West Africa region in particular by addressing gaps in leadership and coordination through UNMEER, by addressing funding needs and by addressing the urgent need for more international health-care professionals in the isolation and treatment centres.  The Council called on all international donors to respond to the UN appeal for funding, including through the recently established UN Ebola Trust Fund.</p><p>  Ireland will continue to work closely with EU partners as well as with the United Nations to ensure a coordinated and robust response in the tackling of the Ebola virus.   We are providing over &euro;16 million in the region, directly and through NGOs.  Our programmes in Sierra Leone and Liberia are focused on strengthening health systems and we have reprogrammed other funding directly to the Ebola response.</p><p>  We are urgently looking at what more we can do, both internationally and through our Embassy in Freetown, which has been very active in helping to coordinate the local effort.   We have adopted a flexible approach with NGO partners so that our long-term development funding to them can, as necessary, be redirected to assist with the fight against Ebola.  We are keeping in close contact with Irish aid organisations operating in the region.</p><p>  Ireland has been playing a strong role internationally and on the ground in Sierra Leone, and, significantly, the Minister of State for Development, Trade Promotion and North-South Cooperation, Se&aacute;n Sherlock TD, was the first European Minister to visit the country since the start of the Ebola outbreak.  We will continue to play our part in the fight to tackle the outbreak and I welcome the agreement at the Foreign Affairs Council that we will examine at the next meeting the wider political, security and economic implications of Ebola for West Africa.</p></reply>

This applicant has submitted all the required documentation.  However, on examination there was a discrepancy between the Irish grandparent&rsquo;s date of birth on the birth certificate and the age on the marriage certificate and the date of birth as recorded on the death certificate.  In all such applications, where eligibility relies on an Irish born grandparent, the grandparent&rsquo;s date of birth should be consistent in all documentation and the age at which he/she got married should be consistent with the date of birth on the birth certificate.</p><p>  In this case the age at marriage of the grandparent is consistent with the date of birth on the death certificate, 15 August 1929. However, the date of birth on the birth certificate is 10 August 1927.

In my pre-budget discussions with the education partners I expressed the hope that continued improvement in the economy over a sustained period will take us to a position where we can make improvements in some areas. The Government's approach to restoring the economy has helped Ireland to return to a position where we are seeing economic growth. It is a continuing improvement in our economic growth over a sustained period that will enable us to move to a point where we can look again at providing for additional teacher resources in schools which could bring about an improvement in PTR, class size and support for classroom teachers.</p><p>  In the meantime, my Department's focus is on targeting any available resources to cater for the continued increase in student numbers across primary, post-primary and third level.

We have a growing population of young people in this country and despite the difficult financial circumstances we face as a country, we prioritised education so that the number of teachers we have in the system has also grown in order to protect existing pupil teacher ratios. There were a thousand more teachers employed in schools around the country in the last school year, than there was the year before. There will be a further increase of circa 1,300 teachers in the current school year.</p><p>  At primary level the staffing schedule operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level. The national average class size at primary level is 24.7 pupils. However, with over 21,100 classes in over 3,100 primary schools throughout the country there will always be variations in class sizes at individual school level. My Department's guidance to local school management is that such variations should be kept to the minimum.</p></reply>

The staffing arrangements for the current school year are set out in Circular 0007/2014 which is available on the Department website.

At primary level, GAM/EAL (learning/language support) hours are allocated on the basis of mainstream classroom teaching posts in the school. Schools have autonomy to deploy this resource between learning support and language support depending on the specific needs of the school. This school has a GAM/EAL allocation of 2 full teaching posts and 20 part-time hours.</p><p>  The new arrangements also provided for additional permanent teaching posts to be given to schools with high concentration of pupils that require language support.

To enable students to understand financial management skills as they apply to households and businesses both the current Junior Certificate Business Studies and Leaving Certificate business syllabuses include learning outcomes that focus on budgeting and financial management. While these subjects are optional on the curriculum the level of take up of the subjects is high. Also of relevance are the Transition Year business programmes developed by schools. Given the recent ongoing review of syllabuses, in particular the Business Studies syllabus, work is ongoing on strengthening existing curricular approaches to financial literacy development.<br/><br/>  A number of organisations are working towards supporting the development of financial literacy and nearly all of the resources they develop are free to schools and are widely used. Quite often links exist between individual schools and organisations in the community including for example, banks, credit unions and the Money Advice and Budgetary Service (MABS), and these links provide the basis for the use of relevant resources. </p></reply>

As well as teaching through the medium of Irish, the school is the only multi-denominational provider in the area.<br/><br/>  While enrolments may have decreased in some schools in the area since the 1980s, this does not necessarily mean that the schools have vacant accommodation to a level which would accommodate the needs of the school in question.  Pupil-Teacher ratios have been significantly reduced since the 1980s.  The current pupil-teacher ratio is 28:1.  In the early 1980s, however, some 77% of ordinary classes in schools had up to as many as 45 pupils in a class group.  With the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio in the intervening years, the same level of accommodation can now accommodate smaller numbers of pupils.<br/><br/>  In addition, seven of the nine schools in the area directly concerned have urban Band 1 DEIS status, which means that their average pupil-teacher ratio is lower again at 20:1 for junior cycle classes and 22:1 at senior cycle with an attendant impact on accommodation.  DEIS schools also have extra supports for pupils and parents, most of which require extra space for their delivery.<br/><br/>  Also, in line with Government policy to support children with special educational needs, significant extra teaching resources have been made available to schools requiring corresponding accommodation such as resource rooms and learning support rooms.<br/><br/>  The Deputy will also be aware that the primary school curriculum and pedagogies are considerably different today from those of the 1980s.  This has impacted and altered accommodation requirements and room usages in schools generally.</p></reply>

Part of this process involves the collection of information in relation to the social context of schools.<br/><br/>The working group report recommended that a school's social context should be used because it can contribute strongly to the level of learning needs that students have.  The report considered that, on the basis of available research evidence, the use of a school's social context is valid in developing an educational profile, as socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with the incidence of certain types of special educational needs, including low achievement in academic learning and emotional or behavioural disorders. <br/><br/>The report also noted that a school within a disadvantaged social context may have a higher share of students presenting with emotional or behavioural disorders. While some of these needs are likely to be reflected in low test scores, others may not, as students with relatively high levels of educational achievement can have emotional and behavioural disorders. <br/><br/>My Department therefore, in conjunction with the NCSE, asked the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct a survey of schools to assist the development of an educational profile.<br/><br/>Though recognising that all schools would not be able to have specific detail regarding all of the questions asked in relation to their pupil populations, schools were asked to provide their best possible estimates in relation to the questions being asked in the survey, in order to ensure that as accurate as possible a social context allocation component of any revised allocation model could be developed for each school.  <br/><br/>The data which schools were requested to return as part of the survey was non-personal, anonymised data and, schools were not asked to return data in relation to the social circumstances of individual pupils.<br/><br/>Schools were also advised that the ERC had put in place a dedicated phone help line in order to provide assistance and support to schools in completing the questionnaire. I understand that many schools used this help line to gain assistance in completing the questionnaire.<br/><br/>Whereas I understand that the return of this survey has caused extra work and some difficulties for some schools, I am confident that having up to date social context data will be highly beneficial to my Department and the NCSE in developing proposals for a new profiled allocation model for schools.<br/><br/>I also wish to advise the Deputy that following publication of the working group report, my Department invited education partners, stakeholders, and parent representative groups to make written submissions in relation to the NCSE report. 26 written submissions have been received to date, from interested parties. <br/><br/>My Department also held a number of consultation meetings on 1 and 3 October last with stakeholders, education partners, and parent representative groups. <br/><br/>Consultation has been a key feature of the development of this policy advice to date and I can confirm that consultation will continue to take place at each stage of the development of proposals for any new model.</p></reply>

In the first instance school transport vehicles are routed and timetabled to coincide with school opening and closing times and existing contract arrangements with private sector providers are framed along these lines.<br/><br/>A further significant factor to be considered in examining the integration of school transport services is child protection. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the opening up of school transport services to adults could have potential risks if this were to be implemented. <br/><br/>The issue of integrated rural transport provision is being looked at closely by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and in that context the National Transport Authority has conducted some trials in this area. I consider this is the most appropriate way of advancing this agenda and dealing with the type of issues I have outlined.</p></reply>

Section 19 provides that any person who assaults a person providing medical services at or in a hospital, or a peace officer acting in the execution of their duty, is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both or, on conviction on indictment , to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years ,or to both.

The offences in section 19 were extended to hospital, ambulance and fire brigade personnel by means of section 185 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in order to address the problem of assaults and obstruction of personnel engaged in providing emergency services.</p><p>  In addition to the special offences under section 19 of the 1994 Act, the general criminal law applies. For example, in the case of an assault causing serious harm to an emergency worker, the offender may be prosecuted under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997.</p><p>  Individual fire authorities have engaged with communities in areas where incidents occur and have successfully reduced these types of violent attacks. Nonetheless , decisions taken to proceed in specific situations , to avoid incidents , and how to proceed with prosecutions are appropriately made by the relevant authorities, in consultation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na .     </p></reply>

The Act also provides that the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) will be responsible for the economic regulation of Irish water and the charges to be levied by Irish Water will be subject to the approval of the CER. The CER has already undertaken public consultations on the development of the economic regulatory framework for water services and will be undertaking further consultations during 2014. Water charges commenced on 1 October 2014 and the first bills will be issued by Irish Water to households from January 2015.<br/><br/>Group Water Schemes that are supplied by way of a connection to the public water supply network will have previously been non-domestic customers of the relevant local authority and will therefore now become customers of Irish Water. Under the arrangements determined by the CER, the existing charges for non-domestic customers will remain in place pending a further consultation. My Department understands that there may be some Group Schemes where special local arrangements may have applied; the future arrangements in relation to these schemes will be resolved as soon as possible. There are other Group Water Schemes that have their own water sources - these will not be customers of Irish Water and will continue to operate as before.<br/><br/>My Department will remain responsible for the overall policy and funding, where appropriate, of the non-public water sector, including the group water sector. Over the past decade, substantial improvements have been made in the group water sector, reflected in improved infrastructure and management and leading to greater compliance with drinking water standards. This has been accomplished through a partnership approach between my Department, the local authorities and the group water sector itself, with the important involvement of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes.<i>This co-operative approach will be maintained as the reform of water services provision is progressed.</i></p></reply>

This will be achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment in areas where there is a commercial case to do so and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.  As I explained in responding to the previous question, it is a matter for Irish Water, in the first instance, to decide whether there is a business case for entering the market. The electronic communications market is a fully liberalised market which is subject to EU market economy rules. Therefore any proposal by Irish Water or others to lay any electronic communications infrastructure to provide public services in areas where high quality broadband is already available, or planned within a reasonable period, must be decided on a commercial basis by the investors.</p><p>  The National Broadband Plan intervention will seek an efficient least-cost approach to deliver high quality broadband access in non-commercial areas. As I indicated in my previous reply, my Department will publish a database of available assets which will be made accessible to all parties interested in participating in the State intervention. This database may identify parts of Irish Water&rsquo;s network as a possible means of routing high quality broadband infrastructure in non-commercial areas should this be appropriate or possible.</p><p>  The market intervention will require some level of State investment which will be allocated in an open, transparent procurement process. My Department will have a significant role in allocating the State investment to one or more successful applicants. In this circumstance it would not be appropriate for me express a preference for any one potential solution over others.</p></reply>

Through the National Broadband Plan (NBP) the Government aims to ensure that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses in Ireland. This is being achieved through measures designed to accelerate commercial investment and the development of a State-led intervention for non-commercial areas.    Since publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector have accelerated with commercial operators investing, or committing to invest, approximately &euro;2.5 billion in networks and services. </p><p>  Under EU State Aid Guidelines Member States cannot intervene where commercial investors have plans to roll out services. A comprehensive mapping exercise is underway in my Department to identify those areas that require a State intervention. An initial list has already been identified and includes the 56 areas in County Clare referred to in the Deputy's Question. </p><p>  I understand that at least one network operator has published a programme to roll out 30 fibre-based broadband networks in County Clare by July 2016. In addition the recent announcement of a joint venture between ESB and Vodafone includes a proposal to provide high speed broadband in Ennis and Shannon Town. I am also aware of the rollout of high speed broadband service in Shannon Town by UPC. </p><p>  The State has previously intervened in the telecoms sector through the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) Programme, by constructing one network in Kilrush, County Clare. This network is currently in use by telecoms operators, who are making telecoms services available to businesses and citizens in the Kilrush area.</p><p>  I expect to publish a map shortly which will allow members of the public to see the precise areas of the country where, based on current information provided by the various commercial operators, it is intended that the proposed Government intervention will cover. Those accessing this map will be able to identify their own house or premises and see whether or not it is in the proposed national intervention footprint. Where a house or premises is not in the proposed intervention area it means it either currently, or will in the near future, have access to commercial NGA services. </p><p>  The map will be the subject of public consultation over a number of months, allowing operators and citizens to comment, clarify and seek updates. In this respect, the map will be dynamic and will be subject to change if new information comes to light or if commercial investments are announced in the future. </p><p>  A further public consultation on a detailed intervention strategy will be launched in mid-2015. </p><p>  EU State Aid clearance will be required for the State intervention. My Department will be working closely with the European Commission on this important aspect of the programme.</p><p>  Finally, a detailed procurement process will have to be undertaken in order to select a potential preferred bidder(s) prior to commencing the roll out of high speed broadband services. I expect the procurement process to commence towards the end of 2015.</p><p>This complex and ambitious project is a key priority for Government and for my Department. It aims to conclusively address current connectivity challenges in a sustainable and meaningful way. Our goal is to ensure that quality broadband services are available to all citizens regardless of where they are located.   </p></reply>

In this regard the trustees of the scheme must, in the management of the scheme, act in the best interests of all scheme members and beneficiaries.   Trustees of a pension scheme must also comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act 1990 which, among other things, sets down certain requirements in relation to the funding of pensions scheme. The funding requirements under the Pensions  Act essentially provide a &lsquo;health check&rsquo; on the  funding level in a pension scheme and provide an indication to the trustees that action is required if the funding level falls below the requirements of the Act.   Matters relating to the provisions in the Pensions Act are the responsibility of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection.  I understand that a number of  changes have been made to the Pensions Act in recent years to assist, and to provide additional options to, employers and  the trustees of pension schemes to address the funding  challenges facing many schemes.   </p><p>  In their discussions with the deferred members, the Expert Panel explained that the process was an industrial relations process and that responsibility for dealing with the deferred members of the scheme rested with the IASS Trustee through engagement with the employers.  Notwithstanding that strict legal position, the Panel recommended, inter alia, that the IASS Trustee engage with the employers on ways to alleviate as much of the impact of the Trustee proposal as is possible whilst also recognising the overall affordability to the employers of the proposals for active and deferred members.  As a result of that Report, there was an uplift in the monies to be provided by the employers outside of the IASS, a significant proportion of which is intended for the deferred members and which goes a long way towards mitigating the benefit cuts proposed by the IASS Trustee.     </p><p>  The IASS Trustee and the principal employers have recently issued documents in respect of the proposed changes in pension arrangements.  These communications mark the commencement of the formal consultation process which the Trustee is required by the Pensions Act 1990 to undertake in respect of the reductions in benefits that it is proposing.  Each member will also have received by now a personalised illustration of future pension benefits.  All members have been invited to send their views on the proposals to the IASS Trustee by 27 October 2014.  The target date for implementation of the proposals remains 31 December 2014.     </p><p>  Huge efforts have been put in by all concerned over many years in an attempt to resolve the scheme's funding problems.  A set of clear proposals has now been put forward which offer the best chance to resolve the long-standing problems of the scheme and resolve members&rsquo; uncertainties about their future pension entitlements.  I would urge all parties to accept them.  </p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority.</p><p>  It is important to state that the role of Exchequer grants for regional and local roads is to supplement Councils like Kerry County Council in their own resources spending in this area. While Councils could apply in the past for grant funding for certain road improvement projects, budgetary constraints mean that the Specific Improvement Grants Scheme has been curtailed in order to maximise the funding available for repair and strengthening work of the road network.</p></reply>

There is significant EU funding available to assist farmers in meeting the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives. Participation in the Single Farm Payment scheme requires farmers to abide by the statutory requirements relating to Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation &ndash; collectively known as Natura 2000 sites. Additional funding is also provided through the rural development programme. Agri-Environmental schemes such as REPS and AEOS have provided a range of supports, including EU payments in respect of Natura 2000 sites, to tens of thousands of farmers. In future, the provision of EU financial supports for agri-environmental actions by farmers in SACs and SPAs will be made exclusively through the Green, Low carbon Agri-environment Scheme (GLAS), to be operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p>  As detailed in the response to the Deputy in Question No 280 of 18 September, I have convened an Inter-Departmental Steering Group to consider the implication of the Hen Harrier SPA designations in relation to agricultural use, forestry and wind-farm development. This Group has been tasked with drawing up a threat response plan for the Hen Harrier and will deal with various issues of concern to land-owners. </p><p>  The Departments represented on the Steering Group have been asked to nominate relevant stakeholders for inclusion on the Hen Harrier Threat Response Plan Consultative Committee.

The Council is funded by my Department and is statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, and specifically in its funding decisions.  In 2014, the Arts Council received an allocation of over &euro;56.8 million in funding and I have maintained that funding level for the Council in 2015. <br/><br/>The Arts Council supports for a range of arts forms are set out in its strategic overview documents, which are available on the Council's website at <i>.</i>These set out the key strategic principles that inform its funding decisions.  Details of all funding provided by the Arts Council to arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are also available on its website.<br/><br/>The Arts Council&rsquo;s funded organisations contribute hugely to the cultural heritage of Ireland.  The Council supports over 50 multidisciplinary venues (also supported by local authorities), large festivals (such as the Galway, Kilkenny and Earagail Arts Festivals), a significant number of artform specific festivals and up to 150 small-to-medium sized festivals spread all through the country.  <br/><br/>In January 2013, the Arts in Education Charter was launched as a joint initiative with the Minister for Education and Skills. The Charter places new responsibilities on Government Departments, agencies, cultural institutions and arts organisations to provide and promote arts-in-education among children and young people. <br/><br/>A High Level Implementation Group, chaired by Professor John Coolahan, Professor Emeritus, NUI, Maynooth, was set up to oversee the implementation of the Arts in Education Charter.  Progress is being made on a number of initiatives, including increasing the number of Artists in Residence<i></i>in colleges of education and developing a website/portal as a key communications and information channel for both the education and arts sectors. Suitable models for artists to become involved in the programme are also being examined by this Group.<br/><br/>There is a range of ways in which my Department is supporting arts, cultural and heritage initiatives in conjunction with local groups and communities.  These include:<br/><br/>- The St. Patrick's Day celebrations;<br/><br/>- Culture Night;<br/><br/>- Heritage Week;<br/><br/>- Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann for the promotion of the Irish traditional arts;<br/><br/>- Web-based projects being developed by my Department to promote greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's heritage for residents and visitors alike; and<br/><br/>- Funding by my Department to support the work of National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) in developing arts projects in second level schools.<br/><br/>A full list of capital, current and philanthropy payments made in 2013 by my Department is available on its website at . Further details are also available from the Arts Council website and from <i>Culturefox</i>, the free online arts events guide.</p></reply>

Investment by Waterways Ireland in these waterways has made them more attractive for boat owners and is helping to develop them as a vibrant recreational and tourist amenity for all waterway users. Given that background, it is now necessary to update the bye-laws to ensure that the rules governing use of the waterways are fit for purpose and best meet the needs of all waterway users.<br/><br/>I am aware that concerns have been raised regarding aspects of the proposed byelaws. Waterways Ireland undertook a public consultation process in relation to the proposed bye-laws referred to earlier this year. I am advised that the main stakeholders, including the Inland Waterway Association of Ireland, the Heritage Boat Association, the Royal Canal Amenity Group and the Irish Boat Rental Association, were contacted individually and invited to meet with the Chief Executive and the senior management team of Waterways Ireland prior to submitting their views.  The current permit holders on the three waterways, including traditional canal users and canal dwellers, received individual written notice and were given the opportunity to make their views and requirements known. <br/><br/>I understand that over 2,000 submissions were made in the course of the public consultation process.  Waterways Ireland has concluded its analysis of the public consultation and a summary of the consultation process and of the submissions received is available on the Waterways Ireland website at <i>.</i>Waterways Ireland has submitted a revised set of draft by-laws to my Department, which is currently being reviewed. When that process is completed, the matter will be referred to me, as Minister, with recommendations for consideration and final decision.  In line with a commitment given during a debate in Seanad &Eacute;ireann on Wednesday 26 February 2014, I will afford interested Deputies and Senators an opportunity to discuss the proposals with me prior to making a final decision on the draft by-laws.</p></reply>

This has occurred at national level through numerous meetings with representative groups, including detailed discussions at the Peatlands Council, at local level through discussions with public representatives and at the personal level, through direct contact between officials and individual turf-cutters.    The draft National Raised Bog SAC Management Plan and review of raised bog NHAs, published in January with the draft National Peatlands Strategy, set out how these sites are to be managed into the future and how the needs of turf cutters are to be addressed. Both documents have been subject to public consultation and will be finalised in the coming months.</p><p>  The needs of turf-cutters are being addressed through the provision of compensation or through relocation to other nearby non-designated bogs and the vast majority of affected turf-cutters are engaging with my Department. 3,017 applications for compensation under the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme, applicable to raised bog special areas of conservation, have been received by my Department. Of these, 814 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs.  </p><p>  6,116 payments and 610 deliveries of turf have been made in respect of these applications. In addition, 1,373 legal agreements have been returned to my Department and 1,197 once-off incentive payments of &euro;500 have been made in respect of these legal agreements. Total expenditure to date amounts to over &euro;10.9 million since this Government introduced the compensation arrangements for affected turf cutters.</p><p>  Since the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme has been extended this year to raised bog Natural Heritage Areas, 147 applications for compensation in respect of these sites have been received by my Department. Of these, 4 applicants have expressed an interest in relocation to non-designated bogs. 68 payments have been made in respect of the applications received.</p><p>  Progress in relocating turf cutters to non-designated bogs is being achieved in a number of cases and arrangements have been made as regards:</p><p>- Clara Bog in County Offaly, where 25 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on Killeranny Bog; and</p><p>- Carrownagappul Bog and Curraghlehanagh Bog in County Galway, where 23 qualifying turf cutters have been accommodated on the Islands Bog and Killasolan Bog.</p><p>  Potential relocation sites have been identified for each of the remaining raised bog SACs where relocation may be required. However, relocation is a complex process with many issues to be resolved for each individual site.</p><p>  My Department will continue to engage with turf-cutters on these sites to ensure that their needs are addressed and that the future of these valuable ecological resources is secured for the benefit of this and future generations. </p></reply>

The development of a cultural centre at Teach an Phiarsaigh in Ros Muc, Co. Galway, is being progressed by a steering group comprising the various stakeholders, including &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, Galway County Council, the Office of Public Works, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and my own Department.  I consider it very fitting that this project is being advanced as part of the 1916 Commemorations Programme since the development of Teach an Phiarsaigh will bring together the legacy of P&aacute;draig Pearse&rsquo;s contribution to Irish history and education and, in particular, his involvement with the Irish language and the Gaeltacht community.  This development will undoubtedly benefit the area in terms of increased tourism, particularly in terms of cultural tourism and the creation of employment in the area. In addition to being one of the flagship projects of the Commemorations Programme, I am advised that Teach an Phiarsaigh is afforded special recognition in F&aacute;ilte Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way project, Connemara Destination Plan and Connemara Driving Tour and is a key component of the strategy to develop the tourism sector in Connemara. <br/><br/>The digitisation of the National Folklore Collection of Ireland is another project under development.  This project, which is called D&uacute;chas.ie, commenced in 2012 and is the result of a partnership between the National Folklore Collection in UCD, Fiontar in DCU and my own Department.  This Irish folklore repository, some of which is already available online, features pages of handwritten folklore and local history recorded in 1937-38 by Irish schoolchildren as part of the Schools' Collection.  It is intended that a significant part of this Collection, including material from Gaeltacht areas, will be available online for the centenary of the 1916 Rising.<br/><br/>My Department is also providing grant aid to the Royal Irish Academy to facilitate the digitisation and online publication by 2016 of <i>Irisleabhar na Gaedhilge, </i>an Irish language periodical published between 1882 and 1926 with regular contributions from the leaders of the 1916 Rising.</p></reply>
