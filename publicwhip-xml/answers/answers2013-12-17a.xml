    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-17a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121700052#WRA00600"><p>A recently published report, &lsquo;An examination of recommendations from inquiries into events in families and their interactions with State services, and their impact on policy and practice&rsquo; by Dr Helen Buckley &amp;amp; Dr Caroline O&rsquo;Neill of the School of Social Work and Social Policy, at Trinity College Dublin, was commissioned by my Department.  My Department commissioned this study in response to a recommendation from the Implementation Plan for the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (or the Ryan Report as it is more commonly known).</p><p>  The focus of the report is on five inquiries in particular; starting with the Kilkenny Incest Inquiry which was published in 1993.  In commissioning the report, my Department sought to have an overview of the implementation of major recommendations and, in particular, what were the overall considerations that led to service improvements following such inquiries. As the purpose of inquiries is to find out what happened and how we can try to ensure that such events are not repeated, it is important that we reflect on which inquiries or types of inquiries led to the improvements in services we all seek. </p><p>  The recommendations of the various inquiries over more than twenty years were addressed to a range of bodies and departments, some of which no longer exist or have been merged into other bodies.  I am very pleased to see that many inquiry recommendations over this period have acted as a mechanism for positive change. The study provides important insight into how the recommendations of such inquiries can be framed to bring about the desired change and service improvement. The report identifies a need to avoid &ldquo;recommendation fatigue&rdquo; and for reports to provide impetus and support for positive change.  I welcome the proposal that, in future, inquiries should minimise the number of prescriptive recommendations and focus instead on key learning points. I agree with the recommendation that reviewers should remain totally independent in their findings, but a collaborative approach to key recommendations is more likely to improve services and outcomes for children. I believe such an approach is likely to increase the impact and relevance of recommendations and facilitate wider policy and organisational developments to be considered for the purposes of successful implementation.</p><p>  We have also, I believe, learned more about successful implementation of change.  In general, it is the responsibility of each Government Department and the bodies reporting to them to take the appropriate action on foot of any recommendation relevant to its work. For example, where recommendations are proper to my Department, they form part of the process of policy development and inform the strategic and business planning processes. Recommendations must be incorporated into key corporate planning processes if they are to be owned by the organisations involved and continue to be prioritised. </p><p>  There is also a role for oversight in relation to implementation where a range of bodies are involved. The process in respect of the Ryan Report Implementation Plan is a good example of such oversight.  My officials are currently preparing a monitoring framework in respect of all significant child care reports. This involves reviewing current monitoring and reporting mechanisms, with a view to capturing all relevant recommendations thematically, and to ensuring there is appropriate and streamlined progress reporting. The purpose of doing so is to provide for the effective and sustained implementation of recommendations across Departments and agencies while reducing unnecessary reporting burdens. It is neither efficient nor effective to have separate reporting processes for related recommendations from a range of different reports and I believe a more integrated monitoring framework will strengthen accountability.  It is intended that this monitoring framework will be put in place following the completion of the formal monitoring process for the Ryan Commission Implementation Plan. It will provide a basis for incorporating recommendations from any future inquiry into the planning and reporting process across relevant Departments and agencies.</p></reply>

My Department has a funding allocation in 2014 of some &euro;260m per annum which is used to implement a number of childcare programmes.</p><p>  &euro;175m of this funding is committed to providing the free Pre-School Year which benefits approximately 68,000 children each year.  The financial benefit to the parent of a child participating in the free pre-school year is about &euro;2,500.  I have succeeded, despite the challenging budgetary situation, in maintaining the Pre-School Year as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children, who would not otherwise be able to do so, can avail of quality pre-school services.  </p><p>  Some &euro;76.4m in funding is used to implement the Community Childcare Subvention and Childcare Education and Training Support programmes.  These provide subsidised childcare for lower income and disadvantaged families and parents participating in programmes provided by Solas and Education and Training Boards.  About 33,000 children benefit each year. </p><p>  A further &euro;9.5m in funding will be used in 2014 to implement an after school programme, targeted at low-income parents availing of employment opportunities, and a new part-time programme targeted at Community Employment participants.  Some 2,600 children are expected to benefit from these programmes.</p><p>  I am happy to advise the Deputy that my Department will be reviewing the Community Childcare Subvention and Childcare Education and Training Support programmes in the coming year with a view to identifying areas where they could be enhanced and improved to ensure that the best use of this funding  investment is being made.  The recommendations of the Indecon Report will be considered as part of this process.</p><p>  As the Deputy may be aware, pre-school services are subject to the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No 2) Regulations 2006.  Childminders taking care of not more than three pre-school children from different families are currently not subject to the Regulations and therefore are not obliged to notify their services to the HSE.  Childminders not subject to the Regulations are encouraged and incentivised to voluntarily notify their services and to avail of quality training programmes.  There has been a limited response to these incentives and considerable work will need to be done to ensure whatever form of regulation is introduced works for children, parents and for childminders.   My Department will be working to develop a suitable approach in consultation with stakeholders in the sector.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2013-12-17a.19.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2013121700053#WRB00700"><p>My Department places a particular value on evidence - informed policy.  The first ever National Longitudinal Study of Children in Ireland, Growing up in Ireland, is wholly funded and managed by my Department, with support from the Department of Social Protection and the Central Statistics Office.  Findings from Growing Up in Ireland provide us with important evidence on children's lives across  a range of outcomes, including health and diet, behaviour and development, as well as their home environment and the financial circumstance of their families.  This evidence has relevance for a range of issues, across Government departments, and is likely to become increasingly used by Departments to inform future policy.</p><p>  In addition to the research undertaken by my Department, the Department of Social Protection undertakes a range of research and monitoring activities, including monitoring the impact of budgetary measures, which focus on households with children and on child poverty.  Collectively, this research and data provides an important resource for the policy system and departments, to support and inform decision-making.</p><p>  While I welcome the fact that Growing Up in Ireland shows that the  vast majority of Irish children are in good health and display low levels of behavioural difficulties, it also gives evidence of a social gradient in child outcomes relating to levels of social advantage, a gap that begins to emerge in early childhood.  This evidence must be used to inform policy and guide what we do.  Overweight and obesity  have emerged as public health priorities and are being addressed through the Special Action Group established by the Department of Health and the Department of Social Protections' initiative 'Healthy Food for All', which promotes healthy eating and combats  food poverty. </p><p>  In my own Department, the introduction of the new Area Based Childhood (ABC) Programme 2013-2016, which is building on the work of the Prevention and Early Intervention Programme (PEIP), is a further demonstration of the Government's commitment to evidence based interventions for disadvantaged children and young people.  We know that the home environment impacts on a whole range of child outcomes and that parenting plays an important role in mitigating the impact of poverty and disadvantage.  </p><p>  My Department is committed to continuing the Growing Up in Ireland Study, to provide high quality data on a whole range of child outcomes, and arrangements are underway to commission a second phase of the study to ensure that this rich data source is continued and built upon. The  research from Growing Up in Ireland and other sources has been carefully utilised to inform the development of the National Children and Youth People's Policy Framework. Finalisation of this framework by my Department, in association with other Departments across Government, is at an advanced stage and it will inform the development of future policies and services to promote improved outcomes, with a particular focus on groups of children whose outcomes are currently poorest.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country. In 2013, &euro;53.498m has been made available for services for young people. </p><p>  Young people benefit hugely from participation in youth work services.  There is a growing body of research evidence which highlights how engagement in quality programmes helps young people to acquire important life skills such as confidence, problem solving, resilience and the ability to develop and maintain positive relationships and how it can enhance young people&rsquo;s competences for communication, leadership and innovation and their employability.   </p><p>  I, and officials of my Department have met, and continue to meet with many youth organisations and groups to see how we can work together to bring about the best possible outcomes for young people having regard to resources available to us and to ensure that the programmes and services being provided are relevant and responsive to young people&rsquo;s needs.</p><p> In keeping with my Department&rsquo;s responsibilities for children and young people, my Department is developing a new strategy for children and young people.  This new five-year Children and Young People&rsquo;s Policy Framework is being developed in a holistic way which will comprehend the continuum of the life-course from infancy through to early and middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.  This overarching Framework will provide the basis for more detailed strategies including a new youth policy strategy. </p><p>  The youth work organisations have a significant contribution to make to the development of the new youth policy strategy. Their experience and knowledge of the challenges that young people face will be important to the new shaping of the new strategy so that it is responsive to young peoples needs. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee, appointed by me in January 2013 and which includes representatives of the national youth organisations as well as Government departments, the Education and Training Boards and other statutory agencies involved in youth matters, is undertaking the preparatory work for the new youth policy strategy. I work closely with the Committee on issues to do with how youth work practice and services can advance key desired outcomes for young people&rsquo;s wellbeing.  It is planned that the youth policy strategy will be substantially progressed for completion in 2014. </p></reply>

I have been contacted by four sets of prospective adopters who were affected by this change and who sought my assistance in this regard. Since this situation arose in July 2013 I have undertaken diplomatic and political efforts to resolve the situation. </p><p>  However it is obvious to me that in order that these adoptions, which were stopped by this change in Russian law, could continue an amendment to the Adoption Act, 2010, would be necessary to extend the validity of the declarations of eligibility and suitability. As the Adoption Act, 2010, is drafted on the basis of the incorporation of the Hague Convention, and the minimum set of standards outlined therein, the implications of amending the Act had to be carefully examined before the Government is in a position to consider any proposed amendment of the legislation.  My Department has worked with the Office of the Attorney General to produce amending legislation that resolves the situation within the parameters of Irish law and our obligations under the Hague Convention.  The legislation proposes an amendment to the Adoption Act to extend the period of eligibility and suitability to allow those affected by the change in Russian legislation further time to complete their adoptions, </p><p>  Earlier today I sought the approval of the Government for the publication and presentation to Dail &Eacute;ireann on Thursday 19th December 2013 of the text of the Adoption (Amendment) Bill, 2013, in order to address the small number of cases affected by the change in Russian adoption legislation. I have received very strong requests from across the House to bring forward such a proposal and I hope the necessary amendment will receive the support of my opposition colleagues.</p></reply>

This will be achieved in two major steps.  The first one has already been achieved in that I signed the required Ministerial orders during 2012 under the Children Act 2001 which ended the practice of detaining 16 year old boys in St Patrick's Institution.  The second step will be the ending of the practice of detaining 17 year old  boys in the adult prison system.  This will be achieved by the completion of the National Children Detention Facility project in Oberstown.  A main contractor and a number of sub-contractors have now been appointed to this project and construction of the new facilities started on site on 23 September 2013.  On 14 October 2013 I officially launched the construction project with the event taking place on the campus in Oberstown.</p><p>  The timeline for the project will see the first three new residential units available in the third quarter of 2014, which will be used to facilitate the transfer of responsibility for 17 year old boys from the adult prison system to the Oberstown campus.    </p><p>  In additional to the capital project, my Department and I are overseeing a further programme of reforms aimed at enhancing the effective management and capacity of services on the Oberstown campus in advance of, and to support, the expanded facilities to be provided. A recruitment process has recently resulted in the appointment, with effect from 2 December 2013, of Mr Pat Bergin as Campus Manager for the Oberstown site, who will report to the Board of Management.   I see this appointment as a crucial element of the reform of the children detention service.   </p><p>  In addition, early next year I will be presenting a set of amendments of the Children Act 2001 to the Oireachtas which will provide a mechanism for the merging of the three existing Children Detention Schools into a single legal entity.  These governance reforms will complement the on-going work over recent years to develop integrated care policies and shared services across the Oberstown campus.</p><p>  I wish to further advise that a care staff recruitment programme has been sanctioned by Government and will shortly be commenced in conjunction with the Public Appointments Service, with the aim of deploying the new staff in Oberstown for orientation and training on a staged basis from early 2014.  </p><p>  In order to ensure a safe and stable transition to the new children detention school campus during 2014, a comprehensive business planning process has  commenced for the delivery of services for all children under 18 in Oberstown.   </p><p>  In line with an agreement made at the Labour Relations Commission earlier this year, agreement was reached with staff representatives on the appointment of a third party arbitrator who is currently overseeing a joint staff / management review of the operation of the campus staffing roster in Oberstown which was implemented in February 2013.   This review is ongoing and it is my intention that the review will be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>  Significant change and development is underway on the Oberstown Campus and arrangements for ongoing staff engagement and support is an important element of this change programme which is being overseen by the Board of management and the recently appointed Campus Manager.</p></reply>

In the main, these are the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) but they also include other bodies such as the HSE, some local authorities and, up to recently, some of the larger national youth organisations. </p><p>  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin ETB, is one such body which distributes allocations to youth projects. The CDYSB, on behalf of CDETB, has for several years, undertaken the administration of approximately 70 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.   </p><p>  In January 2013, in an effort to streamline the tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding,  the administration tasks, formerly carried out by  six national organisations were transferred to CDYSB.  The six organisations are Youth Work Ireland, Crosscare, For&oacute;ige, Involve, YMCA and ECO-UNESCO</p><p>  It is anticipated that, over time, the successful streamlining of the administration of the funding for the youth projects will deliver benefits in terms of saving on the administration costs incurred under the present arrangements and efficiencies for both the Department and projects themselves. </p><p>  In recent years, the number of bodies holding funding administration status from my Department has reduced from approximately 40 to some 30 at the start of 2013.

The existing arrangements for those seeking access to information reflect a transition from complex and historical situations and I am anxious that the HSE implement much more improved and consistent arrangements. It is also necessary to acknowledge that the legal and Constitutional framework within which such access operates is complex, reflecting a it does the balancing rights to privacy of the mother or a child who may not wish for contact to be re- established or personal information exchanged.    The HSE provides an Information and Tracing Service throughout the country to birth mothers, adopted persons and their families. The Adoption Act 2010, requirement that agencies providing Information and Tracing services would gain accreditation resulted in a number of religious orders deciding not to apply for accreditation and transferring files from their Mother and Baby Homes and Adoption Societies to the HSE. Approximately 25,000 files have been transferred to the HSE Regional Adoption Service in Cork, from the Sacred Heart Adoption Society.   Work by the HSE on the organising and storage of these files has taken place.  The HSE has sought the advice of the National Archives in relation to the proper storage of these files that are of great significance. The HSE has also received records from other agencies.  A comprehensive list of records held, and their locations,  is available on the HSE website.</p><p>  The HSE Information and Tracing Service recognises the importance attached to this area of service provision and is working to provide a more streamlined  service and to ensure that enquiries in regard to information and tracing are handled as quickly as possible. The HSE has advised me that, in the first instance, any person seeking information on adoption, or an illegal registration of a birth, should contact the Adoption Authority of Ireland  or the HSE Community Services who will assist in directing them to the personnel dealing with their particular records.  </p><p>  The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences. The Authority, the Health Service Executive and accredited adoption services routinely inform enquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up.  I am conscious of recent media coverage of the issue of information and tracing and I would hope that this will encourage more birth mothers in particular to access the  Contact Preference Register and where possible to consent to the release of information.   </p><p>  Work is continuing  in relation to the preparation of the Heads of Bill of the Adoption (Information and Tracing) Bill.  I am anxious to bring the Heads of bill before Government at the earliest possible date. The Constitutional and legal context within which the development of these legislative proposals must be undertaken is complex. Certain legal and policy questions are currently being finalised and I expect to shortly submit a General Scheme and Heads of Bill to Government. The proposals will have to address the Constitutional and legal position with regard to any retrospective application of legislation, particularly as it relates to the right to privacy and the necessity to obtain consent for the release of personal information. I have agreed with the Oireachtas Health and Children Committee that once agreed by Government, the Heads of Bill  will be the subject of Committee hearings so that the complex and sensitive issues involved can be the subject of public consideration.</p></reply>

They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland has responsibility for the operation of the Contact Preference Register. The Authority has stated that there are currently in the region of 7500 adopted persons and 3400 relatives registered and there have been 660 matches to date. Each "match" involves an adopted person and at least one natural relative; therefore, based on these figures the result is around 9% of adopted applicants and just under 20% of natural relatives have been matched. The Authority advises that this would be comparable with the 10-15% success rates reported in similar registers in other jurisdictions.</p><p>  The Authority, the Health Service Executive and accredited adoption services routinely inform enquirers about the existence of the register and encourage anyone interested in tracing or gaining information to sign up.

This report outlines common themes found by HIQA inspectors when inspecting  these services and provides a valuable overview of the ongoing work required to bring children and family services to a standard of quality care and practice. It recognises the improvements made to date and that many children in residential care and foster care receive a good standard of quality care. </p><p>  The report  highlights the fact that while many residential centres have appropriately qualified staff who are committed and dedicated with interventions that led to positive outcomes for children in their care, the system still faces many challenges and further improvements are required. In relation to foster care the report found that foster carers provided good quality care to children and young people.  While it noted there were few young people waiting for a foster care placement, there were some difficulties accessing appropriate placements for children with complex needs and in a child's local area..There were no negative findings in relation to hygiene and cleanliness standards in residential care or foster care.  </p><p>  I, with my officials have  regular ongoing discussions HSE and HIQA to address inter alia issues arising from inspections of services and to ensure that measures are put in place to improve services as necessary  and  that learnings from these inspections are widely disseminated across the services.

These were: the Kilkenny Incest Inquiry; Kelly Fitzgerald report; West of Ireland Farmer Case; the Monageer Inquiry and Roscommon Child Abuse Case. The objective was to determine the degree to which inquiry recommendations were implemented and to assess their impact in the context of policy initiatives and reforms. </p><p>  While I am pleased to see that many inquiry recommendations have acted as a mechanism for positive change, I am concerned that the findings of this study have also revealed a type of &lsquo;recommendation fatigue&rsquo;. It is important to note that this research report does provide clear advice, based on international best practice, on how to approach future reports. A key message is that future inquiries should take a fresh approach in order to minimise the number of prescriptive recommendations. The report recommends that the focus of inquiries should be on key learning points which may be disseminated within and across organisations.  Specifically, it proposes that recommendations should be drafted in a forward looking phase of an inquiry process, as distinct from the fact finding backward looking initial phase of an inquiry, and that they should be developed based on a collaborative approach with those who will be responsible for their implementation. The report also recommends that inquiries should ensure that the recommendations are informed by all relevant sources of information, knowledge and expertise. They should be framed in a way that illustrates the rationale for change, promotes learning, cites evidence, identifies the organisation or sector responsible for their implementation, and outlines them in such a way that progress in their application will be easy to evaluate.   </p><p>  In general, it is a matter for individual Departments to take the appropriate action on any recommendation relevant to its work. Where recommendations are proper to my Department, they form part of the process of policy development and, if appropriate, inform the usual business planning processes. As regards the higher level oversight of recommendations, my officials are currently preparing a monitoring framework in respect of all significant child care reports. This involves reviewing current monitoring and reporting mechanisms, with a view to capturing all relevant recommendations thematically, and to streamline progress reporting. The purpose in doing do is to provide for the effective and sustained implementation of recommendations across Departments and Agencies, and to reduce the reporting burden on Departments and the HSE. It is intended that the monitoring framework will be put in place following the completion of the formal monitoring process for the Ryan Commission Implementation Plan. </p></reply>

Placements are planned and provided on the basis of the individual needs of each child.  Where possible children are placed within their own extended family network and within their own community.  Currently 92% of children are in the care of the HSE are placed in foster care which is a very positive aspect of HSE care service provision and very high by international standards.</p><p>  In a very small number of circumstances it is necessary to provide placements in other countries in order to meet the individual needs of some children.  In some circumstances it will be necessary to facilitate a foster care placement within the context of the child's extended family or family network.  There are also cases in which the foster family is moving abroad and it is in the best interests of the child to remain with the foster family.  There are also a number of circumstances in which children in the care of the HSE may be placed outside the jurisdiction with specialised therapeutic inputs from child psychiatry and psychology.  All such placements abroad are made with the permission of the Courts.  Placements in Special Care, whether in Ireland or abroad only occur in extreme circumstances and under the jurisdiction of the High Court.</p><p>  The need to provide Special Care placements outside the jurisdiction into the future cannot be avoided in a very small number of cases in order to ensure the best interests of some children with specialised additional needs.  The referral of children abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual.  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.  The level of requirement of these services for children is closely monitored by the National Director of Children and Family Services.  Currently there are 17 children in placement in Special Care in HSE Units and 10 in placement outside the jurisdiction under the jurisdiction of the High Court.  </p><p>  Assessment, Consultation and Therapeutic Service (ACTS) is a new national specialised clinical service which is being developed by the HSE Children and Family Services in order to provide multidisciplinary consultation, assessment and focused interventions to young people who have high risk behaviours associated with complex clinical needs.  These therapeutic inputs will be provided in a flexible, timely and responsive manner with a focus on improving outcomes for young people and their families.  ACTS also supports other professionals in their ongoing work with young people and their families.  This includes on-site therapeutic services to the national high support unit and special care units and the children detention centres.  Assessment, consultation and focused intervention services for children at risk in the community of placement in high support, special care or detention is also a function of the ACTs team.</p><p>  ACTS is a multidisciplinary service which includes psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, counselling and social care.  It is supported by contractual sessions from child and forensic psychiatry.  ACTS is led by a management team consisting of the national manager and three heads of discipline whose central responsibility is the implementation of systems of clinical governance to support the best outcomes for children with particular needs.  This is done through effective planning, implementation and evaluation of treatment programmes and protocol driven interventions.  It also involves the provision of high quality clinical supervision and monitoring of professional development needs of staff.  It is based in Dublin with regional clinics in Cork and Limerick.</p><p>  The HSE is currently implementing a capital development programme for Special Care services in order to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to meet the needs of children requiring this specialised type of care.  The first phase of the programme is underway with improvements to facilities in Dublin completed and the extensive refurbishment of the unit in Limerick complete.  Planning is well underway for phase 2 of the programme which will include a significant expansion of the capacity of the service in 2014/2015.</p></reply>

This is why my Department and I have been progressing work on Ireland&rsquo;s first-ever Early Years Strategy, and working on a comprehensive Pre-School Quality Agenda which aims to improve quality standards in pre-school services in Ireland.</p><p>  Since the broadcast of the Prime Time programme, significant progress has been made in the eight areas which I identified as requiring urgent reform, and legislation to underpin these reforms has now been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The legislation allows for:</p><p>  -  regulations for early years services to prescribe minimum levels of qualifications for persons working in early years services.  As a result, I will be introducing a minimum qualification of FETAC Level 5 for all staff working with children in pre-school services;</p><p>  -  the introduction of a new registration system for all early years services which will require persons wishing to open a new pre-school service to register with the Pre-School Inspectorate in advance of being permitted to operate.  The service design and suitability for purpose will be examined at this stage and a follow-on inspection after the service has opened will examine its care and welfare practices; and</p><p>  -  increased penalties for persons convicted of regulatory breaches, including a Class A fine (i.e. up to &euro;5,000).  In addition, Pre-School Inspectors will have the option to remove a service provider from the pre-school register or attach conditions to a provider&rsquo;s registration.  Protocols will be developed in conjunction with the new Child and Family Agency as to how the various levels of regulatory non-compliance will be reported.</p><p>  The introduction in 2014 of new regulations for early years services, to give effect to the legislative provisions, will also include the introduction of new National Quality Standards which will replace the existing explanatory guidelines with a new outcomes approach and supporting criteria; against which the quality of childcare services will be measured.</p><p>  The successful implementation of the S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks on a national level requires childcare practitioners to have a thorough understanding of quality early years provision.  In 2014, I will be establishing a new National Quality Support Service for pre-school services which will work directly with childcare services to improve the quality of pre-school care and education.</p><p>  In preparing for the establishment of the Child and Family Agency, the Children and Families Services Division of the HSE has worked to address the need for a more coherent national approach to the regulation of early years services and the development of the Pre-School Inspectorate as a nationally co-ordinated service.  Standard Operating Procedures have been introduced to address inconsistencies and provide clarity and transparency to early years services.</p><p>In July of this year, the Pre-School Inspectorate commenced the publication of retrospective pre-school inspection reports online, and this process is continuing.  All new inspection reports completed from 1st   July are also being published online.  Pobal is hosting the publication of the pre-school inspection reports, and they are available on the Pobal website.  </p></reply>

The funding is provided by means of capitation payments </p><p>  The CCS programme is confined to community not for profit childcare services and the funding provided must be used by the services to reduce the weekly fees charged to disadvantaged or low income families.   Parents are required to meet the balance of the economic cost of the service provided, which can vary from service to service..  The economic cost would be expected to include an appropriate level of re-investment costs.   Where a community service consistently hold a significant level of surplus funds at the end of each year, it would be expected to give consideration to reducing its fee structure.   </p><p>  The CETS and After-school programmes are provided by both community and commercial services and the funding provided must be used by the services to reduce the weekly fees charged to qualifying parents.  The fee contributions which parents are required to make towards the childcare fees are capped with the income difference between the subsidy paid by my Department and the fee charged by the service being a matter for the service.</p><p>  The ECCE programme is also provided by both community and commercial services and the funding provided is expected to cover the full cost of the service.  As is the case with the CETS and After-school programmes,  any income difference between the capitation paid by my Department and the cost to the service of providing the free Pre-School Year, is a matter for the service. </p></reply>

The work of this Group has concluded, and their comprehensive report, &lsquo;Right from the Start&rsquo;, was launched recently.</p><p>  The report comprises 10 themes which the Group consider critical for the Early Years Strategy, with core recommendations presented under each theme.  The 10 themes are:</p><p>  -  Economic rationale for increased investment</p><p>  -  Supporting families</p><p>  -  Health and well-being</p><p>  -  Access to services and inclusion</p><p>  -  Quality in services and supports</p><p>  -  Training and professional development</p><p>  -  Regulation and support</p><p>  -  Governance</p><p>  -  Information, research and data</p><p>  -  Implementation</p><p>  A wide range of recommendations is set out in the report for consideration, covering issues that affect Ireland&rsquo;s youngest children and their families, including early childhood health, support for parents, and ensuring quality in early years provision.</p><p>  The recommendations in the report are being considered within my Department.

The<font color="#2F2F2F"> factors associated with overweight and obesity in Irish children are complex, and research suggests that a multidimensional approach which crosses Government departments and agencies and involves children and families and community organisations working with statutory and voluntary sector, is needed. </font></p><p>  &ldquo;Obesity - the policy challenges: The report of the National Taskforce on Obesity&rdquo;, was published by the department of Health in 2005 and remains the guiding document for work in this area. My colleague the Minister of Health, has established a Special Advisory Group on Obesity to advise on implementation of the report and this group has representation from my own Department. In November of this year, the Minister of health and myself launched the first phase of a three year media campaign on preventing childhood obesity developed by both our Departments working with Safe Food and the HSE. The media campaign is complemented by a website, social media interventions and printed resources for parents and professionals. The thrust of the campaign is based on providing parents with practical tips in addressing the problem.  Other work of the group includes technical support for providing calorie content information for small restaurant / coffee shop owners, to facilitate young people in making healthy choices.</p><p>  I recently launched the Area Based Childhood (ABC) programme 2013-2016, a &euro;29.7m programme which is being co-funded by my Department and the Atlantic Philanthropies, to improve outcomes for children in some of our most disadvantaged areas. Some of the initiatives are encompassing empowering healthy choices for children and families, in relation to diet and exercise, as part of a holistic approach to improving children&rsquo;s lives.  Research has shown that parents often underestimate the weight of their children, and a new pilot project has been initiated by the HSE to enhance the measurement of school children to provide parents with accurate information on their children&rsquo;s weight, which will compliment the work done at an earlier stage by Public Health Nurses in baby clinics and developmental checks.  </p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">It is widely accepted by researchers that there is a strong link between physical activity and overweight, and habits formed in youth tend to carry over into adulthood. The Growing Up in Ireland Study also clearly confirms this finding. Young people who took more exercise were less likely to be </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">overweight </font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">or </font><i><font color="#2F2F2F">obese</font></i><font color="#2F2F2F">, especially in comparison to those who never exercised.  </font>As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs I have responsibility for Play and Recreation Policy which have been  set out in &lsquo;<font color="#2F2F2F">READY, STEADY, PLAY!

Significant investment, totalling more than &euro;260m, is being provided this year by my Department to support childcare programmes.  These include the Free Pre-School Year, from which approximately 68,000 children benefit annually.  The financial benefit to the parent of a child participating in the free pre-school year is about &euro;2,500.  I have succeeded, despite the challenging budgetary situation, in maintaining the Pre-School Year as a universal and free programme, ensuring that a significant number of children can avail of quality pre-school services who would not otherwise be in a position to do so.  </p><p>  The Community Childcare Subvention programme, which provides targeted benefit primarily to lower income and disadvantaged families, is also accessible to parents who have relatively average incomes on the basis of their entitlement to hold a GP visit card.  About 25,000 children each year benefit from this programme.</p><p>  Funding is also provided by my Department to support the Childhood Education and Training Support programme which targets funding to support parents seeking to return to the workforce who are participating in Solas or Education and Training Boards education and training programmes.  About 2,500 childcare places are provided each year under this initiative.</p><p>  The School Age Childcare Initiative, which is a joint initiative between my Department and the Department of Social Protection, is also targeted at low-income parents availing of employment opportunities.  The uptake of this programme during the first two pilot phases of the initiative has been low, and the eligibility criteria are being examined by the Department of Social Protection in the context of the third pilot phase.   It is proposed to augment this programme in 2014 with a new strand for certain community employment participants.</p><p>  I was recently asked to launch the Indecon Report on Support for Childcare for Working Families and Implications for Employment.  This report, which was commissioned by Donegal County Council, sets out to address the issue of affordability and access to childcare supports, and a particular focus of the report is an independent examination of whether the cost of childcare represents a barrier to labour force participation, and an examination of potential policy options to address any childcare obstacles which may exist.</p><p>  The Report does offer policy options which could be considered as part of any review of the current supports.  I am aware that childcare costs in this country are high, and would like to expand and enhance the existing childcare support programmes to help address this issue when funding to meet the additional costs becomes available.  However, my emphasis at present is on improving the quality of the services currently provided, and the challenge for the Department is to ensure that the maximum number of children can avail of quality supports within the available resources.</p></reply>

The issue of a passport is, therefore, the culmination of an important and legally-binding process.  The checks and balances within the passport process embrace the standard principles that are provided for in the Act and help to ensure that the identity of the applicant is known and that the person in question is an Irish citizen.  This serves to maintain the worldwide good reputation and integrity of the Irish passport, which, in turn, ensures the safe travel and well-being of Irish citizens, as they travel abroad.  Moreover, it helps to combat passport and identity fraud.The Act underpins a long-standing passport policy in regard to the use of verifiable civil documents such civil birth certificates for first-time applicants.  These documents confirm the details of a person&rsquo;s birth name, date and place of birth, all of which are critical components of a person&rsquo;s identity.     The Passport Service received an application from the person in question on 12 March, 2013.  It could not be finalised because the person concerned did not provide their civil birth certificate or passport from country of birth.  The Passport Service has been in correspondence with the applicant in this regard and, to help the applicant, has recently asked the Irish Embassy in Vietnam to assist in the verification of the individual&rsquo;s identity.</p></reply>

The decentralisation to Limerick of the Development Cooperation Division of the Department was formally completed in late 2008 and the majority of the officers assigned to the Division, which manages the aid programme, Irish Aid, are based there. The Development Cooperation Division also has responsibility for our overall political and trade promotion relations with sub-Saharan Africa and a number of countries in Asia where we have an aid programme.  The Passport Office in Cork city is part of the Passport Service of Ireland. It has a public office and also accepts passport express applications from nine counties.

To deliver significant savings on travel costs, video-conferencing facilities are available at all offices of the Department. Video-conferencing among the Department&rsquo;s offices in Cork (Passport Office) and Limerick (Irish Aid) and its offices in Dublin takes place on a daily basis. Over the past twelve months there have been over 640 video conferences between these offices and Dublin.  </p><p>The table below details the annual cost incurred in 2012 and 2013 by staff travelling from Limerick and Cork to meetings in Dublin and the number of travel claims made in each of those years.

I have maintained contact, both directly and through our Embassy in Washington, with many key players in Congress including Republican Congressman Paul Ryan, Chair of the House Budgetary Committee and former Vice-Presidential nominee; Republican Congressman Bob Goodlatte, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee; leading Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressmen Mark Amodei, Spencer Bachus and Doug Collins; Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi;  Chair of the Congressional Friends of Ireland, Pete King; with House Speaker John Boehner and his staff and with the office of House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy.  I have also maintained contact with key figures in the US Administration and with Irish-American community representatives.    I have reiterated throughout all these contacts the Government&rsquo;s interest in all aspects of immigration reform and in particular our interest in seeing an overall agreement reached which provides relief for currently undocumented Irish migrants and a facility for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US.  </p><p>  In this context, we very much welcomed the US Senate&rsquo;s approval of the Border Security, Economic Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Bill by a 68-32 margin on 27 June last.    </p><p>  The comprehensive draft legislation, which was prepared over several months by a bi-partisan group of eight US Senators, provides for extensive reform of the US immigration system. It includes provisions that would legalise the status of undocumented Irish people and provide a path to permanent residency.  It also provides for future flows of legal migration between Ireland and the US via the proposed E-3 visa.   The focus has since shifted to the House of Representatives for its consideration of the issues and a key factor here remains convincing the Republican House Majority of the importance of making progress.     It remains to be seen whether a consolidated Bill can be agreed between the Senate and the House of Representatives.   It is generally accepted that securing overall agreement will be a complex and challenging process, particularly at a time when Congress has been preoccupied by budgetary and debt issues.    This was clear from my most recent contacts and I believe the challenge to secure agreement has become even greater in recent times.   I am determined to continue to deploy all necessary resources at political, diplomatic and Irish community level to make progress on this vital issue.   In support of this ongoing effort, a delegation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade visited Washington DC in October last for a programme arranged by our Embassy during which they met with key members of Congress and with Irish-American community representatives.    </p><p>  I wrote to US House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner on 12 December, reiterating our position and underlining our continuing strong interest in the prospect of reform of the US immigration system. I expressed the hope that the House will engage further in these issues in early 2014 leading to a positive legislative outcome.  </p><p>  The Embassy in Washington continues our intensive follow-up work with all of our contacts on Capitol Hill and particularly with the Republican House leadership.   It also continues to coordinate our lobbying efforts with our Irish-American community representatives.   I wish to acknowledge the critically important role being played by these community organisations, including the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform and the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform.</p></reply>

To try to answer the questions posed, it is necessary to make assumptions about how the individuals concerned managed, in the period prior to retirement, any possible exposure to chargeable excess tax.  Given the size of the assumed benefits, it is reasonable to take the view that each individual would have sought a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) in 2010, when the SFT was reduced from &euro;5.4m to &euro;2.3m.  This would have allowed them to "grandfather" the pension rights they had built up at that point in time and thus protect them from chargeable excess tax on the PFT amounts.    </p><p>  By way of illustrating this point, take the details in the question relating to the public servant retiring on 1 January 2014 on a defined benefit (DB) pension of &euro;120,000 and a separately accrued lump sum of &euro;200,000 (as per the example - even though the lump sum would, in fact, be three times the pension i.e. &euro;360,000, under normal public service pension scheme arrangements).  Assuming that he or she was retiring after a full 40 year career, then that individual would have had an accrued annual pension and lump sum entitlement on 7 December 2010 (the previous opportunity for claiming a PFT) of some &euro;111,000 and &euro;185,000 respectively (assuming say 37 years service at that time).  The capital value of those pension rights would, therefore, have been around &euro;2.4m, and as this exceeded the then SFT of &euro;2.3m applying from 7 December 2010, the individual would have claimed a PFT from Revenue which would have fully protected the individual from chargeable excess tax on that amount at the point of retirement.  Thus, assuming the individual acted rationally and sought a PFT of &euro;2.4m, the chargeable excess would be &euro;200,000 and the chargeable excess tax would be &euro;82,000. </p><p>  In the same way, the private sector DB scheme member, again on the assumption that he or she was retiring after a full 40 year career, would have accrued a pre-commutation annual pension of some &euro;129,500 at 7 December 2010, with a capital value of &euro;2.590m at that date (i.e. &euro;129,500 x 20) which he or she could have protected with a PFT.  In this instance, on the face of it (but subject to the comments made later), the chargeable excess would be &euro;210,000 and the chargeable excess tax would be &euro;86,100.</p><p>  It is also necessary to assume that the private sector defined contribution (DC) scheme member would have sought a PFT. For illustrative purposes, assume that this individual&rsquo;s fund was built up steadily over a forty year career, meaning that on 7 December 2010, the fund was worth somewhere in the region of &euro;4.6m.  As the capital value of the fund was above the then SFT of &euro;2.3m and did not exceed the old SFT of &euro;5.4m, the individual could have sought a PFT for the full amount of the fund i.e. &euro;4.6m.  (In practice, of course, the value of the DC fund at that time could have been greater or lesser than this amount).  On these assumptions (again subject to the comments below) the chargeable excess would be of the order of &euro;400,000 and the chargeable excess tax would be some &euro;164,000.</p><p>  However, the scenarios illustrated in the question are unlikely to arise in practice, in the case of both the private sector DB and DC fund members, because the purpose of the SFT regime is to restrict the excessive build up of pension savings through tax relieved sources.  It achieves this by imposing penal tax charges on the value of retirement benefits above set limits (i.e. the SFT or PFT) when they are drawn down, thus discouraging the building up of large pension funds in the first place.  All the indications are that the pension funds of highly paid private sector individuals are being actively managed in this way, with a view to avoiding a chargeable excess and the penal tax charges that go with it.  Any individual in the private sector at risk of incurring a liability to chargeable excess tax is highly likely to act rationally and stop accruing pension benefits or stop making pension contributions and negotiate alternative immediate taxable compensation with their employer instead.  All of the evidence suggests that this is what has been happening and is likely to continue to happen. </p><p>  The position in the public service is different.  Public servants cannot avoid the penal tax charge as they have no means of ceasing to accrue benefits under their schemes in order to prevent a breach of the SFT or their PFT, if they have one. </p><p>  It was for that reason that I introduced in Finance Act 2012 a more flexible reimbursement option for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax and extended it in Finance (No.2) Bill 2013.  I should stress that these reimbursement options do not remove or reduce the tax liability arising on a chargeable excess but provide more flexible options for the recovery of the tax liability by the pension scheme administrator.  These options involve effectively spreading the recovery of the tax, paid up front by the public service pension administrator, over a longer period.  It is the case, however, that, in the event of the death of a public servant before full recovery of the tax, any outstanding amount effectively &quot;dies&quot; with the individual but, in such cases, of course, the Exchequer benefits by not having to pay out the member's pension in the future. </p><p>  As regards private sector DB schemes, in the event that a significant chargeable excess tax bill were to arise, the scheme administrator would also have to pay the tax over to Revenue up-front.  In that regard, the legislation is not prescriptive as to how recovery of chargeable excess tax so paid by a private sector pension fund administrator is to be accomplished, other than requiring the individual's rights under the pension arrangement to be reduced to fully reflect the tax so paid or for the individual to reimburse the administrator directly.  If recovery from the scheme member is by way of an actuarial reduction in the pension payable to the member, then it would appear that the recovery would cease on the death of the member.  While the issue of the recovery of chargeable excess tax by private sector DB pension fund administrators has never been raised as a serious issue with my Department (because chargeable excess tax should, generally, not arise in the first place), I would say that if it should transpire that the means of recovery of chargeable excess tax in private sector DB schemes emerges as a problem for members, then I will consider any practical solutions that might be suggested. </p><p>  In the case of private sector DC schemes, the issue of recovery of chargeable excess tax paid by the administrator does not arise, as it would simply have been paid directly from the individual's pension fund.  On that point, while the example in the Question has the private sector DC member purchasing an annuity with his or her pension fund at retirement, it is highly unlikely that this would, in fact, be the case.  This is because, in contrast to individuals in DB schemes, whether private or public service, the DC individual has the option to invest his pension fund, after taking the retirement lump sum, into an Approved Retirement Fund.  He or she thus benefits from being able to retain his or her remaining pension fund capital &quot;intact&quot; after death for the benefit of his or her spouse and children through the Approved Retirement Fund facility. </p><p>  The other important point that the question illustrates is the major criticism levelled at the existing SFT regime.  This is that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 currently used for converting defined benefit pension rights to a capital sum equivalent is inequitable relative to defined contribution pension arrangements, given the higher market annuity rates that those with defined contribution arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities.  I have made changes in the Finance Bill by way of moving, after 1 January 2014, to higher age-related valuation factors that vary according to the individual's age at the point the benefits are drawn down.  These changes will, for the future, substantially improve the equity between defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life.</p></reply>

For the year 2014, the liability date is 1 November.     </p><p>  LPT liability crystallises on the sale of a residential property and must be paid in full either in advance of the sale or must be deducted from the proceeds of the sale.  This includes any LPT that has been deferred by the liable person.  Where a liable person sells their residential property between 2 November and 31 December 2013, provided that they owned the property on 1 November 2013, they will be liable to pay LPT on that property for 2014 and the tax must be paid in full at the time of the sale.  This is in accordance with section 126 of the Act.</p><p>  For a tax such as LPT to function properly, legislation must specify a liability date for the tax to have application for a particular year.  Whatever date is prescribed, the question of liability when there is a change of ownership has to be managed, and I expect the LPT liability is likely to be factored in during negotiations between the parties on the sale price and the closing date of a particular contract.  Furthermore, an individual selling a property will often be purchasing another property at around the same time.  While a vendor who owns a property on 1 November 2013 is liable for the 2014 LPT on that property, if s/he does not purchase another property before 1 November 2013 s/he will not be liable for the 2014 LPT on that &quot;replacement&quot; property - whoever is the owner as of 1 November 2013 will be liable.</p><p>  As there are a number of LPT issues to be considered when buying or selling a house, I am advised that detailed guidance on LPT issues arising in the context of the sale or transfer of a residential property was prepared by the Revenue Commissioners in consultation with the Law Society and is available since last August on the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF"></font></i> and on the Law Society's website.</p><p>  The liability date of 1 November in the preceding year and the obligation on the property owner on that date to pay any outstanding LPT on the sale of a property have been approved by the Oireachtas in passing the LPT legislation and I have no plans to change the law in either respect. </p></reply>

I will however, introduce an additional levy on pension funds at 0.15% to, among other things, continue to help fund the <i>Jobs Initiative</i>.  The additional levy, within the existing legal framework, will apply to pension fund assets in 2014 and 2015.  The impact of the <i>Jobs Initiative</i> can be seen by the increase in employment levels, particularly in the accommodation and food services sector.  The <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  included the reduction of VAT on tourism services to 9% from 13.5% on a temporary basis until the end of 2013.  This measure has proved to be a major success, helping create over 15,000 new jobs as well as protecting existing jobs.  It was due to end this year.  However, it is important that we reinforce success when possible, so I have decided to continue this reduced rate.  This will support the increased number of jobs already in place and accelerate the creation of new jobs.</p><p>  The Deputy will be aware that I announced the reduction of the Air Travel Tax to zero with effect from 1st April 2014.  The decision to remove the tax, together with the retention of the 9% VAT rate for tourism services, will help maintain the momentum created by the success of The Gathering this year.  Since the Budget announcement, airlines have announced the opening up of new routes resulting in a significant increase in passenger numbers with the associated increase in tourism activity and employment.</p><p>  The <i>Jobs Initiative</i>  also included a number of current and capital expenditure measures, including a number aimed at retraining the workforce.  I would ask the Deputy to note that my colleague the Minister for Social Protection, Joan Burton T.D., with responsibility for JobBridge, the National Internship scheme, recently announced that the number of internships, originally planned at 5,000 has now exceeded 20,000.  Indecon Economic Consultants undertook an evaluation of the JobBridge scheme in 2012 (published in April 2013) and their report found that 61.4% of the JobBridge survey respondents were in employment within 5 months of finishing their internships.</p><p>  Under education measures, the Springboard scheme as announced in the Jobs Initiative had initially provided for 5,900 places.  During 2011 and 2012, over 10,000 people enrolled on programmes under the Springboard scheme.  The scheme has been extended further with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair&iacute; Quinn T.D. announcing in June this year, another 6,000 places under the third Springboard allocation.  Further rollouts of the springboard scheme will be considered in the context of the findings of an on-going evaluation. </p><p>  Finally, I want to reiterate that addressing the difficulties in the labour market remains the Government's biggest challenge and, accordingly, the Government is giving its highest priority to job protection and job creation.</p></reply>

The measure will apply where an individual, who has paid capital gains tax on the disposal of assets, makes investments in a new business in the period 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 and subsequently disposes of this investment no earlier than three years after the date of investment.  The CGT payable on the disposal of this new investment will be reduced by the lower of:</p><p>(i) the CGT paid by the individual on a previous disposal of assets in the period from 1 January 2010 and</p><p>(ii) 50% of the CGT due on the disposal of the new investment.  Commencement of this measure is subject to receipt of EU State Aid approval. </p><p>  The CGT entrepreneurial relief is provided for in Section 45 of Finance (No 2) Bill 2013 and will apply to active entrepreneurs who invest in new businesses, engaged in relevant trading activities (as defined), carried on by them personally or through qualifying companies controlled by them in which they are full-time working directors.  The relief is intended to apply to productive enterprises that will generate employment and will not therefore apply to passive investors or to investments in passive activities.</p><p>  The benefit of the entrepreneur relief will arise on the ultimate disposal by qualifying entrepreneurs of the chargeable business assets in which they invest. These chargeable business assets must be held for a minimum of three years and the other applicable conditions must be satisfied to qualify for relief.  Accordingly the benefit of the relief will crystallise from 2017 onwards on disposals of chargeable business assets that qualify for the relief.</p><p>  I also announced in the Budget, the extension of capital gains tax farm retirement relief to farmers who:</p><p>(i)  have farmed their lands for a period of not less than 10 years,</p><p>(ii) on ceasing to farm the lands, immediately let them for up to 15 years &ndash; with each such letting being for a  minimum period of 5 years,  </p><p>(iii) then sell the land.</p><p>  The purpose of the measure is to encourage older farmers who have no children to whom to transfer their farm to lease out their farmland over the long term to younger farmers.  The relief will apply in respect of disposals made on or after 1 January 2014, where the above conditions are satisfied. </p><p>  For a farmer aged 55 or over but under 66 years, full capital gains tax relief will be available on any gain made in respect of disposals for a consideration of up to &euro;750,000.  For a farmer aged 66 years of over full capital gains tax relief will be available on any gain made in respect of disposals for a consideration of up to &euro;500,000. Marginal relief will apply to disposals slightly in excess of these amounts.</p><p>  I also extended the property purchase incentive relief from CGT (in respect of the first 7 years of ownership) by one year to include properties bought up to the end of 2014.  Where property purchased in this period is held for seven years any gain on a subsequent disposal that accrued in that period will not attract a capital gains tax liability.  Where property is held for longer than this period a proportion of any gain will be exempt.</p></reply>

Statistics are not available showing the actual number of persons employed in the film industry.  Files maintained by the Revenue Commissioners provide data on the number of individuals that work on productions in a given year.  These show that in the current year, just over 27,000 individual employments were generated on film productions supported by Section 481 relief.  This includes approximately 20,000 employments as extras on these productions.  Unfortunately, this data does not show whether an individual spent a full year, a week or a day working on the production of a qualifying film.  Similarly, an individual may have worked on a number of productions and would be counted in respect of each production.  For this reason, it is not possible to estimate the number of full time equivalent employees from the Revenue information. </p><p>  As the Deputy is aware, my Department carried out a review of the film relief scheme during 2012.  As a result of this review, the scheme was overhauled in Finance Act 2013 to bring it up to international standards.  The main beneficiaries of the revised relief will be the film producers rather than passive investors as is the case at present. There will also be benefits for the State by way of increased revenues.</p><p>  In my recent Budget statement I gave notice of my intention to bring forward the proposed start date of the new scheme from 1 January 2016 to 2015.</p></reply>

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the &euro;200 arrears can be paid by property owners using any of the payment methods that are currently available for paying LPT.  I understand that to date about &euro;1.79m has been paid directly to Revenue in respect of almost 9,000 properties.  </p><p>  I am further advised that an extensive data matching exercise has been undertaken by Revenue since it received details from the Local Government Management Agency (LGMA) of those properties where the Household Charge has been paid or, in respect of which a waiver or exemption from the charge has been granted.  Revenue has confirmed that the vast majority of data from the LGMA&rsquo;s Household Charge Register has already been matched with its Local Property Tax Register and that the necessary work to finalise this process is ongoing.  </p><p>  Revenue has informed me that the Household Charge payment has been matched to over 1.2 million properties on the LPT Register.  It will not be possible to fully match all Household Charge payments to the LPT Register.  The main difficulty is where different people paid the Household Charge and the LPT for the same property.  The Household Charge registration process only captured details of the person who paid the Household Charge, and where someone other than the owner paid the Household Charge the owner&rsquo;s details are not on the Household Charge Register.  In addition where a property has multiple owners, if different owners paid the Household Charge and the LPT, the Registers may not match.  These mis-matches arise particularly in the case of properties with non-unique addresses.   </p><p>I strongly recommend property owners to check their LPT record online at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>   with their Property ID and PIN.  If Revenue&rsquo;s LPT record shows that there is &euro;200 LPT/ Household Charge arrears but they have paid their Household Charge, they should send Revenue a copy of the receipt for the Household Charge and Revenue will remove the charge from the LPT record.  If they have paid it and they do not have a receipt they should contact their Local Authority or the LGMA for a receipt and send a copy to Revenue. In this way anybody who has paid their Household Charge can ensure that Revenue&rsquo;s records are corrected.</p><p>  As outlined above, unpaid Household Charge at 1 July 2013 became a &euro;200 LPT liability. This was due for payment on that date and interest on unpaid LPT/ Household Charge arrears continues to accrue.  Revenue advises me that the amount will be capped at &euro;200 if paid before they formally launch their LPT/Household Charge compliance campaign.  However, if it is not paid in line with that campaign, interest will be charged; for example, if the outstanding Household Charge is paid on 30 April 2014, the amount payable will be &euro;213.</p><p>  Revenue will begin a compliance campaign on LPT/Household Charge arrears in the first quarter of 2014 and they intend to make property owners aware of this on the Revenue website, in press releases, through interviews with Revenue spokespeople on local and national media, and if necessary, through formal media advertising.  Alongside this public awareness campaign, Revenue will also contact potential non-compliant property owners directly regarding their obligations.  </p><p>  At this stage, the 2012 Household Charge has been paid for over 1.2 million properties and LPT for 2013 has been paid for over 1.6 million properties.  The Revenue Commissioners have a duty, in the interests of fairness and equity to those who are compliant, to take effective follow-up action to recover the tax from the non-compliant.  Revenue will pursue unpaid 2013 LPT liability for the relatively small proportion of properties still outstanding and will also pursue the outstanding LPT/ Household Charge arrears. </p><p>  Further information on Household Charge arrears is available in the LPT Frequently Asked Questions section of the Revenue website.</p></reply>

The first &euro;1m in value is taxed at the 0.18% rate.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, as work is on-going to refine the Local Property Tax Register and data on LPT, and as LPT Returns continue to be filed, it would be premature at this time to present a reliable estimate for increasing the 0.25% rate to 0.35%.

The President's reply to the MEPs noted that the reasons that originally led to the decision to have &euro;500 banknotes in circulation were still valid.  Before the changeover to euro cash in January 2002, six of the euro area countries &ndash; Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands &ndash; had national banknotes worth between &euro;200 and &euro;500.  At the end of June 2013, the share of &euro;200 and &euro;500 banknotes in total circulation was 36%.</p><p>  Mr Draghi's reply to the MEPs also explained that the share of the total circulation value of the high denomination euro banknotes has been quite stable since 2009; it is not much different from the recorded shares of some of the highest denominations of the former currencies of the countries mentioned above.  </p><p>  The President of the ECB also noted that ECB studies indicated that only about 15%  of high-denomination banknotes are used for transaction purposes.  Consequently, it is not likely that a large share of the &euro;500 (and &euro;200) banknotes in circulation is being used for criminal transactions.  Neither does it seem likely that withdrawing the &euro;500 banknote from circulation would contribute to reducing such activities.  Whilst it is impossible to know precisely to what extent and for what reasons people are hoarding banknotes, there is evidence that the &euro;500 banknotes fulfil a role in the provision of cash to the public in times of high uncertainty.   </p><p>  Since the introduction of the euro in 2002 the Central Bank of Ireland has issued in excess of 1million &euro;500 banknotes.</p><p>  As euro banknotes circulate throughout the Eurozone, it is Net Issuance, rather than circulation, that is calculated on a national level.  Net Issuance is a calculation of notes delivered less notes destroyed, less stocks.  It does not take into account factors such as migration of notes within the eurozone.  The Net Issuance of &euro;500 banknotes in Ireland is 112,278 banknotes, with a value of </p><p>  &euro;56,139,000  as at 12 December 2013. </p><p>  The Deputy also refers to a suggestion by Merrill Lynch that the &euro;500 banknote be discontinued with the proceeds being used to recapitialise Eurozone banks. This suggestion has not been examined by the Department of Finance, the Central Bank or the National Treasury Management Agency; nor has it been raised with the institutions referred to by the Deputy. </p></reply>

Qualifying expenditure is expenditure subject to the 13.5% VAT rate.  The work must cost a minimum of &euro;5,000 (inclusive of VAT) which would attract a credit of &euro;595.  Where the cost of the work exceeds &euro;30,000 (exclusive of VAT) a maximum credit of &euro;4,050 will apply. The credit is payable over the two years following the year in which the work is carried out.

Homeowners will be able to view the information provided to Revenue by the contractor through the Revenue electronic systems and will also claim the relief through those systems.  </p><p>  The type of work covered includes extensions, garages, attic conversions, supply and fitting of kitchens, bathrooms and built in wardrobes, water treatment units, landscaping, window fitting, plumbing, tiling, rewiring and plastering. </p><p>Items such as furniture, white goods and carpets are not covered as well as work which is subject to VAT at 23%.

For <i>simplicity, </i>  Revenue allows the single farm payment to be accounted for on either of the following basis: </p><p><b>Receipts Basis. </b></p><p>  The single payment may be recognised as a receipt pertaining to the date the cheque is issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p><i>Example 1</i></p><p>  Accounts are made up to September annually. The single payment for the year 2013, if paid on say 20th December 2013, will form a receipt of the year ended 30th September, 2014 (the 2014 tax year). If however it is not paid until say 10th January 2014, it will still form a receipt of the year ended 30th September 2014 (the 2014 tax year)</p><p><i>Example 2</i></p><p>  Accounts are made up to December annually. The single payment for the year 2013, if paid on say 20th December 2013, will form a receipt of the year ended 31st December 2013 (the 2013 tax year). If however it is not paid until say 10th January 2014, it will form a receipt of the year ended 31st December 2014 (the 2014 tax year). There will therefore be no single payment recognised in the tax year 2013</p><p><b>Annual Basis. </b></p><p>  The single payment may be recognised as a receipt accrued over the year (January to December) in respect of which it was paid.</p><p><i>Example 1</i></p><p>  Accounts are made up to September annually. The single payment for the year 2013, regardless of when it is paid, will form a receipt 9/12 of which will fall into the year ended 30th September 2013 (2013 tax year) and 3/12 of which will fall into the year 30th September, 2014 (2014 tax year).</p><p><i>Example 2</i></p><p>  Accounts are made up to December annually. The single payment for the year 2013, regardless of when it is paid, will form a receipt for year ended 31 December 2013 (2013 tax year)</p><p>  Revenue will accept either the Receipts Basis or the Annual Basis,  provided taxpayers apply the basis consistently, commencing in the year 2005 when the payments were introduced (or on commencement of farming) and there is no significant loss of revenue over that which would arise if the accounts were prepared on a full earnings basis. Where the use of the Receipts Basis would result in no single payment being recognised in a 12 month basis period (e.g. where the issue of the single payment cheque is delayed until after the year-end), the returns of that and subsequent periods may be submitted on the Annual Basis. Revenue reserves the right to carry out reviews if persons change the basis on which their accounts are prepared.</p><p>  Taxpayers who submit accounts on an earnings basis are not permitted to change their system of accounting to either of the simplified systems, Receipts Basis or Annual Basis.</p></reply>

I am also advised that liable persons wishing to pay their 2014 LPT by cheque could do so by attaching the payment to their LPT1A Payment Instruction and returning it to Revenue by 7 November 2013. Alternatively, they could send the cheque separate to the LPT1A Payment Instruction on or before 1 January 2014. </p><p>  Liable persons are also afforded the opportunity to pay their 2014 liability by Single Debit Authority (SDA), which is like an electronic cheque. SDA is a safe, cheap and user friendly method of paying LPT and it also provides liable persons with an extended payment date to 21 March 2014.</p><p>  Because SDA is an online replica of a cheque that operates in exactly the same way as a &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; cheque, it would not make sense from an IT development perspective to provide a &lsquo;tick box&rsquo; system as a confirmation method for manual cheque payments.</p><p>  Revenue has also confirmed to me that SDA is one of the preferred payment methods being used by taxpayers to meet 2014 LPT obligations and there is no demand to develop a &lsquo;tick box&rsquo; solution along the lines suggested. </p><p>  In regard to debit/credit card payments, as I have previously informed the House in respect of 2014 LPT payment options, any property owner who chose to pay in this manner was given an extended filing deadline to 29 November (from 7 November). However Revenue clearly indicated that such transactions would be processed immediately because that is the nature of card payments and Revenue has no discretion in this regard. Revenue has been very consistent in this message and the issue has been covered extensively on its website and in all public pronouncements and media releases. </p><p>  In regard to the specific instance to which the Deputy refers, from the details supplied there seems to be a misunderstanding on how credit/debit card transactions differ from SDA.   Finally, Revenue is most anxious to investigate the circumstances of the call to which the person in question refers. All of The LPT agents are trained to a very high standard and all calls are recorded as part of the quality assurance process. If the Deputy provides Revenue with details of the date and approximate time the call was made to the LPT Helpline, the phone number used to make the call, and the name address of the person in question, its operatives will identify the agent in question and will ensure the quality issue is fully addressed. </p></reply>

On that basis, the owner of a residential property on 1 November 2013 is responsible for paying the tax for 2014.  If an owner sells a residential property after 1 November 2013, he/she remains liable to pay the LPT due on the property for 2014, even if it is sold before the end of 2013.  The Act places a number of obligations on property vendors.  For example, before the completion of a sale the vendor should submit all outstanding LPT Returns, pay all outstanding LPT, and self-correct any Return where there has been an under-declaration of value.  The vendor must also provide the purchaser with details of the valuation band declared on the 2013 return and the basis for arriving at the valuation.  Finally, the vendor must provide LPT &lsquo;clearance&rsquo; to the purchaser confirming that there are no outstanding LPT liabilities or filing requirements.  This information is available to the vendor via the Revenue website at <i><font color="#0000FF">www.revenue.ie</font></i>  . </p><p>  In the case raised by the Deputy, I am advised that the existing LPT legislation does not provide for a waiver facility in respect of LPT in these circumstances.</p></reply>

I was not prescriptive in how this was to be achieved respecting their differing State ownership and investment and paths to profitability. I have reviewed the letters submitted and in light of the various industrial relations developments since then I now am satisfied that the banks will deliver remuneration cost savings of 6% to 10%.    The Bank of Ireland proposal focused on changes to the defined benefit pension scheme that will affect all staff who are members of this scheme and as the deputy will be aware an agreement has now been reached with the IBOA in this regard. The AIB proposal included the closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual along with other changes including an increase in working hours which were agreed with the IBOA in July. The ptsb proposal centred on the wind-up of the defined benefit pension scheme for all staff who were members of this scheme and this has now been completed.</p><p>  For clarity senior management in the banks have made the following contributions; in the case of Bank of Ireland the proposed pension changes affect all staff in the BSPF scheme including the Chief Executive. In the case of AIB reductions in pay and benefits of higher earners ranging from 7.5% to 15% were implemented in the second half of 2012 and it also should be noted that the members of the AIB Leadership Team all joined the bank since 2008 and receive reduced pension contributions from their predecessors. In the case of ptsb all senior management, joined the bank since 2008 and are on lower remuneration levels than their predecessors.</p></reply>

The primary purpose of the changes I am making to the SFT regime is to further restrict the capacity of higher earners to fund or accrue large pensions through tax-subsidised sources. The SFT regime addresses the problem of pension overfunding and excessive pension accrual by dealing with it at the point of pension drawdown in retirement rather than by applying restrictions to pension savings or accrual upfront. The regime achieves this by imposing a penal tax charge on the value of retirement benefits above set limits when they are drawn down. In this way it acts to discourage the building up of large pension funds in the first place or unwinds the tax advantage of such overfunding by clawing back, through the penal tax charge, the tax relief granted.</p><p>  The changes I am making can be summarised as follows;</p><p>  - firstly, the absolute value of the SFT is being reduced, with effect from 1 January 2014, from &euro;2.3m to &euro;2m,</p><p>  - secondly, the valuation factor to be used for establishing the capital value of defined benefit (DB) pension rights at the point of retirement, where this takes place after 1 January 2014, is being changed from the current standard valuation factor of 20 to a range of higher age&ndash;related valuation factors that will vary with the individual&rsquo;s age at the point at which the pension rights are drawn down,</p><p>  - thirdly, in calculating the capital value of a DB pension at the point of retirement, transitional arrangements provide for a &ldquo;split&rdquo; calculation where part of the pension had already been accrued at 1 January 2014 so that the part accrued up to that date will be valued at a factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date valued at the appropriate higher age-related valuation factor,</p><p>  - finally, the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax are being amended and extended.</p><p>  As occurred on the occasion of the introduction of the SFT regime in 2005, and again when the value of the SFT limit was reduced to &euro;2.3m in 2010, the legislation contained in the Finance Bill provides for an individual who has pension rights on 1 January 2014 in excess of the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, to claim a Personal Fund Threshold (PFT) from Revenue in order to protect or &quot;grandfather&quot; the value of those rights on that date. This is subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m, and individuals with PFTs from 2005 or 2010 retain those PFTs.</p><p>  As before, the &quot;grandfathering&quot; provisions contained in the legislation reflect legal advice from the Attorney General. However, unlike previous occasions, the grandfathering arrangements this time around had to take cognisance not just of the reduction in the absolute level of the SFT from 1 January 2014, but also of the increase, from that date, in the factors for converting DB pension rights into capital value equivalents. It is for that reason, lest there be any suggestion that the changes had retrospective application, that DB rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 are to be capitalised at the existing valuation factor of 20, both for the purposes of determining if there is a PFT and for the purposes of placing a capital value on those rights at the time of retirement, where that takes place after 1 January 2014.</p><p>  The changes and grandfathering arrangements outlined above apply, as appropriate, to both DB and defined contribution (DC) pension arrangements in both the private and public sectors. As regards DB pension arrangements, it is irrelevant whether an individual is a higher paid public servant or a highly paid member of a private sector DB scheme, the same SFT rules apply to all such arrangements.</p><p>  Specifically, the new lower SFT limit will apply to both DC and DB arrangements. Those in DC pension arrangements can seek a PFT from Revenue if the capital value of their arrangements exceeds &euro;2m on 1 January 2014, subject to a maximum PFT of &euro;2.3m. If the value of their DC pension arrangements is below the SFT on 1 January 2014, their funds can continue to accumulate up to &euro;2m through further tax-relieved pension contributions and fund growth, subject to the various annual contribution and earnings limits that apply, without any risk of a chargeable excess arising. Members of DB pension arrangements can equally aspire to a maximum &quot;tax&ndash;relieved&quot; fund of &euro;2m. However, in the case of DB pension arrangements, members of such arrangements do not have individual &ldquo;earmarked&rdquo; funds (as is the case in DC arrangements) and this, coupled with the fact that pension benefits in such arrangements reflect a &quot;benefit promise&quot; based on salary and service, dictates that the capital value of pension rights arising under such arrangements has to be determined in some other way.</p><p>  The SFT regime provides (and has always provided) a simple formula for this purpose. The formula essentially requires the annual amount of pension payable to an individual under the arrangement to be multiplied by a valuation or capitalisation factor in order to establish the capital value, both for PFT purposes and for the purposes of establishing the value of DB pension rights at the point of retirement. Up to now, a single valuation factor of 20 has been used for these purposes. In light, however, of the major criticism levelled at the existing SFT regime, that the fixed rate conversion factor of 20:1 was inequitable relative to DC pension arrangements given the higher market annuity rates that those with DC pension arrangements could face if they were to purchase annuities, I have moved to introduce higher age-related factors. This will substantially improve the equity between DC and DB arrangements and as between those who retire at younger ages and those who retire later in life. These are significant changes.</p><p>  The value of DB pension rights accrued up to 1 January 2014 will, under the grandfathering requirements, be valued for the purposes of the SFT regime at the existing factor of 20. If the capital value so determined exceeds the new lower SFT limit of &euro;2m, such individuals may seek a PFT from Revenue, subject to the overall limit of &euro;2.3m referred to earlier. In such cases, additional pension benefits accrued after 1 January will be valued using the relevant higher age-related factor and will, as for DC arrangements, be fully exposed to chargeable excess tax. Where the capital value of DB rights is less than &euro;2m on 1 January, such individuals may continue to accrue pension rights up to the SFT limit but those additional rights will be valued at the relevant higher age-related factor.</p><p>  Whether DB or DC arrangements are involved, on each occasion that an individual becomes entitled to receive a benefit under a pension arrangement for the first time (called a &quot;benefit crystallisation event&quot; or BCE) they use up part of their SFT or PFT, as the case may be. At each BCE, a capital value has to be attributed to the benefits that crystallise and the value is then tested against the SFT or the individual&rsquo;s PFT, as appropriate, by the pension scheme administrator. For DC pension arrangements, the capital value of pension rights when they are drawn down after 1 January 2014 is simply the value of the assets in the arrangement that represent the member&rsquo;s accumulated rights on that date, in other words the value of the DC fund at the point of drawdown. In the case of DB pension arrangements, the default position is that the capital value of such rights drawn down after 1 January 2014 is determined by multiplying the gross annual pension that would be payable to the individual by the appropriate age-related valuation factor. If the DB arrangement provides for a separate lump sum entitlement (otherwise than by way of commutation of part of the pension) e.g. most public service schemes, the value of the lump sum is added to the capital value of the DB pension to arrive at the overall capital value.</p><p>  However, reflecting the grandfathering requirements referred to earlier, where part of the DB pension has been accrued at 1 January 2014 and part after that date, the transitional arrangements provide for the part accrued at 1 January to be valued at the factor of 20 and the part accrued after that date at the appropriate higher age-related factor.</p><p>When the capital value of a BCE, either on its own or when aggregated with earlier BCEs, exceeds the SFT, or an individual's PFT, the excess is subject to an immediate tax charge at 41%<b>, </b>which<b></b>has to be paid upfront by the pension fund administrator and recovered from the individual. In addition, when the remainder of the excess is subsequently drawn down as a pension (or, for example, by way of a distribution from an Approved Retirement Fund or vested Personal Retirement Savings Account) it is subject to tax at the individual&rsquo;s marginal rate, thus giving rise to an effective income tax rate on a chargeable excess of some 65%, excluding any liability to USC and PRSI.</p><p>  The Finance Bill also amends and extends the reimbursement options, introduced in Finance Act 2012, for public servants affected by chargeable excess tax who are required to reimburse the public sector pension fund administrator for the upfront payment of the tax to Revenue. Unlike affected individuals in the private sector, public servants cannot minimise or prevent the breaching of the SFT or PFT by ceasing contributions or benefit accrual. The focus of the changes is to reduce the amount that can be recovered from the net retirement lump sum payable to the individual to a maximum of 20% of the net lump sum (from 50%) and to include the option of reimbursement of the pension fund administrator solely by way of a reduction in the gross pension payable over a period not exceeding 20 years.</p></reply>

A study was undertaken for the European Commission in April 2013 which projected that there may be up to 900,000 ICT job vacancies in Europe by 2015.  While that report did not provide a breakdown of the potential vacancies by country, the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has just published a report which estimates that there will be more than 44,500 potential job openings for ICT professionals in Ireland over the period from 2013 to 2018, including almost 20,400 potential job openings for both new graduates and skilled professionals between 2013 and 2015.</p><p>  The findings of the EGFSN study are informing the development of the new ICT Skills Plan which will replace the  Government's first ICT skills Action Plan launched in 2012 as a collaboration between Government, industry and the education system to increase the supply of high level ICT graduates.  The study also shows that the output of mainstream computer graduates has increased by 25% over the last 2 years and a doubling of graduate output now expected to be achieved by 2015 &ndash; 3 years ahead of the Action Plan target of 2018. In addition, as part of the Plan, almost 1,500 places have been provided for graduate jobseekers under two the rounds of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes that have issued to date and 6,000 places have been provided on ICT programmes under the three rounds of the Springboard reskilling initiative that have issued since 2011. A call for new rounds of the ICT upskilling and conversion courses is expected to issue in early 2014.</p><p>  It is intended that the scope of the revised Plan will be broadened to encompass measures to increase the supply of highly skilled ICT professionals from abroad as well as an increase the domestic supply of high level ICT graduates.</p></reply>

These new procedures have been developed following consultation with the relevant education partners and replace guidelines that were issued to schools in 1993.</p><p>  The procedures are designed to give direction and guidance to school authorities and school personnel in preventing and tackling school-based bullying behaviour amongst its pupils. They include specific requirements in relation to the use of prevention and education strategies and the consistent investigation, follow up and recording of bullying behaviour.</p><p>  There is no requirement that schools report incidents of bullying behaviour to my Department. The procedures however include important new oversight arrangements that involve the school Principal reporting regularly to the Board of Management and a requirement for the Board to undertake an annual review of the school's anti- bullying policy and its implementation. Confirmation that the annual review has been completed must be provided to the parents association and published on the school website.</p><p>  All schools are now required to immediately commence the necessary arrangements for developing and formally adopting an anti-bullying policy that fully complies with the requirements of the new procedures. This is expected to be completed by each school as early as possible in the 2013/14 school year but in any event by no later than the end of the second term of the 2013/14 school year.</p></reply>

In keeping with this principle, additional resources provided in the education system are allocated on the basis of identified individual educational need.</p><p>  Following the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision, Traveller pupils now avail of the following mainstream resources, similar to all other children:</p><p>- Free Pre-school Year</p><p>- School transport</p><p>- Classroom Teacher Allocation at Primary and Post-Primary level</p><p>- Learning Resource Teachers at Primary and Post-Primary Level in the case of identified special educational need</p><p>- Further and adult Education</p><p>Recorded Traveller participation rates in education in recent years show:</p><p>- A total of some 12,000 self-identified Travellers in mainstream primary and post-primary education.</p><p>- The majority of Traveller students transfer from primary to post-primary education.</p><p>- The number of Traveller children enrolled in post-primary school has risen by 46% in the 7 years to 2011-2012</p><p>- Participation rates in the junior cycle have steadily improved from 1,598 Traveller students recorded in 2004/05 to 1,898 in the 2011/12 school year.</p><p>- The number of Travellers progressing to senior cycle has consistently improved in recent years from 260 in 2004/05 to 800 in 2011/12.</p><p>- In 2012, 579 Travellers were enrolled on the Youthreach programme and 672 Travellers participated in the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI).</p><p>- The estimated number attending third level is 3% compared to 53% of the general population.  The 'Equal Access' survey of the ethnic and cultural backgrounds of entrants to higher education in 2011/12 indicates that 29 who identified as Travellers attended third level compared to 24 in 2008/09.</p><p>- As data collected throughout the education system is based on self-identification, the actual number of Travellers in education may be higher than the figures quoted above.</p><p>  Information on the attainment of all pupils at second level is collected by the State Examinations Commission. Information relating to attendance, suspensions and expulsions is collected by the National Educational Welfare Board.</p><p>  My Department is currently revising the collection and collation of data on Traveller pupils through the Primary Census form for primary pupils and through the Post-Primary Pupil Database for post-primary pupils which will facilitate improved monitoring of progression and attainment of Traveller across the primary and post-primary school sectors.</p><p>  Following the phasing out of segregated Traveller provision, Travellers now avail of the following mainstream resources, similar to all other children:</p><p>  - Free Pre-school Year</p><p>- School transport</p><p>- Classroom Teacher Allocation at Primary and Post-Primary level</p><p>- Learning Resource Teachers at Primary and Post-Primary Level in the case of identified special educational need</p><p>- Further and adult Education</p><p>  The cuts to which the Deputy refers relate to the reduction in funding for segregated Traveller specific programmes such as Resource Teachers for Travellers, Visiting Teacher Service and the phasing out of Senior Traveller Training Centres. A portion of the funding previously allocated to segregated education provision for Travellers has been redeployed to mainstream programmes in line with the principle of inclusion.  However significant Traveller specific funding also remains in the system. In 2012, the most recent year for which full expenditure details are available, &euro;20.6m was paid in respect of some 12,000 Travellers in the education system in addition to funding already made available for mainstream provision.</p></reply>

These include:</p><p> - The introduction of a third major transfer point for students between primary level and third level</p><p>- The question of which school the Transition Year should be placed in</p><p>- The undermining of Department policy to maintain as common a curriculum as possible for as long as possible to avoid the risk of specialisation too early and school drop out</p><p>- The potential danger that the senior school will come to be seen as the 'specialist' Leaving Certificate centre into which transfers are sought at senior cycle</p><p>- The loss of the advantages to be gained when teachers regularly teach students from first year to sixth year</p><p>- The possibility of students from other schools seeking entry to the senior school with the attendant repercussions for other schools.</p><p>  Apart for these compelling educational reasons, patronage of the new school, was awarded to the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board (KWETB) specifically on the basis that it would deliver the prescribed curriculum at both Junior and Senior Cycle. Any change to this stated intention could lead to a challenge or to calls for the patronage determination process to be commenced afresh. This could have the effects of both delaying the establishment of the new school and, of course, re-opening the patronage of the new school to other applicant patrons.</p><p>  I have met with a parents' deputation and, in accordance with normal protocol following such meetings, I communicated the outcome of my subsequent consideration of this matter to the Deputies who had requested the meeting.  I also recently wrote directly to the Chairperson of the Maynooth Schools Group fully outlining the reasons for my decision to provide Maynooth with two fully-vertical post-primary schools and confirming that I am adhering to this decision.</p><p>  I am satisfied that the enrolment procedures put in place by the management structure developed by the KTWEB for the new campus will ensure a fair and equitable enrolment policy for both schools.  I am also satisfied that the erroneous description of the existing post-primary school in Maynooth as being a designed Community College was corrected as soon as it came to light and that this had no bearing on the outcome of the patronage determination process for the new school.</p></reply>

Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.</p><p>  The establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools  across the country has been a key educational priority in recent years. The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local </p><p>Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), is responsible for processing applications from primary and post primary schools for special educational needs supports, including the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. </p><p>  Details of the special classes for children with autism, including details of special classes for children with autism in the Meath area, are available on the NCSE website http: //www.ncse.ie. The contact information details for individual schools is available on the Department's website .  Details of the numbers of children with autism who transition from primary to secondary school in the county are not readily available.</p><p>  All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological support from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).  This may take the form of assessment, where needed, or advice on intervention and educational planning </p><p>for pupils with special educational needs, including autism.  The NEPS focusses on providing necessary support to schools in facilitating the effective transition of pupils from primary to post primary schooling. This may involve assessment and review by the teacher, by the psychologist or both, to inform educational planning in second level.  As part of this NEPS service, necessary psychological assessments are carried out in a timely manner.  In instances where the school's assigned NEPS psychologist is not available, the school may access psychological assessments through the Scheme for commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA), full details of which are on the Department's website. Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.   </p><p>  Queries on the waiting time for psychological assessments undertaken by the HSE in Co. Meath are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health.</p></reply>

It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats  all similar types of schools equally irrespective of location. It currently  operates on the basis of a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28  pupils with lower thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools.  As part of the Budget 2012 decisions, there is a phased increase in the number  of pupils required to gain and retain a classroom teaching post in small  primary schools with four teachers or less. The first phase of the budget  measure took effect from September 2012. The final phase of the budget measure  takes effect from September 2014.  </p><p>  An appeals process is available to small schools which have had their staff  number reduced as a result of the budget measure. A school with four classroom  teachers or less which is losing a teacher or failed to gain an additional  teacher as a result of the Budget 2012 measure can submit an appeal to the  Primary Staffing Appeals Board. Details on the appeals process are published  annually as part of the Staffing Schedule for allocating teaching posts to  schools. The Appeals Board operates independently of the Department and its  decision is final.  </p><p>  Since September 2012, ten schools in Co. Donegal have had a post suppressed as  a result of the Budget 2012 measure.</p></reply>

The level of  facilities, including playspace, that can be provided in schools will therefore  vary depending on the extent of classroom accommodation needed for the school.  A suite of technical guidance documents is available on my Department's website  (www.education.ie) to assist design teams in best practice in the design and  development of projects and to encourage them to take a complete design team  approach from project conception. These documents cover all aspects of the  development of a building project for both internal and external works.  </p><p>  The Physical Education curriculum has been designed on the basis that  facilities in schools may vary. Many primary schools have a general purpose  room and practically all schools have outdoor play areas which are used for  teaching different aspects of the P.E. programme. A similar situation with  sports halls and outdoor facilities applies at second level. In addition, many  schools use adjacent local facilities, including public parks, playing fields  and swimming pools. </p><p>  My Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance in the provision  of P.E. Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as  basketball courts. Other P.E. facilities, e.g. pitches are provided, where  appropriate, and in the context of available resources, as part of the  Department's school building programme. </p><p>  The provision of playing pitches is not part of the specification for primary  schools. However, in certain circumstances and where the site conditions allow,  the project scope may include the levelling and grassing of an area which  schools may decide to use for playing fields. At post primary level, an area  may be developed as a practice playing field where site conditions and  resources permit. </p><p>  In the context of my Department's co-operation with local authorities in  identifying suitable sites for schools, the location of sporting facilities is  one factor taken into account in locating schools. The Deputy may be aware of  my Department's role in developing shared community facilities in the Fingal  County Council area, which has made facilities available to the wider community  on a shared basis with the school.  </p><p>  Given the current financial constraints within which my Department is  operating, priority is being given to applications from schools for essential  mainstream classroom accommodation. In this regard, my Department is not in a  position to consider applications from schools for funding towards pitches or  sports facilities outside of the context of school projects on the building  programme. My Department will however continue to provide general purpose  rooms, PE Halls and outdoor play areas in schools where new schools are being  provided within the context of available funding.</p></reply>

These Frameworks will replace the existing Frameworks which were put in place in 2012 and which expire in April 2014.</p><p>  The panels will provide the basis for Architectural, Engineering and Quantity Surveying firms to tender for major school building projects throughout 2014 and 2015. Separate panels will be in place for category 2(b) projects (construction value between &euro;2.5m and &euro;5m) and category 3 projects (construction value greater than &euro;5m). </p><p>  In order to qualify for inclusion on a Framework Panel firms must satisfy certain minimum criteria which essentially demonstrate the firm's capacity to provide the required service as part of a design team on a major school building project. One of the minimum criteria is the need to have completed at least 3 major projects of a similar scale and complexity in the last 5 years. For category 3 projects, one of the three completed projects is required to be a school building project. This particular requirement does not apply to category 2(b) projects.</p><p>  The minimum threshold of &euro;2.5 million for the three completed projects applies only to the category 3 framework. This means that in order to qualify to tender for projects valued in excess of &euro;5 million a firm must show that it has successfully completed three building projects each with a value of at least &euro;2.5 million in the previous 5 years. </p><p>  The minimum value for each of the three completed projects to qualify for the category 2(b) framework is &euro;1 million. There is therefore ample opportunity for smaller firms to compete for category 2(b) projects and if, successful, to demonstrate their capacity to compete for category 3 projects in the future.</p><p>  These minimum criteria are based on the current Suitability Assessment Questionnaire for Principle Service Provider to be assessed under a Restricted Procedure  published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (QC1 v2.0 16/07/2013). </p><p>  However, in cognisance of the downturn in the construction industry, my Department has chosen to extend the period for which completed projects are eligible for inclusion from a three year period (which applied for the 2012 Frameworks) to a period of five years for the new Frameworks.  It is important to understand that this refers to completion dates for projects and that all firms completing such projects in the last 5 years would, by necessity, have been working on the design phases of such projects for anywhere up to three years before the completion date.  While the three projects must have been completed in the last 5 years this, in effect, gives firms an eight year window to provide three examples of large scale building projects which they have worked on in order to satisfy this condition.  It is also worth noting that the number of applications for the 2014 panels has exceeded the level of interest expressed back in 2012.  The evaluation process of the applicants is ongoing and the Framework will be operational by its target date of April 2014.</p><p>  Finally, it should be noted that the appointment of design teams on school building projects of a value less than &euro;2.5 million will generally not be tendered to the above Frameworks but will be conducted by open tender on the Governments e-tenders web-site.</p></reply>

In relation to curricular reform the new junior cycle in post-primary schools outlines eight key skills required for successful learning by students across the curriculum and for learning beyond school. The key skills in the Framework for Junior Cycle all include as elements the use of digital technology. One of the Statements of Learning in the Framework provides for the use by students of technology and digital media tools to learn, communicate, work and think collaboratively and creatively. As new specifications for the Junior Cycle are being prepared, the use of ICT will become integrated across learning areas. In addition, new short courses in Digital Media literacy and in Programming and Coding will be available to schools from September 2014. A draft of it will be available shortly from the NCCA for consultation. </p><p>  The first step in developing a new strategy for the use of ICT in teaching and learning is the completion of an ICT census in schools. The census results are currently being analysed and the results will provide a sound research base which will in turn inform key policy decisions relating to integrating ICT in teaching and learning over the next three to five years. In the past the ICT census of schools focussed on the level of infrastructure in schools. The current census addresses a broad range of themes including:</p><p>- The impact of ICT in teaching and learning and assessment</p><p>-School-wide planning for integration of ICT in teaching and learning</p><p>-Continuing ICT related Professional Development (CPD) for teachers</p><p>-Curriculum-relevant digital content and software resources</p><p>-exploring views on the opportunities presented by integration of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment,</p><p>-Obstacles to ICT integration and how they could be overcome</p><p>  In addition there will be an extensive consultation process with stakeholders and the wider public. As part of this process, the ICT industry will be consulted in relation to technological developments. Feedback from this process and the results of the school census will provide a sound research base to inform policy decisions on the further integration of ICT in teaching and learning over the next five years.</p></reply>

As part of this phase of the Department's decentralisation, a number of posts transferred from the Tullamore office to Athlone which freed up space in Tullamore to transfer parts of the Higher Education Division from Dublin to Tullamore.</p><p>  In April 2010 it was announced that decentralisation of the Department's HQ to Mullingar would not proceed on affordability grounds.  The same is the case for the Agencies listed above. This Department comprises 3 main locations: Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore.  In addition there is a small presence of staff in 40 regional locations outside of Dublin. As of end of September 2013, the Department has a staff of 1,296 people, 920 of whom work outside Dublin.   </p><p>  The information requested by the Deputy in relation to each staff member travelling to individual meetings in Dublin is not readily available and would involve an inordinate amount of administrative time to compile.  However I can inform the Deputy that domestic travel costs for the Department have reduced significantly in recent years.  Since 2007 the costs have been reduced by approximately 40% as set out as follows.</p><p>Year 2007: &euro;3.13m</p><p>Year 2008: &euro;3.06m</p><p>Year 2012: &euro;1.96m</p><p>Year to date 2013: &euro;1.71m</p><p>  My Department's policy specifies that all travel should be by the shortest practicable routes and by the cheapest practicable mode of transport. Officers are encouraged to use public transport whenever practicable, with private transport to be used only in limited circumstances. </p><p>  In terms of measures to reduce the necessity of travel, videoconferencing facilities have been in place in my Department's offices for a number of years, enabling staff in two or more locations communicate by simultaneous video and audio transmissions. In addition during 2013, my Department rolled out unified communications software across the three main offices in Dublin, Athlone and Tullamore and a number of regional/local offices, with plans to extend to other such offices in 2014.  This software facilitates desktop video conferencing and desktop sharing, enabling colleagues in different locations work on the same document.  These technologies reduce the time and cost associated with business travel and enable a more efficient way of working.  It is however inevitable that senior officials in particular would be required to attend meetings away from their base such as Interdepartmental meetings, Ministerial meetings etc.</p></reply>

Providers' programmes are submitted to QQI for validation via an online system and evaluated to ensure they will allow learners to meet the required national standards.  Providers can track the progress of their application via the online system. </p><p>QQI endeavours to process validation applications as efficiently and effectively as possible. Programmes leading to major awards are evaluated on the basis of the detail submitted by the provider in their application. Delays may occur where information contained in the application requires clarification or where providers are asked for additional information. Providers are also required to comply with the legal requirements for Protection for Enrolled Learners (PEL) and if information regarding a provider's PEL arrangements is not provided to QQI then QQI cannot validate the programme.</p><p>It is not possible to inform the Deputy of the specific reasons for the delay referred to in the Deputy's question without further detail regarding the particular providers and awards concerned.</p><p>With regard to the expiry date of December 2013 for legacy awards, the transition to the Common Award System (CAS) at levels 3 to 6 of the National Framework of Qualifications has been in train since 2009. This transition commenced under FETAC and has continued since QQI was established. It is a process whereby old awards were withdrawn and replaced with CAS awards devised by FETAC to meet in full the requirements of the National Framework of Qualifications.  This transition has been a complex activity requiring the input and support of a range of stakeholders and providers, including those in the private sector. Advance planning, briefings for providers and validation procedures for CAS were put in place by FETAC prior to the establishment of QQI. A series of briefings (from 2009 to 2013) were held by FETAC for providers both public and private to inform them about the requirements. Providers have, therefore, had sufficient time to plan programme development in accordance with their quality assurance procedures and to make an application for validation of their programme for the relevant CAS award to ensure continuity of business.</p></reply>

I want to achieve a position where every primary schools has a book rental schemes in operation in the 2014/2015 school year.</p><p>This scheme will be confined to primary schools that do not currently operate such a scheme. To extend it to all schools would mean that the funding available to each school would be diluted to such an extent as to have little impact. I wholeheartedly commend schools that have established book rental schemes to date. However, I regret that they will not be eligible to apply for funding under this scheme.</p><p>I can confirm to the Deputies that the Department will continue to provide a book grant to all primary schools. This grant, which provided &euro;7m to primary schools in 2013, can be utilised for the purposes of updating or expanding a school's book rental scheme.</p></reply>

The report recommends that under the new resource allocation model proposed by the NCSE in its report, children should be allocated additional resources in line with their level of need, rather than by disability category.</p><p>  The NCSE has recommended that in the short-term, pupils with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild General Learning Disability (Mild GLD) category should continue to be supported by schools' Learning Support allocation in the same way as other pupils with a Mild GLD.</p><p>  The NCSE policy advice did not recommend that an exception should be made for children with Down Syndrome who are in the Mild GLD range, over other children who are in the mild range and who also may have other co-morbid conditions.</p><p>  However, the NCSE report states that it is confident that the introduction of a new allocation model will overcome the difficulty posed by all children with mild general learning disabilities, including children with Down Syndrome, who have additional difficulties and who can be supported according to their level of need and in line with their learning plan process. In the meantime, schools are reminded that they can differentiate the level of learning support granted to ensure that available resources are used to support children in line with their needs.</p><p>  The NCSE has established a Working Group to develop a proposal for consideration for a new Tailored Allocation Model, which is set out as one of the principal recommendations of the report. I understand that the Working Group will report its findings before the end of Spring 2014.</p></reply>

The focus of the WSE is on the quality of teaching and learning and the quality of management and leadership. It identifies and affirms good practice in the school while providing clear recommendations for further development and improvement. The inspection team gathers its evidence from a variety of sources. These include observation of a wide range of lessons and meetings with members of the board of management, parents' representatives, a group of students including representatives of the student council, the principal and various staff members. Documentation submitted by the school is also reviewed.</p><p>  In addition to meetings with representatives of the parents and students, detailed questionnaires are issued to a significant sample of parents and students in all whole-school evaluations. These enable parents and students communicate their views on certain aspects of the school's provision to the inspection team.

As well as providing a valuable input to education policy and the development of course curricula by individual institutions, EGFSN research also provides the basis for the selection of programmes for the new targeted reskilling interventions Springboard, Momentum and the ICT skills conversion programme.</p><p>The Springboard programme provides flexible reskilling opportunities at higher education levels for unemployed and previously self-employed people in areas of emerging skills needs. More than 15,000 places in areas such as ICT, Manufacturing and International Financial Services have been provided under the three rounds of the programme that have issued to date.</p><p>  The Momentum programme, which is co-financed by the European Social Fund, is providing 6,500 education and training interventions in 2013 in areas where vacancies exist for the long term unemployed and young people.</p><p>  In addition, the joint Government-Industry ICT Action Plan, which was published in 2012, was developed as a direct response to identified ICT skills shortages and contains a comprehensive range of measures to build the domestic supply of ICT graduates, including through the roll out of the ICT graduate skills conversion programmes, designed and delivered in partnership with industry. Almost 1,500 places have been provided for jobseekers under two rounds of the conversion programmes that issued since 2012. The actions and targets in the 2012 Action Plan are currently being reviewed with a view to publishing a revised Plan in early 2014. The review is being jointly led by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Jobs Enterprise and Innovation and will be informed by the EGFSN report on ICT skills demand which was published in November.</p><p>  Meeting the requirements of enterprise is a high priority for the higher education system and the wide ranging programme of reform which is being rolled out across all levels of the education system seeks to further improve the ongoing supply of high quality skills for the workforce. One of the core objectives under the new Performance Framework for the higher education system is meeting Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills areas through both core funding and specifically targeted initiatives. The creation of the new further education and training authority, SOLAS, will also ensure an increased focus on the evolving skills requirements of industry.</p></reply>

The new Framework will be in place for an initial two-year period with the option to extend for a further two years, subject to satisfactory performance.  As and when a specific requirement for resources arises during the currency of the Framework Agreement, the Department will issue mini-tenders to participants in the Framework and invite them to submit competitive bids.

For works contracts the threshold is &euro;5 million.  The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.</p><p>  All policy, guidance and implementation measures relating to capital projects is published on the Construction Procurement Reform website  where the Capital Works Management Framework provides a suite of best practice guidance, standard contracts and generic template documents. Tendering is dealt with through a range of guidance notes and template documents such as Suitability Assessment Questionnaires, Instructions to Tenderers and Forms of Tender which are published under the CWMF.  These documents may be downloaded and modified to suit each particular tender competition, and provides a consistent approach for contracting authorities to the management of public works projects.</p><p>  The Capital Works Management Framework (CWMF) was introduced on a phased basis from 2007 and became mandatory for all contracting authorities through the issue of Department of Finance Circular 06/10 on 5 May 2010. The documents are updated and augmented where appropriate to respond to new developments in the industry and changes in the regulatory environment.</p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the assessment of a tenderer's financial and economic standing is a key part of any procurement process because the contracting authority must be reasonably satisfied that a contractor will have the necessary capacity to carry out a contract if the contractor is awarded the contract. Establishing the appropriate suitability criteria that are relevant and appropriate to a particular contract is, of course, a matter for the contracting authority concerned. This is because the contracting authority is in the best position to gauge the appropriate levels of financial capacity that are appropriate to the needs of that specific contract. My Department has developed specific national guidelines for contracting authorities in relation to minimum standards for suitability criteria for construction contractors interested in tendering for public works projects; published as part of the Capital Works Management Framework (Guidance Note 2.3.1.3 Suitability Criteria for Works Contractors Minimum Standards refers.  )  In this regard, it is important to point out that there are no centrally imposed requirements for a minimum turnover. Such requirements would logically be developed on a case by case basis with reference to the specific needs of the contract.</p><p>  The Government recognises that the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is very important to the economy and that public procurement can be a source of business for SMEs. In this regard, my Department has issued public procurement guidelines (Circular 10/10) to public bodies which are aimed at facilitating greater participation of SMEs in public procurement opportunities. In relation to suitability criteria, the guidelines stress that public bodies must ensure that any criteria/turnover levels set by them must be both justifiable and proportionate to the needs of the contract.</p></reply>

The Chief Executive Officers of the relevant NSPS bodies and Tourism Ireland meet as the NSPS CEO Pension Committee, which exercises trustee-like functions in relation to the Scheme. </p><p>  As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I am jointly responsible, along with the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, currently Mr Simon Hamilton, for the rules of the North/South Pension Scheme, and in particular for approving amendments which may be proposed to those rules. In exercise of my responsibilities in relation to the Scheme, I and my officials have engaged in correspondence and discussion about reforms to the NSPS rules with my counterpart Northern Ireland Minister and his officials.</p><p>  Review and reform of existing pension arrangements, including public sector pension arrangements, has been an ongoing feature of the pensions landscape in Ireland and the UK over recent times.  In this context it is natural that reforms to the North/South Pension Scheme would arise for consideration, and proposals in this regard have been discussed with the NSPS CEO Pension Committee.</p><p>  Pending further development of these proposed reforms, and mindful that there is ongoing discussion with trade union interests on the proposed changes, I do not intend to elaborate at this juncture on the possible final specific content of the rule amendments which may arise.  I can however confirm to the Deputy my intention that the changes will, to the extent that is consistent with legal norms in each jurisdiction, apply to southern and northern NSPS members alike, including staff of Waterways Ireland in this jurisdiction.  This uniformity of application would reflect the fundamental all-Ireland character of the Scheme, to which successive Governments have been committed.</p></reply>

In this regard the matter should be raised with the Council.</p><p>  With regard to localised flooding generally, it is open to Galway County Council to submit an application under the OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works &amp;amp; Coastal Protection Scheme. Any application received will be assessed under the eligibility criteria, which includes a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and have regard to the overall availability of funding.  Application forms and related guidelines are available on the OPW website (www.opw.ie) under Flood Risk Management.</p></reply>

In 2012, the sector had exports of over &euro;450M, and employment of over 2,500 people.  </p><p>  The State has invested heavily through Science Foundation Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland in the development of a World-class Research Infrastructure by funding industry-academic research collaborations, Industry-led research programmes/Technology Centres and the Applied Research Enhancement Programmes through the likes of the National Institute for Bioprocess Research and Training (NIBRT), the Solid State Pharmaceutics cluster and the Pharma Technology Centre.

The functions will then be carried out by the Local Authorities on behalf of Enterprise Ireland through the establishment of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in each Local Authority area.  There will be 31 such LEOs in total.</p><p>  When established, the LEOs will become the first-stop-shop through which 1) information on national and local supports for business can be accessed, 2) where new start-up and micro (less than 10 employees) can be grant-aided and where small businesses (more than 10) can receive training and mentoring, and 3) where businesses with clear high growth potential can be fast-tracked to the next level of support from Enterprise Ireland.  The LEOs will deliver tailored supports (benchmarked by Enterprise Ireland through its Centre of Excellence) that will enhance the promotion, creation and maintenance of employment and nurture entrepreneurship and innovation. </p><p>  To date, key elements of the project that have been achieved include staffing structures and locations for the LEOs were identified, a Centre of Excellence was established in Enterprise Ireland and a framework Service Level Agreement between Enterprise Ireland and the Local Authorities for the LEOs was published.  Other administrative measures necessary to effect the reform are also significantly advanced in such areas as financial management, website development, training and performance metrics.</p><p>  I am confident that this new comprehensive approach will energise the entrepreneurship culture at local level leading to the start-up and expansion of businesses and the creation of employment.</p></reply>

The Forf&aacute;s report on &ldquo;The Review and Audit of Licences&rdquo;, which assessed 159 licences across key sectors of the economy, estimated that a medium sized supermarket may require up to 20 licences issued by different licensing authorities.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s report recommended the introduction of an integrated licensing system.  The Government considers this project to be of significant importance and has positioned it as one of the Disruptive Reforms in the Action Plan for Jobs 2013.  Such an integrated licensing system, which will streamline the licensing application process, is a reformative step in reducing the administrative burdens for business.  A key goal of the proposed system is to support the licence application process through the provision of a single portal or website through which businesses will be able to apply for, and renew, a multiplicity of licences.  The new licensing system will be developed for the retail sector in the first instance and rolled out to other sectors of the economy thereafter.</p><p>  The delivery of an integrated licensing application system for business offers real potential to ease the process of starting up a business in Ireland and should significantly reduce the work involved in annual renewals of licences.  It will also contribute to maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s position at the forefront of delivering advanced eGovernment services and using Information Technology to reduce costs for business and improve the delivery of services to business. </p><p>  The Integrated Licensing Application System should also provide productivity and efficiency gains in the public sector by streamlining the administration of licensing processes and the potential for more integrated inspection and compliance systems in the future and better application of rick-based enforcement.</p><p>  It is expected that the delivery of the system will be in Quarter 2 of 2014. </p></reply>

The SME Credit Guarantee Scheme has been live since 24<sup>th</sup> October 2012 and is intended to address market failure affecting commercially viable businesses.  It provides a 75% State guarantee to banks against losses on qualifying loans to firms with growth and job creation potential. The Scheme is intended to facilitate up to &euro;150 million of additional lending to eligible SMEs per annum, over the three year cycle. </p><p>  Target groups are commercially viable SMEs, i.e. well performing companies that have a solid business plan and a defined market for their products or services, thereby demonstrating their ability to repay the loan, but that do not secure credit facilities due to the following two market failures:</p><p>1) Insufficient collateral for the additional facilities, or,</p><p>2) Growth/expansionary SMEs which due to their sectors, markets or business model are perceived as a higher risk under current credit risk evaluation practices.</p><p>  To be eligible for the guarantee, businesses must have applied for credit, and must have been refused for either of these two reasons.  Ulster Bank, AIB and Bank of Ireland are participating in the Scheme.  </p><p>  The second initiative is the Microenterprise Loan Fund which was established by Government to improve access to credit for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises and to facilitate the growth and expansion of viable businesses from all industry sectors which have been refused access to credit by banks.   </p><p>Microfinance Ireland opened for business on 1<sup>st</sup> October 2012 and provides support in the form of loans for up to &euro;25,000 to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises employing less than 10 people, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks.  The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.  To be eligible for a loan, persons must possess a business plan, must have a commercially viable proposal, must confirm that they have been refused credit from a bank, and must have the capacity to repay the loan.  It is intended that the Fund will generate over &euro;90m in loan expenditure over a 10 year period.</p><p>My Department publishes quarterly progress reports on the Microenterprise Loan Fund and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme on my Department&rsquo;s website www.enterprise.gov.ie. The progress reports detailing the analysis and performance of both Schemes for the quarterly period ending 30<sup>th </sup>September 2013 are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.

The Patents Office was established in Kilkenny under a decentralisation programme in the late 1990s; the Carlow office was established under the Government&rsquo;s decentralisation programme in 2004.<table><tr><th>Location</th><th><div>Number of Staff <br /><br />(Full time equivalent)</div></th></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td><div>628.42 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Carlow (Companies Registration Office and the National Employment Rights Authority(NERA))</td><td><div>96.93 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny (Patents Office)</td><td><div>51.13 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Shannon (NERA)</td><td><div>11.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Cork (NERA)</td><td><div>7.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Sligo (NERA)</td><td><div>9.00 </div></td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td><div>803.47 </div></td></tr></table></p><p>  The detailed level of information sought by the Deputy in relation to travel costs associated solely with travel between our Dublin and non-Dublin locations is not immediately available as travel costs associated with each Office is not recorded in a manner that immediately distinguishes between different categories of business travel.  It would require a very significant redirection of Departmental resources to seek to provide dis-aggregated travel data specific only to journeys to and from Dublin for meetings.  It should be noted that inspectors for NERA are regionally based and hearings for the Employment Appeals Tribunal are similarly organised. To identify travel or expenses solely incurred on the basis sought would be extremely difficult.  I can, however, advise the Deputy that travel and subsistence payments are made in line with Department of Public Expenditure and Reform instructions and travel is only authorised having due regard to value for money.  Travel costs between Dublin and the provincial locations are generally paid at the applicable return train fare rates save in exceptional circumstances where an officer is required to transport a significant level of files or equipment to/from Dublin and mileage would accrue in respect of the use by the officer of his/her car.</p><p>  Finally, Video Conferencing facilities are available in all decentralised offices and in Dublin, and these facilities are regularly used to facilitate staff attending meetings without the need to travel.  Likewise, where appropriate, Video Conferencing is also regularly used to conduct business between the Department and our colleagues in the Permanent Representation in Brussels.</p></reply>

That Agency keeps in regular contact with its client companies, to ensure that any concerns or issues can be addressed promptly, to seek to enhance opportunities for the companies, to embed and expand their operations here and to explore linkages and other wider economic benefits that can be developed.  This process was, and remains, very active in the case of the three companies referred to in these questions. </p><p>  In addition, I myself avail of opportunities to meet senior representatives of the multinational companies operating here, both at local management level and also with more senior foreign-based executives, whenever possible.  In the case of one of the companies mentioned, I met with senior officials from the US parent company only last month.  Nothing more could have been done to avoid these recent redundancies. </p><p>  A feature of the Pharmaceutical sector at present is that it is going through a process of change, largely driven by recent mergers, which have resulted in excess capacity and a requirement to review operations and reduce costs.  In the case of one of the companies referred to, the new amalgamated company has 90 plants worldwide and needs to reduce that by 42, and the recent announcement included one of its several Irish operations. Other challenges facing the sector include patent expiry and changing trends, costs and dynamics.  These factors are totally outside our control.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the ultimate decision in all these cases is made by the parent company, on strictly commercial grounds, and on what is seen by the companies as being in the best interests of the group as a whole. </p><p>  In the case of the three sets of job losses referred to, the announcements were made a corporate level without advance notice to my Department.  </p><p>  Despite these setbacks, the future for the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices sectors in Ireland is very promising.  Additional jobs have been created in growth areas and most companies in the sector have been investing heavily in their Irish operations over recent years.  Prospects for finding a new buyer for the one plant recently scheduled for total closure are quite high and the IDA are working closely with the company and with potential buyers to advance that process.  It is heartening that in the case of three recent Pharmaceutical plant closures in Ireland, new buyers have been found through the efforts of the IDA and those plants are now back in production with healthy employment levels. </p><p>  We will continue to engage closely with these companies but it is an unfortunate fact that significant change is a feature of the industry.  While it is never possible to make absolute predictions about future redundancies, and there will inevitably be occasional rationalizations and changes, the outlook for these sectors overall, is promising.</p></reply>

Contracts are normally placed for a fixed period or for a defined piece of work.  If further support or development is required when a contract expires, this would normally be the subject of a new tender process.  For some IT support costs, such as proprietary software licenses, where open tendering is not always possible, my Department is engaged in an on-going process to ensure that such costs are kept to a minimum.  In general, my Department has engaged in an ongoing process of ICT support cost management, through the use of tendering, retiring older technologies, and insourcing supports where specialist skills become available in-house.  In the period between 2010 and 2012, this pro-active approach to IT support cost management has given rise to savings which in 2012 amounted to &euro;660,000 on the 2010 figure.  It is expected that the 2013 full year savings will be greater.</p></reply>

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. SWA can consist of a basic primary weekly payment and/or a weekly/monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses a person may not be able to meet (e.g. rent supplement).  It can also consist of a once-off payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs of a once-off nature.  The Government has provided approximately &euro;718 million for the various SWA schemes in 2013.</p><p>  Basic weekly SWA may be payable to anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residence condition and a means test, has registered for employment, unless they have a physical or mental disability, and can prove unemployment, or anyone who is awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare or Health Service Executive payment.  The Government has provided &euro;161.4 million for the basic SWA scheme in 2013.</p><p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The Government has provided over &euro;403 million for rent supplement in 2013.  </p><p>  In order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement.  A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by the relevant local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support. </p><p>  In all other cases, a person who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by the local housing authority in the area where claim to rent supplement is made (and the person intends to reside).  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. Policy in relation to the assessment of housing need is a matter for the Minister for the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>  Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Department may make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional and unforeseen expenditure which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  It is expected that the expenditure on the ENP scheme in 2013 will be in excess of &euro;35 million. </p><p>  There is no automatic entitlement to a payment. ENP&rsquo;s are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.  ENPs are not subject to the habitual residence condition.</p><p>  Where a claimant&rsquo;s safety and wellbeing are at risk due to domestic violence Department officials administering the SWA scheme have discretionary powers to expedite the award of a payment to the person in question.  I am satisfied that the discretionary powers available to Department officials administering the SWA scheme are appropriate to assist those affected by domestic violence.</p></reply>

Currently, almost 200 public bodies are covered by 112 language schemes and my Department is actively engaged in the process of agreeing inaugural and subsequent schemes with a large number of public bodies. </p><p>  It is important to recognise that this is an ongoing process designed to improve the provision of State services in Irish over a period of time. It must be noted also that the process can be challenging for public bodies, particularly having regard to current resource pressures. A number of measures to improve the effectiveness of the language scheme process are being considered in the context of the proposed Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2014. </p><p>  The primary objective of the Official Languages Act is to ensure better availability and a higher standard of public services through Irish. The Act has been framed in the light of the constitutional position afforded to the Irish language by virtue of Article 8 of the Constitution of Ireland and how that article has been interpreted by the Supreme Court.</p><p>  It is intended to submit a memorandum to Government shortly on the Heads of the proposed Official Languages (Amendment) Bill 2014. Subject to approval by Government, it is intended to subsequently publish the Heads together with the results of the consultation process on the review of the Official Languages Act. The Heads will also be brought to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht for consideration. </p></reply>

The language planning process has as its core objective the strengthening of the language as a community and household language in the Gaeltacht. In order to progress the implementation of the language planning process on the ground, the following measures are nearing completion: Notices to designate the first 3 of the 26 Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas will be published very shortly, in line with section 7(3) of the Act.  The language planning guidelines, which will explain the language planning process under the Act, are being finalised.  &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is finalising a suitably robust and transparent system by which organisations will be selected to prepare and implement language plans in the Gaeltacht Language Planning Areas.  The <i>Comprehensive Linguistic Study of the Use of Irish in the Gaeltacht (2007) </i>  is being updated in order to establish the current baseline status of the language in the Gaeltacht. This work, which was commissioned by &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, is being undertaken by NIRSA (the National Institute for Regional and Spatial Analysis). </p><p>  The Deputy will also be aware that my Department and &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta operate a wide range of schemes in the Gaeltacht. It is envisaged that the implementation of the language planning process under the Gaeltacht Act, coupled with the continuing implementation of the various schemes, will further strengthen the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.  The language planning process and the various schemes are, of course, closely aligned with the <i>20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030</i>  , which is the overarching policy document for the promotion of Irish, both within the Gaeltacht and outside it. In this regard, a special allocation of &euro;0.5 million has been provided to support the Strategy in the 2014 Estimates.</p></reply>

There are also long-standing provisions which allow for the payment of an acting-up allowance when a member of staff is required to carry out the duties of a higher grade for an extended period.  The provisions governing these payments are agreed centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and are implemented at local level by my Department and the bodies under its aegis.</p><p>  The principle of flexibility in relation to the undertaking of additional grade-appropriate duties without additional remuneration is recognised in both the Haddington Road Agreement and its predecessors. As the Deputy will be aware, my Department was established in June 2011 and I am not aware of any arrangements being entered into by my Department, or the bodies under its aegis, that would contravene the principle whereby public servants are not paid additional remuneration for undertaking additional duties appropriate to the grade.</p></reply>

That research showed that Irish consumers spent almost &euro;4bn online in 2012. However, 70% of this online business is going out of Ireland. The research also showed that the amount of online purchasing continues to increase. </p><p>  One of the main focuses in the NDS is to significantly increase the level of digital adoption by small and micro businesses in Ireland. According to the most recent CSO statistics available, 93% of businesses have access to the internet, 70% have a website but only 1 in 4 are trading online.</p><p>  In response to this challenge, I am introducing a trading online voucher scheme targeted specifically at the small and micro enterprise sector. This scheme will see Irish businesses apply, through a competitive process, to receive up to &euro;2,500 to support them in developing an online trading presence. Trading online will enable small Irish companies to access wider markets, to survive, grow and create jobs. The vouchers are designed to help small Irish business to take advantage of the enormous opportunity the internet can bring. </p><p>  The trading online voucher scheme is being piloted in Dublin and 25 companies are currently being supported by the scheme. A second pilot scheme will be introduced after Christmas followed by a full national rollout of this scheme during 2014. I secured additional funding to enable national rollout in 2014, with a target of getting 2,000 businesses trading online over a two year period. </p><p>  More information on this initiative can be found on the NDS web page at </p></reply>

The Acts cover a wide range of minerals but exclude stone, sand, gravel and clay, peat, and petroleum/ natural gas. Mineral exploration (prospecting) and mining are regulated under the Acts through prospecting licences, that allow the holder to search for minerals but not to mine, and State Mining Leases and Licences (collectively State Mining Facilities) which govern the extraction of identified mineral deposits. It is unlawful to work minerals without a State Mining Facility.  The Minerals Development Act 1979 provides for a public notice procedure that must be undertaken before granting a State Mining Licence to work privately owned minerals, which affords the opportunity for mineral owners to make submissions to the Minister. The Act also provides for the payment of compensation to the mineral owner. is recouped from the Licensee as a condition of the licence. </p><p>  In addition to State Mining Facilities, a mining operation requires two key permits before mining activities can start. These are:- planning permission under the Planning &amp;amp; Development Acts and Regulations; and an Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Licence (IPPCL) issued by the Environmental Protection Agency. Environmental Impact Assessment regulations require the submission of an Environmental Impact Statement with every planning application for a mine. These processes provide for extensive rights of public consultation and opportunities for local opinion to be taken into account.</p></reply>

The State can only intervene to ensure access to broadband services in areas where the competitive market fails to deliver such services, as in the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS). My Department entered into a contract in late 2008 with Hutchison 3G Ireland Ltd (&ldquo;3&rdquo;) for the delivery of the NBS to certain designated Electoral Divisions. 85 out of the 106 Electoral Divisions in County Kerry, including the area of Glenbeigh, are covered under the NBS. The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses, including those in County Kerry. This will be achieved by providing: a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.</p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services. These developments have been facilitated through the implementation of measures in the National Broadband Plan, including the conclusion of ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, and the new regulatory regime for fixed line Next Generation Access and service bundles. Both of these measures are designed to incentivise the rollout of services by operators. </p><p>  In tandem with these developments, intensive work is underway in my Department to progress a State-led investment to secure the countrywide introduction of next generation broadband access. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector over the coming years, the results of which will inform the areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the National Broadband Plan.</p><p>  In designing the procurement process for the intervention, my Department will be required to comply with the EU State aid rules in relation to the technology to be rolled out. The European Commission's guidelines set out that as different technological solutions exist to provide broadband services, the tender should not favour or exclude any particular technology or network platform.</p><p>  Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules and it is expected that it will be launched in 2014.</p><p>  A number of commercial State companies and non-commercial State bodies are already leveraging their existing infrastructure to actively provide infrastructure and services to the telecommunications market. It is open to Local Authorities and State Agencies to consider the installation of ducting along any development and the potential contribution of State entities in this regard is recognised.</p><p>  Through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, I am committed to ensuring that all parts of Ireland have access to high speed broadband, with a view to ensuring that all citizens and businesses can participate fully in, and maximise the benefits of, a digitally enabled economy and society.</p></reply>

Implementation of this policy, as well as delivering substantial environmental benefits, is securing significant economic benefits for the State and our citizens. For example, the wind energy sector employs around 3,400 people in Ireland. In addition, the SEAI estimates that &euro;255 million in gas imports was avoided by wind energy in 2012 alone. Wind energy accounts for the largest proportion of our renewable energy resource. The development of wind energy projects must take account of the concerns of local communities in relation to the potential impacts of such projects in their areas. I have clearly stated my view that renewable energy developers must ensure that they undertake effective and timely communication from the initiation of projects right through to commissioning and operation. It is essential that local communities are engaged and consulted on an on-going basis.  Such an approach is of course also necessary in the development of community wind farms. There is real potential for wind farms to be developed and owned by local communities which would make an important contribution to improving public acceptance of the technology, and to ensuring benefits are delivered directly to the community in which a wind generation facility is located. </p><p>  SEAI has taken a number of initiatives aimed at fostering social acceptance of wind energy and the development of community wind farms. The report commissioned by the SEAI &quot;To Catch the Wind: the Potential for Community Ownership of Wind Farms in Ireland&quot;, provides a template for development of community wind farms. More recently, SEAI has commissioned research which will include guidance on the financial models for the execution of community wind energy projects. This research is nearing completion. All of this work develops the resource available to communities wishing to develop their own wind farms and avail of existing market supports such as the REFIT scheme and the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development, to which community wind farm project developers may apply through the regional Leadership Partnerships.</p></reply>

The definition of minerals in those Acts specifically excludes stone, sand, gravel and clay, so I have no remit in relation to stone quarrying. Financial terms for State Mining Facilities are set in accordance with Section 26 of the 1940 Act, which affords discretion as to the form of royalty or other payment that may be agreed for each facility, subject to the concurrence of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In proposing rates, attention is paid to: the economics of the deposit being leased, assessed by projected return on investment, having regard to mineral grades and accessibility; royalty rates internationally; the need to continue to attract international exploration funding; and the expectations of the State as mineral owners and the developer achieving a fair return depending on economic circumstances and recognising the need to allow for the many exploration failures.  Actual rates are then settled by negotiation on a case-by-case basis. There is typically an annual minimum payment ("Dead Rent") which merges into the royalty.</p><p>  Royalties for metalliferous mines are usually set on the basis of a percentage of net smelter return. For industrial minerals, the most common system is a royalty based on the tonnage extracted. Details of all State mining leases/ licences are published in the six-monthly report, which is laid before the Oireachtas as required under the Acts. The most recent such report relates to the six months ended 30 June 2013.</p><p>  While taxation is primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance, I would point out to the Deputy that the Corporation tax rate applicable to mining is 25%, twice the rate applicable to business generally. </p></reply>

The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the CER as an independent statutory regulator. Competition in electricity generation has been facilitated by European legislation and transposed into Irish law.  The EU adopted its first package of legislation aimed at the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets in 1996.  This has subsequently been followed by two other packages, the most recent of which was approved in 2009.  This legislation has allowed for competition in the electricity generation and in wholesale and retail supply markets.</p><p>  The Single Electricity Market (SEM) is the wholesale electricity market for Ireland and Northern Ireland.  The SEM came into operation on 1 November 2007 and commenced the trading of wholesale electricity in Ireland and Northern Ireland on an All-Island basis.  It consists of a gross mandatory pool market, into which all electricity generated on, or imported onto, the island of Ireland must be sold, and from which all wholesale electricity for consumption on or export from the island of Ireland must be purchased.  Independent analysis has indicated that the market has worked well and continues to deliver benefits to consumers through the use of efficient generation plant to meet demand across the whole island.  The SEM model of setting prices in a transparent and cost reflective manner is not only assisting to promote competition and attract new investment, it has also contributed to improvements in the availability of generation plants.</p><p>  The structure of the SEM has ensured that generators, including new players, have invested in the market, thus ensuring security of supply.  This is evidenced by decisions to invest in the Irish electricity market by a variety of market players.  Bord G&aacute;is opened its 440 Mega Watt (MW) Whitegate power station in 2010 and ESB commissioned its 435 MW Aghada power station in the same year.  The East West Electricity Interconnector (EWIC) commenced operation in 2012 with a capacity of 500 MW. Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) is currently constructing a 460 MW gas-fired power station at Great Island, Co. Wexford, and expect the plant to be operating from 2014.  The SEM has also facilitated the connection of over 2,400 MW of renewable energy to the grid.</p><p>  The SEM will continue to evolve in line with European electricity market developments, bearing in mind the primacy of the electricity customer when considering market evolution.</p></reply>

The Electricity Regulation Act 1999 provided for the establishment of the CER as an independent statutory regulator. On 1 November 2007 the Single Electricity Market (SEM) went live, commencing the trading of wholesale electricity in Ireland and Northern Ireland on an All-Island basis.  The SEM consists of a gross mandatory pool market, into which all electricity generated on or imported onto the island of Ireland must be sold, and from which all wholesale electricity for consumption or export from the island of Ireland must be purchased.</p><p>  Regarding smaller players entering the electricity generation market, in order to be built and/or to operate, a generation project must hold an Authorisation to Construct or Reconstruct a Generating Station and/or a Licence to Generate Electricity.  The CER is responsible for assessing and for granting or refusing to grant these licences.  The conditions imposed in the Authorisation and in the Licence to Generate must be met by the generator and compliance is monitored by the CER on an ongoing basis.  Under Regulation 13 of Statutory Instrument No. 60 of 2005, the CER authorises, by way of order, the construction or reconstruction of generating stations with installed capacities not exceeding 2 MW.  The approval process is based on the assessment of specific information submitted by the applicant that is less than that required under the full application process and takes into account their limited size and potential impact.</p><p>  I am mindful of the importance of well-functioning energy markets for business and domestic customers.  The Government remains firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on prices in electricity and gas markets.  New players have moved into electricity generation since 1996.  I welcome the entry of new players and increased competition.</p><p>  In the electricity supply markets, the CER has overseen the gradual liberalisation of the electricity supply market which culminated in full market opening in February 2005.  The regulatory framework created the appropriate environment for competition to develop and since then competition has increased in the business and domestic markets.  In 2010, the CER published its Roadmap to Deregulation, which set out the milestones for the end of price regulation.  All business markets were deregulated from 1 October 2010.  From April 2011, the domestic (residential) market was deregulated and so all suppliers are free to set their own tariffs.  The liberalisation of the electricity supply markets has seen the entry of companies such as SSE/Airtricity, BG Energy, Vayu, Energia, Endesa, PrePay Power and Pinergy.  These companies offer competition to Electric Ireland, the supply arm of the ESB.</p></reply>

On 1 November 2007 the Single Electricity Market (SEM), the all-island arrangements for the trading of wholesale electricity, was implemented.  The SEM is a gross mandatory pool which includes a marginal energy pricing system and an explicit Capacity Payment Mechanism (CPM).  At a high level, the SEM design consists of a centralised and mandatory all-island wholesale pool (or spot) market, through which generators and suppliers trade electricity.  Generators bid into this pool their own short-run costs for each half hour of the following day, which is mostly their fuel-related operating costs.  Based on this set of generator costs and on customer demand for electricity, the System Marginal Price (SMP) for each half-hour trading period is determined by SEMO, using a stack of the cheapest all-island generator cost bids necessary to meet all-island demand. </p><p>  The CPM is a fixed revenue mechanism which collects a pre-determined amount of money, the Annual Capacity Payment Sum (ACPS) from all suppliers and pays these funds to all available generation capacity in accordance with rules set out in the Trading and Settlement Code (TSC).  The value of the Annual Capacity Payment Sum is determined by the quantity or capacity requirement, determined as the amount of capacity required to exactly meet all-island generation security standard, and a price, determined as the annualised fixed costs of a best new entrant (BNE) plant.</p><p>  The SEM SMP and associated CPM does not disproportionately reward &quot;outdated&quot; plants.  In fact, due to the structure of the SEM more expensive or inefficient generators are &quot;out of merit&quot; and hence they are not run and are not paid the System Marginal Price (which equates to their short run marginal cost), thus keeping customers' bills down.</p></reply>

The all-island power system is already operating with one of the highest percentages of renewables anywhere in the world, relative to the size of the system, bringing unique challenges with regard to management of the variability of the generation while maintaining ongoing power system stability and security.  The DS3 work programme seeks to address these challenges bringing together many different strands, including development of financial incentive products for better plant performance, and development of new operational policies and system tools to use the portfolio to the best of its capabilities.  Standards for wind farms and conventional plant are also being reviewed to give enhanced operational flexibility for the future. </p><p>  With regard to the DS3 programme, my Department actively monitors progress through representation on the DS3 Advisory Council.  This Council, which was set up by Eirgrid and SONI to ensure that all stakeholders are represented within the DS3 programme, provides a forum through which my Department can provide guidance and take action where appropriate.</p></reply>

It provides physical access for all generators to a central market and it enables all users to avail of electricity from the central market at the most economic rates.  EirGrid's Grid 25 Programme is a Government endorsed strategy to develop the transmission network to ensure nationwide safe, secure and affordable electricity supply supporting economic growth, and renewable and sustainable energy.</p><p>  Annually, EirGrid as Transmission System Operator and the Commission for Energy Regulation, estimate the total revenue requirement in order to ensure recovery of all costs associated with the operation, development and planning of the transmission network in a particular tariff year, of which Grid 25 costs are one component.  This revenue is recovered through Transmission Use of System (TUoS) tariffs from all users of the system, including generators and demand customers.  There are rules outlining cost sharing of network technical adaptations and these are published by EirGrid and approved by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  In general, approximately 25% of network costs are recovered from all generators, including wind farms, with the remainder of the costs being recovered from suppliers and users.  Charges to specific generators connected to the system are based on the generator's capacity and are site specific, differing according to the location of the generator.  However, where assets are being specifically constructed for the purposes of the direct connection of a party (such as a wind farm) to the transmission network, typically termed its &quot;shallow connection&quot;, the generator will contribute 100% of the capital costs for the connection.  </p></reply>

EirGrid's Grid25 national programme is vital for future socioeconomic progress in Ireland.  Grid25 represents an investment in the transmission system of &euro;3.2 billion over approximately 15 to 20 years, and is central to ensuring Ireland develops a power system that meets our future energy needs in a sustainable manner.  Grid25 will reduce our dependency on imported fossil fuels by putting the infrastructure in place to enable us use our own natural resources, help us create less carbon waste and enable us to reach our mandatory 40% renewable electricity targets by 2020.</p><p>  In the Government Policy Statement on the Strategic Importance of Transmission and Other Energy Infrastructure of July 2012, the imperative for the State Companies, and all developers of energy projects, of having early, transparent engagement and consultation with local communities and stakeholder was emphasised.  The Government recognises that people are concerned about the impact of new transmission lines and other infrastructure on the landscape, the environment and local communities.  I am aware that EirGrid is fully committed to extensive public consultation and that the company has been engaging in a comprehensive process in regard to the Grid25 projects.</p></reply>

It is a matter solely for the housing authority concerned to determine whether an applicant for social housing support is eligible for and in need of that support in accordance with the provisions of section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, regulations made under that section, and having regard to the particular circumstances of the case.  </p><p>  Regulation 22(1) of the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 provides that a household with alternative accommodation that would meet its housing need is ineligible for social housing support.  Paragraph (2) of the Regulation clarifies that paragraph (1) does not operate to exclude from eligibility for social housing support an applicant who owns accommodation that is occupied by his or her spouse, from whom he or she is formally separated or divorced.  Under the enactment, a deed of separation is sufficient to set aside this ineligibility ground and it is not necessary to await judicial separation or divorce to get a decision on social housing support in these cases.  This provision is reasonable in most cases.  </p><p>  I acknowledge, however, that situations relating to household members who have separated may exceptionally arise that may not easily be dealt with under the current Regulations. <b></b>Persons who are forced to leave their homes due to domestic violence may however be placed in accommodation arranged by local authorities without having to be entered on the waiting list.  In the longer term, victims of domestic violence may qualify under section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 for entry on a waiting list for social housing support if, in addition to meeting the normal eligibility criteria, the housing authority considers that their current accommodation is unsuitable, having regard to particular household circumstances or on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.  </p><p>  As part of an ongoing review of the 2011 Regulations, my Department is examining such scenarios and in particular whether specific provision is required in respect of separated persons applying for social housing support who own dwellings occupied by spouses from whom they are separated, but where no court order or deed of separation is in place.</p></reply>

The Expert Group reported that the majority scientific opinion was that no adverse short- or long-term effects have been demonstrated from exposure to electromagnetic fields at levels below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). </p><p>  A substantial volume of research on this issue is being carried out internationally by regulatory bodies with responsibilities for monitoring the health effects of electromagnetic fields.  The findings of this research are being monitored by the World Health Organisation's (WHO) EMF Project; it is expected that a report will issue in 2014.  My Department will continue to monitor this and other scientific evidence as it is made available, and will consider any policy implications in this context.</p></reply>

However, the owner is entitled to a 100% refund if the property is <b>vacant</b> for specified purposes. These are where the premises are unoccupied for the purpose of the execution of additions, alterations or repairs; where the owner is <i>bona fide</i> unable to obtain a suitable tenant at a reasonable rent; and where the premises are <b>vacant</b> pending redevelopment.</p><p>  A small number of urban local authorities have historically had separate legal provision enabling a refund of 50% of rates on <b>vacant</b> properties. While the same criteria for refunds apply, 50% of the rates paid is refundable to the owner of <b>vacant</b> premises in the cities of Dublin, Limerick and Cork. These legislative provisions are</p><p>  - section 71 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act 1930;</p><p>  - section 29 of the Limerick City Management Act 1934; and </p><p>  - section 20 of the Cork City Management (Amendment) Act 1941.</p><p>The majority of local authorities are, currently, subject to the provisions of the 1946 Act and the 100% refund regime.  Section 31(b) of the Local Government Bill 2013, as published, seeks to amend the Local Government Act 1946 by reducing the 100% refund regime to 50% for all local authorities, effectively reducing the refund rate to the same level as currently pertains in Dublin, Limerick and Cork cities. </p><p>  In introducing the Bill into the D&aacute;il in October I indicated that I am aware there are numerous factors to be considered when proposing an amendment to rates legislation including its effect on business sentiment and its impact on local government finance.  I intend that the provision is not a further cost on business and will not have unintended consequences in practice.  I have considered the debate on the provision that has taken place during the Bill&rsquo;s passage through the Oireachtas to date. On foot of that, I propose to introduce an amendment to the Bill at Seanad Committee Stage to provide elected members with discretion in the operation of vacancy refunds, allowing members to respond to local economic circumstances.</p></reply>

Section 11 of the Roads Act empowers a local authority, by order, to declare any road over which a public right of way exists to be a public road. Before making an order the local authority must be satisfied the road is of general public utility, consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge and consult with the public/consider any objections received. The consideration of the objections and the making of the order declaring the road to be a public road is a reserved function, so that the decision whether to take the road in charge is ultimately one for the discretion of the elected members.</p><p>  In relation to estates which have not have been completed to the satisfaction of the planning authority and where enforcement proceedings have not been commenced within the relevant period, section 180 also provides that the planning authority must, if requested to do so by the majority of the owners (but not the developer) initiate the procedures in section 11 of the Roads Act. However in this case the section provides that the provision in section 11 of the Roads Act requiring the authority to consider the financial implications of taking the road in charge is to be disregarded.

This included, <i>inter alia</i>, guidance on:</p><p>  - Purpose of securities;</p><p>  - Types of securities;</p><p>  - Requirements for securities;</p><p>  - Default events;   </p><p>  - Securities in phased developments;</p><p>  - Assessment of security mechanisms;   </p><p>  - Computation of bonds; and,</p><p>  - Release of bonds. </p><p>This guidance can also be found on my Department&rsquo;s website.</p><p>  In addressing the wide variety of challenges posed by unfinished housing developments, my Department has also played a coordinating role for local authorities, developers and receivers, and the banking sector. The National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments, which I chair, was established as a response to the report of the advisory group on unfinished housing developments and has harnessed the expertise and goodwill of the construction and banking sectors, local authorities, residents&rsquo; representatives and NAMA. As the 2013 Unfinished Housing Developments Progress Report shows, this coordinated response is producing results, and I am satisfied that no further legislative responses are required at this time.</p></reply>

This year, my Department is providing funding of over &euro;62 million to Dublin City Council in respect of the 2013 social housing programme. This includes over &euro;9.7 million for remedial works to housing estates and flat complexes in Dublin City and almost &euro;3 million for energy retrofitting works, including works to a number of flat complexes.  My Department has submitted a proposal under the EU Structural and Investment funds 2014 -2020, as part of the South and East Regional Operational Programme, for the deep retrofitting of some 2,000 apartments and flats, some 1,500 of which are located in Dublin. Glovers Court is included as part of this proposal. A decision on this application is awaited.</p></reply>

The approach and structure envisaged for these Committees is consistent with the provisions for Community-led Local Development as set out in the draft Common Provisions Regulation for European Structural and Investment Funds 2014-2020. Given that detailed regulations for the management and control of such funds are not yet published, it would be premature to determine the funding distribution model to be used; however, any distribution model used will be consistent with all EU regulations.</p><p>  The current Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), which is implemented through the Local Development Companies, comes to an end at the end of 2013. A successor programme to the LCDP is currently being designed based on, inter alia, the main findings of the d-Term Review of the Programme. To facilitate the redesign of the programme and to allow for the establishment of the LCDCs in line with enhancing the role of local government in local and community development, transitional arrangements will apply for the first six months of 2014, which will entail the current LCDP framework being extended to 30 June 2014, on the same basis as the present arrangement. From 1 July 2014 the LCDCs will have oversight and management of the LCDP, based on the current programme framework.  A new programme will roll out, through the LCDCs, from January 2015.</p></reply>

KCS is based on the international paradigm of Risk Management which addresses the critical elements of fire prevention and fire protection as well as response. The Risk Management approach, which is described in Chapter 2 of KCS, generally involves five stages including identifying hazards and evaluating the risks these hazards pose; mitigating these risks by trying to reduce the probability of the event occurring and/or its consequences if it does occur; planning and preparing to deal with the risk; responding to an event; and reviewing events with a view to learning for the future.</p><p>  The use of an &lsquo;area risk categorisation&rsquo; system is central to the approach in KCS which is being applied across the country by all fire services. This will result in fire station areas being graded across five bands from very high to very low risk categories.  The fire service approach to risk management in an area, including response capacity in terms of numbers of fire appliances and fire crews, is reviewed on the basis of this risk categorisation. It is the predominant risk in an area that defines the risk categorisation. However, KCS provides that in some cases with extensive or widely varying station grounds, it may be appropriate to sub-divide the station area and have different risk categories.</p><p>  KCS sets out the approach and criteria for use by local fire service management in arriving at decisions on the risk category to be assigned to a station area, one of which is: <i>&quot;Extent of Individual Special Hazards (e.g. Institutional, Educational, Industrial, Lar</i><i>ge Scale Retail/Commercial, SEVESO,</i><i>Places of Public Assembly</i><i>etc.)&rdquo;.</i><i></i>The overall approach to undertaking the Area Risk Categorisation Process relies on available data including census data and Risk-Based Approach Reports based on actual fire service activity, the use of local knowledge and operational intelligence, previously undertaken Major Emergency Risk Assessments and other available sources. KCS notes that specific hazard sites, such as SEVESO plants, are closely regulated and already the focus of significant risk mitigation work which includes external site response plans and exercises involving the principal response agencies. Buildings or sites which are of special interest because of their scale and importance to a community or region may not therefore of themselves be high risk, and the presence in an area of such facilities would not necessarily raise an area to high risk or very high risk category in the KCS area risk categorisation process.</p><p>  In accordance with the Framework for Major Emergency Management, which was adopted by Government in 2006, the relevant divisions of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Health Service Executive and the Local Authorities have carried out both individual and joint risk assessments for their functional areas and have prepared Major Emergency Plans, undertaken inter-agency training and carried out exercises on potential emergency scenarios. As part of this process, they have worked collaboratively with SEVESO site operators in accordance with a guidance document which was prepared specifically for this purpose. The central competent authority for the enforcement of the Seveso II Directive is the Health and Safety Authority, while responsibility for the transposition into Irish Law of the new SEVESO Directive (Directive 2012/18/EU) lies with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p></reply>

The self-assessed Charge is set at &euro;200 per annum and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties. It is a matter for an owner to determine if he or she has a liability and, if so, to declare that liability and pay the Charge.  Under the Act, it is a function of a local authority to collect Non-Principal Private Residence Charges, and late payment fees due to it and all Charges and late payment fees imposed and payable to a local authority are under the care and management of the local authority concerned.</p><p>  This year will be the final year of the operation of the Non-Principal Private Residence Charge.  Since its introduction in 2009, the Charge has been an important source of revenue for local authorities and has funded the provision of vital local services.  The following table, based on the most up to date data provided by the Local Government Management Agency, which manages the Charge database, provides details of the number of properties registered and the revenue collected in respect of each liability date.   <table><tr><th>Year of Liability </th><th>Properties Registered </th><th>Charge Collected </th></tr><tr><td>2009 </td><td>339,434 </td><td>&euro;83.9m </td></tr><tr><td>2010 </td><td>342,455 </td><td>&euro;82.8m </td></tr><tr><td>2011 </td><td>346,415 </td><td>&euro;79.1m </td></tr><tr><td>2012 </td><td>358,834 </td><td>&euro;77.3m </td></tr><tr><td>2013 </td><td>348,321 </td><td>&euro;71.3m </td></tr></table></p><p>It has not been possible, in the time available, to collate more detailed data of the kind requested in the questions.

In this regard, local authorities are required to put in place arrangements to ensure that systems, procedures and time frames equivalent to those used by them in relation to correspondence from local authority members also apply in respect of parliamentary representatives.

Details of activities funded through the Fund are set out in the Environment Fund annual accounts which are available on my Department&rsquo;s website, ().</p><p>  The Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund supports a wide variety of local, environmentally beneficial projects.  In 2013, for example, 43% of funding went to Training, Education and Awareness Raising, 23% went to school/community gardens and allotments, 22% went to Development of Community Areas including Wildlife and Biodiversity, 6% went to composting and rainwater harvesting, 2% went to Repair, Reuse and Recycling, 2% to audit, survey and action planning and 2% to other environment related projects.  A list of the successful funding applications for 2012 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:</p><p>.   </p><p>  The following table sets out the total annual funding under the Local Agenda 21 Environmental Partnership Fund, for each of the past 10 years, together with the total number of projects funded. </p><p><b>Local Agenda Environmental Partnership Fund </b></p><p><b>Projects Funded since 2004</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>No. of Projects Funded</th><th>Total funding from Dept.&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>669</td><td>400,000</td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>490</td><td>337,000</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>517</td><td>383,750</td></tr><tr><td>2010</td><td>448</td><td>306,336</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>408</td><td>311,404</td></tr><tr><td>2008</td><td>387</td><td>332,022</td></tr><tr><td>2007</td><td>350</td><td>300,000</td></tr><tr><td>2006</td><td>269</td><td>250,000</td></tr><tr><td>2005</td><td>246</td><td>250,450</td></tr><tr><td>2004</td><td>208</td><td>300,000</td></tr></table></p><p>  While there is no specific legislation for the purpose of implementing Local Agenda 21, the principle of sustainability is incorporated into legislation and policies across a broad range of areas.<i>  Our Sustainable Future</i>, Ireland&rsquo;s Framework for Sustainable Development, which was published in June 2012, sets out a whole-of-Government approach to sustainable development and aims to embed this principle in policy-making processes across Departments and Agencies.</p></reply>

The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.

There are currently 4,364 persons seeking international protection residing in 34 Direct Provision accommodation centres across 16 counties under contract to RIA.  Of these residents, approximately a third are children under the age of 18.</p><p>  I should firstly commend to the Deputy RIA's 2012 Annual Report available on its website - www.ria.gov.ie - which  includes greater detail than before on family make up in centres as well as additional information on facilities for children in each of the centres involved.</p><p>  The Direct Provision system is unique and there is no direct comparison with other types of accommodation where children would reside, be they houses with gardens or apartment buildings. Some accommodation centres have more outdoor and indoor facilities than others.  However, any suggestions that children in these centres do not have opportunities for meaningful recreation activities are wide of the mark. Further details are available in the Report mentioned above. Of the current 34 asylum centres in RIA's portfolio, only 3 were specifically built for the sole purpose of accommodating asylum seekers, that is, they were 'purpose-built'.  All other centres must operate within the physical limitations of the premises' original use e.g. hotel, college dormitory, hostel, etc.  While all conform, at the very least, to minimum contractual and legislative standards, there are necessarily a range of facilities available in centres in the overall RIA portfolio, deriving from their original use.</p><p>  RIA and centre management work with local schools, community groups, sports clubs and NGO's to link children and families into community initiatives, sports and other activities to ensure access to the best available package of services. Children of asylum seekers can access recreational facilities available in the locality in which they are living.  Some Direct Provision Centres have on-site playgrounds.  Many centres will also facilitate NGO&rsquo;s who organise outings etc. Centres also have links with local community facilities which allow for free and discounted access to amenities outside of the accommodation centre.</p><p>  It is worth noting that asylum seeker children benefit from access to primary and secondary education on the same basis as Irish citizen children in the local community, and both schools and the Community Welfare Service are very supportive of those children in assisting with any associated costs in respect of equipment and transport. An exemption from fees for State Examinations is also available to asylum seekers who are holders of medical cards. Homework clubs and quiet spaces are provided in family centres to facilitate children doing their homework. </p><p>  On-site pre-school services are available in some of the larger direct provision centres. However, in all cases parents may opt to send their children to privately run pre-schools in the community. The Early Child Care and Education (ECCE) Scheme provides for free pre-school placements to all children, including children of asylum seekers in direct provision accommodation. </p></reply>

This represents a reduction of almost 74% when compared to the highest level of cases on hand which was recorded in March 2008 at 231,970. The PRA has since that time been engaged in an active arrear clearance programme. Of the 60,115 cases on hand at end November 2013, 14,685 are the subjects of queries and cannot be proceeded with until a satisfactory reply is received. Outside of those cases under query, the net arrear, i.e. the number of cases on hand at 30 November 2013 was, therefore 45,431. It is worth noting that this reduction over a five year period has been brought about whilst also reducing the cost base of the PRA by more than 33% and reducing staff levels by some 25%. </p><p>  The length of time taken to complete a case varies depending on a number of factors. These include the complexity of the case, investigation of title requirements, the completeness of the documentation presented and mapping requirements - this is reflected in the turnaround times for different application types which are set out below:</p><p>-  All electronic applications (eDischarges of mortgages and eNursing Home charges) are completed within 2 working days;</p><p>-  75% of mainstream applications not requiring changes to the map, which are in order for registration, are completed within 10 working days;</p><p>-  91% of Copy Folio and Title Plan applications, received electronically, are issued within 24 hours of receipt of application;</p><p>-  94% of Official Map Searches are completed within 5 working days.</p><p>  The cases on hand also include cases which require a change to the map, first registration and other more complex cases. The first registration applications and similarly complex cases are governed by a detailed and often complex area of land law and the circumstances of each case dictate the nature and the processing time of each individual application.</p><p>  Where a case is urgent and this is brought to the attention of the PRA, in accordance with its customer service policy, the matter is dealt with expeditiously.  I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the number of cases on hand in the Land Registry is at the lowest level since 1997.</p></reply>

These concerns arose from the fact that the scope of the published Bill was limited to apartment developments and did not cater for the many mixed developments containing apartments, duplex units, and detached, semi-detached or terraced houses. This extension of the scope of the Bill required, inter alia, amended definitions of 'multi-unit development' in section 1 and the current section 2(2) which applies the sections set out in Schedule 2 to multi-unit developments containing houses, whether detached, semi-detached or terraced, and which have an OMC structure. It appears that the requirement to establish an OMC was a requirement of the planning permission in many of these cases.  </p><p>  I understand that this practice of requiring the establishment of an OMC in housing developments has ceased following instructions from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government. The taking-in-charge of such developments is a matter for the relevant local authority and I am aware that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has issued a guidance document to the local authorities on this matter.  <b><font color="#000080">   </font></b></p><p>  While I have no immediate plans to amend the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011, the operation of the Act is being kept under review in my Department.</p></reply>

These are:<table><tr><th>Location</th><th>Staff (Whole time equivalent) based outside Dublin (End October 2013)</th></tr><tr><td>Irish Prison Service Longford </td><td>115.63</td></tr><tr><td>Financial Shared Service Killarney<br /><br />(End of December 2013)</td><td>162.34</td></tr><tr><td>Office of the Data Protection Commissioner Portarlington</td><td>28.23</td></tr><tr><td>Equality Authority Roscrea</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>Property Services Regulatory Authority Navan</td><td>0.4</td></tr><tr><td>Coroners Office Navan</td><td>2.00</td></tr><tr><td>Private Security Authority Tipperary</td><td>32.8</td></tr><tr><td>Citizenship Tipperary</td><td>51.21</td></tr><tr><td>Inspector of Prisons Nenagh</td><td>5.00</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>419.91</td></tr></table></p><p>  In addition to the above the Probation Service provides a nationwide service and in so doing has a further 176 in whole-time equivalent terms located outside Dublin.  This means that a total of 595.91 staff are based outside of Dublin.</p><p>  The Deputy should also note that on 2 December just under 30 staff in whole-time equivalent terms transferred from the Department's Killarney Offices to the Payroll Shared Service Centre in Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>  The total staff in my Department is 1948 and of these almost 600 as set out above are based or located outside of Dublin.</p><p>  I am advised that the total cost incurred for travel and subsistence in respect of staff in the above locations, with the exception of the Equality Authority in Roscrea and IPS in Longford was &euro;165,821.15 in 2012 and in 2013 was &euro;161,683.93.  This related to travel by 137 staff in 2012 and 150 in 2013.  The Deputy should note that whilst a  proportion of this cost would have related to meetings in Dublin,  it would take a disproportionate amount of time and effort in analysing the travel and subsistence records to isolate Dublin as a location, to evaluate the purpose of the travel and calculate the number of meetings involved.</p><p>  The cost of travel and subsistence in respect of staff in the Irish Prison Service, paid in accordance with standard travel and subsistence rates, was &euro;396,000 in 2012 and &euro;322,00 in 2013.  The nature of the business of the Irish Prison Service is that it operates on a nationwide basis with major prison locations throughout the country as well as in Dublin.  Again, the Deputy should note that whilst a proportion of this cost would have related to meetings in Dublin, it is not possible to collate the cost of travel and subsistence to isolate Dublin as a location for the reasons stated above.</p><p>  In relation to video-conferencing I am advised that sophisticated video-conferencing units are already installed or are in the process of being installed in the following and create business efficiencies:</p><p> - The Irish Prison Service, Longford</p><p> - Financial Shared Services, Killarney</p><p> - The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, Portarlington</p><p> - The Private Security Authority and the Citizenship Division of INIS based in Tipperary</p><p>  In the other locations outside Dublin referenced above, I am advised that my Department continues to keep all of these locations under review and will consider requests for the installation of new or further units or the deployment of other technology to reduce the cost of travel and enhance business collaboration and efficiencies where appropriate business cases exist.</p><p>  My Department is also actively examining the deployment of other ICT technologies in 2014 and beyond in order to further enhance the ability of all business users to keep in touch and join meetings using a range of collaborative technologies.</p><p>  I am also aware that my Department has in place strict guidelines and protocols, in common with other civil service organisations, which govern the operation of the travel and subsistence provisions so as to minimise the expenditure incurred, including minimising the number of trips made, using public transport where available and sharing travel arrangements where practicable.</p></reply>

Consequently, these two forms of new practice model continue to be provided for in statute since that time and are not merely a recent innovation.</p><p>  Subsequently, the 'Report of the Legal Costs Working Group' published in November 2005 and that of the Competition Authority of December 2006 entitled 'Competition in Professional Services: Solicitors and Barristers', put forward detailed findings and recommendations in relation to greater transparency in the legal costs regime and by way of supporting the more competitive and consumer-focussed provision of legal services in the State. Indeed, the Competition Authority Report of 2006 provides a series of substantial observations that clearly identify and respond to the market concentration of legal services already resulting at that time from the delivery of those services within the confines of narrow historical models that could not be adequately responsive to the needs of current markets, business technologies and consumer behaviour. I cannot accept, therefore, the import of the Deputy's Question as put, that the interests of consumers and our international competitiveness would be better served by the mere retention of anti-competitive or restrictive business models in a sheltered legal services sector that would remain immune to the kind of structural reform that, in every other services sector, has proven itself essential to sustainable economic recovery at this time.</p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, numerous jurisdictions have introduced new and more customer-focussed legal business models in the intervening period since the Competition Authority's Report of 2006. These &quot;alternative business structures&quot; (ABS) can involve the traditional legal services provided by barristers and/or solicitors or combine them, in what  are known as &quot;multi-disciplinary practices&quot;, with those of accountants, insurance brokers, conveyancers or other professionals to provide seamless solutions for clients on a more cost-effective basis.  To ignore these changes would leave legal practitioners and the consumers of their services in this jurisdiction at a growing competitive disadvantage, not to mention continuing to disregard almost a quarter of a century of recommendations from public bodies such as the Fair Trade Commission.  Consequently, in looking to the future, the Legal Services Regulation Bill includes several measures aimed at opening up the provision of legal services in a way that takes account of the emergent legal business models. These will include new opportunities for legal practitioners to establish the types of multi-disciplinary practices mentioned; for solicitors and barristers to participate in legal partnerships; for legal practitioners working for private or State entities to be allowed to act as advocates in court proceedings for their employers; for practising barristers who share premises and costs as a group to be allowed to advertise themselves as such; for solicitors to employ barristers in a practice and for direct access to barristers in non-contentious matters that do not involve the holding of clients monies.</p><p>  It must be recognised that alternative business structures or multi-disciplinary practices and their attendant regulatory frameworks have been, or continue to be, rolled out  in other open economies like our own such as England and Wales, Scotland, Australia, Germany, Netherlands and parts of Canada, including British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario and that there is a wealth of information, regulatory precedent and academic analysis now available on them. The Legal Services Act 2007 provided for the introduction of ABS, including multi-disciplinary practices, in England and Wales - over 240 licences for ABS have been issued to date. The Legal Services (Scotland) Act 2010 also allows for ABS that include multi-disciplinary practices. In Canada, the legislation relates more narrowly to multi-disciplinary practices. Along with officials of my Department, I have been actively reviewing and considering in detail how the introduction of ABS is taking place in all of these jurisdictions along with the relevant literature and those submissions received.   I am also considering the various issues of probity and regulation so that they will continue to be addressed in the development of the Legal Services Regulation Bill.   </p><p>  The genesis and development of policy in this area, culminating in the policy imperatives of the Programme for Government and the EU/IMF/ECB Troika Memorandum to which I have already referred, are set-out in the Regulatory Impact Analysis of the Legal Services Regulation Bill that is available on the website of the Department of Justice and Equality via the internet link, www.justice.ie. Amendments to the Legal Services Regulation Bill are being considered by Government with a view to their be made available prior to the resumption of Committee Stage of the Bill which is expected to take place in the New Year. </p></reply>

By way of illustration, in 2012, INIS dealt with approximately 165,000 new applications across the broad immigration spectrum such as applications for visas, residence, protection and citizenship. Understandably, given that volume of activity a very large number of queries from Oireachtas Members on the status of individual applications are received by INIS. </p><p>  In recognition of the need to facilitate Oireachtas Members in submitting representations and queries and to provide timely and effective responses to all matters raised, a dedicated Oireachtas Members email service has been established by INIS. This service, for the exclusive use of Oireachtas Members, assists Members seeking information on individual cases while also enabling large volumes of queries to be dealt with speedily and efficiently. In 2012, almost 4,800 email queries were processed through the Oireachtas email service, with a similar volume being dealt with in 2013 to date. It is also the case that issues in respect of individual immigration cases are regularly raised through the Parliamentary Questions process and directly with my Private Office, all of which are responded to in an appropriate and timely manner.</p><p>  As I am sure the Deputy will agree the main priority for INIS must continue to be the processing of cases as expeditiously as possible. In that context and in view of the fact that an efficient email enquiry service is available to Oireachtas Members, I am of the opinion that the right balance is being struck between facilitating Members in making enquiries to INIS and the efficient processing of applications and that the provision of an enquiry line as suggested by the Deputy would have the effect of diverting scarce resources away from case processing.</p><p>  I do not see any current need or demand that would justify the extension of the system provided by INIS to other areas of my Department. Nor do I see any business need to establish an enquiry line for sole use by members of the Oireachtas.  It is always open to any member of the Oireachtas who has a concern which they wish to raise to write to my Department. </p></reply>

Such letters confirm that the individual has been accepted and enrolled on a course of full-time education. The applicants to whom the Deputy refers had submitted statements of financial support from the Libyan authorities for the purpose of pursuing English language studies and further third level studies in the State. However, they had  submitted letters of acceptance from English language schools only as they did not have confirmed plans at the time of application to pursue further third level studies in the State. As I indicated earlier, there are soundly based public policy reasons as to why letters of acceptance are also sought from third level institutions.</p><p>  Taking account of the fact that these students will be fully funded by the Libyan authorities, and subject to their meeting all the requirements for a visa for English language studies only,  it was deemed appropriate to make an exception in these cases and to forgo the requirement for letters of acceptance from third level institutions. In the event that these applicants are granted permission for English studies, they will have the option of applying to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department to extend that permission if they are accepted on a third level course and can demonstrate that they have reached the required standard of English. It is open to persons who may have been refused a visa in these circumstances to submit a fresh application.</p><p>  There have been no contacts between my Department and the Libyan Government in relation to student matters.</p></reply>

This service is provided by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  In addition, the office also provides a public service for applicants seeking re-entry visas and this service is administered by INIS. Also, on a daily basis the office receives a number of callers seeking information or for other business. In total the number of persons attending the office is in the region of 130,000 per annum.</p><p>  The nature of the services provided is such that it is demand led and accordingly, there are peaks and valleys in the numbers of callers at different times of the year. For example, there is marked increased demand for registrations during the period from late September to the end of November, linked to the academic year, when a significant number of students apply for first time registration or re-registration.  Equally, there is increased demand for re-entry visa services in early summer prior to the holiday period and also before Christmas and Easter.</p><p>  The Burgh offices are open for registrations from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday &ndash; Thursday and 7 a.m. &ndash; 6 p.m. on Fridays.  While this requires significant staff resources, the long opening hours is aimed at catering for applicants who may be studying or working and find it more convenient to come to the office outside of office hours. Specific times are set aside for certain categories of persons such as students. The public office for re-entry visas is open from 8 a.m. to approximately 2 p.m. Monday to Friday. However, in the vast majority of cases it is not necessary to attend in person for a re-entry visa as INIS operates a postal service which is a more efficient option for applicants. Where there are genuine emergencies and persons need to travel at short notice, INIS facilitates such persons to be dealt with in person. </p><p>   My Department&rsquo;s customer service charter encompasses INIS and the organisation is continually seeking to improve the quality of services provided to customers. A major overall of the public reception facilities in Burgh Quay with expanded dedicated areas for dealing with the public has recently been completed.  In addition, the immigration service is planning to introduce an on-line booking system for appointments which is part of a wider plan to transfer the registration function from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to INIS.  The aim of the booking system is to give certainty to customers that they will be dealt with within a stated time window and at the same time enabling the immigration service to match its staff resources to meet demand at any particular time.  The new reception facilities have been designed to cater for such a system.</p><p>  Finally, I might add that this office is probably one of the busiest Public Offices with some of the longest opening times in the State.  As I indicated earlier, around 130,000 persons attend the Burgh Quay office each year, which I am sure the Deputy will appreciate presents ongoing logistical challenges. I am advised that over the past 18 months there has been no unmanageable issues with queues taking into account the scale of the operation involved. I am confident that the measures outlined above will further improve the services provided to its customers calling to this office.               </p></reply>

It remains the responsibility of all non-EEA nationals who are resident in the State to ensure that they have an appropriate permission from the Minister for Justice and Equality and the great majority of migrants comply with this condition.  It does not follow logically that the solution to illegal migration is for the Irish State to reward those who engage in it.</p><p>  If a person is undocumented his/her case can be considered on its merits by officials in the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service of my Department and part of this consideration involves looking at the extent to which the person's situation is through no fault of his/her own.  Sometimes this consideration will result in a positive outcome for the applicant.   In other cases, the  decision by the Irish authorities, subject to the oversight of our Courts, would be that the person has to go home.  That decision should be respected.</p><p>  Broad regularisation programmes are problematic.  They could give rise to unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.  At EU Level, the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008 made specific commitments &quot;to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons&quot;.  While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual cases.  In our case there are also significant considerations based on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area with the UK which must be taken into account.</p><p>  Any significant departure from well established policies in this respect would have a major impact on the operation of the Common Travel Area both here and in the United Kingdom.</p><p>  Finally, I note that a figure of 30,000 is cited on the number of illegal immigrants in the State; by definition it is impossible to state with any accuracy the number of persons without lawful permission to remain in the State and in this respect, Ireland is no different to any other country.</p></reply>

In practice this is the card referred to by the Deputy. This fee is set by regulations made by the Minister for Justice and Equality with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The fee also applies in circumstances where, as a result of a card being lost or stolen, a new Registration Certificate has to be issued. The fee is currently &euro;300; it does not apply to those categories of persons subject to the fee waiver as set out in the Immigration Act 2004 (Registration Certificate Fee) Regulations 2012 (S.I. No. 444 of 2012).</p><p>  While my Department is, of course, prepared to look at the particular circumstances of every case where a person requires to have a lost or stolen certificate replaced, a strong case would have to be made as to why the fee for the reissue of the certificate should to be waived. Persons who are issued with a registration certificate should be aware that it is an important document which should be kept safely at all times. The loss or theft of a registration certificate should be reported immediately to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  </p></reply>

The various sections of the Charities Act are subject to implementation through commencement orders.  Sections that it was possible to commence in advance of the establishment of the Charities Regulatory Authority, as provided for under the Act, have been commenced.  The remainder will be commenced following the establishment of the Authority. </p><p>  The Deputy will appreciate that the full implementation of the Charities Act, including the establishment of the Authority and Register of Charities, has resource implications that had to be examined in the context of the urgent need to reduce government expenditure.  I delayed bringing this legislation into force in order to consider how best to achieve the objectives of the Act in this context.  It remains an objective of the Government to strengthen the regulation of the charitable sector in effective and proportionate ways.  To advance this, a public and stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the Charities Act 2009, and the establishment of a Register of Charities, was carried out by my Department earlier this year and published in July.  At that time the Government also approved my plans to proceed with the establishment of an independent Charities Regulatory Authority under the terms of the 2009 Charities Act.

My Department devotes considerable resources in protecting animal welfare and is continuing to work closely with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Local Authorities and with the ISPCA throughout the country in an effort to minimise the risks to horse welfare. This pro-active inter-agency approach in relation to horses has resulted in the seizure in recent weeks of large numbers of abandoned and undocumented horses, including in Wicklow and Cork. </p><p>  To date this year, my Department has paid in the region of &euro;2.8m to Local Authorities under the Control of Horses Act to assist them in dealing with stray and unwanted horses.  My Department also provides considerable financial support to animal welfare organisations to assist them in the delivery of animal care and welfare services.  In 2012, this funding amounted to &euro;1.36m to some 140 organisations to assist in their work in 2013 and I plan to make an allocation in respect of 2014 shortly.</p><p>  I should stress that it is the responsibility of horse owners to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and/or their care and to dispose of them appropriately. In this context, horse owners are reminded of the advice of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council that, where an owner can no longer adequately provide for their horse or where the horse can no longer fulfil the purpose for which it was bred, he or she should be proactive in seeking to dispose of the animal humanely. My Department is, of course, continuing to deal with any animal welfare issues relating to horses through its existing mechanisms and I have previously indicated that emergency funding is available to assist horse owners who cannot afford to pay for their humane disposal. </p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with local authorities, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and with animal welfare bodies to ensure that horse welfare is protected.  I urge the public to continue to avail of the Animal Welfare Helpline in operation by my Department, to report instances where animal welfare may be compromised on 1850 211 990.</p></reply>

The officers assigned to the unit carried out their first investigation in April 1986.  Since that time, staff members assigned to the unit have undertaken investigations into a range of matters pertaining to animal health and welfare and public health, to ensure the integrity of the food chain, to protect animal health and welfare and to ensure the integrity of the disbursement of public funds.</p><p>  The remit of the investigation unit is to;</p><p>  -  Investigate all suspected criminal breaches of all legislation pertaining to the food chain, including animal health, animal welfare, public health.</p><p>  -  Provide advice to other DAFM  Divisions regarding possible breaches and approach to investigations</p><p>  -  Cross-report findings back to relevant line Division, as appropriate</p><p>  -  Prepare  prosecution files, where appropriate,</p><p>  -  Present the evidence in Court as necessary.</p><p>  Staff from the unit operate to a specific published code of practice.</p><p>  Joint operations are regularly conducted with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, (NBCI, CAB, GBFI), the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, the Veterinary Council of Ireland, the PSNI, DARD NI, Customs &amp;amp; Excise, the Irish Medicines Board, OLAF and WGEO.</p><p>  Staff assigned to the unit have a range of primary qualifications in various areas related to their work, including law. They have undertaken a wide range of training to help them perform their duties, including up-skilling. Among the training events which were provided specifically for officers in the unit &ndash; additional to other training offered to other regulatory control officers, - include the following:</p><p>  -  A training exercise given by an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the practical aspects of the law relating to searching premises, securing evidence, taking memo&rsquo;s of interviews, the making and taking of statements.</p><p>  -  A training course covering the detailed process associated with the collection of cattle identity ear-tags as evidence supported by a forensic analyst from the state&rsquo;s Forensic Science Laboratory.</p><p>  -  A Legal Training course organised by the DAFM Training Division, involving a practicing barrister, familiar with DAFM cases.  The course involved workshop was geared specifically to explain the &ldquo;how&rdquo; and &ldquo;why&rdquo; of the investigators and prosecutors role and function.</p><p>  In addition, there are regular scientific training sessions attended by veterinary staff in line with the requirements of the Veterinary Practice Act. Furthermore, staff from the unit regularly meet, formally and informally, with other international investigation agency staff to appraise investigative techniques and to keep abreast of current best-practice.</p><p>  As the range and scope of the unit expanded over the years into investigating different areas of DAFM activities, training was provided, in conjunction with the relevant line Divisions, to ensure that the investigating officers were familiar with new legislation and its impact on investigations.</p><p>  Currently there are 10 staff members assigned to the unit &ndash; three veterinary, six technical and one administrative officer. </p><p>  The financial resources assigned to the operation of the unit &ndash; including salaries and day-to-day operational expenses, including travel and subsistence costs - in the past three years, is set out below:</p><p><table><tr><th>2011</th><th>2012</th><th>2013 to date (end Nov)</th></tr><tr><td>&euro;1,014,472.11</td><td>&euro;950,566.40</td><td>&euro;719,983.69</td></tr></table></p><p>  Management of the unit hold monthly management meetings with the staff during which each case is discussed with the investigating officer.

These arrangements were put in place having regard to the size of the vessels involved in the fishery and the time of year in which the fishing takes place.</p><p>  The position in relation to the management of all fisheries, both pelagic and whitefish, is that the quota is managed on a single year basis and under fishing by any group of vessels is not carried forward to the following year for that group. For all stocks, any carry over from 2013, which can be up to 10 % in the case of Celtic Sea Herring, will be added to the national adjusted quota for 2014.  In line with policy, the Celtic Sea Herring sentinel fishery will receive up to 11% of the adjusted quota, each year.</p></reply>

A farmer must use a 5-star stock bull (5 stars within breed or across breed is acceptable) on overall SBV or on the maternal sub-index in his herd.

For the purposes of this task, a farmer must replace 15% of his herd (based on number of cows in the herd) with heifers who have 4 stars for either daughter milk or daughter fertility to satisfy this requirement.

The symptoms include reproductive failure, pneumonia and increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection.  It is caused by a virus classified as a member of the genus Arterivirus.  PRRS was first recognised in the United States in 1987, and the causative virus was identified in the Netherlands in 1991.</p><p>  The position as regards PPRS is that this is disease syndrome would appear to be endemic in Ireland, as it is in virtually all pig producing countries in the world.  While it is acknowledged that PRRS has a negative economic impact on affected farms, there are no PRRS related health guarantees applicable in respect of intra-community trade in pigs and thus no additional health guarantees can be sought or imposed in relation to intra-community trade.  Given these circumstances, my Department does not have any plans to introduce a national eradication programme or a compensation regime at this time.</p></reply>

The growing list of third country markets in which Irish pigmeat is consumed is evidence of my continuing efforts and those of Bord Bia to increase the profile of Irish agri food products worldwide.  Indeed there was a welcome new market opportunity with the opening of the Australian market for Irish pigmeat product earlier this year.</p><p>  For 2014, the strategic focus of Bord Bia for the pigmeat sector on the home market will be to promote the Quality Mark and the consumption of pork to consumers.  The domestic market remains difficult with consumption coming under pressure.  Key activities envisaged in 2014 are TV and point of sale advertising, Facebook and website activities, digital advertising, PR activities and radio promotions.  Pork, ham and bacon with the Quality Mark will also feature in the RTE 1 &lsquo;Home Chef&rsquo; series with Neven Maguire starting in mid January.  In total there will be 19 weeks of promotional activity for pork and bacon on the home market throughout 2014.</p><p>  The main export markets will remain important in 2014, given the pressures on the home market.  In the UK, support will be directed towards projects which can assist processors in identifying and developing business opportunities.  In Russia, efforts will be directed towards enhancing relationships with local authorities, to maintain market access and build market and customer contact for Irish exporters through exhibitions such as Prodexpo.  In Asia, similar efforts in building trade links will continue for 2014, working closely with the Chinese Meat Association, and relevant Chinese government agencies.  In terms of trade development, Bord Bia will host an Irish stand at two trade fairs, Sial China in Shanghai and CIMIE in Beijing, while inward buyer visits from this region will continue to be supported.  In addition, with direct market access to Vietnam and Thailand, Bord Bia plans to do a market assessment of the opportunities within these two countries to explore the export opportunities for Irish operators.</p><p>  I can assure the Deputy that I regard the pigmeat sector as a critically important element of the Irish agri food industry and that my Department and its agencies will continue to work with industry to explore new market opportunities and develop the sector to its full potential.</p></reply>

Each year farmers in Ireland benefit from funding of over &euro;1.5 billion under Schemes such as the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme, the Agri-Environment Schemes, etc.  This comprises the entire net income of many thousands of Irish farmers.</p><p>  The European Commission has an obligation to ensure that Member States manage and use the EU funding granted to them in accordance with the very restrictive provisions governing the Schemes and general financial provisions.  All of the lands declared by farmers must be eligible if these lands benefit from payment under one of more of these Schemes.  My Department is currently carrying out a comprehensive exercise by excluding ineligible features, such as houses, roads, scrub, rivers, etc. in land parcels declared by farmers.  In the vast majority of cases, the exclusion has no impact on payments as the farmers in question have taken a prudent approach and reduced the declared area to take account of the ineligible feature.  No cutbacks have been applied on eligible land.</p><p>  I would like to reassure the Deputy that every effort is being made to protect the interests of the majority of farmers who were fully compliant in the declarations they made on an annual basis under the Schemes.</p></reply>

The protocol aims to ensure a consistent national approach to service delivery where two or more services are involved in the same case.  The protocol provides for local collaboration across care groups at local practitioner level with a mechanism for escalation to Area level and beyond if required.  The Department, and the Child and Family Agency upon establishment, will continue to advance such a collaborative approach in conjunction with the Department of Health and the HSE.</p></reply>

In the main, these are the Education and Training Boards (ETBs) but they also include other bodies such as the HSE, some local authorities and, up to recently, some of the larger national youth organisations. </p><p>  The City of Dublin Youth Service Board (CDYSB), a statutory board established in 1942, under the City of Dublin ETB, is one such body which distributes allocations to youth projects. The CDYSB, on behalf of CDETB, has for several years, undertaken the administration of approximately 70 youth projects in the Dublin City area and has developed a strong track record in managing these payments.</p><p>  In January 2013, in an effort to streamline the tasks associated with the financial management of funding for projects to achieve greater efficiency in the administration of funding,  the administration tasks, formerly carried out by  six national organisations were transferred by my Department to CDYSB.  The six organisations are Youth Work Ireland, Crosscare, For&oacute;ige, Involve, YMCA and ECO-UNESCO.</p><p>  The financial management tasks involved in the transfer are those which had, up to that date, been carried out by the national youth organisations themselves and by the Department. The ETBs  (VECs at the time), had not had a funding administration role in relation to the organisations concerned. The role of the ETBs in supporting the provision of youth services in their respective administrative areas is unaffected by the streamlining initiative.</p><p>  The process involved my Department consulting with CDYSB to discuss their capacity to take on the additional work, the financial and other controls that would be put in place, how the responsibilities would be taken on a &ldquo;no additional cost&rdquo; basis within existing resources and how the transfer of the administrative tasks would be effected. In the deliberative process, my Department received advice that, as there was no payment involved for the provision of the service, the initiative was not subject to procurement rules. Consultations and meetings were also held with the six organisations involved.</p><p>  My Department continues to examine the scope for improving administrative arrangements for the financial management of the funding for youth services to achieve greater efficiency and standardisation. My Department is in ongoing discussion with ETB Ireland, the national representative association for the ETBs, on this shared objective, in the interest of  the front line youth projects and services throughout the country.</p><p>  In recent years, the numbers of bodies holding funding administration status from my Department has reduced from approximately 40 to some 30 at the start of 2013.  It is anticipated that the number of administration bodies will continue to reduce as the integration of the former VECs into Education Training Boards is completed.</p></reply>

When there is no relative or person known to the child to provide relative care, the HSE where possible, will place a child in foster care.  For young people who are unable to live at home or in an alternative family environment residential care may be considered suitable.</p><p>  There are approximately 140 Children's Residential Centres in operation.  The centres typically have between 3 and 6 children.  The children are usually in their teens.  Children living in the centres attend at local schools and take part in local sporting and community activities.  Staff work a shift system and young people are allocated a key-worker.  </p><p>  Third party service level agreements procured by the HSE (and from 1 January, 2014 the new Child and Family Agency) are required to adhere to procedures and guidelines. A voluntary service provider must first establish registration status and is then subject to ongoing inspection and monitoring.  The focus of these inspections is on the level of service being provided to ensure safe, effective delivery of that service and to meet the needs of each individual at any given time. Consequently, staffing levels can fluctuate throughout the term of a service level agreement according to the needs of the child.</p><p>  A private service provider is also subject to the monitoring and inspections set out above. Aspects of private providers agreements differ to voluntary provider agreements as voluntary providers are typically procured for full centres and private providers are procured for individual placements.</p></reply>

In all such cases my officials provide whatever assistance is required to allow such an individual to make a proper referral to the statutory authorities.  Such assistance can often include my officials contacting the HSE directly on behalf of the individual.  It is not possible to quantify the volume of such calls.</p><p>  The HSE publishes a range of reports on performance indicators on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Among these indicators is information relating to referral and assessment processes. The HSE also provides an annual Review of Adequacy Report under Section 8 of the Child Care Act 1991. The Annual Service planning process also provides an opportunity to set out service priorities in the context of available resources.  In addition, information is provided to me by the HSE on specific issues as required or to inform me of policy or legislative issues arising in the services.</p><p>  Child abuse referrals are broken down into four categories: sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect.  Although child prostitution is recorded as sexual abuse, it is not broken down according to the type of sexual abuse reported.  In 2011 there were 15,808 referrals where there was a concern of child abuse received and in 2012 there were 19,044 received.  Figures to date for 2013 indicate that the level of referrals will be similar to the number of reports made to Social Work Services in 2012.</p><p>  The HSE has advised that all referrals received receive an initial assessment to determine what further action is required in accordance with Children First Guidance (2011).  Any immediate protective action which may be required is taken in accordance with the HSE's statutory duty under the Child Care Act 1991.  Intervention is provided as appropriate ensuring at all times that it is proportionate and in accordance with an assessment of the child's needs.  Where it is not possible to deal immediately with a referral of abuse, those which are assessed as highest priority are dealt with in the first instance by social work teams.  All referrals received are reviewed and responses monitored. </p><p>  It is important to note that a small proportion of all referrals made to the HSE are substantiated as above. </p><p>  As regards the Deputy's query in relation to making a positive intervention at the earliest possible stage, my Department does not receive information in this regard.  However, the HSE are always requested to highlight to my Department any cases which may have policy or legislative implications.  This is the position for all cases referred to the HSE, not only those which come through my Department.</p></reply>

Since 2006, my Department has produced a biennial publication which includes data on a wide range of well being indicators affecting the lives of children in Ireland.  The study includes a section containing data on social, emotional and behavioural outcomes relating to children.  Data from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Survey (HBSC) relating to self esteem, found that 57.3% of children reported feeling happy with the way they are, although this percentage reduced with older children.  There were also regional differences with 60.9% children living in the South-West reporting feeling happy with the way they are compared to 53.6% in the West.  </p><p>  The &quot;How We see It: Report of a Survey on Young People&rsquo;s Body Image&quot; report was conducted by young people from the D&aacute;il na n&Oacute;g Council in 2011 and published in October 2013.  2,156 young people, aged between 10 and 21 years completed the survey, which was anonymous.  The findings from this survey clearly demonstrate that body image is a burning and complex issue for young people in contemporary Ireland, with 77% of participants ranking body image as important to them. Key findings included:</p><p>- Two out of 3 participants say that they were fairly or very satisfied with their body image with more than twice as many boys as girls being 	satisfied (22% male; 8% female) and girls expressing considerably stronger dissatisfaction (26% female; 10% male). </p><p>- 97% of the young people who took part in the survey do some type of exercise, and activity and sports were cited as most important in supporting positive body image.  However, girls are twice as likely as boys not to take enough exercise to stay healthy, while boys are more than twice as likely as girls to feel that they take more exercise than is healthy.</p><p>- 60% of all participants said they feel pressurised to look good for other people. Girls (70%) were far more likely to say this than boys (46%).</p><p>- More than half of all the young people surveyed said their body image interferes with their participation in certain activities (such as swimming, dating, putting photographs on Facebook) and girls are up to twice as likely as boys to find it harder to take part in all of the listed activities.</p><p>  My Department also recently published &lsquo;Youth work: A systematic map of the research literature&rsquo; (2013). This publication provides an international review of the available evidence relating to the contribution that youth work can make to improve the lives of young people. &lsquo;Sense of self&rsquo; was identified as one of seven key human and social capital outcomes for  young people where youth work was seen to make a valuable contribution.  These findings will inform my Department in developing its policy objectives for young people and in supporting quality-based and outcomes-focused youth work and related provision.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 400,000 young people and involve approximately 1,400 paid staff and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>  In 2013, &euro;53.498m has been made available for services for young people. This includes capital funding of &euro;1.5m to support projects in the youth services, including new Youth Caf&eacute;s and &euro;0.250m for the provision of Play and Recreation facilities. This year, it proved possible, in the context of end year savings and efficiencies, to provide additional assistance to over 35 youth projects and organisations to assist them in ensuring their sustainability for the year ahead. Youth Officers of the Education and Training Boards, who have very close links with local youth projects, have been of great assistance to my Department in this process. </p><p>  With regard to funding for Co. Kildare, &euro;458,220 has been provided to six projects and services in 2013. In addition, I have recently allocated an amount of &euro;50,000 to Kildare Youth Hub, Kildare town towards the cost of developing a youth caf&eacute; facility which will offer a safe environment for young people to &lsquo;hang out&rsquo;. </p><p>  Work is underway in my Department on the determination of the 2014 allocations for the youth services. In line with Government policy, my Department, along with all Government departments, has been required to achieve significant savings on schemes and services in line with the reductions set out in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure (CRE). I am pleased to advise the Deputy that, as part of Budget 2014, I have secured an additional allocation of &euro;1m in current funding to reduce the impact of the CRE savings requirements on the youth services next year.  The additional allocation means that the savings requirement in 2014 will be &euro;2m rather than &euro;3m indicated for the youth services in the CRE and the total current funding allocation for youth services will be &euro;49.78m.</p><p>  Every effort is being made to finalise the 2014 funding allocations promptly so that youth projects and national youth organisations can be advised of their 2014 allocations as soon as possible. </p><p>  My Department has strong links with youth sector organisations and there is regular interaction with them on a range of issues including matters to do with ensuring quality services to meet young people&rsquo;s needs and the challenges youth organisations encounter in managing the budgets available to them over the year. The most prominent issues brought to my Department&rsquo;s attention over the past two years related to the impact of reduced budgets on youth organisations and youth projects throughout the country. The youth organisations also followed closely Ireland&rsquo;s Presidency of the EU Youth Council of Ministers, in which we prioritised the importance of quality youth services for young people&rsquo;s social inclusion and the contribution of youth work to the attainment of the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy, particularly for youth employment. The  National Youth Council of Ireland partnered my Department in the organisation of the EU youth conference held in Dublin in March. Over 200 young people and policy makers from all the member states discussed issues of concern to youth, including youth unemployment, education and training and access to social services and supports for young people. Youth sector organisations where active participants in the Expert Round Table event which I hosted in June, in Co Kildare, and in which for the first time, youth organisations came together with employer and business representatives to discuss the contribution of youth work to young people's employability and entrepreneurship. My Department continues to work closely with the youth sector on these priority issues in the context of the Government&rsquo;s plan for the Youth Guarantee.</p><p>  My Department works collaboratively with the youth sector organisations on important policy initiatives in various fora. The National Youth Work Advisory Committee appointed by me in January 2013 includes representatives of the national youth organisations as well as statutory sector interests.  The youth work organisations are making a significant contribution to my Department&rsquo;s work, through the National Youth Work Advisory Committee which is undertaking preparatory work on the proposed new youth policy strategy for completion next year.</p><p>  I, and officials of my Department will continue to meet with many youth organisations and groups to try and see how we can work together to ensure the most effective and efficient use of the resources available in order to continue to support the provision of quality and responsive youth services for  young people.</p></reply>

The report focuses specifically on children's outcomes (including health, educational and social, emotional and behavioural), children&rsquo;s relationships with family and friends and children&rsquo;s services and supports. </p><p>  The first &ldquo;State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children&rdquo; report was produced in 2006 and three further publications have issued since then.  The report is based on a National Set of Child Well-being Indicators. These indicators  were developed in 2005 through a consultative process with  multiple stakeholders, including children themselves. The indicator set is comprised of over 50 individual indicators which are reported on using previously published data.  It is intended that these indicators will be reviewed and updated. The next  State of the Nation&rsquo;s Children Report is due to be published in 2014.</p><p>  As well as reporting on the national  set of well-being indicators, my  Department also manages the &ldquo;National Longitudinal Study of Children in Ireland&rdquo; (NLSCI). </p><p>  The purpose of the research is &lsquo;to study the factors that contribute to or undermine the well-being of children in contemporary Irish families; and through this, contribute to the setting of effective and responsive policies relating to children and to the design of services for children and families&rsquo;.</p><p>  The study monitors the development of almost 20,000 children &ndash; an infant cohort of approximately 11,100 children aged nine months and a child cohort of 8,570 children aged nine years. </p><p>- The infant cohort includes 1 in every 5 children born over the period 1st December 2007 and 30th June 2008.</p><p>- The child cohort included around 1 in every 6 nine-year old children in Ireland at the time of the first wave of data collection (which took place from May 2007 and September 2008).</p><p>  The first phase of the Growing Up in Ireland will conclude in 2014 and it is intended to put in place a new contract to continue monitoring the study children into later life. </p><p>  My Department is committed to continuing the Growing Up in Ireland Study, to provide high quality data on a whole range of child outcomes, and arrangements are underway to commission a second phase of the study to ensure that this rich data source is continued and built upon.</p></reply>

Minister for Health, has arranged a meeting with the National Coalition for Vision Health early in the New Year.</p><p>  The issues involved in eye health span a number of areas in the health sector with regard to access to treatment, patient safety and quality of care.  There are a number of eye conditions which require specialist health services including cataract, refractive error, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and age related macular degeneration.  There are detection and treatment services available at present in community and acute hospital settings for these conditions.</p><p>  The Health Service Executive (HSE) provides a sight testing service as part of the school health screening programme for children of primary school age.  Children who are identified as requiring treatment or intervention are referred to the HSE ophthalmic service for follow up.  Urgent cases are given priority and less urgent cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.  Children between 12 and 16 years, whose parents are in receipt of a medical card, are eligible for HSE eye-care services when named on their parents' card.  Other children between 12 and 16 years are eligible to be seen by the HSE ophthalmic service when there is a medical reason for the eye condition, rather than a refractive error.  </p><p>  The National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme commenced at the beginning of this year.</p><p>  In addition, there are a number of high level strategies which are relevant to the area of eye health, including Clinical Programmes; Public Health; Health Protection; Positive Ageing and Carers Strategies and Screening initiatives.  A number of these strategies link with the Health Service Executive's Clinical Ophthalmology Programme.</p><p>  The Government has continued to provide financial supports to those agencies involved in research, support and service provision for people with visual impairment in Ireland.  The Government remains committed to the provision and development of vision services and supports through health prevention, screening and intervention policies and programmes, all of which contribute to address the priority goal of Vision 2020, namely to eliminate avoidable blindness in Ireland.  In this context, it is not proposed to develop a separate national vision strategy.</p></reply>

The Department of Health, in collaboration with the Health Service Executive and Irish Aid, is the designated national authority for reporting on implementation of the Global Code.</p><p>  Ireland is committed to implementation of the Global Code, as evidenced most recently by the national commitments given at the 3rd Global Forum on Human Resources for Health. Ireland has also been recognised internationally for its work in this area, receiving a Health Worker Migration Policy Council Innovation Award in November 2013.

However, the Medical Council's Medical Workforce Intelligence Report, published on 25th July, 2013 provides useful information concerning doctors on the Medical Council's Register in 2012.  It noted that 16,392 doctors retained registration with the Medical Council Register, while a further 1,256 doctors entered the register for the first time. On the other hand, 1,419 doctors did not retain registration, representing an exit rate of 8%. These movements resulted in a 3% fall in the number of doctors registered at the end of 2012 compared with 2011.  The Council reported that "a relatively high proportion of recent graduates from Irish medical schools are leaving the register". The exit rate was highest amongst those aged 65 years and over, 19.2%; with 6.4% of those aged 25 - 29 and 6.3%  of those aged 30 - 34 exiting. However, it also found that doctors who qualified abroad (the 6 world regions averaged 13%) were more likely to exit the register than those who qualified in Ireland (5.8%). </p><p>  It should be borne in mind that there is a global demand for doctors and that they are a mobile workforce. A range of factors, including opportunities to gain further experience and/or specialist training, the levels of pay available, working conditions generally and other economic factors and social conditions in different countries influence trends in migration. </p><p>   I want to ensure that the talented NCHD workforce we train are offered rewarding and satisfying career paths here in Ireland. In July this year, I set up a Working Group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU, to carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.  The terms of reference of the review include making recommendations aimed at improving graduate retention in the public health system; planning for future service needs; realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training.</p><p>  The Group has submitted its interim report to me and it will be published shortly.

A range of factors including: opportunities to gain further experience, specialist training,  levels of pay available, working conditions, and other economic and social conditions in different countries also influence trends in migration. </p><p>  The Government has decided that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets. The health sector must make its contribution to that reduction.   The HSE may, however, continue to recruit front-line staff in circumstances where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement, and this can be accommodated within the budgetary and staff number limits in place. </p><p>  Notwithstanding the need to reduce numbers employed in the public service, the Government is, however, wholly committed to the provision of training, work-experience and employment opportunities where possible. Hence, for example. the decision to implement a Nurse Graduate Initiative. This Initiative enables the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurses positions for two years, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited. The Initiative therefore supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system, and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation. To date 256 staff nurse/midwife graduates have commenced employment nationally. </p><p>  I also want to ensure that NCHDs are offered a rewarding and satisfying career here in Ireland. In July this year, I set up a Working Group chaired by Professor Brian MacCraith, President of DCU. This Group will carry out a strategic review of the medical training and career structure of NCHDs.  The terms of reference of the review include making recommendations aimed at improving graduate retention in the public health system; planning for future service needs; and realising maximum benefit from investment in medical education and training. </p><p>  The Group submitted its interim report to me last week, and it will be published shortly.  The Group is now moving to stage two of its work, with a view to submitting its final report to me by the end of June 2014.  </p><p>  I am determined that as part of the overall health reform programme we build a public health system that values the contribution and commitment of all health professionals.

It is estimated that the combined gross savings from the IPHA and APMI deals will be in excess of &euro;120 million in 2013 with an additional &euro;28 million saved in 2014.</p><p>  The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which came into operation on the 24th of June, introduces a system of generic substitution and reference pricing. This legislation will promote price competition among suppliers and ensure that lower prices are paid for these medicines resulting in further savings for both taxpayers and patients. It is estimated that this system will yield &euro;50 million in savings in 2014.</p><p>Under the Act, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) is responsible for the assessment for interchangeability of medicines. Generic substitution will be introduced incrementally with the IMB prioritising those medicines which will achieve the greatest savings for patients and the State. The Board is in the process of reviewing an initial 20 active substances, which equates to approximately 1,500 individual medicines.   They include statins, proton pump inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. </p><p>  The first List of Interchangeable Medicines, containing groups of atorvastatin products, was published by the IMB on the 7th August. The IMB is updating the List of Interchangeable Medicines on an ongoing basis and it expects to complete the assessment of  the top 20 priority medicines by  Quarter 2 2014.  The process will then continue until all relevant medicinal products on the reimbursable list have been assessed. </p><p>Once a List of Interchangeable Medicines is published by the IMB  a two stage price reduction process gets underway. First, under the terms of the 2012 APMI Agreement, the price of all relevant products fall by 20%, e.g. atorvastatin prices were reduced from 1st September.   Secondly, the legislation provides that the HSE may set a reference price for groups of interchangeable products published on the List of Interchangeable Products with a view to introducing further significant price cuts. Taking both price reductions into account, atorvastatin prices are down 70% since the introduction of generic substitution.</p><p>  Reference pricing involves the setting of a common reimbursement price, or reference price, for a group of interchangeable medicines. It means that one reference price is set for each group or list of interchangeable medicines, and this is the price that the HSE will reimburse to pharmacies for all medicines in the group, regardless of the individual medicine&rsquo;s prices. </p><p>  The first reference price for atorvastatin products was implemented on 1 November 2013. The next reference price, for certain esomeprazole products, will be introduced on the 1st January 2014. Reference prices will ensure that generic prices in Ireland will fall towards European norms.</p><p>  The legislation also includes a process for the review of existing prices outside of reference pricing. Each medicinal product, which was on the Reimbursement List when the legislation was commenced, must be reviewed by the HSE within three years to determine whether it should remain on the List and, if so, the price that should apply.  </p><p>  The Act also provides for the removal of items from the Reimbursement List and for conditional reimbursement of certain products. &euro;10 million savings have been targeted in Budget 2014 from the delisting of products and the HSE is now considering products for review in compliance with the legislation.</p></reply>

However, under the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland&rsquo;s (PSI) Code of Conduct, pharmacists are required to provide honest, relevant, accurate, current and appropriate information to patients regarding the nature, cost, value and benefit of medicines provided by them. Every pharmacist has an obligation to comply in full with the statutory Code of Conduct. </p><p>  The PSI advises patients that their pharmacist should be in a position to provide them with whatever information or clarification they require about prescribed medicines, including information about the pricing of those medicines. The Department of Health has asked the PSI to examine how greater price transparency can be achieved. It should also be noted that the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 provides patients with an incentive to seek interchangeable products priced at or below the reference price.  </p><p>  It is the view of the HSE and the Department of Health that there should be total transparency provided when any pharmaceutical service is accessed by a member of the public. </p><p>  In relation to improved prescribing practises, a Medicines Management Programme (MMP) has been established by the HSE to provide sustained national leadership in this area. </p><p>  The aims of the MMP include (a) ensuring that patients have access to the essential medicines that they need; (b) facilitating more cost-effective prescribing with initiatives in relation to high-cost medicines; (c) ensuring value for money in relation to medicines; and (d) enhancing evidence based prescribing and optimising patient safety through a reduction in medication related adverse events. </p><p>  The MMP will focus on drugs and medicines which can be expected to have a significant impact in terms of patient safety and expenditure. In this context, the MMP will monitor drug utilisation and expenditure under the community drug schemes and initiate a health technology assessment for products where there are queries in relation to efficacy and value for money. This process has the potential to produce significant savings in drug expenditure while at the same time enhancing patient safety.</p><p>  The MMP has also introduced the preferred drugs initiative which facilitates more cost-effective prescribing particularly in relation to high-cost medicines and it has commenced a series of educational meetings with general practitioners to reinforce the message around safe, effective and cost-effective prescribing as well as generic prescribing.</p></reply>

No claim associating water fluoridation, at the optimal level, with negative health effects has been substantiated. The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, established in 2004, continuously monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects. It advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, protects the oral health of the population and does not cause any ill effects. It advises that there is no association between water fluoridation and thyroid disorders. The opinion of the Expert Body regarding the absence of ill effects of water fluoridation is supported by major international scientifically validated reviews. The Department of Health keeps the policy of water fluoridation under constant review. As part of this ongoing work, a review of evidence on the impact of water fluoridation on general health will be conducted by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health in 2014.</p></reply>

It is charged with, and is accountable for, the effective regulation of pharmacists and pharmacies in Ireland, including responsibility for supervising compliance with the Act.  Under the Act, the PSI inter alia is responsible for the registration of pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and pharmacies, the education, training and continuing professional development of pharmacists, as well as the inspection of pharmacies, enforcement of medicines and pharmacy legislation and the operation of fitness to practise functions.  These functions are funded by fees paid by registrants. The setting of fees for the pharmacy profession is governed by the Act which requires the PSI to make an application for ministerial consent to any fees that it proposes to charge.  This process allows for the consideration, and examination, of the Society&rsquo;s fee proposals by my Department.</p><p>  In 2008, the PSI commissioned an extensive review of its functions arising from the implementation of the Pharmacy Act 2007. The process included a comparative analysis of comparable international pharmacy regulators and consultation with national stakeholders.  Arising from that review the fees for registrants were set by the Council of the PSI with the approval of the then Minister for Health.  In 2010, following an internal review of fees and the cost of regulation, the PSI Council sought and received ministerial approval for an annual reduction in continued registration fees of  10% -11% for pharmacists, pharmaceutical assistants and pharmacies.

The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board (NPHDB) is the body responsible for the capital project.  Last August, I announced appointments to this Board to replace the transitional Board which had been in place since January this year.  These appointments bring architectural, planning, procurement, engineering and construction expertise to the project.  In November, Mr. John Pollock was selected as Programme Director of the NPHDB.  Also in August, I announced appointments to the Children's Hospital Group Board which, as client for the project, will play a key role in ensuring the new hospital is optimally designed and completed as swiftly as possible.  In November, Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman took up post as CEO of the Children's Hospital Group, and will play a central role in driving forward the integration of the three hospitals, and the project as a whole.</p><p>  Prior to the commencement of construction, key elements of the project include design development, decant works for the site and planning permission. The new NPHDB has reviewed the design team procurement process, which had been initiated in July, and decided on a change of approach based on its collective expertise and taking into account changing market conditions. While this means that the design team will be selected in Spring 2014, rather than by the end of this year as originally planned, the Board is confident there will be no delay to the project overall.  Pre-application planning discussions have commenced, a master plan for the St. James's Hospital campus is being prepared and St. James's Hospital is working closely with the Development Board and the HSE in relation to the decant phase of the project.  Work on the review of urgent care centre configuration is at an advanced stage and I intend to bring proposals in this regard to Government shortly.</p><p>  The new children's hospital will provide  in-patients with their own single room and en-suite bathroom, with overnight in-room accommodation for parents.  The new theatres and procedure rooms will have advanced medical technology for patient diagnosis (e.g. x-ray machines) and complex surgeries, which will inevitably improve clinical outcomes for patients.  The hospital will have a child-centred design with colourful play areas and external gardens for children (and for their families). Different play areas and recreational facilities will be provided that are appropriate for different age groups.  Work on developing a detailed timeline is continuing, which will reflect the urgency and priority of the project and also its scale and complexity.  However, at this stage, the Board is confident that construction can begin in Spring 2015 with the transition of services to the new hospital to commence at the end of 2018.</p><p>  In October, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform announced that up to &euro;200m would be made available for the new children&rsquo;s hospital from the sale of the National Lottery, adding to the existing &euro;450 million Exchequer funding. The level of funding now in place underlines the Government&rsquo;s commitment to this priority project.  Also, philanthropic / non-Exchequer funding will be sought to the maximum and most appropriate degree. Estimated costs will be reviewed and refined at each stage as the project progresses.  The total spent on the new children&rsquo;s hospital to date is &euro;41 million.  Of the total spent on the project in its previous location, much of the work that was done for the project on its previous site can be transferred to the new site. However, a proportion of the costs incurred require to be written off.  This cannot be avoided, having regard to the fact that the continuing serious planning concerns identified meant that the project could not continue on the original site.</p></reply>

Consultant Contract 2008 sets out clear rules on the relative volume of private practice that may be undertaken by consultants, depending on the individual contract held, and the arrangements for measurement and management of this, including the steps to be taken where it the permitted volume exceeded.  Depending on contract type, a consultant may have no access to private practice (Type A contract holders), a cap of 20% private activity for newly appointed consultants (Type B)  or a cap of up to 30% in the case of certain existing consultants.  Arrangements concerning implementation and monitoring of Consultant Contract 2008 are matters for the HSE in the first instance.  It is incumbent on publicly-funded hospitals to ensure compliance with the terms of the contract, including the provisions in relation to the ratio of private practice undertaken.</p><p>  The level of fees charged by a consultant who sees a patient privately is a matter between the consultant and the patient.  The fees arising may be met personally by the patient concerned, by the patient's health insurer, or a combination of the two depending on the extent, if any, to which the patient has insurance cover for the service provided.  Given these arrangements, the data sought by the Deputy is not available.  However, I have impressed on health insurers the need to contain costs, including payments in respect of consultant fees.</p></reply>

These falls reflect Government policy that the numbers employed across the public service must be reduced in order to meet fiscal and budgetary targets.  The health sector must make its contribution to the necessary reduction.  Nonetheless, it is open to the HSE to continue to recruit nurses and midwives in circumstances where it has been established that there is an urgent service requirement and this can be accommodated within the budgetary and staff number limits in place.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the need to reduce numbers employed in the public service, the Government is wholly committed to the provision of training, work-experience and employment opportunities where possible. Hence the decision to implement a Nurse Graduate Initiate and an Intern Scheme for Health Support Staff.  The Nurse Graduate Initiative enables the health services to offer 1,000 graduate nurses positions for two years, at a time when job opportunities in the public service are very limited.  Therefore it supports the retention of recently qualified graduate nurses and midwives within the Irish health system and enables them to gain valuable work experience and development opportunities post-graduation.  To date 77 staff nurse/midwife graduates have commenced employment in HSE South, 256 nationally.</p><p>  There is a global demand for nurses and that they are a mobile workforce. A range of factors, including opportunities to gain further experience, the levels of pay available, working conditions generally and other economic factors and social conditions in different countries influence decisions to move abroad.  As the recruitment of nurses to specific posts and regions is a matter for the HSE in the first instance, the Deputy's enquiries concerning nursing posts in Cork-Kerry regional hospitals have been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.</p></reply>

The HSE&rsquo;s National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) has primary responsibility for the implementation of <i>Reach Out.</i>  I would like to assure the Deputy that dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  </p><p>  The National Suicide Research Foundation (NSRF), which is funded by the NOSP operates the National Registry of Deliberate Self Harm.  This is a national system which monitors the occurrence of deliberate self-harm presenting to hospital Emergency Departments.  The NSRF compiles and publishes data on the incidence of deliberate self harm an annual basis.  Data on the reasons behind the presentation of deliberate self-harm is not collected. </p><p>  A Child and Adolescent Self-Harm in Europe (CASE) study which was carried out in Ireland and in six other centres in Europe and Australia aimed to establish the prevalence and correlates of self-harm among adolescents aged 15-17 years.  The study found that the common factors significantly associated with self-harm among young boys and girls in Ireland were having a friend who engaged in self-harm and drug use.  Among girls, having lower self-esteem experiencing problems making friends or keeping friends and conflict with parents were also associated with deliberate self-harm.  Having a family member who had engaged in deliberate self-harm and experience of forced sexual activity were also significant for girls.</p><p>  Deliberate self-harm in boys was significantly associated with higher levels of anxiety and impulsivity, problems with schoolwork and having experienced bullying at school.  Among boys who had experienced bullying, other factors increasing the risk of self-harm included worries about sexual orientation, physical abuse, and problems with school work.  Risk of lifetime self-harm was four times higher for boys who experienced bullying in school.</p><p>  Drawing from the CASE study data from the seven countries, Madge at al (2011), found that there was a weak association between being bullied and deliberate self-harm.  The researchers concluded that there is no single pattern of self-harm among young people, but both psychological characteristics and stressful life events substantially increase risk.  The NOSP is currently funding a literature review to examine the prevalence and impact of cyber bulling on mental health and suicidal behaviour.  This literature review addresses Action 11 of the Department of Education and Skills <i>Action Plan on Bullying</i> (2013).  The literature seems to suggest that cyber bullying alone does not lead to deliberate self-harm or suicidal ideation, but cyber bullying may increase depression in young people, and thereby exacerbate vulnerabilities which increase the risk of deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideation.  Emergency Departments have the expertise in deliberate self-harm, crisis intervention nurses and/or liaison psychiatry services to support anyone who attends after an episode of self-harm.</p></reply>

The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0 - 18 years).  A number of national and regional implementation groups have been set up to progress this plan over the coming years.  This measure will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children and young adults requiring access to health related supports.</p><p>  As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply of the 10th December,  within Disability Services, the two main organisations that are funded to meet the needs of people with acquired brain injury nationally are Acquired Brain Injury Ireland and Headway Ireland.  Some other organisations such as Cheshire Ireland and the Irish Wheelchair Association also provide services for people with acquired brain injury.</p><p>  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland (ABII) works mainly with adults (18-65 years) whose main disability is acquired brain injury, although ABII is also involved in pilot projects developing services for children and runs parenting programmes for parents of children with acquired brain injury in Dublin.  ABII provides a range of flexible and tailor-made services, including assisted living services, home and community services, home and community rehabilitation services, day resource services, rehabilitation support, case management, education programmes and individual development supports.  Headway provides a range of services to people with acquired brain injury (16 - 65 years), including day services, a psychology and social work service, community integration programmes, supported employment, family support and rehabilitation training programmes.</p><p>  Neuro-rehabilitation services for children are provided by the HSE or by the non-statutory sector acting in partnership with the HSE.  These services are provided primarily through the tertiary services offered by the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH), Enable Ireland and the Central Remedial Clinic.  The NRH currently has 8 dedicated beds for children who have a requirement for rehabilitation.</p><p>  Within the HSE primary and community services, neuro-rehabilitation services are provided through the Early Intervention and Children's Therapy Teams, which provide assessment and intervention services to children with a wide range of disabilities.  The HSE is committed to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Report - National Policy &amp;amp; Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011 - 2015 and to the development of the Rehabilitation Medicine Programme.  In this regard, both clinical and executive leads have been assigned and a national working group drawn from the various stakeholders has been established and is currently developing an implementation plan.</p><p>  In relation to services specifically for children and teenagers with acquired brain injury, the Report concludes that the best interests of children with neurological presentations and associated needs are best served by including such children within a children's framework and recommends that children's needs be included in the work being done through the reconfiguration of paediatric services.  HSE Disability Services managers work with service users and their families to provide an appropriate level of service during the transition phase to adult services, according to eligibility for specific services and within available resources.</p></reply>

HIQA may also undertake an investigation as to the safety, quality and standards of the services if the Authority believes that there are reasonable grounds for doing so as set out in Section 9 of the Act.  HIQA, therefore, uses the powers available under the Health Act 2007 to monitor compliance with the Standards it sets and to undertake investigations in public hospitals.  A number of hospital inspections have taken place in recent months as part of HIQA's monitoring of the implementation of the National Standards for the Prevention and Control of Healthcare Associated Infections (HCAI).  To date HIQA has carried out both announced and unannounced inspections in public hospitals around the country to monitor compliance with the HCAI Standards.  It is a matter for HIQA to decide on the operational arrangements used to monitor implementation of Standards and if such monitoring requires unannounced visits to public hospitals.   HIQA does not carryout inspections in private hospitals as HIQA does not have a remit in this area.</p></reply>

A National Lottery grant of &euro;171,890 was awarded to the organisation in 2010 and in 2011 the organisation received a further grant of &euro;69,000. The organisation was unsuccessful in 2012.

This review was carried out by retired High Court Judge T.C. Smyth.</p><p>  Judge Smyth submitted his report to the Minister in September 2010.  The report recommended that a further investigation should not<b></b>be held and that, in order to avoid prejudicing any civil or criminal cases, the report should not be published.  A short summary of the report was, however, prepared and supplied to the patient support groups in January 2011.</p><p>  I understand that the allegations referred to by the Deputy are the subject of on-going legal proceedings.</p></reply>

Once the final tourism policy has been published, it will provide a robust foundation for a broader tourism strategy and action plan.  The question of a Home Gathering can be considered in that context but, for now, I have no such plans.  However, I can assure the Deputy, that, as in recent years, F&aacute;ilte Ireland will again run a Home Holidays Marketing Campaign in 2014 to foster growth in the domestic market next year and to encourage home holidays. I am, of course, open to any suggestions as to how a &quot;Home Gathering&quot; might work.</p></reply>

Rather, it would be constructed through the PPP model. While this model involves the private sector carrying the construction risk, it does require the State to meet the initial design, planning and land purchase costs. In the case of the M20 in the context of available road monies these costs are not affordable at present.</p><p>   In 2011 I indicated to the NRA that they should withdraw their application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for the M20 Cork to Limerick route. I was concerned that to proceed any further with the scheme to build the M20 would have exposed the NRA to significant costs arising from a consequent requirement to purchase the CPO'd land within a limited timeframe.  This would have had to be done without the reasonable prospect of proceeding to construction stage quickly.  I don&rsquo;t believe the basis exists at present that would give confidence that a PPP of the scale of the M20 would be affordable or achievable and thereby justify commencing the project through planning again. However, this position is constantly under review.</p><p>   Regarding developments along the route at Rourkes Cross and Charleville, as the planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority  I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The decision to operate vessels is a commercial decision for the vessel operators themselves.</p><p>  Inland waterways hauliers&rsquo; licences arise under Council Directive 96/50/EC, which harmonises conditions for obtaining national boatmaster certificates for carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Community.  Ireland is exempt from this Directive as operators of passenger boats in Ireland operate exclusively on national waterways not linked to the navigable network of another Member State.  National certificates are limited to these national waterways, but Ireland has nevertheless the obligation to provide access to boatmasters from other Member States, carrying relevant certificates under the Directive.</p><p>  The development of interconnected inland commercial transport to attract commercial craft to the inland waterways would be a matter for my colleagues the Ministers for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht (responsible for Waterways Ireland); Public Expenditure and Reform (responsible for OPW); and Environment, Community and Local Government (regarding emissions and pollution control).</p></reply>
