This will enable us to benchmark our linguistic competence against ourselves and in comparison with other countries.  This will also facilitate objective target-setting for performance in languages.  To this end, we will mainstream use of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-05-24a.26.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017052400070#WRB00700"><p>The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.</p></reply>

They have provided me with the following information. </p><p>Examination superintendents are appointed annually by the SEC.  Appointment in one year does not necessarily guarantee appointment in any subsequent year.  The positions are advertised:</p><p>- in the national newspapers; </p><p>- by issuing the previous year&rsquo;s superintendents with an application form;</p><p>- by supplying application forms to all post-primary schools. </p><p>To be eligible for appointment, applicants must satisfy all of the terms and conditions for appointment set out by the SEC.  Since 2013, this includes a requirement to be registered on the Register of Teachers maintained by the Teaching Council of Ireland, a change that was linked to requirements under the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. </p><p>The SEC has a long-standing policy of prioritising applications from non-permanent teachers in the appointment of superintendents.  Retired teachers may also apply and be appointed in accordance with the terms of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which prohibits discrimination in employment on a number of grounds, including age.  The SEC emphasises its policy of prioritising applications from substitute or unemployed teachers in the recruitment section on its website and in recruitment information sent to schools for distribution to teachers.  To give effect to this policy the SEC appoints all unemployed and substitute teachers, who apply for the role of Superintendent, before any other appointments are made to this role provided they are otherwise eligible.</p></reply>

When considering secondment applications schools are requested to consider national/ education objectives and policies and to facilitate, where possible, the release of teachers to national programmes for the benefit of the wider school community.</p>  <p>  Information abstracted from a manual database indicates that seventy three primary teachers were on secondments in excess of five years in the period 2009 to 2014.  The numbers in Voluntary secondary and community/ comprehensive schools on secondments in excess of five years in the same period was one hundred and eighty five.  Information on secondments in E.T.Bs is not available in my Department.  The other information requested involves the examination of the hundreds of personal records and it has not been possible to dedicate the time required to undertake this task to date. </p>  <p>  In 2010 a new limit on secondment numbers for teacher CPD support services and for positions in management and other bodies or working on programmes run by the Department was introduced.  It is a condition of the revised arrangements that the maximum length of time that any teacher may be on secondment is set at 5 years, following which they may return to their schools. </p>  <p>  The rationale for the revised policy on secondments is the need to ensure that only persons with recent knowledge and experience of teaching and learning and curriculum are involved in the design and delivery of professional development programmes for teachers.</p>  <p>  While some difficulty was experienced implementing the new requirements particularly in relation to those who were on secondment prior to the new requirements being introduced in 2010, the 5 year limit has been implemented with some strictly limited alleviation agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for the Education Centres and support services to facilitate succession planning at local and national levels.</p>  <p>  Draft proposals to amend the length of secondment arrangements to Department approved programmes are currently being considered under the auspices of the Teacher Conciliation Council. </p>  <p>  The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  Once finalised it is planned to publish the new revised secondment scheme.</p></reply>

Devising an integrated implementation plan for Arts-in-Education is a priority under Pillar 1 of the programme, whose aim is to enable the creative potential of every child to be realised.  This includes the objective that by 2022 every child in Ireland will have access to tuition and participation in art, music, drama and coding.  The plan &ndash; &lsquo;Creative Children&rsquo; &ndash; is to be launched in September 2017. </p>  <p>  Work on the &lsquo;Creative Children&rsquo; plan is currently being progressed by my Department in close collaboration with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Arts Council. It is envisaged that the Creative Children plan will comprise three key strands.  These connected strands will have overlapping concepts and themes.  and it will be important to ensure there is co-operation and synergy across activities.  This will ensure that the overarching goal of Pillar 1 can be achieved, providing successful experiences relating to arts, creativity and innovation, for our children and young people, and for our society as a whole. </p>  <p>  It is proposed that these 3 strands will be:</p>  <p>  1. Creative Schools / Scoileanna Ild&aacute;nacha - which will see special teams of teachers and artists working together in schools to help make the arts a key part of school life.</p>  <p>  2. Professional Development Strategies, for teachers and artists.</p>  <p>  3. Further Arts Education Initiatives - under a plan that will encourage, highlight and recognise the non-formal and non-mainstream initiatives in arts education and creativity.</p>  <p>  My Department is working closely with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Arts Council in developing the plan for Pillar 1 of the programme.  The overall Creative Ireland programme will shortly be considered by Government, following which the issue of programme funding will be progressed through the estimates and budgetary process.</p></reply>

GMGY is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none. </p>  <p>  In Junior Infants to 2nd Class, the children follow the GMGY programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes.  There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme.  In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four week period during GMGY time according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents. Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping.  In 3rd to 6th   class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together. Belief-specific teaching is integrated into GMGY for these classes. </p>  <p>  The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in Junior Infants to 2nd   class has evolved.  The majority of CNS schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four week period.  Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all class groups remain together throughout.  However, they continue to follow the GMGY programme.  I have previously indicated that I see merit in this approach. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is to commence a review of the GMGY programme for Junior Infants to 2nd   class, starting in September 2017.  As part of that review, the belief-specific teaching aspect of the programme will be examined.  The Education and Training Boards, as patrons, are also looking at how GMGY can be delivered on the ground in the most inclusive fashion possible.  I look forward to seeing the outcomes of these processes.</p></reply>

In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department is included among the prescribed bodies to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development and local area plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment and observations.  This enables local authorities to reserve future school sites in areas designated for proposed housing development.</p>  <p>  My Department's 6 Year Capital Programme prioritises building projects for areas where significant additional school places are required.  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 sets out the teaching resources available for schools for the 2017/18 school year.  This budget represents the start of a major reinvestment in education and the first phase of implementation of the Action Plan for Education, aimed at becoming the best education system in Europe within a decade.  The budget provides for over 2,400 additional teaching posts for our primary and post-primary schools next year.  This includes additional teaching posts to meet demographic need, curriculum reform, additional guidance posts, additional resource teaching posts, addition teaching support for DEIS schools and the strengthening of school leadership. </p>  <p>  My Department's policy is that children with special educational needs should be included in mainstream placements with additional supports provided, unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or in the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school.  My Department, therefore, provides for a range of placement options and supports for schools, which have enrolled pupils with special educational needs, in order to ensure that wherever a child is enrolled, (s)he will have access to an appropriate education.  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  There are currently 1,152 special classes nationally, which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.  Of these, 126 are ASD early intervention classes, 526 are primary ASD classes and 236 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non-ASD special classes.  The NCSE has informed my Department that it intends to establish an additional 181 Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year which will bring the total number of Special Classes available across the country to 1334.</p></reply>

This was part of the latest call issued by the HEA regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape.  The call sought submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.</p><p>Arising from the submissions received and subsequent detailed presentations made to the HEA, the TUSE project were allocated a ring-fenced sum of &euro;1.445 Million in 2016 to support the further development of the project (&euro;400,000 of this was provided to consortium in November 2016 for 2017 work on project). </p><p>The key merger objectives to be funded are:-</p><p>- A re-engagement plan, agreed by both Institutes.</p><p>- The publication of an agreed vision and values for a TUSE.</p><p>- Fostering a high level of staff and stakeholder engagement to help design the future TU.</p><p>- Developing a Regional Stakeholder Forum to underpin the potential of this new Institution to exert a transformational impact on the region by interacting very closely with stakeholders throughout its formative stages;</p><p>- External support to facilitate and support change management. </p><p>The Technological Universities Bill,  which was published in December 2015, is to give effect to the recommendations set out in the National Strategy for Higher Education with regard to the IOT sector, including the development of a new technological university model.  In addition, the Bill provides for a number of important reforms to the governance and operation of the existing institutes of technology.</p><p>In relation to the legislation, the third Government Legislative Programme of this Partnership Government was published on 17 January 2017, and the Technological Universities Bill is listed on the D&aacute;il Order Paper and is awaiting Committee Stage.  </p><p>When I became Minister for Education and Skills, I recognised that there were a significant number of matters raised previously in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage.  A process of consultation has been underway with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Following the finalisation of this consultation process I intend to advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p><p>- 63% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 11% to attend special schools.</p><p>My Department considers it essential that in assessing the need for special class placements the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there.  This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p><p>- S/he has ASD </p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 at present.  The NCSE has informed my Department that it intends to establish an additional 181 Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year which will bring the total number of Special Classes available across the country to 1334.</p><p>This will include 143 ASD early intervention classes, 626 primary ASD classes and 281 post-primary ASD classes.  </p><p>The number of Post Primary ASD special classes available for the 2017/18 school year will be more than double that available in 2013/14, increasing from 124 in 2013/14 to 281 in 2017/18.  This is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary ASD special class numbers. </p><p>However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.  This is because, for children with Autism, transferring from a special class in a primary school to a special class in a post primary school may not always be the optimal choice.  Many children can progress to mainstream post primary with support of SNA and Resource Teaching hours, while more may transfer from primary to a special school depending on their presentation and needs.</p><p>It should also be noted that there is a proportionally larger enrolment at Primary level due to the higher number of standard years.</p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required. </p><p>Parents/guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child.  Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>Where there is no educational placement available, my Department will consider applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme, where a student can receive 20 hours home tuition per week as an interim measure until a placement becomes available.</p></reply>

However, the reality of the economic situation and the public expenditure corrections which had to be made in recent years presented challenges across all areas of public expenditure, including higher education. The sector has responded well to these challenges and has continued to provide opportunities for increasing numbers of students to undertake a higher education qualification. </p>  <p>  The Report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding of Higher Education (Cassells Report) found that a capital programme of &euro;5.5 billion is required over the next 15 years.  This has informed the submission of my Department to the ongoing Capital Review process led by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. This submission was also informed by responses from Higher Education Institutions to a consultation process on capital requirements recently undertaken by the Higher Education Authority, with the support of my Department. </p>  <p>  In the meantime, the Deputy will be aware that the 2016-2021 Capital Plan provides for a direct Exchequer investment of &euro;150m in higher education, including &euro;40m already allocated to the Grangegorman project.

An important focus of the funding will be on addressing infrastructural deficits that exist in the Institutes of Technology. </p>  <p>  In 2016, my Department provided capital funding of almost &euro;20m for Institutes of Technology, including a &euro;10m provision for urgent minor works and equipment renewal. </p>  <p>  The Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority are currently progressing the prioritisation of projects for the PPP programme.</p></reply>

Each of these schools was given an opportunity to have a teacher trained as a Reading Recovery teacher. In some areas where training took place in local cluster groups, schools other than those targeted in the DEIS Action Plan were allowed to participate in the programme.</p>  <p>  My Department, through the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), continues to prioritise this support for DEIS schools as well as maintaining ongoing support for other schools already participating in the Reading Recovery programme.</p>  <p>  New non DEIS schools have not been permitted to join the Reading Recovery programme in light of the extensive programme of support now available to all schools in the area of literacy.</p>  <p>  The Educational Research Centre (ERC) has reported positively on the range of interventions, including Reading Recovery, in place for DEIS schools. Inspectorate evaluations also demonstrate that the effectiveness of specialised programmes is maximised when they are integrated into the overall literacy programme in a school. </p>  <p>  Support for all schools, DEIS and non DEIS, provided by the PDST takes this into account as part of the ongoing professional development programme for "Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life - The National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy for Children and Young People 2011 - 2020" and its "Interim Review Report 2017".</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers. </p>  <p>  The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships has been low as these programmes operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment. While SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices, the number remains low.</p>  <p>  Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  The first of these new apprenticeships were launched in 2016, with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship getting underway in November. We have already seen an increase in female participation in these new programmes with almost 40% of the initial intake on the Insurance Practitioner programme being female. 13 further new apprenticeships will get underway in 2017, many of which are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident, as these new apprenticeships are rolled out, that this will lead to a continued increase in female participation. </p>  <p>  As set out in the recently published Action Plan to Extend Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, my Department will, in conjunction with SOLAS, review the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation, in light of the broadening of the apprenticeship system into new areas. The review will be completed in 2018 and any recommendations made will be implemented immediately.</p>  <p>  Recently, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship got underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website www.apprenticeship.ie, an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. In all aspects of the digital campaign women feature prominently and as the campaign rolls out, there will be a specific focus on encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeship as a means of launching or developing their careers.</p></reply>

The Charter is an initiative of my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, working in association with the Arts Council.  Through the co-operation of both Departments and the Arts Council, good progress has been made on implementation of the Charter objectives to date. </p>  <p>  One of the commitments in the Arts in Education Charter is to support and encourage schools to make their facilities available for out-of-hours community, recreational and cultural activities, in so far as is practicable. Many schools already make their premises available to the local community outside of school hours; and schools profit from an improved relationship with the wider community as a result. Being linked effectively with the local community can help the school to provide a wider curriculum and range of co-curricular activities. </p>  <p>  It is for this reason that my Department has published in 2016 &ldquo;Looking at our Schools 2016&rdquo; - A Quality Framework for Primary Schools and &ldquo;School Self-evaluation Guidelines for Post-Primary Schools&rdquo;. These guidelines suggest that the relationship between the school and the wider community should form one of the self-evaluation criteria for schools. Schools shall now in their school policies and plans, where possible, include arts-in-education opportunities as an important aspect of enriching the curriculum and the wider life of the school.  </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s first Arts in Education Portal was launched in May 2015.  The Arts in Education Portal was developed in partnership with the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and has become a key national resource for arts education. </p>  <p>  In 2015, Music Generation Ltd. announced Phase 2 of the initiative during which up to 9 additional new Music Education Partnerships will be established over the period from 2017 up to 2021. The application process for these new partnerships is currently underway. </p>  <p>  'Creative Ireland' is the Government&rsquo;s legacy programme to the successful 'Ireland 2016' initiative. It is a five-year programme, from 2017 to 2022, which places creativity at the centre of public policy. The Arts in Education Charter is to be embraced, fast-tracked and further resourced over the coming years as part of the Creative Ireland programme.</p></reply>

These schools now form part of the network of specialised placements for students with ASD.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes and special schools in various geographical areas where there is an identified need and continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required.</p>  <p>  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1152 across the country in 2017, of which 888 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  The NCSE has informed the Department that it intends to establish an additional 162 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year increasing the number of ASD Special Classes by 18% from 888 to 1,050. This will include 17 new ASD early intervention classes, 100 new primary ASD classes and 45 new post-primary ASD classes.</p></reply>

However, unlike other subject areas, the content of the religious curriculum provided by schools is not set by the Department of Education and Skills. The Education Act recognises the rights of the different church authorities to design curricula in religious education and to supervise their teaching and implementation. This means that the content of the religious education programme in a particular primary school is determined by the patron of the school. </p>  <p>  In relation to Garda vetting, the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 2012 to 2016 (the Vetting Act) was commenced by my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality in April of last year and put in place certain statutory requirements for the Garda vetting of persons involved in working with children and vulnerable persons.   When the vetting requirements were commenced last year, my Department issued circular 0031/2016 which set out the statutory vetting requirements applicable to schools along with the practical arrangements in place to support the vetting procedures.  A Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) document was also published by the Department to assist schools with queries in respect of the circular.   Responsibility for ensuring that any statutory vetting requirements are met rests with each individual school authority. It is therefore a matter for each school authority to determine, having regard to the particular circumstances in question and the requirements of the Vetting Act, whether any vetting requirement applies in respect of a person or persons undertaking work in the school.</p></reply>

The congregation&rsquo;s letter states that its intention is to use part of the proceeds of the disposal to meet its outstanding contribution of &euro;8.8 million relating to the voluntary offer it made in 2009 in response to the findings of the Ryan report. The congregation also advised me that it will have provided the college with 6.5 acres, inclusive of the school and lands transferred in 2008 and the 3.5 acres of playing grounds now transferring.</p>  <p>  I am not privy to the deliberations or the debates within the congregation on why these particular lands were selected for disposal. </p>  <p>  As I noted, the congregation has an outstanding redress contribution of &euro;8.8 million.

I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system. Teachers are not paid equally. For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching. Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods. Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. </p>  <p>  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Commissioner that in regard to the deployment of Garda personnel, a distribution model is used which takes into account all relevant factors including population, crime trends and the policing needs of each individual Garda Division. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within his/her Division. The Commissioner has advised that all Garda&iacute;, not simply designated Community Garda&iacute; have a role to play in addressing community policing issues as and when the need arises and, in that sense, community policing involves far more than a single unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. </p>  <p>  I am further informed by the Commissioner that, as of the 31 March 2017, there were 323 Garda including 4 Community Garda together with 22 Garda Reserves  attached to the Kildare Division. When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. </p>  <p>  Community policing is at the heart of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. It provides a means of recognising that every community &ndash; both urban and rural &ndash; has its own concerns and expectations. In this regard I welcome the strong emphasis placed by the Garda Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 on further developing and supporting the community policing ethos of the organisation so that Garda&iacute; spend more time in the community, gaining public confidence and trust and providing a greater sense of security. Proposed initiatives include the establishment of local Community Policing Teams (CPTs) headed by an Inspector and made up of Garda&iacute; from across a range of areas to proactively work with the community to prevent and detect crime; and the establishment of Community Safety Fora in every District comprising local Garda&iacute;, local communities and key stakeholders. </p>  <p>  This Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Funding has also been provided for the recruitment of 300 Garda Reserves.</p>  <p>  This plan is progressing apace. I am informed by the Commissioner, since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, that just under 1,000 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide 50 of whom have been assigned to the Kildare Division.  I am also informed that another 600 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end -  an increase of 500 since the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; including Community Garda&iacute; across every Garda Division in the coming years. To ensure a continuous pipeline of candidates a new recruitment drive was launched by the Commissioner earlier this month with a closing date of 1 June. The competition is being undertaken by the Public Appointment Service on behalf of the Commissioner and applications should be made to www.publicjobs.ie.</p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan. This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will see an increase in Garda visibility in our communities.</p></reply>

The Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act 1962 provides that free legal aid may be granted in certain circumstances for the defence of persons of insufficient means in criminal proceedings.  Under the 1962 Act, the courts, through the judiciary, are responsible for the granting of legal aid.  An applicant must establish to the satisfaction of the court that their means are insufficient to enable them to pay for legal representation themselves.  The court must also be satisfied that, by reason of the "gravity of the charge" or "exceptional circumstances", it is essential in the interests of justice that the applicant should have legal aid.  An applicant's previous convictions are not a criterion for access to legal aid under the Act.  I have no function in these matters which are determined by the judiciary.</p>  <p>These provisions must have regard to the right to a fair trial, including the provision of legal aid where appropriate, which is a Constitutional right upheld by the courts in a number of judgments.  The Supreme Court ruling in the case of State (Healy) v Donoghue [1976]I.R. 325 effectively determined that the right to criminal legal aid is, in circumstances which are quite wide in practice, a Constitutional right.  Article 6(3)(c) of the European Convention on Human Rights states that "Everyone charged with a criminal offence has [the right] to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing or, if he has not sufficient means to pay for legal assistance, to be given it free when the interests of justice so require".</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, an accused person is entitled to a presumption of innocence and legal representation and any obstacles to obtaining necessary legal aid which were found to be unreasonable could give a defendant an avenue for appeal or prohibition of the prosecution.  The overriding concern is to ensure that no risk arises in relation to the prosecution of persons charged with criminal offences before the courts.</p>  <p>Work on the preparation of a draft General Scheme of a Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill is at an advanced stage in my Department.  The key purpose of the legislation is to transfer the administration of the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme to the Legal Aid Board and to give effect to Government Programme commitments in respect of criminal legal aid, including introducing a more rigorous and objective means testing system for criminal legal aid, provision for contributions, and new sanctions.   It is my intention to seek approval of Government for the General Scheme of the Bill and submit it to the Oireachtas for pre-legislative scrutiny as early as is practicable.</p></reply>

This position is reinforced by the EU framework for insurance which expressly prohibits Member States from adopting rules which require insurance companies to obtain prior approval of the pricing or terms and conditions of insurance products.  Consequently, I am not in a position to direct insurance companies as to the pricing level that they should apply to particular categories of individuals.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, I am aware of the matter raised by the Deputy.  I established the Cost of Insurance Working Group and appointed Minister of State Eoghan Murphy as Chair.  The Report on the Cost of Motor Insurance was published in January 2017.  It contains 33 recommendations and 71 actions which are detailed in an action plan contained in the Report with agreed timelines for implementation.  Recommendation 6 of the Report, in particular, aims to address the problems faced by returning emigrants regarding the recognition of no claims bonuses through the introduction of a standard protocol for insurance providers, to ensure a greater consistency of treatment for returning emigrants.  This is required to be in place by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Also the Deputy should note that by Q2 2017, insurers are being asked to implement procedures when pricing a policy to enable the acceptance of driver experience from abroad when a person has previous driving experience in Ireland and is coming from a country that drives on the left side of road. By Q4 2017, insurers are being asked to implement a similar procedure in relation to experience gained in a country that drives on the right hand side of the road. Insurance Ireland will submit a report to my Department on the implementation of these procedures in Q2 and Q4 2017.</p></reply>

To qualify for a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:  </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; </p>  <p>  - be without both hands or without both arms;  </p>  <p>  - be without one or both legs; </p>  <p>  - be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;  </p>  <p>  - have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Scheme. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations.</p>  <p>  The criteria to qualify for the Scheme are necessarily precise and specific.  After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and fuel grant provided for members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;65 million in 2016. This does not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.  </p>  <p>  I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities and that the relief has been maintained at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. From time to time I receive representations from individuals who feel they would benefit from the Scheme but do not qualify under the six criteria. While I have sympathy for these cases, given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

Schools should also use their autonomy under the staffing schedule to implement smaller class sizes for junior classes.  However, it is the responsibility of the Principal teacher in consultation with the teaching staff to decide on the organisation of the pupils for teaching purposes.</p>  <p>  This position is reflected in the Primary School Curriculum (1999) which is set out across four stages, with each stage representing two class levels.   The curriculum provides for progressive and developmental learning experience for our pupils.  General guidance and advice for teachers are provided in National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) curriculum documents, and assessment guidelines etc.  that are applicable to all primary schools.</p>  <p>  The Primary School Curriculum (1999), which is child-centred rather than subject-centred, also allows for flexibility in timetabling and teaching methods.  It emphasises that children should experience learning through a variety of classroom organisational approaches.  While these include individual learning and whole-class teaching, the curriculum particularly encourages collaborative learning through pair work and group work as appropriate to the specific learning contexts and goals.  Within multi-grade classes, teachers may use a range of models for grouping pupils, including mixed ability grouping.  Integration and differentiation are also key approaches in the primary curriculum.  The organisation of teaching and learning through integrated themes can be highly motivating and satisfying for children and are particularly useful in multi-class situations.</p>  <p>  In general, the view of my Department is that, where combined classes are formed, mixed ability classes are preferable and my Department recommends random selection as a fair and educationally sound approach to the assignment of pupils to such cases.</p></reply>

All students in initial teacher education courses study the area of differentiation as a mandatory element of their programme, which is set out by the Teaching Council.   Students must also undertake a minimum of two placement settings incorporating a variety of teaching situations, class levels and school contexts, including, where possible, multi-class/mixed ability teaching situations.  Graduates of primary initial teacher education must also be able to demonstrate that they have established classroom management strategies and organisation skills to cater for a range of classroom situations.</p>  <p>  Newly qualified teachers receive additional support in multi-class teaching and differentiation through the mandatory workshop programme provided by the National Induction Programme for Teachers.  The Professional Development Service for Teachers provides continuous professional development for teachers in differentiated teaching and learning, which is a core methodology of all classrooms.  Discrete support for multi-class teaching is provided through the delivery of customised school-based support to individual schools or to clusters of schools who engage in regional and local projects where schools have multi-class settings.</p></reply>

All schools, not just those who queried the outcome of the February 2017 process, are being contacted to request them to ensure that their POD/PPOD data is fully correct and up to date, including Eircodes.  As soon as the 2016 National Census data becomes available later this summer, this data will be run through the identification model with the fully up-to-date POD/PPOD data.If this exercise reveals that any school which did not qualify for DEIS in the February 2017 round actually meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the fully up-to-date information then it will be included, subject to resources. </p><p>My Department intends to make available to all schools information relating to the identification process and their own individual school data.  Arrangements for this are in hand and schools will be advised in due course </p><p>I also wish to inform the Deputy that a communication to all schools will issue shortly to provide information on the identification model, including details of how the datasets are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for schools to provide detailed and up to date information to my Department's online pupil databases.</p><p>The implementation of the new objective central data-based model of identifying levels of disadvantage within school populations will be followed by a further programme of work to create a more dynamic model where levels of resource more accurately follow the levels of need identified by that model.

While my Department has provided advice and assistance to it in regard to its accommodation requirements, statutory responsibility for the decisions taken in regard to accommodation are a matter for the organisation itself and I have no role in those decision making processes.   My Department is not in a position to allocate space in any of its premises in Dublin city centre to Caranua.   I understand that the Caranua Board and executive have considered various alternative accommodations and have agreed to a new solution involving a rental payment on the basis that it meets the organisation&rsquo;s business needs and represents value for money having regard to current market conditions.  It is important also that the accommodation available to its staff members is of an appropriate standard.</p>  <p>  Caranua currently shares accommodation in a property in central Dublin assigned to my Department by the Office of Public Works (OPW).   The OPW is leasing this property from the landlord.   I understand that the lease on the property is due to expire at the end of this month &ndash; the lease having been extended at the request of OPW from its original expiry date of May 2016.   The OPW has secured alternative office accommodation in central Dublin for the occupiers of the current premises and I understand that the move to this new accommodation will take place in the near future.   OPW has informed my officials that Caranua will not be a party to the lease on the new premises but that there will be a side letter between it and OPW dealing with any relevant issues.   I understand that that is OPW&rsquo;s normal practice in such matters.   I am advised that Caranua&rsquo;s contribution to the rental cost of the premises will be in the region of &euro;220,000 per annum (plus VAT), together with some &euro;9,000 per annum for parking.  I understand also that some fit-out works will also be required on the new premises.   </p>  <p>  Section 7(7) of Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 permits Caranua, from time to time as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions and with the approval of the Minister, to enter into contracts with persons and to engage consultants or advisers and any moneys payable as a result of this must be paid by Caranua out of moneys at their disposal.   While Caranua has been in regular contact with my Department regarding its accommodation requirements and the necessity to move, it has not, at this time, submitted a contract in respect of its accommodation for the proposed new premises.</p>  <p>In conclusion, I should point out that Caranua&rsquo;s costs, including accommodation costs, must be met from the NTMA investment which is funded by religious contributions.  This arises from the provision in section 30(1) of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 which states that the &ldquo;expenses and other costs incurred by the Agency under this Act shall, subject to the approval of the Board, be charged on the investment account to the benefit of the Agency&rdquo;  .   The Department&rsquo;s legal advice is that Caranua&rsquo;s costs, including accommodation costs, must be met from the NTMA investment account.</p></reply>

Gross income before the deduction of income tax or the universal social charge, is assessed with certain specified social welfare and health service executive payments excluded.  </p>  <p>  The assessment of income from the same starting point is deemed to be fair and reasonable because this approach eliminates any distortion which might arise from different spending decisions in different households.  </p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme provides for different levels of income thresholds where families have (i) less than 4 dependent children (ii) between 4 and 7 dependent children and (iii) 8 or more dependent children.  In recognition of the additional cost to families where more than one person is attending college, income thresholds may also be increased by up to &euro;4,830 for each additional family member attending college at the same time.

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.  </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale.  </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start.  I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.   The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours.  </p>  <p>  The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service.  While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  In education, there is a well-established increment system.  Teachers are not paid equally.  For example, the pay scale for teachers appointed prior to 2011 ranges from &euro;32,009 to &euro;60,155 depending on the date that the individual began teaching.  Part of the negotiation to date has secured a convergence of the scales of recruits at different periods.  </p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector.  A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission.  The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve.  However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.</p></reply>

The Teacher Conciliation Council is part of the scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for Teachers and was set up to deal with claims and proposals relating to the Terms and Conditions of employment of teachers.  The Council is composed of representatives of teachers, school management, the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and is chaired by an official of the Workplace Relations Commission.</p>  <p>  The Teacher Exchange scheme is open to primary teachers who are registered with the Teaching Council, have completed probation and who wish to exchange their posts for educational purposes.  Educational purposes would include enabling teachers in primary schools to gain experience of teaching in different types of settings.  The concept is that teachers will gain a different experience, enrich their knowledge and understanding of their professional work and share this understanding with colleagues.</p>  <p>  The minimum period for which an exchange may occur is one year and the maximum is five years.  </p>  <p>  In 2016 the issue of this limit and the purpose of the scheme was reviewed under the auspices of Teachers Conciliation Council.  Having considered the matter and taking into account all circumstances both the union and management partners considered that their preferred option is to retain the existing scheme as set out in the published circular.</p>  <p>  However, in response to a request for consideration of a voluntary transfer scheme for Primary Teachers from the Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation, I have decided to extend the maximum period for which an exchange may occur for those teachers in their fifth and sixth year of exchange for one further year.  </p>  <p>  This new voluntary transfer scheme is to be considered under the auspices of the Teacher Conciliation Council.</p></reply>

Recruitment to apprenticeship is therefore driven by employers rather than by SOLAS or by education and training providers.  </p><p>The 2014 Review of Apprenticeship in Ireland acknowledged the number of women employed in craft apprenticeships has been low as these programmes operate in sectors that have traditionally low levels of female employment.  While SOLAS offers a bursary to employers to encourage them to employ female apprentices, the number remains low.</p><p>Currently the Apprenticeship Council is overseeing the expansion of the apprenticeship system into a range of new areas, following a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers.  The first of these new apprenticeships were launched in 2016, with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship getting underway in November.  We have already seen an increase in female participation in these new programmes with almost 40% of the initial intake on the Insurance Practitioner programme being female.  13 further new apprenticeships will get underway in 2017, many of which are in sectors where there is a different gender balance in the workplace and I am confident, as these new apprenticeships are rolled out, that this will lead to a continued increase in female participation.  </p><p>As set out in the recently published Action Plan to Extend Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, my Department will, in conjunction with SOLAS, review the pathways to participation in apprenticeship in a range of diverse groups, including female participation, in light of the broadening of the apprenticeship system into new areas.  The review will be completed in 2018 and any recommendations made will be implemented immediately.</p><p>Recently, a digital campaign to promote apprenticeship got underway with a dedicated Twitter feed #Generation Apprenticeship, a new apprenticeship website<i></i>www.apprenticeship.ie, an Apprenticeship Ireland Facebook page and a LinkedIn page. In all aspects of the digital campaign women feature prominently and as the campaign rolls out, there will be a specific focus on encouraging women and girls to consider apprenticeship as a means of launching or developing their careers.</p></reply>

There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision.</p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that. There will be a role for the existing patron/landowner in consulting with local community and school interests and taking into account proposals from different prospective multi-denominational patrons.  It is envisaged that transfers will largely be by way of voluntary transfer of live schools by existing patrons.</p>  <p>  While these new structures are being introduced, my Department will continue to work with the main stakeholders to progress delivery of choice in areas already identified, in 2017 and beyond.  </p>  <p>  As the Deputy will also be aware my Department uses a Geographical Information System to identify areas under increased demographic pressure nationwide. When it is decided that a new school is required to meet demographic needs my Department runs a separate patronage process to decide who will operate the school. Following patronage processes, which give significant weight to parental demand, the vast majority of new schools which are established come under multi-denominational patronage. </p>  <p>  Since 2011, 31 new primary schools and 37 new post-primary schools have been, or are in the process of being, established.  </p>  <p>  All of the 31 primary schools are multi-denominational and 32 of the 37 post-primary schools are multi-denominational.</p></reply>

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. </p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p>  <p>  The model will allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are now published and available on the Departments website.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants.</p></reply>

Indeed international research indicates that school leadership is second only to classroom teaching as an influence on pupil learning. </p>  <p>  Budget 2016 provided 250 posts to second level schools to enable Deputy Principals to be more fully available to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. At primary level Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts in both the primary and post-primary sector. </p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals. It has been created to offer professional and practical support to schools leaders. This support structure for leadership teams in schools will attempt to ensure that school leaders have opportunities to access, share and create knowledge and experience within their leadership roles. The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders. Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards. </p>  <p>  Last year my Department published &ldquo;Looking at Our School 2016", a quality framework for primary and post primary schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p>  <p>  The current review of the post of responsibility structure in schools will, in the context of restoration of posts, address the further development of a distributed leadership model.</p></reply>

This is the first significant investment in the sector in 9 years &ndash; a period in which State investment in higher education fell by 33% (&euro;463 million). This will allow us for the first time to keep pace with demographic increases and also introduce targeted initiatives in priority areas, in particular disadvantage, skills, research and flexible learning, with thousands of students benefitting under each heading.</p>  <p>  In addition, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently completing a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training. The proposal under consultation seeks to deliver up to an additional &euro;200m per annum by 2020 through an increase in the National Training Fund levy. </p>  <p>  Meanwhile, to examine the proposals that can add to these two elements and put in place a sustainable system of funding that can deliver a world-class third level system for the medium and long term, in 2016 I published the Cassells report, and as committed to in the Programme for Government, that report is currently with the Oireachtas Committee.</p>  <p>  This is an area where broad political consensus is needed on the future direction, and I will be working to build that consensus. The Funding Model review will compliment the ongoing work by the Oireachtas Committee in relation to the Cassells report.</p>  <p>  In relation to student supports, my Department is investing in a significant programme of supports in order to assist students from under-represented groups to participate in and complete higher education. </p>  <p>  In total my Department will invest approximately &euro;450 million in access supports in the 2017/18 academic year. This will benefit approximately 80,000 disadvantaged students through the student grant scheme. Other measures include the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities.</p></reply>

The financial and other consequences for ASTI members of failure to co-operate with the terms of the agreement were formally notified to ASTI in June 2016.  It was indicated at that time that in the event of continuing failure to co-operate in the medium term, further additional measures may also ensue.  </p><p>A number of measures are being applied since July 2016 or will be applied to ASTI members in consequence:</p><p>- The pay increases for 2012 new entrant teachers that are effective from 1 January 2017 and 1 January 2018 do not apply;</p><p>- Increments are frozen until July 2018;</p><p>- Missing out on inclusion of the S&amp;amp;S allowance of &euro;1,592 into the pay scale &ndash; the first moiety of this due on 1 September 2016 (&euro;796) has not been paid;</p><p>- The alleviation of the FEMPI Act pay reductions for higher earners has been withdrawn, meaning a further pay reduction of up to &euro;1,769 per teacher;</p><p>- Non-application of the &euro;1,000 increase being paid to public servants on 1 April 2017, as brought forward from 1 September 2017 under the LRA;</p><p>- The Ward Report measures have been withdrawn and the revised sequence for filling posts is not being applied &ndash; both of these would enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more easily and quickly than before;</p><p>- Promotion posts announced in Budget 2017 will not be available;</p><p>- The additional teacher allocation/reduction in class contact time from September 2017 for teachers with Junior Cycle classes will not apply;</p><p>- No S&amp;amp;S opt-out option;</p><p>- No S&amp;amp;S opt-in option;</p><p>- Missing out on chance to influence use of Croke Park hours through a review;</p><p>- Potential for job losses through compulsory redundancy;</p><p>- Withdrawal of enhanced redundancy payment where a teacher is made redundant;</p><p>- Potential delay or loss of the pay increase of &euro;1,000 due on 1 September 2017 and the reversal of the pay reductions for higher earners due on 1 April 2017.</p><p>Following discussions, the Teachers Conciliation Council published a set of proposals in November for consideration by ASTI members aimed at finding a resolution to their dispute. ASTI members have chosen to reject the proposals put forward aimed at resolving their dispute and in consequence, to reject the Lansdowne Road Agreement. It is regrettable that many ASTI members will now suffer permanent financial losses and loss of other benefits as a result of this choice.  </p><p>The proposals represented the final outcome of the process and there will be no further offer made to ASTI. </p><p>The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with TUI and INTO will see pay rises of between 15-22% (between &euro;4600 and &euro;6700) for new entrant teachers.  The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours. </p><p>Any further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay will be informed by the recently published analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission. The Government established the Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p><p>I accept that the teacher unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance that they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress, and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of public service pay talks.  My colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, invited the Public Services Committee of ICTU to discussions on public service pay and a continued approach to the unwinding of the FEMPI legislation and these discussions are now underway.</p></reply>

Among those strategies are the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019. </p><p>The Action Plan for Education 2016 &ndash; 2019 provides a key statement on the reform agenda across the education and training system. The Plan contains a range of actions to be implemented with particular focus on disadvantage, skills needs, and continuous improvement within the education service. A key objective of this Plan is to address the identified skills needs across key priority sectors of the economy identified by the SLMRU. These sectors include financial services, manufacturing and ICT, transport, business administration and many others.</p><p>The National Skills Strategy 2025 has over 120 Actions involving over 50 stakeholders, the purpose of the Strategy is to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland&rsquo;s growth both economically and societally over the next decade.  Included in the actions in the Strategy is the creation of a new National Skills Council. The Council had its first meeting on the 15th May. The Council will oversee research and advise on prioritisation and delivery of identified skills needs. Skills information from the EGFSN, the SLMRU and the Regional Skills Fora will feed into the work of the Council. </p><p>Within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, significant improvements have been made in the planning and funding of provision since the publication of the FET Strategy in 2014.  Education and Training Boards engage in a service planning process annually against a range of detailed parameters set by SOLAS.  This process has been refined and improved each year and includes the use of strengthened labour market data provided by the SLMRU to ensure that the skill needs of learners and enterprise are met. </p><p>In the Higher Education Sector, the primary objective of Springboard+ in 2017 is to provide upskilling and reskilling courses to develop the talent base in Ireland in key growth sectors of the economy. including ICT; hospitality; biopharma, medical device technologies and manufacturing; financial services; and entrepreneurship. This year the eligibility criteria has been expanded to include homemakers and those in employment who wish to upskill or  reskill in specific high demand skills areas ie Biopharma/Med-tech. </p><p><b></b>The Action plan to expand apprenticeship and traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 now sets out a clear pathway for developing new apprenticeships as well as targets for the development of new programmes. The Plan committed to a new call for proposals in 2017 to refresh the pipeline already established through the 2015 call, this second call for proposals was issued on 8 May. The Apprenticeship Council has prepared a handbook &ldquo;Developing a National Apprenticeship&rdquo; to accompany this second call. The plan also commits to examining the potential for public sector engagement with the apprenticeship system. The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed through the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s first call for proposals, launched in September 2016 and an Industrial Engineer Apprenticeship commenced in November 2016.  13 further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.</p></reply>

The central vision of the Plan is that the Irish Education and Training System should become the best in Europe over the next decade. The Plan&rsquo;s high-level goals are based on the five policy areas which I believe will help us to achieve this ambition. The goals are:</p>  <p>  1. Improve the learning experience and the success of learners</p>  <p>  2. Improve the progress of learners at risk of educational disadvantage or learners with special educational needs</p>  <p>  3. Help those delivering education services to continuously improve</p>  <p>  4. Build stronger bridges between education and wider community</p>  <p>  5. Improve national planning and support services.</p>  <p>  The basic aim of this Government is to sustain our economic progress and use it to build a fair and compassionate society. Education is the best means of delivering a fairer society, breaking down cycles of disadvantage and ensuring that all our people, in particular those with special educational needs, are able to participate in that progress and fulfil their potential. Excellent and innovative education and training are the pivot around which personal fulfilment, a fair society and a successful nation should revolve.  It is central to sustaining economic success and in converting economic success into building a strong community. Having the best education and training service in Europe will allow us to provide better opportunities for more people from disadvantaged groups, as well as ensuring that we create more sustainable well-paying jobs.</p>  <p>  Our approach to special education has undergone a huge transformation with a growing proportion of children with special educational needs being educated with their peers in mainstream schools.  The participation and progress of learners with special educational needs across the whole education system remains a key focus with an emphasis on improving whole-school and whole system approaches. The Action Plan 2017 sets out a range of measures which will be undertaken during this year. These include allocating teachers to schools under the new allocation model to support children with special educational needs, publishing the outcomes of a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme, and consult with partners on the implementation of sections of the EPSEN Act and on the provision of services to children with Down Syndrome. </p>  <p>  Quality of provision is the cornerstone to the success of the education and training system.  We recognise the fundamental roles that leaders, teachers and support staff play and we want to strengthen the system&rsquo;s capacity to continuously improve and to deliver the highest quality education and training services for learners. The Action Plan 2017 details actions which will ensure that leadership, management, quality frameworks, teaching methods, and initial and continuing training are all operating to the highest standards across the continuum of education and training provision. These actions include expanding the range of supports available through the Centre for School Leadership, providing dedicated professional support to teachers to support the implementation of curricular and policy change, and developing and introducing a new postgraduate qualification for aspiring school leaders.</p>  <p>  To become an innovation leader and to build a strong talent base, we as a nation must effectively engage with enterprise. We must work to address identified skills needs in critical areas, and recognise the shifting global economic and political climate in which services are delivered and jobs are created.  Successful enterprise engagement is the foundation of much of the planned activity detailed in the Action Plan 2017. This includes driving the growth of traineeships and apprenticeships, ensuring the relevance of work placements and work-based projects, and increasing the diversity of opportunity in learning beyond school. To advance this agenda, together with Minister Halligan, I launched the National Skills Council and the Regional Skills Fora last month. The Council&rsquo;s members are from senior levels within the public and private sectors, and they will oversee research, advise on the prioritisation of identified skills needs and on addressing those needs, and have a key role in promoting and reporting on the responses of education and training providers to the identified needs. The nine Regional Skills Fora will provide a cohesive education-led structure for employers and the further and higher education system to work together in addressing the skills needs of their regions, help employers to better understand and access the full range of services available across the system, enhance links between education and training providers in planning and delivering programmes, reduce duplication and inform national funding decisions.</p>  <p>  In order to ensure that progress is made in all of these areas, updated annual Action Plans will be published each year, detailing the actions that will be implemented during that year. As part of this process, actions will be monitored against published timelines and progress reports will be published on a quarterly basis. Recently, the 2016 End of Year Review and the 2017 Quarter 1 Progress Report were published. They are both available on the Department&rsquo;s website (www.education.ie), with full details of the actions already achieved in these three important areas. </p></reply>

This will contribute to delivering a step-change in the development of critical skills, knowledge and competences and providing the foundations for participation in work and society. </p>  <p>  The roll-out of the new Leaving Certificate subject of Politics and Society commenced in 41 schools in September 2016, following an open invitation to introduce this as an optional Leaving Certificate subject. Politics and Society aims to develop the student's ability to be a reflective and active citizen, in a way that is informed by the insights and skills of social and political science. The introduction of the specification was part of my Department's commemoration of 1916 and its commitment to education for sustainable development. The subject will be available to all schools from 2018. </p>  <p>  The Government is committed to enhancing the availability of technology in schools through the introduction of ICT/Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject. As set out in the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) is conducting a scoping exercise in this regard. Informed by this research, the NCCA are working on development of a draft subject specification in 2017, with a view to implementation in schools in September 2018. </p>  <p>  Physical Education has been developed by the NCCA as a full subject that can be assessed for the Leaving Certificate in a manner similar to other subjects. I have approved a Senior Cycle Framework for PE - non-examinable, and a Leaving Certificate PE specification- an examinable subject for Leaving Certificate. </p>  <p>  The Framework will assist schools to design a P.E. programme for those students who may not choose to take P.E. as part of their Leaving Certificate examination.  These developments are in keeping with the strong emphasis from my Department on promoting and encouraging Healthy Lifestyles for all students and commitments in the Programme for Partnership Government. </p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Education also includes commitments to finalise and implement additional subject specifications at Leaving Certificate level as resources permit.</p></reply>

At primary level, Budget 2016 provided for additional release days for teaching principals to range between 15 and 25 days depending on the size of the school. </p>  <p>  Budget 2017 provided for an additional &euro;7.75m to strengthen school leadership which has provided for the equivalent of 170 additional posts to second level schools to employ an additional Deputy Principal to assist the school principal with the leadership of the school. With effect from September 2017, schools with pupil enrolment in excess of 700 will be allocated additional Deputy Principal posts.</p>  <p>  Budget 2017 also provides for the commencement of the restoration of middle management posts in both the primary and post-primary sector with effect from the 2017/18 school year. </p>  <p>  The recently established Centre for School Leadership (CSL) is a collaboration between my Department and the representative professional bodies for school principals.

The work of the Centre draws on best international practice and research in the professional development of school leaders. Priorities for the Centre include a new post graduate qualification for aspiring school leaders, a mentoring programme for newly appointed school principals, coaching support for serving principals, a review and alignment of leadership programmes with Department standards. </p>  <p>  Last year my Department published &ldquo;Looking at Our School 2016", a quality framework for primary and post primary schools which is designed to support the efforts of teachers and school leaders, as well as the school system more generally, to strive for excellence in our schools. </p>  <p>  The current review of the post of responsibility structure in schools will, in the context of restoration of posts, address the further development of a distributed leadership model.</p></reply>

The quality of our teaching profession is the single most critical factor in sustaining and enhancing the quality of education outcomes in our system. We know that providing the best possible professional development and ongoing practical support to these key people in the education sector is vital if we are to realise the ambitious objectives that we have for Irish education. Specific targets for 2017 are outlined in the Action Plan for Education.</p>  <p>  My Department spent approximately &euro;46.5m on teacher continuing professional development (CPD) in 2016 across the primary and post primary sectors. The teacher CPD budget represents 0.56% of my Departments overall net expenditure.</p>  <p>  The spend of &euro;46.5m includes all costs associated with the provision of CPD at primary and post primary level funded by my Department.</p>  <p>  The professional development needs of serving teachers in recent years have been addressed through the provision of an induction programme for newly qualified teachers, national in-service for new and revised curriculum areas including junior cycle, the new primary language curriculum and ongoing support for the curriculum generally with a particular focus on priority areas -  literacy and numeracy, well-being, support for school leaders and for teachers to meet the needs of children with special educational needs. </p>  <p>  The responsibilities of the recently established Centre for School Leadership, a partnership between my Department, IPPN and NAPD, cover the range of leadership development from pre-appointment training and induction of newly appointed principals, to CPD throughout leaders' careers. </p>  <p>  Other areas of expenditure include training for child protection, Board of Management training, a Teacher Fee Refund Scheme, Teacher Professional Networks and a number of postgraduate programmes to meet particular identified needs such as the teaching of mathematics and special educational needs. </p>  <p>  The Teaching Council is the professional body and regulator for teachers.

No. 24950/17).</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to progressing the development of a dynamic and innovative education system that reflects the diversity of twenty-first Century Ireland.  The Programme for a Partnership Government reflects the Government&rsquo;s objective of strengthening parental choice and further expanding diversity in our school system.  The desire of parents for diversity in education is primarily being pursued by increasing the number of non-denominational and multi-denominational schools with a view to reaching 400 by 2030.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that on the 30th January, 2017, I  announced new plans aimed at providing more multi-denominational and non-denominational schools across the country, in line with the choices of families and school communities and the Programme for Government commitment in this area.</p>  <p>  This will involve the Education and Training Boards in the initial phase, as the State&rsquo;s local education authorities, identifying areas where there is likely to be demand for greater diversity and they will work with pre-school services to establish evidence of this demand among the cohort of pre-school parents. There will then be discussions between individual ETBs and the existing patrons/landowners concerning the possible transfer of schools to accommodate this demonstrated demand for diversity. My Department is currently working with the Education and Training Board sector and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to develop the process for the identification of demand for diversity at pre-school level.</p>  <p>  Each ETB will then prepare a report for the Department outlining the levels of demand within their functional areas and the responses of the existing patrons as to how this might be accommodated through the reconfiguration of existing school provision. The location of these schools is therefore unlikely to become available until after the reports have been submitted. </p>  <p>  In the subsequent implementation phase, where the level of demand for multidenominational schools is sufficient to justify transfer of a school from denominational to multi-denominational patronage, a process will commence to give effect to that.

This will benefit approximately 1,100 post graduate students who meet the eligibility criteria for the special rate of maintenance grant.</p>  <p>  The Student Grant Scheme is now open for applications for the 2017/18 academic year. This earlier opening date will facilitate earlier decisions for students on their grant applications and therefore provide students with greater certainty about the financial support that will be available to them. </p>  <p>  In addition to this specific measure targeted at postgraduate students, I also secured an additional &euro;4.5 million in Budget 2017 for other new access measures that will benefit target groups such as lone parents, travellers, mature students, and students with disabilities. </p>  <p>  The new measures being introduced as a result of Budget 2017 will complement the existing student supports that are already in place. In total my Department will invest approximately &euro;450 million in access supports in the 2017/18 academic year. This will benefit approximately 80,000 disadvantaged students through the student grant scheme. Other measures include the Student Assistance Fund and the Fund for Students with Disabilities.</p></reply>

The designation of any performance in the certificate examinations as a 'fail' ceased in 1968. </p>  <p>  The nature of curricular examinations such as the Leaving Certificate and the procedures currently in place for awarding grades are such that a certain amount of fluctuation in the grade distribution from year to year is to be expected. Grade distributions are also affected significantly by the proportion of candidates who opt to take the examination at each level. In particular, if the proportion of candidates opting for Higher level increases, the candidates making this move will tend to be those who were towards the higher achieving end of the Ordinary level distribution and will tend to fall at the lower achieving end of the Higher level distribution. This will obviously affect the grade distribution at both levels. Influenced by the combined effect of syllabus change in mathematics,  known as Project Maths, and the introduction by the Higher Education Institutions of 'bonus points' for Higher level mathematics, the number of students in recent years presenting for Higher level in Leaving Certificate Mathematics examinations has increased significantly, from 15.8% in 2011 to 28% in 2016. </p>  <p>  During the standard-setting process that happens as part of the marking process each year, the State Examinations Commission (SEC) takes account of these and any other relevant factors in the course of satisfying itself that the distribution of grades awarded is appropriate and that it accurately reflects the performance of the candidates in comparison to the achievement standards envisaged when the syllabus was designed.</p>  <p>  In the context of a significant migration of mathematics candidates from Ordinary to Higher level, it may be noted that a similar absolute number of candidates awarded E, F or no grade at Ordinary level will inevitably be manifested as a higher percentage, since the total number of candidates at this level has reduced.</p>  <p>  The number of candidates who failed to achieve at least a D3 grade at any level of the mathematics examination in 2016, while marginally higher than in the last three or four years, is very similar to the number in the years before that (2009 to 2011, for example). In the context of the factors mentioned above, there is nothing especially unusual about the grade distribution in mathematics for 2016.</p>  <p>  In the case of the current syllabus change in mathematics, there has been a deliberate attempt to increase the emphasis on higher-order thinking skills, including interpretation, problem solving, and dealing with the unfamiliar. These are skills that students find difficult to master and teachers find difficult to instil in students. The syllabus expectations are ambitious at all levels. </p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) will be undertaking a review of the Project Maths initiative, now that the full implementation of all phases of the curricular change is complete. By this time, students will have been through the new mathematics cycle a few times and the NCCA will have good information on which to base the assessment of its impact, especially on the learning of under-achievers. I have asked the SEC to ensure that any lessons that can be learned from candidate performance in recent examinations, and the 2016 examination in particular, be fed into that review process. The Project Maths Implementation Support Group, an industry-education partnership set up by my Department, including third level bodies, Engineers Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, will also be able to provide their considered opinions to this process.</p></reply>

This compares to 16% in 2012/13.   The rates of non-progression vary within and between sectors.</p>  <p>  Below average progression rates continue in the fields of Construction and Related, Services, Computer Science and Engineering with again variation between sectors and institutions.   However, there is some improvement reported in progression rates for Computer Science with rates increasing from 80% to 84%.  Institutes of technology rates have increased from 74% to 80% compared to universities from 85% to 88%.  This would indicate that the funding made available for retention measures is having a positive impact.</p>  <p>  The National Plan for Equity of Access to Higher Education, 2015-19, is the national policy framework for promoting access to, and successful completion of, higher education for students from groups that are currently under-represented in higher education. The vision of the National Access Plan is to ensure that the student body entering, participating in and completing higher education at all levels reflects the diversity and social mix of Ireland&rsquo;s population. The Plan contains 5 key goals and 28 actions that are scheduled for implementation in the period 2015 - 2019.  One of the actions is to address non-completion among the student population with a particular emphasis on &lsquo;access&rsquo; students.</p>  <p>  This action is currently underway. The Higher Education Authority (HEA) have produced a discussion paper on the factors that contribute to &lsquo;student success&rsquo;.  A Working Group has also been established, which is chaired by the HEA, and which comprises representatives from across the higher education sector. The intention is to identify the type of strategies and measures that have been shown to be successful in different institutional contexts. The National Forum for the enhancement of Teaching and Learning is currently facilitating a focussed scoping exercise to inform the activities of the Working Group.  The scoping exercise is being chaired by the Union of Students of Ireland. This will ensure that the student voice is central to this process. It is expected that the Working Group will produce its report by the end of 2017.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, in 2013, Ireland launched it's first Irish Survey of Student Engagement (ISSE) to take the views of students into account, particularly when looking at rates of non- progression. The results of the ISSE survey will continue to guide future policy decisions on retention across all years of higher education.</p></reply>

The report of the Expert Group on the Future Funding for Higher Education sets out a number of funding options for the sector with income contingent loans being just one of those options. Other options include a predominantly State-funded system or a State-funded system supplemented with continuing student fees. The Report is currently with the Joint Oireachtas Committee for consideration where each of the funding models will be examined and the process will include input from all stakeholders. I understand the Union of Students in Ireland are one of the groups who have made a submission.</p>  <p>  Following on from the report as the Minister for Education and Skills I have already acted to secure increased funding in  Budget 2017 of &euro;36.5m for higher education and to make further provision in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling for 2018 and 2019, which, cumulatively, represents an additional &euro;160m investment by the Exchequer in higher education in the period 2017 &ndash; 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently completing a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.

Substantial research, analysis, consultation with service users and stakeholders, and piloting have gone in to the development of this model and all of the evidence points to the fact that this new system will deliver better outcomes for children. </p>  <p>  No school will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. In addition, no school will receive an allocation, for the support of pupils with complex needs, less than the allocation they received to support such pupils during the 2016/17 school year. No allocation made for such pupils by the NCSE will be removed from schools as long as that pupil remains in the school. </p>  <p>  An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of this new allocation model. The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools. This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model. Supports for children with special educational needs is a key priority for this Government. The new funding will ensure that all schools receive a sufficient allocation of special education needs resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils, including pupils who have yet to enrol in their school, who require such support. </p>  <p>  Under the new allocation model, schools will be provided with a total allocation which includes a baseline allocation for the school and an allocation based on the school&rsquo;s profile. </p>  <p>  The provision of a profiled allocation will give a fairer allocation for each school which recognises that all schools need an allocation for special needs support, but which provides a graduated allocation which takes into account the actual level of need in each school. </p>  <p>  Schools will be frontloaded with resources, based on each school&rsquo;s profile, to provide supports immediately to those pupils who need it without delay. This will reduce the administrative burden on schools as schools will no longer have to complete an application process annually and apply for newly enrolled pupils who require resource hours. Children who need support can have that support provided immediately rather than having to wait for a diagnosis.</p>  <p>  Schools will therefore no longer have to make applications, for newly enrolled pupils for whom resource teaching hours may have been provided under the old model, or for pupils who have received a new diagnosis, as schools will now receive a single allocation for all of their special education teaching needs, based on their school size and profile.</p>  <p>  The new allocations to schools will include provision to support all pupils in the schools, including where a child receives a diagnosis after the allocation is received by a school, or where there are newly enrolling pupils to the school. </p>  <p>  All allocations to schools include a supplementary provision, which has been referred to as the &lsquo;baseline allocation&rsquo; which is allocated over and above the profiled allocation. </p>  <p>  For students who start school from September 2017, with a specific diagnosis, either in junior infants or transferring from another school, the resources they need will already be in the school under the new model.  </p>  <p>  It should be noted that this is a brand new model of allocation and is not comparable to the existing model. By using a broad range of attainment and socio-economic criteria, it is expected that generally, a school&rsquo;s profile will remain relatively constant from year to year.  Each year, some students with additional teaching needs will leave and others will enrol, broadly balancing the school profile. Resources allocated under this model will not normally be adjusted between allocations. </p>  <p>  DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p>  <p>  The model will allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model. The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance. Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p>  <p>  Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs are now published and available on the Departments website.</p>  <p>  The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs. The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p>  <p>  In relation to the matter raised by the school with regards to an application for an additional mainstream teacher, Circular 17/2017 (Primary School Staffing Schedule) provides details of how a school may apply for an additional mainstream staffing post on the basis that they are a developing school, or have projected increased enrolments, and the criteria for qualification under this process.</p></reply>

The demand for 2017/18 will not be known until the NCSE application process is complete.</p><p>There are currently over 12,500 learning support and resource teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools. An additional 900 teaching posts have also been provided to support the introduction of the new model for allocating Special Education Teaching Resources to mainstream primary and post primary schools from September 2017.  </p><p>My Department considers it essential that, in assessing the need for special class placements, the individual needs of children should be properly assessed to determine the appropriateness of special class provision for them.</p><p>Some students, although academically able to access the curriculum in mainstream, may find it too difficult to manage full-time placement there. This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p><p>Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that:</p><p>-  S/he has ASD </p><p>-  S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>125 special schools also provide specialist education for those pupils who need it.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE continues to establish additional special classes to support children with Special Educational Needs including Autism as required. Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of such classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1153 across the country in 2016/17, of which 888 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned. The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>With regard to Kildare, in particular, there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the County. Of these, 520 students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and SNA support. 322 students are attending 59 ASD special classes, including 6 Early Intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes. A further 100 students with ASD are placed in 4 special schools in the county. The number of ASD classes has increased in the area by 24% since the 2013/14 school year.</p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that it intends to establish 1 new ASD class at primary level and 2 new ASD classes at post-primary level in Co. Kildare for the 2017/18 school year.</p><p>Parents/Guardians who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) who can assist in identifying an appropriate educational placement for their child. Contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p><p>In recent years, the NCSE has provided my Department with a number of policy advice papers on the provision of supports for children with special needs, all of which are available on the NCSE&rsquo;s website.  It is intended to bring into effect many improvements to the provision of special educational needs support, through policy developments across a range of areas, in conjunction with NCSE policy advice.</p><p>As committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government, the adequacy of the present policies and provision and their scope for improvement is being examined. The NCSE are currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the SNA Scheme to ensure better outcomes for children with special educational needs. Following its pilot, the new model for allocating special needs teachers has been introduced in schools. </p><p>I can confirm that this Government will continue to ensure that the supports required, to ensure that all children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education, will be provided. </p><p>Further details on special classes, resource teaching and SNA allocations are available on the NCSE's website at <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</p></reply>

Among those strategies are the National Skills Strategy 2025 and the Action Plan for Education 2016-2019. </p><p>The Action Plan for Education 2016 &ndash; 2019 provides a key statement on the reform agenda across the education and training system. The Plan contains a range of actions to be implemented with particular focus on disadvantage, skills needs, and continuous improvement within the education service. </p><p>The National Skills Strategy 2025 has over 120 Actions involving over 50 stakeholders, the purpose of the Strategy is to provide a framework for skills development that will help drive Ireland&rsquo;s growth both economically and societally over the next decade.  Included in the actions in the Strategy is the creation of a new National Skills Council. The Council had its first meeting on the 15th May. The Council will oversee research and advise on prioritisation and delivery of identified skills needs. Skills information from the EGFSN, the SLMRU and the Regional Skills Fora will feed into the work of the Council. </p><p>Within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, significant improvements have been made in the planning and funding of provision since the publication of the FET Strategy in 2014.  Education and Training Boards engage in a service planning process annually against a range of detailed parameters set by SOLAS.  This process has been refined and improved each year and includes the use of strengthened labour market data provided by the SLMRU to ensure that the skill needs of learners and enterprise are met. </p><p>In the Higher Education Sector, the primary objective of Springboard+ in 2017 is to provide upskilling and reskilling courses to develop the talent base in Ireland in key growth sectors of the economy. including ICT; hospitality; biopharma, medical device technologies and manufacturing; financial services; and entrepreneurship. This year the eligibility criteria has been expanded to include homemakers and those in employment who wish to upskill or  reskill in specific high demand skills areas ie Biopharma/Med-tech. </p><p><b></b>The Action plan to expand apprenticeship and traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020 now sets out a clear pathway for developing new apprenticeships as well as targets for the development of new programmes. The Plan committed to a new call for proposals in 2017 to refresh the pipeline already established through the 2015 call, this second call for proposals was issued on 8 May. The Apprenticeship Council has prepared a handbook &ldquo;Developing a National Apprenticeship&rdquo; to accompany this second call. The plan also commits to examining the potential for public sector engagement with the apprenticeship system. The Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship, the first of the new programmes developed through the Apprenticeship Council&rsquo;s first call for proposals, launched in September 2016 and an Industrial Engineer Apprenticeship commenced in November 2016.  13 further new apprenticeships are due to launch later this year in various sectors including medical devices, polymer processing and financial services.</p></reply>

It is a matter for individual schools to use their professional judgement to identify pupils who will receive this support and to use the resources available to the school to intervene  at the appropriate level with such pupils.</p></reply>

The pyrite remediation scheme is a remedial works scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope to dwellings, which have significant damage attributable to pyritic heave.</p>  <p>  All works under the pyrite remediation scheme are completed to the requirements of I.S. 398-2:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material - Part 2: Methodology for remediation works by competent builders and are overseen by design professionals in accordance with the requirements of the Board and the Housing Agency.</p>  <p>  At the end of the remediation works, each dwelling is provided with a Certificate of Remediation for Reactive Pyrite in Sub-floor Hardcore Material, which is completed jointly by the relevant builder and the design professional in accordance with Annex B to I.S. 398-2:2013. The certificate confirms that the dwelling has been remediated to the requirements set out in the national standard. A total of 701 dwellings have been completed under the scheme to date and are in the process of receiving certificates of remediation.

It was open to all local authorities to apply for funding towards the capital cost of public infrastructure, which, when provided, would secure the early delivery of additional housing at considerable scale and more affordable price points, with developments in excess of 500 units in the Dublin area, or in excess of 200 units in areas outside Dublin. </p>  <p>  21 local authorities submitted a total of 74 proposals in October 2016. On 28 March 2017, I announced funding for 34 projects under LIHAF. The total cost of these projects is &euro;226.46 million, of which &euro;169.65 million is to be funded under LIHAF with local authorities funding the remaining &euro;56.81 million. These public infrastructure projects will be key to the delivery of 23,000 housing units over the next four years, with a longer term projection of up to 70,000 units as the selected sites are fully built out.  </p>  <p>  Louth County Council submitted three projects for consideration under LIHAF funding.  LIHAF funding was approved for an access road in Newtown, Drogheda in the amount of &euro;1.22m and an access road in Mount Avenue, Dundalk in the amount of &euro;3.3m.  However, while the Port Access Northern Cross Route (PANCR) in Drogheda was one of a number of proposals that merited funding, it was not possible to include the project in the March 2017 approvals, within the level of funding available.  Qualifying proposals such as this one may be re-considered for LIHAF funding in the event that an approved proposal does not proceed or that additional LIHAF funding becomes available.  </p>  <p>  I understand from Louth County Council that the plans for the Port Access Northern Cross Route are not affected by the recent decision of Drogheda Municipal District elected members to agree to the closure of St. Laurence&rsquo;s Gate to vehicular traffic.  The Council has advised that the PANCR remains a priority project and a number of  housing projects which are ready to progress in that area require the upgrading of the road infrastructure.

The Department has contracts in place with in excess of 60 companies for the provision of these services.  This includes two contracts for the provision of the JobPath service and 22 contracts for the provision of the Local Employment Service (LES).</p>  <p>  The JobPath Request for Tender set out the percentage of clients referred to the service that the Department expected the service providers to place into employment, based on historic progression to employment rates of each of the referral groups in respect of each contract area (i.e. the &lsquo;counterfactual rate&rsquo;). The expected performance, known as the reference performance rate, set out in the RFT was set at between 60% and 70% above the counterfactual rate, depending on the client group&rsquo;s duration of unemployment. The Department also set a minimum performance rate, below which the Department would not accept bids. This was set at 30% above the counterfactual rate. </p>  <p>  Based on this information, tenderers were invited to submit performance offers as part of their bids. The performance offers made in the bids form part of the JobPath service providers&rsquo; contracts with the department and as such it is not intended to publish same.</p>  <p>  I can however confirm that no JobPath providers bid below the reference performance level i.e. below the 60% - 70% above the counterfactual rate as set out in the JobPath request for tender.  Full details of the approach taken are contained in the request for tender which is available on the department&rsquo;s website.</p>  <p>  The JobPath service has been designed to support the long term unemployed (and those most at risk of becoming long term unemployed) to obtain and sustain employment in the open labour market. The service is being delivered on a payment by results model with all upfront costs of the service being borne by the companies themselves.  Jobseekers engage with the JobPath service for 12 months, but can expect to receive in employment support and assistance from the service for a minimum of three months (and up to a maximum of 12 months) when they enter employment.   </p>  <p>  Payments to contractors are geared towards sustained employment outcomes achieved; contractors are paid for each 13 week period of full time employment (of 30 hours per week) that former Jobseekers successfully complete, up to a maximum of four such payments.  In addition a payment is only made were the former jobseeker was not in receipt of a Jobseeker related income support payment from the department during the 13 week period.  </p>  <p>  The contracts for the provision of the local employment service (LES) set out the requirements of the service to be delivered and the capacity required from the contractors. Jobseekers engage with the LES service for 12 months and may receive in employment support and assistance from the service when they enter employment. Contractors aim to place 30% of those jobseekers who complete their engagement period with the service into employment (of 30 hours per week).  </p>  <p>  The clients with whom the local employment service engage fall into two broad groupings  - those clients activated/referred by the department for support and assistance and jobseekers who engage directly with the service themselves (this group may include people with a disability, lone parents, early school leavers, qualified adults, ex-offenders, members of the travelling community and refugees). </p>  <p>  Payments to contractors are made based on this contract for services model, with the department fully funding the cost of the service in any given location.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the deputy.</p></reply>

This began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition), which had been available from 65 for those who satisfied the qualifying conditions, thereby standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  This is the current State pension age.  It will increase to 67 in 2021 and to 68 in 2028.  </p>  <p>  In most cases, it is hoped that workers will continue to work up to the new State pension age.  In such cases, they will not be eligible to claim Jobseekers payments, as they will be in employment.  Where this is not possible, but they are still jobseekers, there are specific measures which apply to someone claiming Jobseeker&rsquo;s Benefit from a date after their 65th birthday, provided they are entitled to that payment.  Where qualified, these recipients may continue to be eligible for that payment until reaching pension age.  The requirement to be genuinely seeking work remains, however, and if someone has voluntarily retired aged 65, or at a younger age, and is not seeking work, they are not entitled to Jobseekers benefits.</p>  <p>  Reversing the abolition of State pension (transition) would have a significant Exchequer cost.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is estimated that well over half of the gross cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65, and (c) there have been two Budget increases in the rate of the State pension since then.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2018 is likely to be in the region of &euro;84 million, and this is expected to increase over time.  The cost of reversing this decision would depend, therefore, on the effective date of such a measure, and also on any resultant changes in behaviour.</p>  <p>  Each year more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  As a result of this demographic change, the number of State pension recipients is increasing year on year.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, and demographic change alone is expected to increase spending on pensions by over &euro;220 million this year, not including the impact of rate increases.  </p>  <p>  The purpose of changes to the State pension age is to make the pension system more sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  This sustainability is vital if current workers, who fund State pension payments through their PRSI on a Pay-As-You-Go basis, are to receive a pension themselves when they reach retirement age.  Rowing back on these changes, which have already been legislated for, would undermine that sustainability to the detriment of current workers.</p>  <p>  It should also be borne in mind that these changes are modest in the context of increasing longevity among older people, and the duration of the average pension is still expected to increase based on current trends.  </p>  <p>  There is no legally mandated retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers.  While such a contract may have been entered into with a retirement date of 65, in the context of the previous State pension arrangements, there is no legal impediment to the employer and employee agreeing to increase the duration of employment for one or more years, if both parties wish to do so.  </p>  <p>  Of course workers who do not wish to continue working may retire before they reach the State pension age.  However, they will not be entitled to a State pension until they reach state pension age, and if they are not genuinely available for work, they will not be eligible for Jobseekers benefit.  This is the case whether they are aged 65 or younger.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

This gives the person a yearly average of 36 and an entitlement to &euro;214.20 state pension (contributory) per week, effective from 11th May 2017.  The person concerned was notified of this decision on 4th   May 2017, together with their right to appeal the decision. </p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme was introduced in 1994, to make qualification for state pension (contributory) easier for claimants who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows a period of up to 20 years (from 1994) spent caring for children under 12 years of age or an incapacitated person(s) to be disregarded when state pension (contributory) eligibility is being assessed.  The effect of this is to reduce the number of years by which the person&rsquo;s contributions are divided, thereby increasing their yearly average, and making it easier for them to qualify for pension, or where qualified, to receive a higher rate of entitlement.  In the case of the person concerned, it is not possible to apply the homemakers disregard as the period spent caring preceded 1994. </p>  <p>  It is open to the person concerned to apply for state pension (non-contributory).  This is a means tested pension, also payable from age 66.  I have arranged for an application form to be issued to the person concerned.  On receipt of a completed form, the person&rsquo;s entitlement to state pension (non- contributory) will be assessed and the person will be notified of the outcome without delay.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Commissioners provided CARANUA with space in 24/27 North Frederick Street, Dublin 1 (a building leased by the Commissioners). The lease on Frederick Court is between the Commissioners of Public Works and the Landlord.  </p>  <p>  Rent was not paid by CARANUA for its occupation of Frederick Court for the period since its foundation in 2013 to 31 May 2016.  It was subsequently agreed with CARANUA that it would pay rent on Frederick Court commencing 1 June 2016 in the amount of &euro;106,000 per annum.  The first instalment has been received with the second instalment expected shortly.  This arrangement was dealt with by way of a simple agreement between the Commissioners of Public Works and CARANUA.  </p>  <p>  As the lease on Frederick Court is expiring, it will be necessary to vacate that premises.  The Commissioners of Public Works have offered CARANUA space in newly leased premises on James Joyce Street, Dublin 1.  The lease is being taken by the Commissioners of Public Works for use by another State agency and CARANUA are being offered accommodation in the building.  This will be dealt with by way of a simple agreement between the Commissioners of Public Works and CARANUA.  The amount of rent due to be paid by CARANUA for the new office accommodation amounts to &euro;188,589.55 plus VAT per annum.  This increased rent arises from the provision of a larger area of accommodation to CARANUA.  </p>  <p>  It is the remit of the Commissioners to provide accommodation for Government Departments and certain agencies.  The Commissioners are funded by the Exchequer to meet the rental costs that arise in the provision of leased accommodation for these. Accordingly, the Department of Education and Skills does not pay rent for its accommodation in Frederick Court.</p></reply>

Consequently, the efficient management of parking spaces and traffic flow on hospital campuses is of crucial importance. This is to ensure on-going availability of parking spaces; free flow of traffic on campus; unobstructed access for emergency vehicles at all times; proper use of spaces designated for drivers with disabled permits; and proper use of spaces designated as drop off points near the hospital entrance.</p>  <p>   The HSE (Health Service Executive) has advised that it does not have one single contract to provide parking services at all hospitals.  Instead each hospital has a unique arrangement which reflects its specific circumstances. </p>  <p>  Arrangements for car parking generally is an operational matter for the HSE. The HSE has advised that it does not provide guidelines on hospital parking and each hospital/hospital group implements their own guidelines. </p>  <p>  Hospitals which charge parking fees are very cognisant of the financial implications of parking costs for patients and their families particularly those with long-term illnesses. Consequently, a maximum daily fixed parking charge has been introduced in some hospitals, thus capping this expense. I understand that some hospitals also provide reduced rate parking rates for long-term patients and visitors for whom the payment of the full rate would cause hardship. The HSE has advised me that it keeps hospital parking charges under review.</p>  <p>  In response to the particular queries raised, as these are service matters, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.</p></reply>

Consequently, Budget 2017 allocated &euro;20 million to the NTPF, rising to &euro;55 million in 2018.  </p>  <p>  In December 2016, I granted approval to the NTPF to dedicate &euro;5m to a daycase waiting list initiative with the aim of ensuring that no patient will be waiting more than 18 months for a daycase procedure by 30 June 2017. In excess of 2,000 daycases will be managed through this process and patients have started to receive appointments and procedures. Long-waiting Ophthalmology patients are a core group who will receive treatment under this initiative.</p>  <p>  In order to reduce the numbers of long-waiting patients, I asked the HSE to develop Waiting List Action Plans for 2017 in the areas of Inpatient/Daycase, Scoliosis and Outpatient Services. These plans have now been finalised and will be communicated shortly.</p>  <p>  The HSE is currently finalising the Report of the Primary Care Eye Services Review, which aims to reorganise primary eye-care services with an increased emphasis on maximising delivery of a comprehensive service in primary care, thereby creating capacity in hospitals to provide more complex ophthalmology services.</p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures. Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations. To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.  </p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second. The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. </p><p>On the 4 April, I signed a commitment agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide broadband to an additional 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. This figure includes over 25,300 premises in County Cork. Eir has committed to doing this work over a 90 week period, with an average of 500 premises passed per day.  My Department will be monitoring this rollout to ensure that eir meets its obligations under the Agreement.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my website www.dccae.gov.ie.</p><p>In total, over 192,500 of the 267,361 premises in County Cork will be able to access a high speed broadband service through commercial providers by the end of 2018. The remaining c.75,000 premises will be covered by the NBP State Intervention. </p><p>Nationally, there were over 50,700 new fixed broadband subscriptions in 2015, and over 50,800 in 2016. This brought the total number of fixed broadband subscriptions to over 1.36m. Further information on this issue is available in ComRegs Quarterly Key Data Report for Q4 2016 which is available at <i>www.comreg.ie.</i></p></reply>

In that regard, it is important to note that the Irish Coast Guard of this Department, the Royal National Lifeboat Institute, mountain rescue teams and other community-based voluntary emergency services and groups are not exempt from the payment of tolls.</p>  <p>  Although voluntary and community organisations such as river and sea rescue provide a valuable service, it is still essential, for the purpose of implementation of a fair and robust system of tolling enforcement, that it is applied equally to all users.  It would thus be very difficult to provide an exemption for one voluntary or community organisation and not to another.  In addition, making the voluntary and community sector generally exempt from tolls would incur a cost to the Exchequer as the PPP toll operators would have to be reimbursed for losses. </p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the matter to TII for a more detailed reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

The Commission stated that it was satisfied that the institutions it is investigating are &lsquo;unquestionably&rsquo; the main such homes that existed during the 20th century and that it does not currently recommend that other institutions be investigated. In its report the Commission commits to including relevant information on other institutions which have come to its attention in its social history report which will form a key part of its final report. At this future point, the report notes that the Commission may also be in a position to comment on the need for any further investigations in respect of these institutions.</p>  <p>  I am conscious that the Commission's terms of reference already include mechanisms to ensure that any additional matters which the Commission may deem to warrant investigation can be brought to the attention of Government and Government would consider any such recommendations.</p>  <p>  While the report states that the commission is not seeking an extension to its current remit, I have indicated that I want to conduct a scoping review to consider if broader terms of reference would help answer some of the questions which have been raised again in public debate. In this context it is useful to remind ourselves that many of the additional issues being raised again in public discourse were examined when the commission was being established. While I am open to examining the calls for an extension, it is essential that we do so with a full understanding of the considerable breadth and scope of its current terms of reference. </p></reply>

This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of the Affordable Childcare Scheme and is currently being progressed in that context.  Work on preparing a Request for Tenders (RFT) for this 'Independent Review of Cost' is currently underway and it is envisaged that this RFT will be published in the coming months.</p><p>The Independent Review on the Cost of Providing Quality Childcare will, among other things, examine the link between wages, the quality of provision, and public funding.

I am pleased to confirm that major improvements in childcare subsidies will therefore come into effect this September, including increases of up to 50% in targeted childcare subsidy rates and a new universal childcare subsidy for children aged between 6 months and 36 months. September&rsquo;s changes will be delivered through existing childcare schemes, pending the introduction of the ACS.</p>  <p>  Childcare subsidies will be provided directly to Tusla-registered childcare providers. All Tusla-registered childcare providers, community and private, can sign up to provide these schemes, ensuring accessibility throughout the country in a range of services to suit the needs of parents. </p>  <p>  Childcare subsidies will be administered using the Programme Implementation Platform (PIP); a system that childcare providers are familiar with through the delivery of the ECCE (free pre-school) programme and existing targeted schemes supported by my Department. In the case of the universal childcare subsidy, parents must provide both the child and parent PPS number to their childcare provider to qualify.</p>  <p>In order to raise awareness among both childcare providers and parents, I promised a comprehensive public information campaign before the end of May. I am delighted to report that over this week each childcare provider in the country will receive an information pack on the changes to the schemes I have just outlined. In addition City/County Childcare Committees have been briefed in order to offer local support to childcare providers; a dedicated website has been launched (affordablechildcare.ie) and officials from the DCYA will shortly commence a series of information events throughout the country.</p></reply>

Mindful of the challenge that it would present to the sector, my Department introduced the following supportive measures:</p>  <p>  -  Learner Funds to provide sector workers with an opportunity to upskill to a Level 5 qualification.</p>  <p>  -  In 2017, my Department made funding available to provide a bursary to childcare staff who have undertaken higher level courses at their own expense.</p>  <p>  -  The Regulations provide an exemption up to 1st September 2021 for certain existing childcare staff who intend to retire from the sector in the near future, do not hold the minimum qualification and who do not wish to undertake a course of training at this stage. This option was first publicised through the City / County Childcare Committees in 2014.

You will appreciate that given that these matters are subject to litigation, I am constrained in relation to commenting.    </p>  <p>  However, I am advised by the military authorities that there is no military police investigation into this matter. The statutory authority for dealing with health and safety matters in the workplace is the Health and Safety Authority. </p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that following a number of inspections at the Air Corps premises at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, in 2016, the Health and Safety Authority issued a report of inspection with a number of general improvements and recommendations for follow up. The Air Corps committed to addressing these recommendations as part of an eight phase improvement plan. The military authorities have advised me that six of the eight phases have now been fully completed and a further phase is progressing well and will be completed shortly. The final phase is a continuous ongoing process.</p>  <p>  You will also be aware that in September 2016 I appointed an independent third party to review allegations made in a number of protected disclosures relating to health and safety issues in the Air Corps which were received in late 2015 and early 2016. Once a final review is to hand, I will determine any further steps required and ensure that all recommendations, whether arising from the work of the Health and Safety Authority or the ongoing protected disclosure review, will be acted upon to ensure the safety of the men and women of the Air Corps.</p></reply>

I believe that measures contained in the Lansdowne Road Agreement (LRA) and the provisions introduced in Budget 2016 and 2017 will be of benefit generally to members of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF). The provisions set out in the LRA are an extension of the provision of the Haddington Road Agreement and all existing dispute resolution procedures continue to apply. The LRA provided for increased salaries during 2016 and 2017 in a manner which benefitted the lower paid. These benefits come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those earning up to &euro;31,000 and in 2017 for all those earning up to &euro;65,000. In addition the Government has introduced legislation which has commenced the process to reduce the pay reduction applied under the FEMPI Acts.In relation to the Pensions Related Deduction (PRD), which is commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Pension Levy&rsquo;, the exemption threshold for payment of the &lsquo;Levy&rsquo; will increase substantially during the course of the agreement from &euro;15,000 to &euro;28,750 which means that annual income subject to the levy below &euro;28,750 will no longer be liable to the deduction.</p><p><font color="#000033">In terms of remuneration going forward, f</font>ollowing the publication of the Pay Commission&rsquo;s report on 9 May 2017, the Government intends to initiate negotiations on a successor to the Lansdowne Road Agreement ahead of Budget 2018 considerations.

My Department made a detailed submission to the Commission setting out these very matters and this is specifically referenced by the Commission in paragraph 6.13 of their Report. In the context of the Defence Forces, I note that the Commission in paragraph 6.29 accepts that there are challenges surrounding the recruitment and retention of personnel in specialist streams such as ICT, pilots, Air Traffic Controllers and avionic technicians. The Commission also go on to state that while remuneration is important in this regard there are other significant factors at play such as working environment, career advancement etc. These matters will be addressed as part of the framework which facilitates the Representative Associations engaging with the official side in talks parallel to those taking place between ICTU and the official side at National level. This process has begun this week.</p><p>In relation to staffing, the manpower requirements of the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) are monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the Defence organisation, both at home and abroad. As there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces, targeted recruitment takes place on a regular basis so as to maintain the personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. In terms of overall strength, the Government remains committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the PDF at 9,500 personnel. </p><p>With regard to recruitment, I am advised by the military authorities that their planned target is to induct approximately 850 new entrants to the Defence Forces across all services and competition streams in 2017. </p><p>  A new General Service Recruitment campaign was launched on 23 February 2017 and the 2017 Cadetship competition was launched in March 2017. Direct Entry Competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled. An Air Corps apprentice class was also inducted in March 2017. </p><p>Promotions are ongoing within Officer ranks in order to fill rank vacancies. A new NCO promotions competition to fill vacancies to the ranks of Sergeants and above has been launched from which promotions will commence in Q3 2017. </p><p>  With regard to job satisfaction, career prospects and related issues, a Climate Survey completed in the Defence Forces in 2015/16 as part of the Independent Monitoring Group process has provided valuable feedback for military and civilian management. The Climate Survey, while clearly indicating the challenges facing the Defence Forces, particularly in the areas of leadership, communication, organisational culture, the working environment and active management of personal expectations, also points out the many positives, especially in relation to the commitment of personnel to the values and mission of the Organisation, the high levels of work satisfaction, pride in the Organisation and positive views on culture and work support.</p><p>In response to the issues raised in the Climate Survey, an Action Plan was formulated involving engagement with all levels of management within the Organisation. The initiatives in this Action plan included conducting additional Focus Group Surveys in order to provide further Data on conditions within the Defence Forces; the implementation of White Paper projects relating to HR issues; the continuation and improvement of Exit surveys; the improvement of the Defence Forces internal communications plan and the adoption of an Integrated Competency Framework.</p></reply>
