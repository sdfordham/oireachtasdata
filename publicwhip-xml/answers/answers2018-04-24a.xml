    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-24a.9.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400059#WRA00800"><p>While the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has overall responsibility for EU Cohesion Policy and the European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds, at the outset I think I should clarify the position regarding the Cohesion Fund.  This Fund is aimed at Member States whose Gross National Income (GNI) per inhabitant is less than 90% of the EU average. For the 2014-2020 period, the countries which qualify for the Cohesion Fund are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia.  As a budget contributor, Ireland does not qualify for Cohesion funding.</p>  <p>  I am, however, fully engaged in exploring future EU funding options for the transport sector. Following the publication of the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework, Minister Donohoe and I wrote a joint letter in February to Transport Commissioner Bulc and Regional Policy Commissioner Cretu emphasising the considerable challenges facing Ireland in the transport sector and setting out how the NDP and NPF will inform future investments into the regions, including the West, Border and North West regions which will be particularly impacted by Brexit.  We made the point that investment in infrastructure has the potential to mitigate the implications of Brexit in these regions.  </p>  <p>  Over the coming years, Ireland will continue to prioritise key projects on the Core and Comprehensive networks under the National Development Plan with the objective of enhancing connectivity between the Comprehensive and Core networks and thereby enhancing the sustainability and connectivity of our outermost regions and our connectivity to Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The Connecting Europe Framework (CEF) is the EU funding instrument developed specifically to direct investment into European transport, energy and digital infrastructures to address identified missing links and bottlenecks.  Preparations are underway for CEF 2 and my Department has been participating fully in that process.  In this regard the Department wrote to the European Commission in March with its comments on the Commission&rsquo;s draft proposals.  This letter again stressed Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on its road network and the need for investment in strategic road links.</p></reply>

This significant increase in funding allowed for increasing investment in maintenance and renewal of the network and the rolling stock, and also to provide more funding for safety projects.  </p><p>In Budget 2018, I secured an 8% increase in the overall Exchequer funding for PSO services across both the bus and rail networks.  Budget 2018 also provided for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021.  This represents a 30% increase over the original Capital Plan allocations for 2018-2021 and includes investment of over &euro;1 billion in heavy rail maintenance and infrastructure.</p><p>The public consultation process held by the NTA following the publication of the Rail Review in 2016 helped to begin an informed discussion about the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland. Over 300 submissions were received in response to that consultation process.  The NTA has prepared a report of those submissions, and it has recently updated this to reflect the additional funding which will now be available for rail infrastructure and services following on from Budget 2018.</p><p>The NTA&rsquo;s updated report on the consultation was received by my Department in February.  I intend to bring the updated report to Government shortly and I would expect that this updated consultation report would then be published shortly thereafter by the NTA.</p></reply>

It is not directly involved in the management, development or marketing of particular tourism initiatives, which are matters for the tourism agencies. </p>  <p>  In the context of overall national policy, F&aacute;ilte Ireland has operational responsibility to support the development of tourism nationally and regionally - including along the east and south east coasts - and for domestic tourism marketing.  Tourism Ireland is responsible for the overseas marketing and promotions.</p>  <p>  At agency level, the tourism potential of the east and south east is developed and promoted in line with the relevant tourism experience brands - namely, "Ireland's Ancient East" and the Dublin brand.  Capital funding allocations to F&aacute;ilte Ireland from my Department's Vote for tourism product development provide for continued investment by F&aacute;ilte Ireland in these experience brands, through the development of attractions and other tourism infrastructure.  Current funding allocations allow for the further enhancement and animation of these regions through festivals, business supports, training, and other related programmes.  Tourism Ireland market these regions overseas.</p>  <p>  With specific regard to the coastal areas of the east and south east, I am aware that coastal villages and Dublin bay are areas of priority and focus for F&aacute;ilte Ireland in relation to the Dublin experience brand.  Under Ireland's Ancient East, I understand that new opportunities may also arise relating to the rich Viking heritage of the region under further visitor experience development currently underway in the agency.  </p>  <p>  I have asked F&aacute;ilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland to provide the Deputy with further operational detail on their work to support the development of the tourism potential of the east and south east coast.

Resources available from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, were also circulated. This included: </p>  <p>  - revised Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children, </p>  <p>  - Guidance on Developing a Child Safeguarding Statement, and </p>  <p>  - the Guide for Reporting of Child Protection and Welfare Concerns. </p>  <p>  The Department has also provided information on the Tusla eLearning Programme "Introduction to Children First". </p>  <p>  In relation to sporting bodies, Sport Ireland, which is funded by my Department, is the statutory body with responsibility for the development of sport, increasing participation at all levels and raising standards, including the allocation of funding across its various programmes. My Department engages directly with Sport Ireland, who in turn engages with the National Governing Bodies of Sport, including in relation to Children First.  </p>  <p>  Through the Children First Interdepartmental Implementation Group, my Department requested that 25,000 copies of the revised Children First: National Guidelines be provided to Sport Ireland. Sport Ireland have disseminated the Guidelines to NGBs, for onwards circulation to their member sports clubs.</p>  <p>  I am informed that the Children First Act has been discussed at a number of Designated Safeguarding Children Officer meetings, held by Sport Ireland 3-4 times a year to update National Children Officers of NGBs. A number of Local Sports Partnership have also delivered workshops on Children First.  Sport Ireland held a seminar on the Act for CEOs and NCOs on 11 November 2017, and also communicated by letter to all CEOs on the full commencement of the Act in December 2017. In February 2018 a follow-up letter was sent regarding the preparation of Child Safeguarding Statements and risk assessments, required by the Act to be in place by March 2018.</p></reply>

This was a group established some years earlier to bring together the relevant State agencies and business groups with a view to ensuring that Dublin city centre remained "open for business" during the construction phase of the project.  </p>  <p>  The meetings I chaired involved representatives of the various stakeholders: the National Transport Authority (NTA), Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII), Dublin City Council, Dublin Bus, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Retail Excellence, Dublin Chamber and Dublin Town.  Construction of the project finished last year, and the new Luas Cross City was opened in December 2017 and growth in passenger journeys on the Green Line has grown by 28% since then. </p>  <p>  On 15 March this year, I held a meeting with the organisations who are involved in delivering and enabling the Luas services: the NTA, TII, the tram operator Transdev, and the tram manufacturer Alstom. Our meeting discussed the electrical fault that had recently come to light involving the newly-commissioned 55-metre trams, the level of availability of trams on the Green Line, and the need to resolve the difficulties, increase peak-time passenger capacity, improve services, and restore passenger confidence in the Luas.  The organisations outlined the approaches that they were following to address the problems and the mitigating actions that they would pursue in order to increase the passenger capacity especially at the times of peak demand.</p>  <p>  I ensured that, following this meeting, the NTA maintained frequent contact with my Department in order to keep us specifically informed of the progress being made by the State agencies, the operator and the manufacturer in implementing the relevant actions to which they had committed themselves.  I am pleased to say that the progress updates are now positive, and that the NTA has reassured us that the situation is much improved with the Luas Green Line performing well in more recent weeks.  The full complement of trams to run the current timetable has been made available to Transdev, and the electrical fault in the new longer 55m trams has been diagnosed.  Three of these longer 55m trams are now in use for passenger services and the remaining four are being delivered and commissioned. </p>  <p>  The NTA and TII are working with all relevant parties who expect that by the end of May, all 7 of the new, longer trams will have been progressively brought into use, thus further enhancing capacity and service levels.  Shortly after that, they intend to introduce a new timetable in order to make optimum use of the full, expanded fleet.  That new timetable should further improve passenger services across both the Green Line and the Red Line.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-24a.24.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1213" speakername="Shane Ross" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400059#WRA02300"><p>Action 33 of the Road Safety Strategy, for which the Road Safety Authority have lead responsibility, is that long term reliance on multiple learner permits should be reduced by introducing measures to ensure that learner permit holders sit a driving test before they can obtain a subsequent learner permit.  </p>  <p>  I understand from the Road Safety Authority that an action plan has been developed to progress this initiative.  However, increases in applications for driving tests coupled with the retirements of driver tester staff have stretched the RSA&rsquo;s capacity to put the plan in place so it has not yet been launched.  As I stated in the debate on driving test waiting times in the Seanad on 25 October 2017, the driver testing service has seen an increase of almost 20% in the levels of driving test applications over the previous four years. This, coupled with the retirements of driver tester staff, has meant that the waiting times for customers for driving tests have, unfortunately, increased.  </p>  <p>  The Road Safety Authority (RSA) currently employs 103.44 full time equivalent driver testers. My Department has sanctioned an additional 28 Driver Testers in October 2016, and all 28 are now conducting driving tests.  A further 8 are due to commence work by June 2018.  </p>  <p>  Sanction was given to the RSA to replace retired testers as required. My Department and the RSA are examining the long term requirements for driver tester numbers to ensure that the Authority can meet future demand.</p>  <p>  The RSA is currently undertaking other initiatives in order to increase capacity to deliver extra driving tests. These initiatives include the delivery of 120 extra overtime tests per driver tester who participates.  To date, 45 driver testers have delivered the extra tests and I understand that this has yielded more than 5,000 extra tests to date, with further delivery expected over the coming months.  Other measures currently being implemented by the RSA include reducing the  number of applicant no-shows at the driving test, and making those tests available for other test applicants, better communication with test applicants via text-messaging and via applicants&rsquo; Approved Driving Instructors, to reduce non-conducted driving tests, and  a new test booking system that will give test applicants much more control over their booking and appointment choice. </p>  <p>  The RSA have assured me that they will review their capability to introduce further measures to reduce long term learner permit holding as soon as their capacity to deliver driving tests has increased sufficiently to make that possible.</p></reply>

Overseas visitor numbers for March are due to be published by the CSO later this week and overseas revenue and domestic figures for Q1 will be published in June.</p><p>The Government continues to offer strong support to the industry, as demonstrated most recently by F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s launch of the new brand for the Midlands, Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands.  An additional &euro;2 million has been invested in Tourism Ireland this year to support its digital marketing infrastructure.  This investment recognises the fact that we are operating in a hugely competitive international marketplace in which it is vital that Ireland maintains a strong presence. </p><p>Despite positive visitor numbers from Britain in early 2018, Brexit continues to be a concern for tourism. The tourism agencies are keeping a very close eye on developments in the British market. Nevertheless, it highlights the importance of market diversification as we continue to attract greater numbers of visitors from European, North American and long-haul destinations. The inaugural direct flights from China, due to commence in June, will be vital in exploiting the potential of this massive market.</p><p>We cannot be complacent about continued growth in tourism. We must aim to deliver growth which is sustainable, from an economic, social and environmental perspective. This is something that will be considered further in the preparation of a revised Tourism Action Plan under the stewardship of the Tourism Leadership Group.</p></reply>

Directional information signs are those which advise drivers of the correct route to their destination.</p>  <p>  The Signage and Delineation on Irish roads are designed and installed in accordance with the Traffic Signs Manual, published by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, which is the standard for signing and road marking in this country.</p>  <p>  Terminal Destinations for National Primary Route signage together with Terminal and Intermediate Destinations for National Secondary Route signage are outlined respectively in Table 2.2.5 and Table 2.2.6 of the Traffic Signs Manual.

MetroLink will comprise of a total of 25 stations (including 15 new stations), 3,000 additional Park and Ride spaces, and a journey time of approximately 50 minutes from Swords to Sandyford. </p>  <p>  The NTA, in conjunction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) recently launched a public consultation process on the Emerging Preferred Route (EPR). The Emerging Preferred Route is the proposal which has been identified as the likely optimal scheme from a technical design perspective, without the benefit of public consultation and input. It is not a finalised and selected scheme &ndash; the final layout will only be determined after consideration and evaluation of the issues raised during the consultation process.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the current process, that also includes public consultation meetings, is to obtain the views of the general public, particularly those along the identified emerging route, and to take that input into account in finalising a selected route. Following receipt of all of the submissions, the issues and concerns identified will be carefully considered by TII and the NTA in determining the final scheme proposal. Following a full appraisal of the feedback a public consultation report will be published by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  The NTA and TII expect that an application for a Railway Order, comprising the final scheme design, will be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la during Q3 of 2019. A further public consultation will be undertaken in 2019 as part of the statutory planning consent process. This will include a report assessing the environmental impacts of the project as well as final details of any property land acquisitions needed for the scheme. Subject to receipt of planning approval, construction of the project is expected to commence in 2021 with MetroLink open for passenger use in 2027.</p>  <p>  I understand the concerns raised by affected stakeholders including both residents and local amenities. I believe there are many benefits the Metro project can bring. The NTA and TII, through the consultative process they have underway, are working collaboratively to address concerns identified and to develop mitigating proposals.  Their aim is to find a way of delivering the MetroLink project, while maintaining good routes that interchange with other public transport and doing it in such a way that respects the social and community life of our city. </p></reply>

Addressing urban congestion on both the strategic road network and locally in certain locations is an important theme in the Strategy. The measures proposed are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region. </p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021. This substantial multi-annual envelope includes funding of some  &euro;770 million for the BusConnects programme. The recently published National Development Plan (NDP), which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, also confirms BusConnects as one of a number of key investment priorities which will address growing congestion in the city and capacity constraints on the existing public transport network in the short to medium term. The advantage of a bus-based solution is that the implementation can start quickly and the benefits of BusConnects can start coming on stream progressively from 2019.</p>  <p>  BusConnects will radically redesign the bus system in Dublin and will include a network of &ldquo;next generation&rdquo; bus corridors on the busiest routes including segregated cycling and walking facilities, a complete redesign of the bus network, a network of park and ride facilities at key locations, simpler fare structures, cashless payment system and a state of the art ticketing system, new bus branding, integrating bus vehicles of different operators and types, new bus stops and shelters and use of low emission vehicles. </p>  <p>  Work is ongoing, by the National Transport Authority (NTA), on the redesign of the bus services network in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) and also on infrastructure proposals for Core Bus Corridors which will be an integral part of the programme.  When this work is complete, the NTA will be launching public consultations. The NTA expect that an initial public consultation at Concept Level on the Core Bus Corridors will be held in Quarter 2 of this year. This period of consultation will be followed by a next phase in Quarter 3 on the re-designed bus network (service re-design) and a separate public consultation on the Core Bus Corridors at a detailed level also in Quarter 3. The results of the public consultations will inform the NTA on the final decisions to be made on the network redesign and Core Bus Corridors routes.</p></reply>

Positive mental health is an  important topic and its profile has been rightly raised in recent years, as the identification and prevention of mental illness has become a priority for the Government and many advocacy organisations. Young people, in particular, need to nourish their mental health and wellbeing as life becomes more fast-paced and demanding, especially during times of increased challenge at exam time and during the transition into the workplace.</p>  <p>  I am keen therefore to ensure that there is a population-wide increase in participation levels in sport and physical activity this matter is receiving particular emphasis in a new national sports policy that is nearing completion and which I expect to launch in the near future. The benefits to be gained from increasing the level of sport and physical activity across the population are many.  For example, tension and stress release, improved physical and mental energy, improved sleep patterns, increased concentration levels at school or at work, and the positive impacts on social relationships.</p>  <p>  It is also appropriate to recall that Connecting for Life, Ireland's National Strategy to Reduce Suicide 2015-2020, recognises the role of sport and physical activity as a protective factor for mental health.  My Department is represented on the cross-government Steering Group for the implementation of this important Strategy.</p></reply>

The full terms and conditions of the SCP are available on my Department's website.</p><p>The Revenue Commissioners operate a tax relief scheme for donations to certain sporting bodies under Section 41 of the Finance Act 2002. Obtaining the tax relief is a three stage process.  Firstly, the club or group must apply to the Revenue Commissioner to become an &quot;approved sports body&quot;. Secondly, the approved body applies to my Department for their project to be an &quot;approved project&quot;.  The possible project types include acquiring land or buildings for sports purposes, developing sports facilities, purchasing fixed non-personal equipment for sports activities, or repaying a loan for any of these purposes.  Finally, PAYE donors fill out a certificate and supplies this to the club.  The club may then apply to Revenue for the tax relief on this donation.  While the exact amount of relief is a matter for Revenue, I understand that relief is given at the higher rate of tax on a &quot;grossed-up basis&quot;.  In the case of a donation made by an individual who pays tax on a self-assessment basis, the individual will be entitled to claim a tax deduction for the donation in computing his or her total income and there is no grossing up arrangement. Similarly, in the case of corporate donations, the company will be entitled to claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense or an expense of management in computing total profits of the company for the relevant accounting period.</p><p>Full details on how this tax relief scheme operates, including a step by step guide to the scheme, can be found on the Revenue Commissioner's website <i>.</i></p><p>There have been calls from the sporting sector for the expansion of the existing scheme and the consideration of further taxation measures to promote donations to sports clubs, including during the public consultation on the National Sports Policy.

The 2017 round of the SCP closed for applications on the 24th February 2017.  In November and December last, Minister Ross and I announced &euro;60m in allocations to a record 1,800 projects under the 2017 round. The recently published National Development Plan (NDP) provides &euro;100m for the SCP in the period to 2021 and states that the programme will be further expanded over the period 2022 &ndash; 2027. An announcement in relation to the next round of the programme is expected shortly.</p>  <p>  In relation to swimming pools, the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme (LASPP) provides grant aid to local authorities towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. There are four swimming pool projects remaining in the current round of the LASPP and the priority in 2018 will be on progressing these projects. The existing capital envelopes for the LASSPP are sufficient to cover the costs of these pools.</p>  <p>  The NDP also contains a commitment to establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100m available over the coming years. My officials have commenced drafting the terms and conditions of the new LSSIF and are currently engaging with relevant stakeholders in this regard. An announcement in relation to when applications will be accepted will be made once these terms and conditions are finalised. </p>  <p>  As part of the development of the National Sports Campus, &euro;26 million has been allocated for Phase 2 of the National Indoor Arena which comprises covered pitches and ancillary facilities, for rugby, soccer and Gaelic games. Construction is underway and this project is due for completion in 2019. Furthermore, &euro;15 million has been allocated for the construction of a National Velodrome and Badminton Centre. Planning permission is in place and construction is to commence in 2020. This project is due for completion by 2021.</p>  <p>  Finally, the upcoming National Sports Policy, which I expect will be considered by Government in the coming weeks with a view to its publication shortly thereafter, will include a specific focus on how Government should fund sports facilities in the years ahead.</p></reply>

NTA expect to commence a tender competition later this year for a programme of new diesel-electric trains that would enable the enlargement of the rail fleet by approximately some 300 new rail carriages. Given typical train manufacturing lead times delivery of these new diesel-electric trains is expected in 2022. Additionally, Irish Rail and the National Transport Authority (NTA) are assessing the availability of additional fleet that could be introduced to passenger service on the rail network in Ireland in the intervening period.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy ad overall funding in relation to public transport.

The measures proposed in the strategy are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  Investment in public transport in recent years has enabled renewal and expansion of the bus fleet as one of a number of measures to increase capacity and improve services, responding both to demand growth and to the need to provide a viable alternative choice for private car users.  In 2017, a total of 102 buses were purchased for Dublin Bus both for their replacement programme and to cater for market growth, and similarly it is expected that 140 buses will be purchased in 2018 for the Dublin Region.  These buses were purchased through a bus supply framework agreement put in place by the NTA.</p>  <p>  Looking to the future, the Bus Connects programme will fundamentally transform our bus system, so that journeys for bus passengers will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable.  This programme was launched last year by the NTA, and it is identified in the National Development Plan (NDP) as a key public transport investment priority for completion in the GDA over the period of the plan.  Amongst other features, BusConnects will see the transition to the use of lower emission vehicles.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport.

Minister Ross and I were delighted last June when the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that Ireland had achieved Test Status, a massive milestone for the sport's development in this country.</p>  <p>  In October 2016, Minister Ross and my predecessor, Minister of State Patrick O'Donovan, approved the development of a high performance cricket training facility at the National Sports Campus. I understand that the initial phase of the facility is due for completion in May. I also noted recently that the Board of Cricket Ireland endorsed the development of a new permanent cricket stadium at the National Sports Campus. </p>  <p>  In relation to future capital funding more generally, the Sports Capital Programme (SCP) is the primary vehicle for Government support for the development of sport and physical recreation facilities and the purchase of non-personal sports equipment throughout the country. A wide variety of sports have been supported under the programme including cricket.  An announcement on the next round of the programme is expected shortly and any suitable cricket projects submitted will be fully considered.  Furthermore, the recently published National Development Plan (NDP) contains a commitment to establish a new &ldquo;Large Scale Sport Infrastructure Fund&rdquo; (LSSIF) with at least &euro;100m available over the coming years. My officials have now commenced drafting the terms and conditions of the new LSSIF.  The Fund will be for larger projects where the proposed Government contribution would exceed the amount currently available for individual projects under the SCP. In terms of calls for proposals, it is envisaged that the views of the National Governing Bodies of Sport will be sought regarding the prioritisation of projects for possible inclusion and any plans for significant cricket projects will be considered in that context.</p>  <p>  As regards current expenditure funding for cricket, that is provided through Sport Ireland, which is the statutory body with responsibility for the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport. This includes responsibility for the allocation of funding to the National Governing Bodies of sport, including Cricket Ireland.  I have referred the Deputy's question to Sport Ireland for direct reply in relation to support provided by it for cricket.  I would ask the Deputy to inform my office if a reply is not received within 10 days.</p>  <p>  Finally, I am happy to confirm the Government's commitment to continue to support the furtherdevelopment of all sport in Ireland, including Irish cricket.</p></reply>

The status of the port, and whether its current status potentially inhibits its development, was most recently considered in a strategic review, commissioned by my Department, and carried out by Indecon Economic Consultants.</p>  <p>  Their report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult, given the Port's complex legal structure.  Instead, it was recommended that the Port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated.</p>  <p>  In order to assist Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's overall consideration of how best to move forward, the company then engaged consultants to assess market interest. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port; however, it did identify possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port.</p>  <p>  Following that assessment my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter. That advice identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal and those issues remain under consideration by my Department.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may also be interested to know that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has advised that it has completed a commercial review of Rosslare Europort and will now prepare a Business Plan for the port to include consideration of the implications of Brexit for the port.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Irish Maritime Development Office (IMDO), in conjunction with my Department, has been undertaking a study into the use of the UK Land-bridge by Irish importers and exporters.  The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK Land-bridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on Land-bridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable.  This piece of research is being finalised and is expected to be completed shortly and should inform the potential for the future utilisation of all Ports, including Rosslare Europort.</p></reply>

For the 2014-2020 period, the countries that qualify for the Cohesion Fund are: Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. As a budget contributor, Ireland does not qualify for Cohesion funding.</p>  <p>  Following the publication of the National Development Plan and the National Planning Framework, Minister Donohoe and I wrote a joint letter in February to the European Commissioner for Transport, Ms Violeta Bulc, and the European Commissioner for Regional Policy, Ms Corina Cretu, emphasising the considerable challenges facing Ireland in the transport sector and setting out how the National Development Plan and National Planning Framework will inform future investments into the regions, including our outermost regions and our connectivity to Northern Ireland, which will be particularly impacted by Brexit.  We made the point that investment in infrastructure has the potential to mitigate the implications of Brexit in these regions.  </p>  <p>  Over the coming years, Ireland will continue to prioritise key projects on the EU&rsquo;s TEN-T core and comprehensive networks under the National Development Plan with the objective of enhancing connectivity between the comprehensive and core networks, thereby enhancing the sustainability and connectivity of our outermost regions. </p>  <p>  The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) for Transport is the EU funding instrument developed to direct investment in European transport infrastructure. The post-2020 EU Multiannual Financial Framework is due to be released in early May and preparations are now also underway at European Commission level for a new CEF 2 Regulation. All Member States have been invited to engage with the European Commission in relation to its preparatory work for the new CEF 2 Regulation and my Department has been participating fully in that process. The Department wrote to the European Commission in March with its comments on the Commission&rsquo;s draft proposals and highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s reliance on its road network and the need for investment in strategic road links, including on the comprehensive road network. In particular, the Department asked that reference to the cross-border Dublin to Letterkenny road (via the A5) be included in the Annex to the proposed Regulation.</p></reply>

Discussions centred on the recent electrical fault with the new longer 55m trams and addressed what they are doing to ensure the availability of trams and full services on the Green Line.  The Agencies outlined the range of actions they were developing to address difficulties and to put in place additional peak time capacity on LUAS services.</p>  <p>  Since that meeting, those mitigating actions have been implemented and that has resulted in a marked improvement in the planned vehicle requirements on the Green Line being met at peak times.  Two of the new 55m trams recently resumed service on the Green line with a third introduced last week.  I also understand that the NTA and TII are working with all relevant parties and expect to introduce a new service timetable to make optimum use of the 7 new longer trams.  This new timetable will improve services across the Green Line and also the Red Line.  </p></reply>

The 2017 Review highlights many positive aspects of the 2017 round of the programme including the simplified application process, the greater transparency in terms of how allocations were decided and the introduction of an appeals process for invalid applications. Areas requiring improvement are also identified however, in particular the need for greater clarity in the Department's own guide to making an application. The Review also suggests a number of measures aimed at further prioritising applications from disadvantaged areas and all proposals in this regard, including the Deputy's helpful suggestion, will be fully considered prior to the next round of the programme opening for applications. </p><p>Separately, a full Value For Money Review of the Sports Capital Programme is underway which is being led by the Department's Strategic Research and Analysis unit, with oversight from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

These measures were largely successful and the invalid rate for the 2017 round of the programme was the lowest ever at 20%. This compares to the average invalid rate for previous programmes of 34%. While this was good progress, I am committed to lowering this figure even further for the next round of the SCP. In this regard, a review of the 2017 round has now been published on the Department's website which contains a number of suggestions.  As previously raised by the Deputy, one of the measures being considered is contacting applicants during the assessment process to give them the opportunity to submit corrected documentation.</p>  <p>  In addition, all of the applicants who remain invalid following the conclusion of the 2017 round of the SCP have been contacted and informed that under the next round of the SCP they will be given the opportunity to simply submit the corrected documentation needed to make their 2017 application valid, without the requirement of going through a full new application process.

A &euro;1.35 million marketing campaign in Britain is being complemented by an additional &euro;500,000 F&aacute;ilte Ireland programme to support businesses along the Wild Atlantic Way to position themselves to benefit from the campaign, as well as to boost its own marketing campaigns in Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  The key focus of the campaign is to extend the holiday season beyond the peak summer months, by enticing people to visit in the spring and autumn. Phase one of Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s marketing campaign was rolled out in Britain in February and March and with phase two scheduled for September and October.</p>  <p>  Some 300 eye-catching billboard ads are highlighting the Wild Atlantic Way in key roadside and city centre locations across Britain right now. The ads feature strong and iconic images of various locations along the Wild Atlantic Way and the key message is the quick and easy access from Britain to those spectacular locations in under two hours. The campaign, which will reach at least ten million potential holidaymakers around Britain, is highlighting ease of direct access from six British gateway cities (London, Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow) to Cork, Kerry, Shannon, Knock, Donegal and City of Derry airports. An important element of this campaign is the co-operative advertising with airlines flying to airports close to the Wild Atlantic Way &ndash; highlighting good value offers and ease of access, helping to convert interest into business.</p>  <p>  While it is too early to report on the effectiveness of the campaign as yet, I look forward to hearing from the tourism agencies later in the year in this regard.</p></reply>

The Government approved that recommendation.  </p>  <p>  As advised in response to Parliamentary Question No. 243 of 28 March 2018, EU Regulation 598/2014 only applies to airports with more than 50,000 civil aircraft movements per calendar year, and therefore in Ireland it only applies to Dublin Airport.  The regulation does not apply to Cork or to Shannon, who both recorded traffic of under 20,000 for 2017. </p>  <p>  As regards the consultations which took place, these were held entirely at official level between my Department, those Government Departments with a policy connection - environmental, planning and development - and their agencies, including obviously Fingal County Council.  I am advised also that there was some official level engagement at EU level to understand how other Member States were progressing and there was contact with UK counterparts too, given the similarities in our regulatory, governance and legal structures.  </p>  <p>  On foot of all this, the Government has decided that Fingal County Council offers the best solution for Ireland, which is why I will be bringing a draft Bill to this House to provide for that. </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-24a.203.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1286" speakername="Simon Coveney" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400062#WRD03300"><p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 100, 105 and 108 together.</p>  <p>  The Syria conflict, which is now in its eighth year, has cost up to 500,000 lives. Over 13 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance inside Syria, including close to 3 million people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. Over 6 million people are displaced internally, and a further 5.5 million have fled to neighbouring countries and the wider region. There have been repeated breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law. There have been numerous instances of denial and diversion of humanitarian aid, the use of medieval &lsquo;starve or surrender&rsquo; siege tactics and the use of chemical weapons. I am aware of the petition on the Syria conflict to which Deputy Murphy refers and I fully concur with the sentiment of concern expressed by the petitioners about this appalling situation.</p>  <p>  The apparent chemical attack in Douma on 7 April was a particularly shocking and sickening development. Like many, I was horrified by the images of entire families who had died in the basements where they had sought shelter, and I publicly and unreservedly condemned the attack. In response to that horrific attack on civilians, and following Russia&rsquo;s veto of meaningful UN Security Council action to ensure accountability for such attacks, a number of states took action against facilities related to the production of chemical weapons. I note that their stated objective was to ensure that such attacks do not recur. </p>  <p>  Last week I discussed the situation in Syria, including these most recent developments, with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council. We condemned in the strongest possible terms the use of chemical weapons in Syria, and stressed the need to ensure full legal accountability for those responsible for such crimes. We also reiterated our support for the UN-led political negotiations to end the conflict, and the urgent need to reinvigorate the political track. I reaffirmed the need to avoid any escalation of the situation in Syria, and the importance of ensuring accountability for the use of chemical weapons. </p>  <p>  Ireland and the EU provide political and financial support to a broad range of measures which aim to ensure full legal accountability for all war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Syria. This includes the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism established by the UN General Assembly to assist in the investigation and prosecution of persons responsible for the most serious crimes under international law committed in Syria, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria established by the UN Human Rights Council, and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Fact Finding Mission and Joint Investigative Mission with the UN. In addition, Ireland has consistently supported EU sanctions targeting the regime and its supporters, and will continue to do so as long as the situation on the ground justifies these measures. </p>  <p>  Obviously a comprehensive, sustainable, Syrian-owned and Syrian-led resolution to the conflict will be required to provide lasting relief to the suffering of the Syrian people. UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura is leading political negotiations to end the conflict based on the 2012 Geneva Communique and UN Security Council resolution 2254. Ireland and the EU fully support this process. The EU provides direct assistance to the UN-led Geneva peace talks and has launched, in coordination with the UN, an initiative to develop political dialogue with key actors from the region to identify common ground. </p>  <p>  Since 2012, Ireland has contributed over &euro;95 million to the humanitarian response to the Syria crisis, including &euro;25 million in 2017 alone. The EU and its Member States have to date mobilised more than &euro;10.6 billion for humanitarian, stabilisation and resilience assistance inside Syria and in neighbouring countries, making the EU the largest single donor to the effort. The EU is hosting a further donors&rsquo; conference for Syria this week, and Ireland will use that opportunity to announce our pledge to the humanitarian effort in response to the Syria crisis in 2018. </p></reply>

These concerns were raised by my officials through the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast.  I am aware that the Northern Ireland Equality Commission had also intervened in the matter. I am pleased at the clarification that issued from the UK Home Office over the weekend indicating that this was an error and was being corrected.</p>  <p>  The Government is continuing to work with the EU Taskforce and its EU27 partners with a view to achieving an orderly British withdrawal from the EU, including a transition period, as well as agreeing a framework for an ambitious future relationship with the UK. In this regard, a Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland is an integral part of the draft Withdrawal Agreement. It is drafted to give legal effect to the commitments and guarantees provided in the EU-UK Joint Report of last December on avoiding a hard border and protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, including North South cooperation and rights. It also reflects the agreement reached on maintaining the Common Travel Area.  </p>  <p>  In parallel, the Government&rsquo;s wider contingency planning, coordinated by my Department, is also well advanced. Its focus is on the immediate regulatory and operational challenges which may be required in the context of Brexit. It assumes a trading relationship based on the default WTO rules, but also examines the possible effects on many other areas of concern. This work is therefore providing baseline scenarios for the impact of Brexit across all sectors, which can then be adapted as appropriate in light of developments in the EU-UK negotiations, including in regard to transition arrangements and the future relationship.</p></reply>

It is a matter of deep regret that these elections have been convened in the absence of agreement on either the electoral calendar or on the conditions for a credible and inclusive electoral process. </p><p>The ongoing political, economic, social, and humanitarian crises continue to have a profoundly negative impact on the country and on the people of Venezuela.  The mass exodus of Venezuelan people from the country is continuing, with a consequent impact on neighbouring countries and concerns at the impact on regional stability. </p><p>It was agreed at this month&rsquo;s meeting of EU Foreign Ministers, which took place in Luxembourg on 16 April, that EU High Representative <font color="#2F2F2F">for Foreign Affairs Federica </font>Mogherini should issue a Declaration on behalf of the EU on the situation in Venezuela. </p><p>The High Representative issued the Declaration on Thursday 19 April and the text of that Declaration, including an update on recent developments, is annexed to this reply for the Deputy&rsquo;s information. </p><p>Ireland, as a member of the EU, fully subscribes to the views expressed in that statement.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the Government will, along with our EU partners, continue to closely monitor developments in Venezuela, particularly in the context of next month&rsquo;s elections. </p><p><b>ANNEX</b></p><p><b>Council of the EU - PRESS RELEASE </b>207/18  19/04/2018</p><p><b>Declaration by the High Representative on behalf of the EU</b><b>on the situation in Venezuela</b></p><p>Recent developments in Venezuela are causing further polarisation and are preventing progress on the multiple crises that the country is facing.</p><p>The presidential elections are announced for 20 May, and will be held together with the election of the members of municipal and state assemblies.  We deeply regret that elections have been convened without a wide agreement on the electoral calendar nor on the conditions for a credible and inclusive electoral process. </p><p>We also regret the continued existence of political prisoners and obstacles to limit the participation of political parties and candidates. </p><p>The recent decision of the National Electoral Council (CNE) to limit participation in local and regional elections to those parties that present candidates for the presidential elections is a further blow to the credibility of the process.  This will only exacerbate polarisation and create more obstacles to a peaceful political solution.</p><p>The European Union calls on the government to ensure free, transparent, and credible elections that allow the participation of all political parties under equal conditions; a balanced composition of the CNE; an agreed and viable electoral calendar and all technical guarantees necessary for elections to conform to international standards.  Such conditions are necessary to allow for full and independent international observations missions.</p><p>The European Union is fully committed to supporting Venezuela to find peaceful and democratic solutions and is ready to use all its instruments to support regional and international efforts to that end.  In this context, the European Union will monitor closely the electoral process and related developments on the ground and stands ready to react through appropriate measures to any decision or action that might continue to undermine democracy, the rule of law and human rights situation in the country.</p><p>The European Union is also concerned and monitoring in close cooperation with the UN and other international organisations, the social impact of the ongoing economic crisis that is seriously affecting the population, including many European citizens residing in the country, and leading to the current mass migration that creates challenges to host communities, particularly Colombia and</p><p>Brazil, and regional stability. </p><p>As announced by Commissioner Stylianides during his recent visit to the region, the EU will be providing assistance to those affected.</p><p><b>Press office - General Secretariat of the Council, </b>Rue de la Loi 175 - B-1048 BRUSSELS - Tel.: +32 (0)2 281 6319, press.office@consilium.europa.eu - www.consilium.europa.eu/press</p></reply>

The event, called &lsquo;A Further Shore&rsquo;, was produced by Poetry Ireland and saw some of the island&rsquo;s finest actors and musicians charting the journey through the years of the Troubles towards the achievement of the Agreement. An audience of some 400 people were in attendance and the event was livestreamed by RT&Eacute;.</p>  <p>  On 10 April, I gave the opening address at an anniversary event organised by F&eacute;ile an Phobail at St Mary&rsquo;s University College in West Belfast. I later met with community representatives at the Skainos Centre in East Belfast before meeting the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  In the afternoon of 10 April, I attended and spoke at an event in Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast marking the anniversary together with many of those who participated in the negotiations. That evening, I was in the audience for Belfast City Council&rsquo;s ceremony which recognised the crucial involvement in the peace process of both former President Bill Clinton and Senator George Mitchell.</p>  <p>  These anniversary events were an important opportunity to reflect on the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, to honour those who worked so hard to build peace and reconciliation on these islands, and to remember all those who lost their lives during the tragic years of the Troubles. While looking back, the anniversary events were also an opportunity to review the progress that has been made and the challenges that remain. </p>  <p>  Over the course of many months, the Irish and British Governments, as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, have worked tirelessly to support and facilitate the parties in their efforts to form an Executive. </p>  <p>  The devolved, power-sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are the best means for achieving accountable, representative decision-making for all the people of Northern Ireland. </p>  <p>  Unfortunately, to date, it has not proved possible to reach an agreement on the formation of an Executive, despite intensive engagement.  In light of this, the Government has been working with the British Government to consider means by which we can support the political process, in accordance with the Agreement, in the period ahead.</p>  <p>  The Taoiseach has spoken with Prime Minister May and emphasised the Government&rsquo;s full commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and our continuing determination to secure the effective operation of all of its institutions.</p>  <p>  I remain in very regular contact with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, whom I met in Belfast on 10 April and again in London on 16 April.  We spoke about the importance of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and reiterated that the best place for decisions on Northern Ireland to be made are the power-sharing devolved institutions.</p>  <p>  The Good Friday Agreement is the indispensable framework for providing stable, inclusive, power-sharing government for all the people of Northern Ireland and for sustaining our interlocking relationships &ndash; within Northern Ireland, on the island of Ireland and between the UK and Ireland. As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, both Governments have an obligation to uphold and protect the letter and spirit of that Agreement and we are continuing to work to that end.</p></reply>

The leaders of loyalism played a crucial role in negotiating the Agreement and in winning the referendum that endorsed the Agreement, and their recent statement reaffirms their commitment to the principles of the Agreement and to the peace process.</p>  <p>  I acknowledge and share the concerns, expressed by some since the statement was released, that there are communities that have not fully benefitted from the peace process even after 20 years. In response to these concerns, I wish to reaffirm the Irish Government&rsquo;s determination to work in partnership with the British Government and with representatives from all communities and sectors in Northern Ireland to foster greater reconciliation and progress.</p>  <p>  I also welcome the clear and unequivocal rejection of criminal actions from within loyalism. Giving real effect to this declaration would make a major contribution towards the transformation of loyalist communities and would be a real enabler for the social, economic and political development of Northern Ireland as a whole.</p></reply>

An AEO is an economic operator who is deemed reliable in the context of his or her customs related operations. There is no legal obligation for economic operators to become an AEO, it is a matter of choice for each operator based on their specific situation.</p>  <p>  Under the UCC the status of AEO consists of different types of authorisations: AEO for Customs Simplifications (AEOC) and AEO for Security and Safety (AEOS). An economic operator can apply for both.  The criteria for approval as an AEO are as follows:  </p>  <p>  - Record of compliance with customs legislation and taxation rules, including no record of serious criminal offences relating to the economic activity of the applicant;  </p>  <p>  - Demonstration of a high level of control of its operations by the applicant and of the flow of the goods, by means of a system of managing commercial and, where appropriate, transport records, which allows appropriate customs controls;  </p>  <p>  - Proven financial solvency.</p>  <p>  And depending on the type of AEO:</p>  <p>  - Practical standards of competence or professional qualifications directly related to the activity carried out (AEOC); </p>  <p>  - Appropriate security and safety standards (AEOS).</p>  <p>  Applications are assessed on a case by case basis. There is no fee for application, nor is there any required size or scale of business.</p>  <p>  I am advised by Revenue that Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status, and customs authorisations for simplifications, are normally granted by the customs authority of the Member State in which the trader is established and are automatically recognised in all Member States.  While AEO status allows a holder to apply for simplifications in another Member State, the status is of most benefit in connection with the customs procedures of the country of residence of the AEO, significantly simplifying the process of import and export.  Thus some 89% of third country imports to Ireland are carried out by the 146 AEOs resident in Ireland and authorised by Revenue.  Many of these AEOs are customs agents or carriers who take responsibility for import formalities on behalf of traders located in Ireland or abroad.</p>  <p>  It is not possible to say in absence of an application how many registered hauliers would meet the criteria for authorisation as AEO.  Of the 146 economic operators currently holding AEO status in Ireland, some 65 are in the business of freight forwarding, transport and related businesses.  Revenue is aware, however, that the majority of hauliers have insignificant levels of business with countries outside the EU at the moment, and so they would derive little benefit from AEO status at present.</p>  <p>  As part of the Government wide response to Brexit, Revenue is meeting with representatives groups, including hauliers, and attending industry seminars to discuss the potential issues resulting from Brexit. Revenue has advised businesses to examine the possible impacts of Brexit on their supply chains and to consider applying for one or more of the authorisations or simplifications available that best suit their business model.  </p>  <p>  Advice and assistance on customs authorisations and simplifications is available on the Revenue website and Revenue will continue to engage with representative groups, taking account of developments in the ongoing EU-UK negotiations. </p></reply>

Given that individuals join trade unions largely for the well-known benefits of membership, and the potential value of the relief to an individual would equate to just over &euro;1 per week, this scheme would have little to no incentive effect on the numbers choosing to join. There is no specific market failure that needs to be addressed by such a scheme, and it would consist largely of deadweight.&quot;</p><p>Given the conclusions of the review, I have no plans to reintroduce such a relief.</p></reply>

This measure is subject to a commencement order after a full consideration of any administrative or EU state-aid requirements.</p>  <p>  For the relief to operate, there must be both a sale and a purchase of land within a period of 24 months of each other. Where other qualifying conditions are satisfied, stamp duty will be paid only to the extent that the value of the land that is purchased exceeds the value of the land that is sold. A reduced rate of 1% will be charged on the excess, if any, of the purchase value. If the sale takes place before the purchase, then relief will be given at the time of purchase. However, if the purchase takes place first, then stamp duty will have to be paid but can subsequently be refunded when the sale takes place. </p>  <p>  A number of qualifying conditions must be satisfied before the relief can apply. The most important condition is that Teagasc must issue a certificate stating that a sale and purchase or an exchange of farmland was made for farm consolidation purposes. This is the certificate that is currently required in relation to the capital gains tax relief available on farm consolidations. The criteria to be used by Teagasc for this purpose and the information to be supplied to Teagasc are contained in guidelines published by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. </p>  <p>  A purchaser of farmland must retain ownership of the farmland for a period of five years and must use the land for farming. Where any part of the land is disposed of before the end of this five-year holding period, the stamp duty relieved can subsequently be recovered by Revenue, or partly recovered as appropriate.</p>  <p>  The measure will apply to all transactions which took place after on or after 1 January 2018 and on or before 31 December 2020, so farmers who consolidate their holdings prior to the commencement of the relief, but within those dates, will still be eligible.</p>  <p>  Consideration of the administrative and EU state-aid requirements arising is ongoing. </p></reply>

Both of these perspectives are outlined as follows. </p><p>On the Enforcement side, the Central Bank operates an assertive risk based approach to supervision which is supported by a credible threat of enforcement. The Central Bank&rsquo;s enforcement strategy is aimed at promoting principled and ethical behaviour in regulated entities and those that work in such entities. The Central Bank takes appropriate action where regulated entities and/or individuals fall short of those expected standards of behaviour. </p><p>Since 2006, 118 cases have been concluded through the ASP/settlement procedure. This has resulted in the sum of &euro;61,828,525 being imposed by way of monetary sanctions. Notable cases involving issues of overcharging include the Administrative Sanctions Procedure (ASP) concluded by way of settlement in 2010 involving Allied Irish Banks as well as that concluded by way of settlement in 2011 concerning MBNA Europe Bank Limited. </p><p>Public statements on the Central Bank&rsquo;s settled ASP cases are available on the Central Bank&rsquo;s website. </p><p>In terms of consumer protection, errors by regulated financial services firms are monitored by the Central Bank through a number of supervisory tools, including its on-site inspection work and through the statutory requirement imposed on regulated firms to notify the Central Bank of certain errors within timeframes prescribed by the Consumer Protection Code 2012.  All such errors, including, but not limited to those related to commercial loans that impact consumers, are thoroughly analysed and monitored by the Central Bank to ensure that they are fully resolved, with customers notified and refunded promptly, systems&rsquo; failures corrected and controls implemented to prevent a recurrence of the error.  </p><p>The Central Bank considers each error on its own merits, with the overarching objective of protecting consumers&rsquo; interests, including ensuring that they are not left out of pocket. Excluding the Tracker Mortgage Examination, the figures show that firms have returned &euro;164 million to consumers over the last four years following errors (this figure is not exclusive to errors related to consumer loans). Of this, firms identified and reported &euro;75 million, while the Central Bank identified &euro;89 million through its own supervisory activity.  The Central Bank publishes details of this supervisory work in its Annual Performance Statements (APS).  For example, the APS 2016 &ndash; 2017 includes a breakdown of consumer restitution across a number of categories of financial institutions &ndash; see page 21 for relevant details (available at the following link):<i>). </i></p></reply>

For example, on a Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) basis, 2017 was the fifth consecutive year of inflation below 1 per cent. This phenomenon is not restricted to Ireland. Low inflation has been a feature of advanced economies in recent years. However, in 2017, inflation on a HICP basis across the euro area accelerated to 1.5 per cent, from 0.2 per cent in 2016.</p>  <p>  This acceleration did not occur in Ireland, with inflation on a HICP basis averaging just 0.3 per cent in 2017. The divergence between inflation in the euro area and Ireland can in part be attributed to the impact of euro-sterling appreciation on consumer prices in Ireland. In turn this reflects the importance of the UK as a source of imports of consumer products.</p>  <p>  While average inflation is low, that masks considerable variation across the components which make up the index. For example, the price of goods is declining. In 2017, goods inflation averaged -2.1 per cent. The decline in goods is driven by declining prices for non-energy industrial goods and food. In contrast, energy prices increased on average by 4 per cent last year.</p>  <p>  While goods prices on the whole are falling, those for services are increasing. For example, services inflation averaged 2.5 per cent last year. One important factor driving the increase in services inflation is strong growth in rent prices. Rent inflation averaged 6.7 per cent last year, a moderation from the 8.7 per cent increase in 2016.</p>  <p>  While inflation is not categorised by the CSO or Eurostat into discretionary or non-discretionary elements, both institutions publish detailed inflation data at a sub-component level according to the United Nations (UN) Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP).  </p></reply>

The draft scheme of the HBFI Bill was approved by Cabinet at the end of January and drafting is currently being undertaken by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in conjunction with my officials. It is expected that the Bill will be published shortly and I am hopeful that the Oireachtas will be in a position to pass the HBFI Bill in the first half of 2018, with a view to HBFI commencing operations later in 2018. The passage of legislation establishing HBFI is a priority for the Government.</p>  <p>  While HBFI will be an independent legal entity established under the Companies Act 2014, in order to ensure that the fund is established in the most efficient manner possible it is proposed that HBFI will harness the considerable expertise and skills amassed through NAMA&rsquo;s existing residential funding programme. It is envisaged that this will be achieved by enabling the NTMA to allocate current NAMA staff with the relevant skills and experience to HBFI where appropriate and subject to the need to ensure that achievement of NAMA&rsquo;s own statutory objectives is not adversely affected. The allocation of NAMA staff will be commensurate to the level of demand for lending from developers and staff will only be assigned where the skills and experience match those that are sought by the Board of HBFI. However as HBFI&rsquo;s establishing legislation has not yet been enacted it follows that no NAMA staff have been transferred to HBFI to date.</p>  <p>  Officials in my Department have been engaging with stakeholders including the Construction Industry Federation and other market participants who welcome the proposed scheme. Formal applications for funding will commence once the entity is up and running later this year. While it will ultimately be up to the Board of HBFI, when it is constituted, to determine the terms and conditions of the fund's lending, the success of an application will depend on, inter alia, the risk profile of each project, the quality of collateral and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In order to comply with EU State aid rules, lending will be provided at market equivalent rates and will not constitute subsidised funding for residential developers.</p>  <p>  Once HBFI is established it is estimated that the fund&rsquo;s proposed allocation of &euro;750m could have capacity to fund about 6,000 homes in the coming years. This delivery estimate is based on an assumed delivery cost of &euro;250,000 per unit and an assumption that HBFI would recycle the allocated funding once over an estimated three year time horizon. The current estimated shortfall in residential supply is 15,000 &ndash; 20,000 units per annum and, accordingly, HBFI, with an annual average delivery of 2,000 homes, could help reduce this shortfall by about 10%.</p>  <p>   HBFI&rsquo;s operating costs will include salary costs, the cost of providing legal, financial reporting and other services in addition to loan servicing costs, audit fees, Board fees, office accommodation and systems costs. While it is too early to estimate operating costs in advance of a business plan which has been endorsed by the future Board of HBFI, it is envisaged that these costs will be commensurate with those of NAMA&rsquo;s residential funding programme and costs typically incurred by other market participants.</p></reply>

The EU VAT Directive provides that Member States may apply either one or two reduced rates to certain goods and services listed in Annex III of the Directive, including the supply of goods and services intended for use in agricultural production. Ireland currently operates two lower rates of VAT, 13.5% and 9%, as permitted by the EU VAT Directive.  In addition, the VAT Directive allows for historic VAT treatment to be maintained under certain conditions and Ireland had retained the application of the zero rate of VAT on certain goods and services but is prohibited from extending or applying this rate to other goods or services such as plastic for wrapping silage bales or silage making.</p>  <p>  Currently, under Irish legislation, the standard rate of VAT, 23%, applies to the supply of plastic for wrapping silage bales (supply of a good) and the reduced rate of VAT, 13.5%, where the wrapping is supplied in the course of the agricultural service of silage making (supply of a service).  VAT on wrapping for silage bales can be recovered by VAT registered agricultural contractors, who in turn charge VAT at 13.5% on the supply of their silage making services to farmers.  VAT registered farmers are entitled to recover this and other VAT borne on their input costs, while flat rate farmers are compensated for the VAT borne on their input costs through the flat rate addition applied to their supplies.  The VAT borne on silage making and other expenses associated with agricultural production are included in calculating the amount of the flat rate addition each year. </p></reply>

This follows on from the Commission's Reflection Paper on the Deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which was published on 31 May 2017, as part of a series of reflection papers on the Future of Europe. </p>  <p>  The Commission's proposal provides for the transformation of the intergovernmental ESM to an EMF which would be incorporated into the Union legal framework.</p>  <p>  Following the Euro Summit, which took place on 15 December, Finance Ministers were mandated to work on Economic and Monetary Union, and in particular on completing the remaining elements of Banking Union and on the development of the ESM, in preparation for the June European Council. As the Deputy will be aware, discussions have been ongoing. </p>  <p>  The ECOFIN Council/Eurogroup meetings since then have allowed me to discuss this concept with my European counterparts. I have contributed to a paper on EMU, alongside the Finance Ministers of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden. We see this as an important step.  It sets out a number of common values, including that &ldquo;the ESM should be strengthened and possibly developed into a European Monetary Fund".  While the ESM should have greater responsibility for the development and monitoring of financial assistance programmes, decision making should remain firmly in the hands of Member States and the current voting structure as fostered by its intergovernmental nature should be retained.  Work by Finance Ministers on this topic will continue over the coming months, to facilitate discussion by Heads of State or Government in June.</p></reply>

The purpose of this part of the account is to show that the expenditure recorded has been devoted to the purposes intended by the D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  The subheads of a Vote set out the detailed allocations of all the expenditure on programmes and services within the ambit of the Vote, and are the headings under which the Department is required to account for the expenditure in its appropriation account.  Managing the delivery of public services within budgetary allocations is a key responsibility of every Department and Minister throughout the financial year.  There are important measures in place to ensure that budgetary targets are being met.  There is regular reporting to Government on expenditure levels and my own Department is in regular contact with all Departments and Offices to ensure that expenditure is being managed within the overall fiscal parameters.  Expenditure profiles are published for each month, and the drawdown of funds from the Exchequer is monitored and reported on against these profiles on a monthly basis in the Exchequer Statement. </p>  <p>  Public procurement rules cover the acquisition, whether under formal contract or not, of works, supplies and services by public bodies. National rules governing public procurement must comply with the relevant EU, WTO and national legal requirements and obligations. The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  The issue of expenditure allocation or indeed whether expenditure has been sanctioned in an appropriate manner takes place before the procurement process is initiated and is therefore outside the scope of public procurement rules.</p></reply>

I have visited the area and seen the problem at first hand.  While addressing the problem is a matter for Fingal County Council (FCC), the Office of Public Works  (OPW)  is working with the Council to assist it in finding a proper long term solution to the problems at Portrane.</p>  <p>  The key objective is for FCC and its engineering advisers, following a full assessment of the situation, to develop and implement an effective management plan to address the erosion issues at Portrane.</p>  <p>  On 16th March 2018, my officials met with FCC where this issue was discussed.  Following this meeting the Council with its engineering advisers is working to finalise its assessment with a view preparing a management plan which will include workable near term measures to address the problem and a sustainable long term solution.  </p>  <p>  Any viable solution identified may be undertaken by the local authority using its own resources or, if necessary, through funding under the OPW Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme on application by FCC.</p></reply>

This Study assists Local Authorities (LA&rsquo;s) to meet their statutory obligations in relation to coastal erosion and to develop appropriate plans and strategies for the sustainable management of the coastline in their counties.  </p>  <p>  The LA&rsquo;s may carry out coastal erosion works using their own resources. Where coastal erosion could give rise to a coastal flood risk, the OPW operates the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, under which applications for funding from LA&rsquo;s are considered for measures costing up to &euro;750,000 in each instance. In that context, funding for coastal erosion risk management studies may also be applied for under this scheme. Funding of up to 90% of the cost is available for projects which meet the eligibility criteria including a requirement that the proposed measures are cost beneficial. </p>  <p>  The OPW has published guidelines for coastal erosion risk management measures and funding applications under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, available on the OPW website. </p>  <p>  I will next week be announcing the Flood Risk Management Plans with the proposed measures to protect 90 coastal communities from their assessed flood risk, in the coming years. These Flood Risk Management Plans were developed through the OPW&rsquo;s Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Programme.</p></reply>

These maintenance works relate to arterial drainage schemes completed by the OPW under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 and 1995. The OPW has a statutory duty to maintain the completed schemes in proper repair and effective condition. Maintenance of all drainage schemes carried out under earlier Acts, known as Drainage Districts, is the responsibility of the relevant Local Authority.</p>  <p>  The area mentioned in the deputy&rsquo;s question Akeragh Lough Drainage District is a Drainage District and it is the responsibility of Kerry County Council (KCC) to maintain all channels and structures in this scheme in good repair and working order.  The OPW has no responsibility for the maintenance of the drainage network in this area.</p>  <p>  In relation to coastal erosion and flooding, it is the responsibility of KCC to assess the local erosion problems in this area and to develop and implement a management plan and any viable measures to address the erosion issues there.</p>  <p>  KCC applied for and was approved funding of &euro;150,000 in March 2018 under the Office of Public Works' Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to carry out a Coastal Erosion Risk Management Study of Ballyheigue as part of the Ballyheigue-Banna-Carrahare and Brandon Bay Maherees study. </p>  <p>  A single study was approved given the proximity of these locations.  The final study extent will be updated and agreed in advance with OPW.</p>  <p>  KCC is currently progressing this study.</p></reply>

These supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs continue to operate under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018 - 2020, and both unions representing SNAs, namely SIPTU and F&Oacute;RSA, have signed up to that agreement.  As set out in the LRC proposals, the supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs only apply to current SNAs who are notified that they are to be made redundant.  Accordingly, the purpose of these arrangements is to facilitate eligible SNAs who are being made redundant by one employer in filling SNA vacancies that may become available in another school / ETB.</p><p>Once an SNA with a minimum of one year's service (service in a substitute capacity i.e. covering for maternity leave, sick leave, career breaks, job-sharing etc. does not count) is notified by his/her employer that s/he is to be made redundant then s/he shall be deemed to be a member of a supplementary assignment panel for SNAs.  The detailed supplementary assignment arrangements for SNAs for the 2017/2018 school year are set out in Departmental Circular 0042/2017 which issued on 25 May 2017 and which is available on the Department's website at the following address:</p><p><i></i></p><p>The operation of this panel is described and outlined in Circular 0042/2017 and it is designed to be as flexible as possible which enables all eligible SNAs, who have the requisite Panel Form 1 completed by their former employer, to apply for any SNA position that is advertised by a school or an ETB with no sectoral, diocesan or geographical limitations imposed.  Every eligible SNA will remain on the panel for two years with a view to getting further employment.  If they are not successful over that period of time in obtaining a further SNA position then they will be eligible for a redundancy payment.  Furthermore, an SNA may opt out of this supplementary assignment panel at any point in time triggering the processing of his/her redundancy payment in line with the terms set out in the SNA redundancy scheme (DES Circular 58/06) or any revision of same that is applicable at that time.</p><p>It should be noted that this does not prevent any person, including newly qualified SNAs, from applying for SNA vacancies but employers are obliged to give precedence to applicants who are members of the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel.</p><p>The Supplementary Assignment Panel arrangements are reviewed by my Department on an annual basis in conjunction with an independent Supplementary Assignment Manager, the school management bodies and the two unions representing SNA staff (F&Oacute;RSA and SIPTU).</p><p>My Department has set up a dedicated e-mail address to deal with all queries in relation to the SNA Supplementary Assignment Panel and any queries in respect of the operation of the Panel can be directed to this dedicated e-mail address: snasupplementpanel@education.gov.ie. </p></reply>

In meeting the demands of unprecedented societal and educational change, it is important to review and update the curriculum to ensure children are afforded a high-quality, coherent, and more relevant mathematics education that will contribute towards their personal and academic learning and development.  The Primary Mathematics Curriculum will aim to develop learners&rsquo; conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning and productive disposition.  Equipping learners with these five strands of Mathematical proficiency will provide them with vital life skills and a foundation for citizenship in the 21st century.</p><p>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) began developing the new Primary Mathematics Curriculum in September 2016.  This curriculum is for all children and is underpinned by the view that every child is capable of engaging with mathematical concepts and ideas from birth. Initial work focused on junior infants to second class.  Consultation on a draft of this part of the curriculum began in October 2017 and finished in mid-March 2018.  Consultation included online questionnaires, consultation seminars in Limerick, Sligo and Dublin, written submissions and a network of schools working with the draft curriculum.</p><p>Work has begun on the analysis of the data gathered through the consultation.  This work will be presented in a consultation report which will be published on the NCCA website before the summer. The report will also set out next steps for work on the primary mathematics curriculum including work on the senior classes.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills recently agreed to a proposed revised schedule for the implementation of the new Primary Mathematics Curriculum, whereby the curriculum will be introduced to schools as a single-stage implementation, from Junior Infants through to 6th class, rather than in two stages, Junior Infants to 2nd class and then 3rd class to 6th class, as originally planned.  The revision arises in good part from learning from the implementation of the Primary Language Curriculum, including listening to extensive feedback received from that process.  While the revised approach to implementation of the new Primary Mathematics Curriculum will impact on timing at the initial stages, the proposed date for full implementation of the curriculum in all years of primary, September 2021, remains unchanged.</p><p>Following the recent changes made by the to the implementation plans, the NCCA will publish the draft curriculum for junior infants to sixth class in late 2018 for consultation.  This draft will incorporate work carried out on foot of findings from the recent consultation.  The second consultation will again include work with a network of schools. </p><p>For further information including the extensive body of mathematics research which informed the development of the draft curriculum, see<i>.</i></p></reply>

The methodology adopted to assess levels of disadvantage in schools is based on centrally held data with a uniform application across the entire school system to assess levels of disadvantage in Primary and Post-Primary schools. </p><p>The key data sources used in the DEIS identification process are the DES Primary Online Database (POD) and Post-Primary Online (PPOD) Databases, and CSO data from the National Census of Population as represented in the Pobal HP Index for Small Areas which is a method of measuring the relative affluence or disadvantage of a particular geographical area. Variables used in the compilation of the HP Index include not only single parent rate, but those related to demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is combined with pupil data, anonymised and aggregated to small area, to provide information on the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in the pupil cohort of individual schools. </p><p>A detailed document explaining the methodology used in the Identification process is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>As the Deputy will be aware, an update of the identification model is currently underway. This will take account of updated school data as provided by schools for the current school year combined with the Pobal HP Index of Deprivation, based on CSO Small Area Population statistics derived from the 2016 National Census. It is envisaged that this process will be completed in the coming weeks.</p><p>Should this exercise reveal that any school, including the school referred to by the Deputy, which did not qualify for DEIS in 2017 meets the criteria applicable to schools with the highest concentration of disadvantage based on the updated information, then additional schools may be included subject to available resources.</p></reply>

The improved staffing schedule has been implemented for the 2018/19 school year and is set out in Circular 0010/2018, available on the Department of Education website.  </p><p>In establishing their staffing for the 2018/19 school year, schools may appoint the number of teachers allowed for on the staffing schedule using the school enrolment of 30<sup>th </sup>September 2017.Any teachers appointed from the staffing schedule must be engaged in teaching duties within the school.

Ensuring every child is supported and given the opportunity to reach their full potential is a key priority for this Government and my Department is committed to improving educational outcomes for members of the Traveller and Roma communities.  </p>  <p>  The details supplied by the Deputy relate to a school with Special School designation dating from a period when separate education provision for members of the Traveller community was the norm.   The phasing out of segregated education provision for Traveller children began in 2006 in accordance with Government policy which was developed in consultation with Traveller representative groups and education partners.  St. Thomas&rsquo;s is the only remaining education centre in the country catering for post-primary age Traveller students on a segregated basis.   </p>  <p>  My Department has been engaging with the Patron of St. Thomas&rsquo;s for many years to progress the transfer of its student cohort to the mainstream school system in line with this agreed national policy.   (As with all schools under private patronage, the decision in relation to school closure, amalgamation etc. ultimately rests with the Patron).   </p>  <p>  In order to ensure a smooth and effective transition of provision for students, my officials are engaging with the school Patron and the Educational Welfare Service of Tusla in relation to future education provision for the current student cohort in St. Thomas&rsquo;s.  Tusla&rsquo;s Educational Welfare Service is available to work with parents to source school places for the current enrolment, including 2 students at Leaving Certificate level who would be due to sit exams in 2019.  Now that students at the centre are progressing to Leaving Certificate it is particularly important  important that these students would have access to the full curriculum and associated supports in order to maximize their opportunities to progress to further and higher education and employment.</p>  <p>  Current overall policy on Traveller education is being progressed within the framework of National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021.  The Strategy has a particular emphasis on improving Traveller engagement with education and my Department is working with relevant Government Departments and agencies and Traveller representative Groups to progress Strategy actions aimed at improving education outcomes for all Travellers, including the current student cohort of St Thomas&rsquo;s School.</p></reply>

Under these strategies, the Higher Education Authority (HEA), reviews the performance and progress of the Irish higher education system, with reference to a steering and performance based framework for the system governance of higher education in Ireland.  </p>  <p>  Higher educational institutions are independent bodies.  The performance framework and associated dialogue process allows institutions to set out the individual contribution they will make to delivery of national system-level objectives, with reference to their mission, strengths and strategic plans and in ways that reflect the diversity of the institutional mission or profile. </p>  <p>  As part of its goal setting and reporting process with the HEA, Limerick Institute of Technology (LIT) reported on its incorporation of the former Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute in Thurles into an enlarged LIT with more than 7,000 full-time and part-time learners and approximately 550 staff members serving Limerick City and County, Tipperary and Clare.  LIT research and development plans reported to the HEA include a Centre for Rural and Sustainable Development at Thurles which is focused on supporting communities, enterprises, and industry to develop and engage in sustainable practices and processes.  The LIT Thurles Campus also provides a number of undergraduate programmes in rural and sustainable development, central to the training of agribusiness professionals.</p></reply>

SUSI&rsquo;s online system for the 2018 Scheme is now open.  Students attending college in the academic year 2018/19 are required to submit their grant application to Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) via <i>www.susi.ie </i>to have their eligibility for grant assistance assessed.</p><p>I understand that the individual in question already holds a level 8 degree.  One of the criteria in the student grant scheme relates to 'progression'.  This means that a student must be moving from year to year within a course, having successfully completed the previous year or be transferring from one course to another, where the award for the subsequent course is of a higher level than the previous course.</p><p>  The objective of this policy is to help as many students as possible to obtain one qualification at each level of study. </p><p>If the person to whom the Deputy refers is ineligible for a SUSI grant then there are some other options which could be pursued.  </p><p>Students in third-level institutions experiencing exceptional financial need can apply for support under the Student Assistance Fund.  This Fund assists students, in a sensitive and compassionate manner, who might otherwise be unable to continue their third level studies due to their financial circumstances. Details of this fund are available from the Access Office in the college attended.</p><p>  Also, tax relief at the standard rate of tax may be claimed in respect of tuition fees paid for approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including approved postgraduate courses in EU Member States and in non-EU countries.  Further information on this tax relief is available from the Revenue Commissioners on <i>www.revenue.ie.</i></p></reply>

The proposed change, which will increase the compulsory retirement age to 70 years, will require the enactment of legislation and my colleague, the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform is progressing this draft legislation at present.  </p>  <p>  Pending the legislative changes referred to above the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform set out temporary measures which will apply to those affected and who will reach age 65 before the legislation has commenced.  That circular from DPER further authorised Government Departments and Offices to adapt those temporary arrangements so as to make them available to public service bodies under their aegis.</p>  <p>  The temporary arrangements in the Education and Training sector mirror those outlined by DPER and my Department recently issued a Circular and Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on this matter to the sector.  </p>  <p>  In essence these arrangements permit someone with a compulsory retirement age of 65 years to continue working until they reach State pension age currently age 66.  The person concerned must retire, take their lump-sum payment but can return directly to their post in the educational institution.  They will return to work on the first point of the relevant pay-scale.  It is intended that these temporary arrangements will continue until the commencement of the legislation to change the compulsory retirement age.  </p>  <p>  Full details of the Circular and FAQs which are published on my Department&rsquo;s website are attached for ease of reference.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-24a.595.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400069#WRL04600"><p>I wish to clarify that any site that has been announced as having been &ldquo;agreed in principle&rdquo; will not have been fully conveyed, transferred or leased to my Department by the date the agreement was reached or announced as having been reached.</p>  <p>  In order to explain the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I wish to put a context on the site acquisition process.  The first step is the identification of potential site options.  My Department works closely with local authorities in the identification of school sites and, in addition in line with relevant circulars, also considers the potential of existing properties in the ownership of my Department or other state agencies.  </p>  <p>  Where a suitable site or property is identified, negotiations with the relevant landowner follow with a view to obtaining agreement on the terms of the land acquisition; this includes price but can also include other aspects such as technical issues arising from the development of the site.  This process can take some time but once the terms of the acquisition are agreed, i.e.  "agreement in principle" obtained, the process moves to conveyancing stage.  </p>  <p>  The point at which "agreement in principle" is reached with a landowner in respect of a proposed site acquisition is a very positive step in the acquisition process.  However, it is also the point that the conveyancing process to formalise the transfer (or lease) of the property commences.  </p>  <p>  Property conveyancing can be a time-consuming process depending on the variables in an individual case such as title issues and easements.  Due diligence has to be applied to the transfer in order to ensure that good and marketable title is obtained in the interests of the Exchequer. </p>  <p>  In addition in cases where an acquisition is subject to planning permission, while contracts may be signed in advance, the transfer of ownership of the property occurs once planning permission has been granted.  The planning process also includes the planning appeal process.   </p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the above, where there is relative certainty in relation to finalising matters, for example where the land is in public ownership or where planning permission is being submitted but contracts not yet finalised, my Department sometimes can inform the school authorities of the proposed school location at this point on the basis that &ldquo;agreement in principle&rdquo; has been obtained. </p>  <p>  My Department&rsquo;s general approach is to inform the school authorities of the potential location of the new school at as early a stage as possible, provided that this would not jeopardise the potential acquisition.  In general, where a site is in public ownership or where there is relative certainty in relation to completion of the acquisition, the school can be informed at the point when "agreement in principle" has been obtained and prior to contracts being signed.  In some cases, particularly where the land is in private ownership, due to commercial sensitivities it may not be appropriate to confirm the site location at the point at which agreement in principle is reached.  For example, title issues may come to light at conveyancing stage which means that the acquisition may not proceed; if this information were in the public domain it could potentially jeopardise any subsequent disposal of the land by the owner.  Similarly in some cases prematurely announcing the site location could jeopardise completion of the acquisition process due to commercial or other issues.  </p>  <p>  I trust this explains the context in which the school site acquisition process operates, and the reasons why school site acquisition progress can be referred to as having reached the point of "agreement in principle" while the formal transfer process has not completed.  </p></reply>

The Deputy will therefore appreciate that all applications for capital funding must be considered in the context of the existing challenging financial circumstances where funding must be prioritised for this purpose and to provide mainstream classroom accommodation where additional teachers are being appointed.</p>  <p>  In this context, it is important to note that the Department has clarified in writing to the school authority that the Department is not in a position to advance further needs of the school at present.  The school&rsquo;s accommodation demands remain to be considered subject to available funding but without an indicative timeframe for the progression as a further phase.  </p></reply>

*At this stage, it is not possible to give an accurate breakdown of the forecast population in new apprenticeships on a sectoral basis. The Apprenticeship Council is continuing to work with consortia in developing a wide variety of proposals in various sectors of the economy made through the first call for proposals. In addition, following our second call for proposals last year a further 26 new proposals were approved for further development across a wide range of occupations. Once developed, these will further shape the sectoral breakdown of these new apprenticeships.</p></speech>

At the end of 2017, an additional eight new traineeships had been developed in areas such as hospitality, engineering and animation. The programmes have been designed by ETBs working in collaboration with employers to meet identified skill needs. In addition, we have broadened the eligibility criteria on participation to include school leavers, older learners and people in employment. </p><p>A new Five-Step Guide to traineeship has been developed which is aimed at employers seeking practical information on how to develop a traineeship within their company.  The guide provides practical information on what a traineeship is; how employers and prospective trainees can access traineeship programmes; information on current traineeship opportunities, and the five-step process to developing a new traineeship. </p><p>I have been informed by SOLAS that they are currently reviewing the 2017 end of year traineeship enrolments figure and also the gender breakdown of enrolments for the first quarter of 2018.  I will forward this information to the Deputy once it has been verified and validated.</p><p>The information requested by the Deputy in relation to traineeship targets and budget allocation is set out in the following tables.</p><p>Targets 2016 - 2020<table><tr><th><b>Existing Traineeships</b></th><th><b>2016</b></th><th><b>2017</b></th><th><b>2018</b></th><th><b>2019</b></th><th><b>2020</b></th></tr><tr><td>Number of &lsquo;live traineeships programmes&rsquo;</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>24</td><td>24</td></tr><tr><td>Target new enrolments per annum</td><td>2,400</td><td>2,400</td><td>3,000</td><td>3,500</td><td>3,500</td></tr><tr><td><b>New/relaunched traineeships</b></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Number of traineeship programmes (cumulative)</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>20</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>Planned new enrolments per annum</td><td>100</td><td>200</td><td>900</td><td>1,500</td><td>1,500</td></tr><tr><td>Total target trainee enrolments p.a.</td><td>2,500</td><td>2,600</td><td>3,900</td><td>5,000</td><td>5,000</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Allocation for Traineeships</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>&euro;</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>&euro;29,398,301</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>&euro;26,159,261</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>&euro;41,000,000 (subject to SOLAS/ETB service planning process)</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The key proposal in the Directive is that parental leave should be made available to parents on a paid basis, and it is currently under discussion at working group level.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will also be aware that Deputies Roisin Shortall and Catherine Murphy have proposed a Private Members Bill, entitled Parental Leave (Amendment) Bill 2017, which provides for the extension of the existing entitlement to parental leave from 18 weeks leave to 26 weeks leave. The Government decided not to oppose this Bill at Second Stage, which took place on 8 February 2018.</p>  <p>  I advised the House that I was available to discuss the proposal contained in the Bill with the sponsoring deputies. The Bill has been referred to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality and I have strongly suggested that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality carry out a comprehensive legislative scrutiny on the Bill and on related issues in order to inform the debate and to allow interested stakeholders, groups and individuals to make submissions and to input to the legislative process. </p>  <p>  I look forward to engaging in future discussions on the Bill in the context of the work that is ongoing in relation to expanding paid support to parents.</p></reply>

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal. </p>  <p>  Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 48 have been assigned to the Cork City Division. Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 - a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016. </p>  <p>  I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track. This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, 200 of whom attested last month. Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties. There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018. </p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical. The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cork City Division.</p></reply>

The plan encompasses the agreed recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate Report "Changing Policing in Ireland" and the Programme for a Partnership Government commitment to expand the Garda work force.</p>  <p>  In relation to civilian staff, the Plan sets a medium term target of 20% civilians of the overall Garda workforce by 2021. This translates to a doubling the number of civilian staff from 2,000 to 4,000 over the period and will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na more in line with international norms.  This target will be achieved through a twin-track approach of firstly, a &ldquo;civilian by default&rdquo; policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts other than operational policing posts and for non-operational policing posts that become vacant and, secondly, the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to policing roles.</p>  <p>  While Government determines overall policy and provides the necessary resources, it is the Garda Commissioner who has responsibility to carry on and manage and control generally the administration and business of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by arranging for the recruitment, training and appointment of its members and civilian staff.  As the Deputy will be aware it is also the Garda Commissioner who is responsible for the distribution of resources, including personnel, among the various Garda Divisions and I, as Minister, have no direct role in the matter.</p>  <p>  I am assured by the Commissioner that all posts are filled having regard to the Five Year Reform and High-level Workforce Plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the requirement to allocate both Garda and civilian resources appropriately.</p></reply>

Ireland voluntarily opted into the two EU Council Decisions on Relocation (2015/1523) and (2015/1601), which provided for the EU wide relocation of 160,000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece.</p><p>By the end of the two-year EU Relocation Programme in September 2017, across the Union, a total of 37,000 asylum seekers were eligible and registered for relocation in Italy and Greece, of which 78% (approximately 29,000) had been relocated to other EU Member States including Ireland. This is significantly lower than the 160,000 expected to be made available under the programme for relocation and resettlement.</p><p>Notwithstanding this, Ireland has remained committed to the target of 4,000 refugees and asylum-seekers and has taken its own steps to meet those commitments. The arrival of Ireland's relocation persons was completed in March 2018 with 1,022 people having arrived from Greece and work continues to house such persons in communities.  267 people have arrived under relocation in 2018.</p><p>Under Resettlement, Ireland pledged to admit 520 people under resettlement by 2017. We surpassed that figure in 2016 and this enabled the Government to further increase its commitment under the programme.  A total of 1,040 persons under the European Commission&rsquo;s July 2015 Resettlement scheme will have been admitted by the end of this year, which is  a doubling of the original commitment of 520.</p><p>792 people have already arrived and the remaining refugees are due to arrive in the coming months. The European Commission recognises Ireland as being one of only seven EU Member States to have fulfilled their resettlement pledges from the July 2015 Agreement.</p><p>In a further gesture of humanitarian assistance towards the most vulnerable caught up in the migration crisis and following a debate in the D&aacute;il, the Government also committed to taking up to 200 unaccompanied minors (UAMs) from France who were previously resident in the migrant camp at Calais. Unlike any other Member State, Ireland also offered these young people programme refugee status.</p><p>Following 13 missions to France, a total of 41 young people ultimately expressed an interest and were assessed as suitable to come to Ireland under the programme.  They have all arrived in Ireland and this programme has been completed. These young people<b></b>were taken in under the care of Tusla who have statutory responsibility for minors.  The IRPP has also accepted 6 unaccompanied minors from Greece under the Relocation Programme.<b></b>Further initiatives to respond to the needs of unaccompanied minors are under consideration at present.</p><p>To address the remaining balance of approximately 1,800 people under the IRPP, additional resettlement pledges have been made to take a further 945 refugees from Lebanon between 2018 (345) and 2019 (600).  A new Family Reunification Humanitarian Admission Programme (FRHAP) is being established and will be open for applications shortly. This has a capacity to welcome up to 530 people by the end of 2019.</p><p>The Government is also keeping under review its options to further respond to our humanitarian obligation and to meet the target of 4,000.</p><p>A breakdown of the number of unaccompanied minors under the Calais Special Project and Greece is outlined in the following tables.</p><p><b>Calais Special Project</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>41</td></tr></table></p><p><b>IRPP from Greece</b><table><tr><th>Year</th><th>Number</th></tr><tr><td>2016</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>2017</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>6</td></tr></table></p></reply>

Certain of the circumstances surrounding his death have been subject to a number of investigations and reviews by various state bodies such as An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The tragedy was also subject to independent scrutiny by the Independent Review Mechanism established by my predecessor as Minister for Justice and Equality.</p>  <p>  The initial investigation conducted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na led to the DPP successfully prosecuting a case against the driver of the car involved and resulted in a conviction.</p>  <p>  Complaints from the family were also referred to the Independent Review Mechanism (IRM) established in May 2014 as a means to independently review certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which had been made to the Minister for Justice and Equality or the Taoiseach or other public representatives.  A panel consisting of two Senior and five Junior Counsel was established for the purpose, all selected on the basis of their experience of the criminal justice system.  Every case under the Independent Review Mechanism was reviewed by independent counsel, who made an objective recommendation. It was open to counsel to make any recommendation that they saw fit, including, if they considered it appropriate, some form of independent inquiry.  Following the review of this case, counsel made a recommendation that the Minister should take no further action in this case and were of the view that the appropriate forum for these matters was GSOC. The Minister accepted the recommendation put forward by Counsel and informed the family accordingly in December 2016.</p>  <p>  A number of complaints made to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission by members of the family are the subject of investigation by GSOC.</p>  <p>  I can inform the Deputy that GSOC has now completed its criminal investigation in the case and has provided a copy of the report to the family, the Garda Commissioner and to me as Minister. It is understood that GSOC will publish this report shortly.</p>  <p>  As previously stated, once all the GSOC investigations are completed, the question of whether further action, if any, is to be taken will be fully considered. </p></reply>

This gives a wide range of community and voluntary organisations the opportunity to bid for government funding for projects to support the integration of migrants in our communities.</p>  <p>  South Dublin County Partnership received funding from OPMI via South Dublin County Council between 2008 and 2016 under a National Integration Funding Programme that concluded in 2016. In 2017, a new 3 year National Integration Funding Programme was initiated. Grant allocation under this programme was by way of open competitive calls for proposals. All organisations wishing to be considered for funding &ndash; including those who had received funding under the previous programme - were required to make new applications.  All eligible applications received were assessed by OPMI staff against the published selection criteria. The funding recommendations were reviewed by an assessment committee that included external representatives.  In all, 15 projects were selected to receive funding from a total of 73 eligible applications.</p>  <p>  An application was received from South Dublin County Partnership which included a request for funding to contribute to the cost of running the centre referred to by the Deputy.  Regrettably, this application was unsuccessful in what was a highly competitive process.</p>  <p>  My officials advise that at a subsequent meeting held with the Office for Promotion of Migrant Integration in November last year, representatives from South Dublin County Partnership outlined their concerns for the future of the centre in Clondalkin.  Officials of my Department proposed a number of alternative options to secure funding.  They invited the representatives of South Dublin County Partnership to consider these options further and to submit proposals.  However, no such proposals have been forthcoming to date.  These options remain open to the organisation and my officials remain available to discuss those options further with South Dublin County Partnership should they so wish.</p>  <p>  The National Funding to Promote the Integration of Immigrants is one of a number of funding programmes, administered by or on behalf of my Department to support migrant integration. We also provide funding from the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund and the Communities Integration Fund. South County Dublin Partnership is in receipt of integration project funding under both these funds. In 2017 the Partnership was awarded a grant of &euro;150,000 over three years under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund.</p>  <p>  The Migrant Integration Strategy, which was published in February 2017, makes provision for the continuation of funding through OPMI for integration related projects at community level up to and including 2020.  Future "Calls for Proposals" under all integration funding programmes will be advertised on my Department's website, the Office for the Promotion of Migrant Integration and the EU Funds Unit of the Department.  South Dublin County Partnership is entitled to apply as appropriate.</p></reply>

The review has, in particular, highlighted an overestimation of the level of sexual crime reported for most years from 2003-2016.</p>  <p>  The CSO have advised that part of the reason for the over-recording of crimes was because, until now, if repeated crimes were committed by the same person on the same victim, each incident was recorded as a separate case. During the 14-year period under review, from 2003 to 2016, sex crime reporting was overestimated by the Garda by 6 per cent overall.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the over-recording of these crimes was most pronounced in the years 2003-2008, and that in more recent years the level of over-recording discovered was between 1% and 3%.</p>  <p>  While it is very concerning that further errors in the recording and classification of statistics have been uncovered, it is important that these errors are identified and that the figures are corrected and measures put in place to avoid recurrence.</p>  <p>  The CSO guidance in this area is of great assistance to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as the continued diligence shown by the Policing Authority in terms of their oversight of this issue.</p></reply>

The Public Appointments Service (PAS), on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, manages the initial recruitment stages for selection of Garda Reserve members with the final stages of the recruitment process being managed by the Garda Commissioner and I, as Minister, have no direct involvement in the matter. </p>  <p>  The "Programme for a Partnership Government" includes a commitment to double the Garda Reserve to act in a supportive role undertaking local patrols and crime reduction measures.  In line with this, the Government has in place a plan to achieve a Reserve strength of 2,000 by 2021 as part of an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 which will also comprise 15,000 Garda&iacute; and 4,000 civilians.</p>  <p>  To support the expansion of the Reserve the Commissioner undertook a recruitment campaign for Garda Reserves last March which attracted 2,394 applicants, of whom 498 successfully completed the initial stages carried out by PAS.  These applications are currently being processed by the Garda Appointments Office.  The time frame for this can vary due to a number factors including the length of the vetting process which may, for example, be more time consuming if the applicant has resided abroad or is deferred for medical reasons.  Positions for training to become a member of the Reserve are only offered when all stages of the application process are completed and there is a need to ensure there are sufficient candidates for a class to enter training in the Garda College.  It is expected that the first class from the current competition will commence training in the coming months.  </p>  <p>  Reserve members make a very valuable contribution to the communities they serve throughout the country and I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who have expressed an interest in joining their numbers.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the PAS and the Garda Appointments Office that any candidate involved in the recruitment process for the Garda Reserve competition must contact the Public Appointments Service or Garda Appointments Office themselves should they have any queries in relation to their application as these offices will not disclose or discuss any application to third parties in accordance with Data Protection policies.</p></reply>

Garda management keeps this distribution of resources under continual review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure that the optimum use is made of these resources.</p><p>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, as of the 28 February 2018, the latest date for which figures are available, the strength of the Cork West Division was 298.  There are also 8 Garda Reserves and 26 Garda civilian staff attached to the Cork West Division.  When appropriate, the work of local Garda&iacute; is supported by a number of Garda national units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Armed Support Units, the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau and the Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to ensuring a strong and visible police presence throughout the country in order to maintain and strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and to deter crime.  To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021, including 15,000 Garda members.</p><p>Since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide, of whom 20 have been assigned to the Cork West Division.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.  </p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have already done so.  In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.  </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division, including the Cork West Division.</p><p>In so far as the allocation of newly attested Garda&iacute; is concerned, this is a matter for the Commissioner.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the needs of all Garda Divisions are fully considered when determining the allocation of resources.  However, it is important to keep in mind that newly attested Garda&iacute; have a further 16 months of practical and class-room based training to complete in order to receive their BA in Applied Policing.  To ensure that they are properly supported and supervised and have opportunities to gain the breadth of policing experience required, the Commissioner's policy is to allocate them to specially designated training stations which have the required training and development structures and resources in place, including trained Garda tutors and access to a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities under the training programme.</p><p>I have set out in the table the number of new Garda recruits assigned to each Garda station in the Cork West Division in each of the years 2014 -2017 and to date in 2018.<table><tr><th>Probationer Garda Allocations 2015 &ndash; 2018*</th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr><tr><td>DIVISION</td><td>STATION</td><td>2015</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td><td>2018</td><td>TOTAL</td></tr><tr><td>CORK WEST</td><td>BANDON</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>CLONAKILTY</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>15</td><td>0</td><td>20</td></tr></table>*To date in 2018  </p></reply>

To achieve this the Government has put in place a plan for an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  We are making real, tangible progress on achieving this goal.</p><p>I am informed by the Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014, just under 1,800 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  Garda numbers, taking account of retirements, increased to 13,551 at the end of 2017 &ndash; a net increase of over 600 since the end of 2016.</p><p>I am pleased that funding is in place to maintain this high level of investment in the Garda workforce to ensure that the vision of an overall workforce of 21,000 by 2021 remains on track.  This year a further 800 new Garda Recruits will enter the Garda College; some 400 of whom have entered already this year. In total, 800 Garda trainees are scheduled to attest during the year, some 200 of whom attested last month.  Further, Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, are on track to reach 14,000 by the end of this year.</p><p>I can assure the Deputy that projected departures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are kept under continuing review and the level of recruitment adjusted as necessary in order to achieve the desired strength.</p><p>In addition, a further 500 civilians will also be recruited to fill critical skills gaps across the organisation and to facilitate the redeployment of Garda&iacute; from administrative and technical duties to front-line operational duties.  There are plans to strengthen the Garda Reserve with new Reserves expected to commence training in 2018.  </p><p>This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources needed to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across every Division</p><p>In the spreadsheet at the following link I have set out for the Deputy's information the number of departures from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the years 2014 - 2018, as provided to me by the Garda authorities. These figures include departures arising from voluntary, compulsory, or cost neutral early retirement, resignation, death, dismissal and medical discharge.</p></reply>

It is open to any individual to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions for naturalisation prescribed in the Act.  The statutory residence conditions are that the applicant must have a period of 1 year's continuous residence in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the 8 years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence amounting to 4 years (in the case of an application based on being the spouse or civil partner of an Irish citizen the Act reduces this further period to 2 years during the preceding 4 years). </p>  <p>  Where an applicant is found to be non-resident for substantial periods of time such periods will not be reckonable for the purposes of fulfilling the statutory residency conditions for naturalisation stipulated in the Act.  This is of particular importance with regard to the requirement to have 1 year&rsquo;s continuous residence in the State immediately prior to the date of application, and may also mean the requirement of total residence is not met.  The guidance notes attached to the application form inform applicants that arrangements for assessment of residence are on the basis that the person is physically resident in the State for the required period of time and that where there are significant absences from the State the application may be refused.  A reasonable and generous period of up to 6 weeks is allowed to provide for absences from the State for normal holidays and other short term and temporary nature absences, such as for a family bereavement or medical emergency, and such short term nature absences from the State would not impact on the statutory residence requirement.  Some further discretion may be allowed where there are wholly exceptional or unavoidable circumstances.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the application for naturalisation in respect of the person referred to by the Deputy is being reviewed in light of additional information supplied by the applicant.  Following correspondence from the individual concerned on 19 April 2018, a letter issued to her on 20 April 2018 requesting certain information.  Upon receipt of the requested information the case will be further processed and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.</p>  <p>  Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS of my Department by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.  The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from the INIS is, in the Deputy&rsquo;s view, inadequate or too long awaited.</p></reply>

As Minister, I have no direct role in these matters.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to a pilot scheme to reopen 6 Garda stations, both urban and rural, to determine possible positive impacts that such openings will have on criminal activity, with special emphasis on burglaries, theft and public order.</p>  <p>  The Garda Commissioner's final report, which is available on my Department's website, recommends that Rush Garda Station be reopened, along with stations in Ballinspittle, Co.

Dublin.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda authorities that a brief of requirements was provided to the OPW in relation to the reopening of these 6 stations, including Rush Garda Station, and that the Garda authorities in that regard requested the OPW to undertake technical surveys to determine the works which would be required to enable the stations to reopen and the costings of any such works.</p>  <p>  I am further informed that the OPW has this week written to the Commissioner outlining the works and estimated cost involved.</p>  <p>  I understand that at this stage it is not possible to provide a timeframe for reopening the stations concerned, which is dependent on a number of factors.  </p></reply>

Any person who assaults or threatens to assault a peace officer in the execution of their duty is guilty of an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months or both or on convictions on indictment to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years or both.  In addition, the Act allows for judges to impose such sentences consecutively on persons found guilty of such offences.  </p><p>In June 2015, following a number of serious assaults on prison staff, the State Claims Agency (SCA) commenced a review of assaults on prison staff by prisoners in accordance with Section 8 of the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act, 2000.  </p><p>In November 2016, the SCA presented the report to the then T&aacute;naiste.  The report noted many positive findings including that given the number of committals in 2015 the ratio of assaults to the number of prisoners in the system was very low.  The role of a prison officer is a difficult and challenging one.  Prison staff must deal with a wide range of complex issues and there are occasions when they are subjected to unacceptable acts of violence.</p><p>The report contains a large number of recommendations.  These recommendations were accepted and implemented - an undertaking that has been included as a Key Action in the Irish Prison Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2016-2018.  The Irish Prison Service is committed to creating a safer environment for all those who work or live within our prison walls.  In addition, the Service is committed to ensuring that any staff member who is subject to or witnesses an assault is given the necessary supports in the aftermath of the incident.</p><p>Given the substantive nature of the recommendations, the Irish Prison Service has an implementation plan in place and is in the process of implementing these recommendations.  </p></reply>

The whole of Government effort to deliver on these objectives is supported by the annual Action Plan for Jobs. </p>  <p>  The CSO estimates that between April 2016 and April 2017, 27,400 Irish emigrants returned to Ireland. As the economy continues to grow and the economy approaches full employment, this trend is likely to continue.</p>  <p>  Since the first Action Plan for Jobs was launched in early 2012, there are almost 346,000 more people at work bringing total employment in the State to 2,225,100 (as of Q4 2017). My Department and its agencies have a range of initiatives to connect with Irish emigrants (and others) and outline the careers and entrepreneurial opportunities in Ireland. These include:</p>  <p>  - IDA Ireland actively promotes Ireland as a location for new investment and Enterprise Ireland has specific targets to attract entrepreneurs to Ireland with a focused marketing programme underway in international markets.</p>  <p>  - Since 2016, my Department has funded TechLife Ireland- a partnership with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the Irish Technology industry to promote and brand Ireland as a top destination to pursue a career in technology and attract 3,000 top tech professionals to Ireland each year. Industry is playing an important role in supporting the initiative and driving its development.</p>  <p>  - Science Foundation Ireland encourages leading researchers to move to Ireland raising Ireland's profile as a location for research excellence and career advancement. For instance, SFI awards two Saint Patrick's Day Science Medals to distinguished Irish scientists, engineers or technology leaders living and working in the USA: one academic and one from industry.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would emphasise that ensuring a continued focus on attracting foreign direct investment and maintaining and improving competitiveness is critical to attracting talent back to Ireland.</p></reply>

This scheme has been put in place as it is considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances as necessary.  Under the scheme, which will run until 2020, Enterprise Ireland can provide restructuring support to SMEs in severe financial difficulties.  </p>  <p>  As part of the deliberations of the Technical Working Group on State Aid, it was agreed that Ireland should extend the R&amp;R scheme to include temporary restructuring support for those SMEs with acute liquidity needs.  This extension has been notified to the Commission and approval is expected early in Q2 2018.  </p>  <p>  My Department is carrying out extensive work to prepare for all Brexit eventualities. Informed by detailed research, my Department is putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including the Brexit Loan Scheme which was launched last month and which will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit or will be in the future. </p>  <p>  The recent signing of the counter guarantee from the EIB group (through its InnovFin Guarantee) means that the &euro;24 million exchequer funding announced in the 2018 Budget (&euro;14 million from my Department and &euro;9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine) can be leveraged to provide a fund of &euro;300 million. The Brexit Loan Scheme, which was launched last month, is open to businesses of fewer than 500 employees which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact (or potential impact) of Brexit. They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy demonstrating that they plan to innovate or adapt in response to Brexit. This scheme will be operated within De Minimis State Aid Regulation.</p>  <p>  My officials are also examining policy proposals for a new longer-term Business Investment Loan Scheme to support businesses to invest strategically for a post-Brexit environment and a new Business Finance Advisory Hub service which would focus on business development.   </p>  <p>  The Agencies of my Department are at the forefront in working with firms to ensure they are equipped to deal with Brexit and to enhance their performances in an increasingly competitive global trading environment through lean programmes, skills development and reducing business costs.  </p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland (EI) has launched the 'Brexit SME Scorecard', an interactive online tool which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit.  EI is also offering a 'Be Prepared Grant' of up to &euro;5,000 to support clients to develop a Brexit Action Plan and it continues to support clients to improve their competitiveness, acquire new markets and enhance management skills. </p>  <p>  The Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) are organising workshops, seminars and training to assist companies to better understand the challenges of Brexit and have a range of supports to help clients to respond to those challenges, to become more competitive and to source new markets.  </p>  <p>  InterTrade Ireland is also working to minimise the impact of Brexit on north-south trade.</p></reply>

Securing access to existing and new and innovative medicines is a key objective of the health service. However, the challenge is to do this in a safe and sustainable manner. Treatment must be appropriate and proportionate and clinical decision-making, such as prescribing, should be based on both patient needs and sound medical evidence.</p><p>Lidocaine 5% medicated plasters are licensed for the localised relief of post-shingles pain in adults. This is the only licensed use for the patch in Ireland. It has been reimbursed in the community drugs schemes since 2010.</p><p>Clinical concern arose when, from 2012 on, usage increased significantly, to the point where, in Ireland, more plasters were being used in than the entire UK National Health Service. In such situations, it is important and appropriate for clinicians to review usage and, in 2016, the HSE Medicines Management Programme (MMP) reviewed the use of the plasters. The review estimated that only 5-10% of prescribing was for the licensed indication.</p><p>Following the clinical review, the HSE introduced a new reimbursement approval system for the patches from September 2017, to support appropriate use and patient care. Under these arrangements, the patient's GP or consultant must apply to the MMP for reimbursement approval on behalf of the patient. In the case of a negative reimbursement decision, the treating clinician can appeal the decision. Once a patient is approved for reimbursement support, irrespective of the indication, there will be no expiry on the duration of treatment. This also applies to applications already approved by the MMP.</p><p>As of 29 March 2018, there have been 5,747 online applications from clinicians requesting the reimbursement of Versatis. Of these applications, 1,205 patients (over 21%) have been approved. Of 672 online appeals, over 71% of patients have been approved for reimbursement. The MMP has sought further information on another 41 appeals. Accordingly, since 1 September 2017, 1,681 patients have been approved for reimbursement of lidocaine plasters, based on the clinical case made by their GP or consultant.</p><p>It is clear that this new process supports appropriate use and prescribing and both post-shingles patients and other appropriate cases can continue to be treated with lidocaine plasters.</p><p>The HSE notified prescribers and pharmacies of the introduction of the new system in August 2017. This advice was re-issued recently, and information for patients and practitioners is on the HSE Medicines Management Programme website at <i><i>www.hse.ie/yourmedicines</i></i>.</p><p>This reimbursement decision is a matter for the HSE. However, I fully support the objectives of the HSE Medicines Management Programme.</p></reply>

High energy drinks will qualify as high sugar products under the criteria being used to define high sugar drinks.  Therefore their advertising, marketing, sponsorship and product placement will be covered by these new Codes.</p>  <p>  The Codes sit alongside and complement other voluntary and statutory measures intended to ensure the responsible marketing of food to the public.  These include the Broadcast Authority of Ireland General and Children&rsquo;s Commercial Communications Code and the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland Code of Standards for Advertising and Marketing Communications in Ireland.</p>  <p>  Finally, the Minister for Finance announced in Budget 2018 the introduction of a sugar tax, at a rate of 30 cent per litre on drinks with over eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres, along with a reduced rate of 20 cent per litre on drinks with between five and eight grams of sugar per 100 millilitres.  The rationale for the sugar tax is to reduce the consumption of drinks high in sugar such as high energy drinks.</p></reply>

The additional resources bring the budget for the provision of home support services to &euro;408 million.  The HSE's 2018 National Service Plan provides for a target of some 17.094 million home support hours to be provided to 50,500 people, which compares with last year's 16.34 million hours delivered to 50,000 people (home help and home care package funded hours combined).  This is an increase of 754,000 hours to 500 more people.  In addition 235 intensive home care packages will provide 360,000 home support hours for people with complex needs.</p>  <p>  Following the recent significant adverse weather the HSE provided about 350 extra Home Support Packages across 13 specific hospitals over a five week period.</p>  <p>  Despite this significant level of service provision, the demand for home support continues to grow.  It is important to note that the allocation of funding for home support across the system, though significant, is finite and services must therefore be delivered within the funding available.  In this context, I acknowledge that access to the service may take longer than we would like.  However, the HSE monitors the delivery of home support on an on-going basis, to ensure that activity is maximised relative to individual clients&rsquo; assessed care needs within the overall available resources for home support and having regard to demand throughout the year.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to promoting care in the community so that people can continue to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes for as long as possible.  To support this, we plan to establish a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home support services.  The Department is currently engaged in a detailed process to progress this.</p></reply>

Under Section 52 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by Section 12 of the Health (Amendment) Act 2013, a person who has been referred to a hospital for an in-patient service, including that provided on a day case basis, will have to pay the statutory daily charge, currently &euro;80 per day, up to a maximum of &euro;800 per year.  On this basis, where venesection is classed as a day case procedure and is not carried out in an out-patient setting, the public in-patient charge applies.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently considering the issue of the application of the public in-patient charge of &euro;80 for venesection in Acute Hospitals as well as broader issues in relation to the treatment of patients with Hereditary Haemochromatosis.</p>  <p>  The Deputy may be aware of the ongoing review of the General Medical Scheme and other publicly funded contracts involving GPs, and that discussions with GP representatives to progress this work are to commence in the coming weeks.  I expect that the issue of venesection services for patients with haemochromatosis will be considered in the context of the overall GP contract review process.</p></reply>

The quantum of services to be provided with that funding,  and the key service deliverables and priorities  for the Disabilities Services Programme for this year are outlined in the HSE&rsquo;S National Service Plan for 2018.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy&rsquo;s particular query in respect of waiting lists, service provision and service funding is as service matter for the HSE, I have asked the Executive to reply directly to the Deputy on this issue.</p>  <p>  In terms of the ratification of the United Nations&rsquo; Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (UNCRPD), it should be noted that the Convention and the Optional Protocol cover a broad range of commitments, some of which require substantive cultural change.  Work is continuing on the reforms needed for a high level of compliance with the Convention's requirements.  In the early implementation phase it is essential that resources are appropriately focussed in the enhancement of services needed for compliance with the Convention.  For this reason, a phased approach is seen as the most practical and realistic way of moving ahead.  Accordingly the Optional Protocol is not being ratified at this time but will be ratified as soon as possible, at the latest following completion of Ireland's first reporting cycle which will identify any actions needed with regard to compliance with the Convention.</p></reply>

There is no provision under the GMS GP contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.</p>  <p>  The HSE has advised GPs that where a blood test forms part of the investigation or necessary treatment of a patient&rsquo;s symptoms or conditions, this should be free of charge for patients who hold a medical card or GP visit card.  Notwithstanding this, I am aware that some GPs have begun to charge GMS patients for phlebotomy services in some circumstances.</p>  <p>  This is a matter of concern for me as it has long been the position, under successive Governments, that no user charges should apply to GP services provided to GMS and GP visit card patients.  If a patient who holds a medical card or GP visit card believes he or she has been incorrectly charged for routine phlebotomy services by his or her GP, then that patient may take the matter up with their HSE Local Health Office, who will investigate the complaint.</p>  <p>  If the local office determines that the charge was inappropriate, it will inform the HSE Primary Care Reimbursement Service who will arrange to refund the cost of the blood test to the patient and recoup this amount from the GP.  The local office will inform the GP of the decision to deduct the payment.</p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the Community Drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the Reimbursement List.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the IPHA agreement, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE). </p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I am keen to engage with Industry and to explore ways in which new medicines might be more easily introduced in Ireland.  However, any innovative approaches that may be tabled must be compatible with the statutory provisions which are in place and must also recognise the fundamental pricing/funding issues in the context of finite Exchequer resources.  </p>  <p>  I have indicated willingness to meet with MS Ireland and my office is in contact with the organisation to arrange a mutually convenient date.</p></reply>

Funding has been provided to support extension of the existing cath lab operating hours to 12 weekly sessions per week, or by 20%, as recommended in the Herity Report.  Recruitment efforts to support this service extension are ongoing.</p>  <p>  In the interim, a mobile cath lab service has also been provided.  The mobile cath lab was deployed in October 2017 for an initial period of 20 weeks and this was extended in February for another 10 weeks to allow further time for the recruitment effort.  As requested by the Minister, the Department has now requested proposals from the HSE on the continued deployment of the mobile cath lab.  A modular cath lab has also been proposed, as an interim solution pending the outcome of the National Review of Specialist Cardiac Services, and the Department of Health is currently examining this proposal at the Minister&rsquo;s request.  </p>  <p>  A national review of specialist cardiac services is underway, which aims to achieve optimal patient outcomes at population level with particular emphasis on the safety, quality and sustainability of the services that patients receive by establishing the need for an optimal configuration of a national adult cardiac service.  In terms of scope, the National Review will cover scheduled and unscheduled hospital-based services for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac disease in adults.  The Steering Group for the review held its first meeting on 31 January last.  As set out in the National Development Plan 2018-2027, investment in cardiac catheterisation laboratories and other cardiac services infrastructure nationally will be informed by the outcome of the National Review. </p></reply>

It is important to note that aspects of the primary care workforce were included within the scope of the review, where the key units of capacity were workforce-based.  This included GPs, practice nurses, public health nurses and a number of therapy professions. </p>  <p>  However, in parallel, a number of initiatives have been underway to enable robust and accurate workforce planning, including:   </p>  <p>  - The National Strategic Framework for Health and Social Care Workforce Planning, which was launched in November 2017, was developed alongside the Capacity Review.  This Framework will support an approach to workforce planning that will enable the recruitment and retention of the right mix of health workers, across the health system.  </p>  <p>  - Recently I launched &ldquo;A Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix  in General and Specialist Medical and Surgical Care Settings in Adult  Hospitals in Ireland&rdquo;.  This is a new plan to determine the number and  type of nurses needed in each hospital ward around the country. </p>  <p>  - Effective workforce planning and appropriate resourcing of health services will be a key enable of Sl&aacute;intecare reforms.  This will be addressed in the Sl&aacute;intecare Implementation Plan which I expect to bring to Government in May.</p>  <p>  These initiatives, in tandem with the findings of the capacity review, will provide a robust framework within which workforce planning and assessment can be undertaken on an ongoing basis.</p></reply>

However, I am pleased to say that there was a modest increase of 300 beds over the period 2013 to 2016 (or 2.5%).  A further 200 additional beds were opened this winter and more will open throughout 2018.  I am determined that we will continue to increase bed capacity over the coming years to tackle overcrowding in EDs and waiting times for procedures and to sustainably meet the needs of an aging and growing population.  </p>  <p>  The Capacity Review makes clear that we need additional capacity across nearly all areas of the health service over the next decade and we now have firm commitments in the National Development Plan for a coherent and substantial programme of capital investment in our hospital system and in the community.  We now have a fully funded capacity review which will see an extra 2,600 beds introduced in our hospitals in the coming years and 4,500 more community beds.  I am committed to front loading several hundred of these beds to ease pressure in our EDs next winter. </p></reply>

The Act specifies the criteria for decisions on the reimbursement of medicines.</p>  <p>  In line with the 2013 Act, if a company would like a medicine to be reimbursed by the HSE pursuant to the community drugs scheme, the company must first submit an application to the HSE to have the new medicine added to the reimbursement list.</p>  <p>  As outlined in the Framework Agreement with industry, and in line with the 2013 Act, the HSE will decide, within 180 days of receiving the application (or a longer period if further information is sought from the company), to either add the medicine to the reimbursement list or agree to reimburse it as a hospital medicine, or refuse to reimburse the medicine.</p>  <p>  HSE decisions on which medicines are reimbursed by the taxpayer are made on objective, scientific and economic grounds, on the advice of the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics (NCPE).</p>  <p>  The NCPE conducts health technology assessments (HTAs) for the HSE, and makes recommendations on reimbursement to assist HSE decisions.  The NCPE uses a decision framework to systematically assess whether a drug is cost-effective as a health intervention.</p>  <p>  The HSE strives to reach a decision in as timely a manner as possible.  However, because of the significant monies involved, it must ensure that the best price is achieved, as these commitments are often multi-million euro investments on an on-going basis.  This can lead to a protracted deliberation process.</p>  <p>  I have been informed by the HSE that they are currently assessing the following indication for reimbursement:  </p>  <p>  - KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a ≥ 1% TPS and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.  Patients with EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before receiving KEYTRUDA.</p>  <p>  The NCPE is currently conducting a HTA on this indication.  Once completed, the HSE will evaluate this application for reimbursement in line with the criteria laid out within the 2013 Act.</p></reply>

As with livestock farmers in Ireland the winter that has just passed and the current late and wet spring have put huge pressure on tillage farmers.  At this late stage the number of crop options has diminished significantly as we have passed the optimal sowing date for crops such as spring wheat, beans and oats.</p>  <p>  The introduction of Greening and specifically Crop Diversification places obligations on tillage farmers with between 10 and 30 ha to grow two crops, with the main crop not exceeding 75%.  For farmers with more than 30 ha three crops must be sown.  Again the main crop cannot exceed 75% and the two main crops cannot exceed 95%. </p>  <p>  My Department has put forward a strong case to the EU Commission seeking a derogation in relation to the Crop Diversification obligations for the 2018 scheme year.  We are confident that the case being made meets the relevant standards, as set out in the Regulations, for such an exemption.  </p>  <p>  Whilst formal approval from the EU Commission for the Irish derogation is now awaited, I believe that where alternative crop options are not available to allow farmers to be compliant with Crop Diversification rules, growers can make crop choices that best suit their current situation, even if this leaves them non-compliant with the Crop Diversification rules.</p>  <p>  My Department is in the process of adding some new functionality to the online application system to allow this derogation to be availed of.  For farmers and advisors who have already applied or who do so before the introduction of the new functionality, an amendment will have to be made to declare that the non-compliance in 2018 is due to the adverse weather conditions this spring.</p>  <p>  This exemption will assist tillage farmers and allow them to make the best of a difficult spring period.</p></reply>

I asked Teagasc from an early stage to work locally with affected farmers in areas with fodder difficulties and support them on fodder budgeting for the winter ahead. I prioritised the payment of farm supports to assist farmers with cash flow.  In this regard my Department has paid out over &euro;1.6bn to Irish farmers under Pillar I and Pillar II and will continue to make residual payments.</p>  <p>  As a further early intervention, and to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the issue of fodder availability in affected areas, I convened a fodder group chaired by Teagasc, and comprising of all the main stakeholders including feed merchants and co-ops, banking, farm bodies etc. </p>  <p>  I introduced a targeted &lsquo;Fodder Transport Support measure&rsquo; on 29 January 2018 to provide additional assistance to those livestock farmers in parts of the West and North West severely affected by on-going fodder shortages.  The main purpose of the measure was to support the cost of transporting fodder between those areas where it was plentiful and those where it was scarce. It is operated primarily through the Co-operative structure.</p>  <p>  The continuation of cold wet weather throughout March resulted in a serious delay to the onset of spring. Grass growth remained negligible, ground stayed wet and livestock had to remain housed in many cases.  This resulted in the fodder problem extending countrywide with a consequent tightening of fodder availability nationally.</p>  <p>  In response I extended the fodder transport measure to all counties and also introduced a Fodder Import Support Measure, to ensure that there was adequate fodder available to feed the national herd.  This measure was introduced on 5 April to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage (hay, silage, haylage etc.) from outside the island of Ireland.  Northern Ireland is excluded.  The measure is operated through Co-operatives and other importers approved by the Department . It covers fodder imported up to 30th April 2018. Support under the measure will substantially reduce the cost to farmers of imported fodder by approximately one third.  This initial allocation will support the importation of up to 20,000 tons of fodder into the country and this will be kept under on-going review until the current crisis is over.  Together these two measures address remaining issue around fodder availability. </p>  <p>  Root crops are not eligible under the Fodder Import Support Measure or Fodder Transport Support Measure.  Indications are that there are adequate quantities of eligible fodder being made available through importation and local trading to meet demand.</p>  <p>  In other supports, planning continues with a view to commencement of balancing payments under certain Pillar II schemes including the Sheep Welfare Scheme followed by the GLAS scheme in the near future.</p>  <p>  The GLAS Traditional Hay Meadow grazing date has been extended to 1 May 2018, and this makes available an additional 27,000 ha of grazing for livestock which would not otherwise be available.</p>  <p>  Furthermore, I have recently met with the CEO's of the main banks to discuss any cash flow issues arising from the recent bad weather and access to finance for the sector generally.  During these meetings I continued to stress that in the context of the current situation the banks should be flexible and put measures in place to support their customers.</p>  <p>  My officials are monitoring the fodder situation on a daily basis and engaging with all stakeholders in addressing the remaining challenges around fodder supply this spring.  Recent improvement in grass growth is rapidly improving the situation at farm level.  The next step will be to prevent this situation arising again, through supporting farmers to effectively plan and manage their grass and fodder supplies for the coming winters.</p></reply>

The PMG has met each month since September 2017 and has considered seven months of pricing data trends.  The PMG has indicated that, in the vast majority of cases to date, prices have remained stable.  The PMG noted in its latest statement (available at www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/news-and-media/press-releases/Pages/Statement-March-Findings-from-the-Household-Waste-Collection-Price-Monitoring-Group--Trend-shows-residential-waste-collecti.aspx) that situations arose during monitoring where office staff may have taken longer than expected to provide price details over the phone and in these scenarios, company websites were used to confirm prices. However, the PMG further noted that not all companies provide prices on their websites and that not all consumers will have internet access, or are comfortable with this mode of comparison.</p>  <p>  To conclude, the results from the PMG in conjunction with the study being undertaken by the CCPC, will provide an evidence base for future policy decisions in relation to the household waste market.​</p></reply>

A healthy and diverse media sector is critical to any democracy.</p>  <p>  I also recognise the financial difficulty that all broadcasters are facing.  As the Deputy will be aware, I obtained Government approval to proceed with the drafting of a number of legislative amendments to the Broadcasting Act, 2009 including amendment of the provisions of the Act relating to the broadcasting levy to alleviate the burden on broadcasters, and exempting community broadcasters from the levy altogether.  The proposals provide that a portion of the licence fee receipts will be paid to BAI to help defray their administrative costs.  This will reduce the overall levy to be paid by the sector and would be applied evenly across all broadcasters.  The amount of the reduction would be contingent on the overall level of licence fee receipts.</p>  <p>  The proposals also provide for the introduction of a new funding scheme to offer bursaries to journalists working in local or community radio stations.  In addition, I announced my intention to seek Government approval to remove hourly limits on advertising for commercial radio stations.  These measures will contribute to alleviating the financial challenges faced by broadcasters.</p></reply>

The scheme delivers a range of energy efficiency measures free of charge to low income households vulnerable to energy poverty, who meet the defined eligibility criteria.</p><p>I recently announced that the measures available under the scheme are being expanded to include dry lining and external wall insulation.  This will increase the number of households that can avail of the scheme.  Replacement windows may be offered in limited circumstances, most likely where external wall insulation is being carried out and the existing windows are very poor performing and need to be replaced to ensure the insulation performs effectively.  The changes will be introduced over the next two months and updates will be provided on SEAI&rsquo;' website shortly.</p><p>Eligibility for the Warmer Homes scheme is means tested, successful applicants must continue to meet the following criteria:</p><p>-  You must own and live in your own home</p><p>-  It must have been built and occupied before 2006</p><p>- You must receive one of the following:</p><p>-  Fuel Allowance as part of the National Fuel Scheme</p><p>-  Job Seekers Allowance for over six months and have a child under seven years of age</p><p>-  Family Income Supplement</p><p>-  One-Parent Family Payment</p><p>-  Domiciliary Care Allowance </p><p>My Department works with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection  (DEASP) on an on-going basis to ensure that the energy efficiency support programmes administered by SEAI are consistent with, and complementary to, the income support schemes offered by DEASP.  The eligibility criteria are kept under review, and there are no plans to expand the eligibility criteria at present. </p><p>SEAI will continue to operate a &lsquo;one home one visit&rsquo; rule for 2018. This has been the approach in order to ensure that as many eligible homes as possible receive an upgrade.  However, revisits will become possible in 2019.  This will mean that people who only had their attic insulated previously could become eligible for wall insulation.</p></reply>

In addition, a presentation was given to Cavan County Council by the Chief Geologist of the Exploration and Mining Division of my Department on 9 April at which members of the Cavan Mining Objection Group were present.</p>  <p>  In brief, in response to the points raised in the correspondence attached to the Deputy's question, I can confirm:</p>  <p>  -  To date, where minerals have been found and companies have purchased land, this has been agreed with the landowner.  There have been no instances to date where a landowner has been forced to sell their land.  In addition, to date, there have been no compulsory acquisitions of land for mining development.</p>  <p>  -  The text of my Department&rsquo;s letter to the Cavan Mining Objection Group, dated 28 September 2017, identified the environmental safeguards that have been put in place to guard against the possibility of any potential significant environmental impacts arising.  It is important to note that in the case of mining, the environmental assessments are carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>  <p>  -  It is noted that Ireland ranks highly in the Policy Perception Index (PPI) because of its robust and transparent regulatory system.  The transparency of the expectations with regard to adherence to licence conditions and protection of the environment provide clarity to any exploration company considering investment in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  -  The Directors of BMEx Ltd. carried out two site visits in the locality. Other than that, the data analysis and compilation has been desk-based.</p>  <p>  -  It should be noted that no application for mining has been made.  I reiterate that prospecting and exploration activities are non-intrusive and temporary in nature and environmental impact is minimal.</p>  <p>  The up-to-date position regarding these Prospecting Licences  is that BMEx Ltd. have carried out data compilation and geological mapping in the Prospecting Licence Areas, and as a result of this work they have downgraded the prospectivity of the project and have decided to prioritise exploration elsewhere.  The licences have been recently surrendered by the company.</p>  <p>  I trust this and all of the previous correspondence clarifies matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Subsequently, formal notification of the proposed acquisition was received by my Department on 21 November 2016. </p><p>After a period of examination by my Department, I received the Phase 1 examination report and recommendation by my officials regarding the proposed acquisition on 4 January 2017.  I then accepted the advice of my officials to refer the proposed acquisition to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for a full, or Phase 2, media merger examination and made my formal determination in that respect on 10 January 2017.  I also appointed an advisory panel to assist the Authority in its deliberations.</p><p>However, the media merger notification was withdrawn by the parties on 6 June 2017 and as a result of this I was not required to make a determination in this case.</p><p>The Phase 1 examination report was published, alongside the subsequent reports of the Broadcasting Authority and Advisory Panel, in July 2017.  In advance of publication and in the interests of fair procedures, both parties to the proposed acquisition were afforded the opportunity to examine the contents of the reports and to highlight commercially sensitive information, which was then omitted from the versions of the reports published on my Department's website. </p><p>Regarding the communications I have had with INM or its representatives since becoming Minister, as I have set out in my Statement to the D&aacute;il on the 18 April 2018, I received a phone call on 10 or 11 of November, 2016 from Eoghan &Oacute; Neachtain, Director of Public Affairs at Heneghan PR, who was representing INM at that time.  During this brief conversation Mr &Oacute; Neachtain informed me that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission had cleared the acquisition by INM of the Celtic Media Group, which I was not aware of.  I understand the CCPC published its decision on its website on November 10 2016.</p><p>I expressed a<font color="#004080">n </font>opinion that the likely course of action would be a referral to a Phase 2 examination, in accordance with the media merger guidelines and in light of the scale of the proposed acquisition, its geographical impact and the extent of ownership of regional media by INM.  I had not received any file on the proposed acquisition at that point.  I also clearly stated that this was not a definitive view and that I would be guided by the advice of my officials, as I had been in all previous media merger cases.</p><p>As also set out in my statement to the D&aacute;il, I briefly spoke with Mr. Leslie Buckley at a data summit in the RDS on 3 May 2017<font color="#004080">.  </font>I have also been interviewed on several occasions, either at doorsteps or at prearranged interviews, by representatives of INM and indeed the Celtic Media Group, where the question of the proposed acquisition by INM of Celtic Media Group was raised with me.</p></reply>

Today, almost 7 out of 10 of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland have access to high speed broadband.  Since this Government came into office almost 400,000 additional premises have access to high speed broadband.  This will increase to nearly 8 out of 10 premises by the end of this year and by 2020, 9 out of 10 premises will have access to a high speed broadband connection.  This is being achieved via a combination of commercial investment and a State led intervention.</p><p>In April 2017 I published an updated High Speed Broadband Map which is available at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>. This map shows the areas targeted by commercial operators to provide high speed broadband services and the areas that will be included in the State Intervention Area under the NBP. </p><p>The Map is colour coded and searchable by address/eircode:</p><p>-  The AMBER areas represent the target areas for the proposed State led Intervention under the NBP and are the subject of an ongoing procurement process.  </p><p>-  The BLUE represent those areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high speed broadband services.  </p><p>-  The LIGHT BLUE areas represent eir's commercial rural deployment plans to roll-out high speed broadband to 300,000 premises by the end of this year as part of a Commitment Agreement signed with me in April 2017. </p><p>In April 2017, I signed a Commitment Agreement with eir in relation to its plans to provide High speed broadband to 300,000 premises in rural areas on a commercial basis. eir has committed to completing the roll-out by the end of this year.  Information on eir's planned rural deployment is available at <i></i>.  A copy of the Commitment Agreement is available on my Department&rsquo;s website <i>www.dccae.gov.ie</i>. </p><p>There are just over 101,000 premises in Donegal.  Nearly 34,000 (33%) fall within the AMBER area and will be covered under the State led Intervention.  Some 56,500 (56%) of premises are in a BLUE area and fall to be covered by commercial providers, while 11,000 (11%) are LIGHT BLUE and fall to be covered by eir's planned rural deployment.  Individuals can check which category their premises falls into by going to my Department&rsquo;s website www.broadband.gov.ie and entering their eircode into the Map.</p><p>Quarterly updates on eir's rural deployment are published on this website. Since beginning their roll-out in Q4 2016, eir has passed a total of 121,000 premises, including some 15,000 in County Donegal. A further 11,000 premises remain to be passed in Donegal by the end of this year.  By the end of eir's deployment approximately 67% of Donegal's premises will have access to a high speed broadband service.</p><p>My Department is in a formal procurement process to select a company who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network in the State intervention area. That procurement process is now in its final stages.  My Department will engage with the successful bidder on the most efficient roll-out of the network.</p><p>In the interim, practical initiatives will continue to be addressed through the work of the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce to address obstacles and improve connectivity in respect of existing and future mobile phone and broadband services. </p><p>Under this Taskforce, engagement between telecommunications operators and local authorities through the Broadband Officers is continuing to strengthen.  These Broadband Officers are acting as single points of contact in local authorities for their communities.  The appointment of these officers is already reaping rewards in terms of ensuring a much greater degree of consistency in engagements with operators and clearing obstacles to developing infrastructure.  There is a link to a list of these local Broadband Officers on my Department's website.</p></reply>

Plastics feature across a wide range of applications and products, such as packaging, construction, electrics and electronics. The effects of plastic on the environment have been well publicised.</p>  <p>  In terms of plastic packaging, Repak, the producer responsibility scheme tasked with managing packing in Ireland, has been working with its members (including all the major retailers)  to identify ways to reduce or optimise packaging.  Repak members pay fees based on the amount of packaging they place on the market and this incentivises them to reduce packaging. </p>  <p>  A lot of work has been done by Repak members to prevent and minimise the amount of packaging they require. With the assistance of the EPA, Repak&rsquo;s Prevent and Save initiative has worked with Irish business to reduce packaging and to promote packaging improvements across industry. Under the initiative, specialist packaging technologists look for ways to optimise the packaging used and to minimise any resulting packaging waste.</p>  <p>  At European level, I recently wrote to the European Commissioner with responsibility for the environment to welcome the  recently published plastics strategy. I assured him Ireland fully embraced the ambitions of the new strategy. I asked the Commission to focus, in particular, on the most difficult non-recyclable plastics such as soft wrapping, film and single use items such as coffee cups and plastic straws. I am determined to make sure these products, if they come onto the market here or elsewhere in Europe, will be recycled or biodegradable and that they will not go into landfill sites.</p>  <p>  I am looking forward to the Commission proposing within the next month EU-wide actions to tackle single use plastic items.  I believe that working proactively with our European colleagues will achieve a major environmental benefit in a coordinated manner.</p></reply>

These reports set out a Party&rsquo;s historic and projected emissions, climate polices, measures taken and under consideration, and major policy developments in the reporting period.</p>  <p>  National Communications are submitted every four years, and form a significant part of this process. National Communications from developed country Parties (such as Ireland) include information on emissions and removals of greenhouse gases, policies and measures in place, vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, and education, training, and public awareness initiatives. Additionally, developed country Parties set out details of assistance provided to developing country Parties.</p>  <p>  In addition, developed countries submit Biennial Reports every two years. These reports outline the progress made towards the achievement of emissions reductions and the provision of financial, technology, and capacity-building support to non-developed countries. </p>  <p>  Parties were invited to submit their Seventh National Communications no later than 1 January 2018. Ireland advised the UNFCCC in December 2017 that this submission would be delayed, which was necessitated by a number of factors, including the desirability of taking account of recent policy developments and revisions to UNFCCC guidance on the preparation of National Communications. Ireland submitted its Seventh National Communication and Third Biennial Report to the UNFCCC on 30 March 2018.</p></reply>

Through a multi-agency approach by NTA, DCC, and TII working in conjunction with the various Public Transport Operators, the measures set out in the 2015 Study are being progressed so as to ensure that Dublin City transport system is capable of operating efficiently and reliably, with consistent journey times, and that it is facilitating the City's continued development and growth.</p>  <p>  In 2016, the NTA published its Transport Strategy for the GDA 2016-2035 which provides the overarching framework for the planning and delivery of transport infrastructure and services for Dublin over the next two decades. The measures proposed in the strategy are linked to an analysis of current and projected levels of travel demand across the region.</p>  <p>  Recent investment in public transport, allocated through the NTA was targeted to provide additional capacity and alternative choice for private car users. This included investment in new cycling routes and expansion of public bicycle share schemes, integrated ticketing and Real time passenger information (RTPI), renewal and expansion of the bus fleet, commencement of city centre rail re-signalling, opening of the Phoenix Park Tunnel, progressive and on-going introduction of city centre traffic management measures, reorganisation of bus services and the introduction of Luas Cross City.</p>  <p>  Budget 2018 provides for an increase in the multi-annual capital investment for public transport with a four-year capital envelope of &euro;2.7 billion over the period 2018-2021. The recently published National Development Plan (NDP), which was launched earlier this year by Government as part of Project Ireland 2040, also confirms a number of key investment priorities that will be delivered progressively and steadily over the short, medium and long term, to match transport demand, alleviate congestion and deliver a range of benefits over the next decade.</p>  <p>  As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. The National Transport Authority (NTA) has statutory responsibility for the development and implementation of public transport in the Greater Dublin Area.</p>  <p>  In light of the NTA's responsibility in the matters raised, I have referred the Deputy's question to the Authority for a more detailed reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.</p></reply>

Works on such roads are undertaken by local authorities using monies from own resources and these monies are supplemented by grants from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  In 2018 Department grants for regional and local roads increased by 29% from &euro;324m to &euro;417m.</p>  <p>  - Restoration Improvement monies (for strengthening works) have increased by 18% in 2018.</p>  <p>  - Restoration Maintenance monies (for surface dressing works) have increased by 17% in 2018.</p>  <p>  - An important new grant for Drainage works (overall &euro;10m) has been introduced.</p>  <p>  - Ring-fenced monies for Community Involvement Schemes (CIS) are being provided (overall &euro;10m).  Following an application process local authorities will be advised of their grant funding for CIS within a few weeks.</p>  <p>  In conjunction with local authorities the Department has set up the MapRoad system which allows road works and road condition to be recorded across the 94,000 km of regional and local roads.  This has facilitated the reporting of road condition across various classes of roads by NOAC.  Until steady state is achieved and progress is made on addressing the backlog there is likely to be a disimprovement in the ratings reported by NOAC.</p>  <p>  The 2018 regional and local road allocations were announced on the 29th January 2018 and all grant funding available to the Department in respect of regional and local roads has now been allocated.  It is therefore a matter for each Council to determine its priorities and decide its work programme on that basis, taking available grant funding and its own resources into account.</p></reply>

The introduction of the appeals process ensures that the SCP accords with the Department&rsquo;s Customer Action Plan, which commits to maintaining "a formalised, well publicised, accessible, transparent and simple to use system of appeal/review for customers who are dissatisfied with decisions in relation to service&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Each appeal submitted was assessed by an official not involved in the original assessment of that application.  All decisions on appeals were also reviewed by at least two more senior officials.  A total of 149 appeals were submitted and of these, 35 were upheld.  Appeals were accepted where the appellant demonstrated that the Department erred in its decision to make the application invalid, or where it was agreed that the Department's own guide to making an application was not sufficiently clear, or where it was felt the original decision involved an overly strict interpretation of the SCP terms and conditions.  More detail is contained in the review of the 2017 round of the SCP, which has been published on my Department's website (www.dttas.ie).</p>  <p>  All clubs with applications that remain invalid have been informed that they can resubmit their 2017 application, along with any corrected documentation to make their application valid for the next round of the SCP without the necessity of submitting a full new application.  I expect an announcement will be made shortly regarding when the new round of the programme will be open for applications.</p></reply>

The initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these monies is a matter for each local authority.</p>  <p>  Under the Strategic Grant Scheme, my Department gave a commitment in 2010 to provide grant assistance to Cork County Council in relation to the acquisition of land for the Carrigaline Western Relief Road.  The commitment to part fund land acquisition on this road has been met but no grant commitment was given in relation to the construction of the road.</p>  <p>  In the aftermath of the financial crisis there were major cutbacks in funding for the national, regional and local road network.  This resulted in the severe curtailment in funding for road improvement grant programmes, including the Strategic Grant Scheme, in order to focus available funding on maintenance and renewal work.</p>  <p>  The Building on Recovery Capital Plan 2016-2021 and the Capital Plan Review allocations mark a significant step forward in terms of restoring funding to the levels needed to maintain the road network in a &ldquo;steady state&rdquo; condition and allowing for some investment in road improvement schemes but it is going to take time for funding to build up to the required level.  For now funding will largely continue to support the maintenance of the regional and local road network.  While a limited number of improvement projects are scheduled to go ahead over the next few years, funding is not available to commit to additional schemes at this point.</p>  <p>  My Department is, however, liaising with Cork County Council with a view to positioning the project for development in the post-2021 period.</p></reply>

Sentiment in the industry both overseas and here at home is generally positive for the remainder of 2018.  Tourism Ireland&rsquo;s aim is to grow overseas tourism revenue by a further +5% this year and to increase the number of overseas visitors by 2%.</p>  <p>  The early signs are promising, with the CSO reporting in its Overseas Travel release that overseas trips to Ireland for the first two months of the year, at almost 1.2 million visits, were up 7.9% on 2017, as follows:</p>  <p>  - Visits from North America were up by 4.2%;</p>  <p>  - Visits from Mainland Europe were up by 17.6%;</p>  <p>  - Great Britain registered an increase of 4.0% in visits; and</p>  <p>  - Visits from the rest of the world (long-haul) decreased by 3.8%.</p>  <p>  While the data only covers two months and it is too early to predict how the rest of the year might fare, it is a welcome start which indicates that we are well placed to build further on the outstanding growth of recent years.</p>  <p>  The Government continues to offer strong support to the industry, as demonstrated most recently by F&aacute;ilte Ireland&rsquo;s launch of the new brand for the Midlands, Ireland&rsquo;s Hidden Heartlands.  This will enhance the Midlands as a tourism destination for both domestic and overseas visitors.  We have also invested an additional &euro;2 million in Tourism Ireland this year to support its digital marketing infrastructure.  This investment recognises the fact that we are operating in a hugely competitive international marketplace in which it is vital that we maintain a strong presence.</p>  <p>  Despite positive visitor numbers from Britain in early 2018, Brexit continues to be a concern for tourism.  I am aware that the tourism agencies are keeping a very close eye on developments in the British market.  Nevertheless, it highlights the importance of market diversification as we continue to attract greater numbers of visitors from European, North American and long-haul destinations.  The inaugural direct flights from China, due to commence in June, will be vital in exploiting the potential of this massive market.</p>  <p>  We cannot be complacent about continued growth in tourism.  We must aim to deliver growth which is sustainable, from an economic, social and environmental perspective.  This is something that we will be considering this year in the context of the Government&rsquo;s tourism policy.</p></reply>

As with other Departments and agencies across the State, my Department and its agencies are preparing for the different potential outcomes, including contingency planning for a &lsquo;no-deal&rsquo; scenario.  </p>  <p>  Irish ports and airports, and the airlines and shipping companies that use them, operate as independent commercial companies and planning and preparations in the context of Brexit are operational matters for each. Air and shipping services are market driven. </p>  <p>  In relation to shipping, in the past shipping operators have responded to economic developments and increased or reduced capacity in response to market demands. I am confident that shipping services can be expected to adapt to changing market demands and we have seen the evidence of this over recent months with the actual and planned increase in shipping capacity on direct routes to continental ports.</p>  <p>  However, a significant proportion of goods destined for EU markets use the UK landbridge to access these markets. The efficiency of these routes could be affected by Brexit, particularly if there are procedures and associated delays at UK ports or airports. The Irish Maritime Development Office, in conjunction with my Department, is currently finalising a study into the use of the UK landbridge by Irish importers and exporters. The purpose of this research is to establish the volume of traffic using the UK landbridge at present, the likely consequences that Brexit will have on landbridge usage and the various alternative options that may be viable. This research is expected to be completed shortly.</p>  <p>  In relation to infrastructural requirements, the Government&rsquo;s recently published Project Ireland 2040 recognises the role and infrastructural plans of ports and airports in supporting continued enhancement of Ireland&rsquo;s high-quality international connectivity. Key actions planned include a new runway for Dublin Airport, continued development of Cork and Shannon Airports, investment in Ireland West Airport Knock, and for smaller airports under the Regional Airports Programme. There will also be major development of Dublin, Cork, Shannon-Foynes and other ports, as well as investment in transport connectivity to ports. </p>  <p>  My Department inputs to the wider Government oversight and planning for Brexit. It remains in close contact with other Government Departments and agencies and with our ports and airports. As part of our Brexit planning, the Department held a stakeholder meeting with maritime stakeholders last month on the implications of Brexit for the maritime sector. It is also represented at meetings of a sub-group of the National Civil Aviation Development Forum, at which Brexit is a standing agenda item. This sub-group includes representatives from the airlines, airports, regulators and my Department and meets approximately every two months. </p>  <p>  My officials will continue to work with the maritime and aviation sectors and with other transport and tourism stakeholders in planning for the implications of Brexit.</p></reply>

BusConnects will be delivered by the National Transport Authority (NTA) and will initially address the transition of bus fleets operating within the Greater Dublin Area with potential expansion to other urban centres - towards new low-emission vehicle technologies. It is expected that by 2023, half of the bus fleet (approximately 500 buses) will be converted to low-emission vehicles, with plans for full conversion by 2030. </p>  <p>  My Department has also established a Green Public Transport Fund to support the uptake of energy-efficient technologies for PSO operators within the public transport sector; specifically, to support pilots, trials and demonstrations of emerging low emission technologies by covering the price differential between the cost of conventionally fuelled buses and the cost of an alternatively fuelled vehicle, as well as any associated refuelling or recharging infrastructure. I understand that the NTA intends to access this Fund before end 2018 to facilitate trials of a range of technologies in urban bus fleets.</p>  <p>  The NTA has recently undertaken a market consultation assessing a broad range of alternative fuels and technologies. My Department and the NTA will continue to work together with a view to determining the most suitable options for the Irish context.</p>  <p>  Equally, the importance of rail in providing an energy-efficient mode of transport has not been overlooked. Electrified rail use, in particular, is capable of achieving low emissions through utilising renewable sources of energy and considerable progress in projects such as the Luas Cross City has been achieved. This strong move towards electrification in the commuter rail sector which began with DART and was added to by LUAS will be reinforced and further developed through the new Metro Link and the Dart Expansion Programme set out in the National Development Plan. </p>  <p>  In addition, I recently established a new electric vehicle (EV) grant scheme to support the transition of the Taxi/Hackney/Limousine sector to EVs. This new initiative will help to stimulate the uptake of EVs in the SPSV industry by giving drivers up to &euro;7,000 towards the purchase of an EV.

Hotel bed occupancy nationally grew from 56% to 60% between 2016 and 2017 while the aggregated bed occupancy rate for other types of accommodation was significantly lower at 42%.</p>  <p>  Occupancy rates for hotels are considerably higher in Dublin and have increased as a result of the increased visitor numbers to Ireland in recent years.  This has led to capacity issues at times of peak demand.  However, a significant programme of hotel building is underway in Dublin to meet this demand.  In this regard, research commissioned by F&aacute;ilte Ireland shows that significant additional tourist accommodation stock, in the order of 5,500 rooms through new builds and extensions, is being brought on stream in Dublin, the bulk in 2018 and 2019. </p>  <p>  In response to consumer preferences and in order to boost the economic rationale for investment in hotel developments, F&aacute;ilte Ireland revised its hotel regulations. These changes make investment more attractive by allowing hotel operators provide more rooms per square metre and operate at a lower cost base, thereby improving hotel capacity, competitiveness and profitability.  Consumers benefit from increased room capacity, more competition and a wider range of accommodation. </p>  <p>  I am not aware of any issues with regard to the availability of restaurants.  However, I should point out that they are not required to register with F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  Given that the level of investment to enter the market is less challenging than that for hotels, I am confident that the market can respond sufficiently quickly to any changes in demand.</p>  <p>  Projected skills demands across the economy are being addressed through a combination of measures involving various key stakeholders.  I welcome the recent decision by the Minster for Business, Enterprise and Innovation to remove certain chef grades from the ineligible lists of Work Permits from non EEA.</p>  <p>  A Hospitality Skills Oversight Group, involving all relevant stakeholders, oversees skills development and promotion in the sector to ensure the skills needs are met.  Further specific queries the Deputy may have in relation to this group, should be directed to my colleague the Minister Business, Enterprise and Innovation.</p>  <p>  A suite of culinary apprenticeships is being developed and overseen by a collaborative consortium including education and training providers, F&aacute;ilte Ireland and other key industry stakeholders. The first of these apprenticeship programmes for commis chefs commenced in autumn 2017 in Educational and Training Boards in various locations around the country.</p>  <p>  The Tourism Action Plan 2018-2020, to be finalised shortly by the Tourism Leadership Group, will contain specific actions to address the demands of the tourism sector over the next number of years.</p>  <p>  F&aacute;ilte Ireland's 'Get Brexit Ready' programme offers a suite of industry supports, designed to help businesses struggling with the loss of trade created by Brexit.  The programme allows individual businesses to self-assess their exposures and risks and provides a range of interventions to help overcome any challenges arising from &ldquo;Brexit&rdquo;.</p>  <p>  Government measures such as reducing the VAT to 9% on tourism services, also helps the industry to further meet the demands of the tourism sector.</p></reply>

Accordingly, the introduction of an analogous body is not proposed at this time. </p>  <p>  However, as the Deputy knows, my Department is currently undertaking a wide-ranging review of the Child Care Act 1991, the principal legislation underpinning the child protection system. As part of this review, which is a commitment under Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures: The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014 &ndash; 2020, my officials will naturally take into account the developments and experiences of the child protection systems in other jurisdictions in Europe and beyond. All matters relevant to the situation of children in care will be considered in the context of the Review.</p>  <p>  It should also be noted that Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, already makes use of innovative methods to identify the appropriate intervention for children in need of help, including the use of Family welfare conferences (FWCs). Family welfare conferencing is a tool that harnesses the power of the extended family to create durable solutions for children and young people. With the support of an independent facilitator, FWCs enable families to make choices and to take ownership of a situation and its solutions. For example, in the case of relative foster care, a FWC might be used to ascertain the views of the child and their family on who in the extended family might be best placed to offer care to the child and thus lessen the impact and dislocation of entering care. Family Welfare Conferences are also an integral part of the Children Act 2001. The approach recognises the centrality of parental and family relationships and informal support networks in promoting the welfare of children and ensuring their safety, while enabling the Agency to meet its statutory and co-ordination functions.</p></reply>

This measure refines the development introduced last year, whereby three intake dates were adopted, and will increase the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to a potential duration of 76 weeks (two programme years). </p>  <p>  This new measure will address the situation whereby there was a wide range in the number of free preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash; between 61 and 88 weeks &ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children.</p>  <p>  This further enhancement delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers. The second year of ECCE required either an increase in the upper age limit for ECCE, or a reduction in the lower age limit. The latter was chosen and is consistent with the legislative requirement with regard to school start age. </p>  <p>  The number of entry points will revert to one at the beginning of the programme year (September). One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. This will also make it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p>  <p>  In the example cited by the Deputy the child will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2018 as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2018. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in September 2019, continue for a further year from September 2020 and commence school in September 2021.</p>  <p>  It must be noted that parents have the discretion to decide how much of ECCE to avail of for their child. A decision may be made to utilise one year only of the programme for various reasons.  For example, depending on the child's date of birth, parents may wish to send their child to school at 4 rather than 5 years of age.</p>  <p>  At a broader level, I announced on the 6th December 2017 that I have put a pause on the decision to remove the ECCE over age exemption so that further consultation with parents can occur. Until the consultation is complete, and both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills have time to consider its findings, the overage exemption will continue to be available. In practice, this means that my Department is continuing to accept and approve applications for the September 2018/2019 ECCE year.</p></reply>

Work is ongoing to address these matters. While we remain confident that these issues will be addressed, I can also confirm that the Department has approached the Department of Public Expenditure in order to put in place an interim solution.</p>  <p>  This interim solution consists of advising Tusla that, while discussions continue between the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to including foster carers under the General Indemnity Scheme operated by the State Claims Agency, no approval for overall indemnification can be provided at this stage. However, both Departments are aware of the critical importance of this matter and are committed to ensuring that every foster parent is offered an indemnity on an individual basis where required.  </p>  <p>  In this regard, any such individual indemnification would be on an ex-gratia basis and, as such, indemnification would be made available voluntarily and outside any strict legal obligation. This is a temporary measure to address immediate individual cases while the overall indemnification issues are being resolved.</p>  <p>  It might also be noted that the Irish Foster Care Association have been appraised of matters as they stand and my officials have undertaken to keep the Association informed as to progress in the matter.</p></reply>

The upper age ECCE requirement is that the child must not reach 5 years and 6 months before the end of the programme year.</p>  <p>  Some children will not be able to commence their ECCE in September 2018 as they will not have reached the age of 2 years and 8 months on or before 31st August 2018. However, they will be able to commence ECCE in September 2019, and continue for a further year from September 2020, commencing school in September 2021.  Parents of children born around this time of the year may prefer for their children to start school at 4 rather than 5. These parents may therefore choose to avail of 1 year of ECCE only. However, it is important to note that this is a parental choice and that the overall policy change has ensured that two programme years are available to all children, an improvement on the system as it has operated to date.  </p>  <p>  This extension to ECCE from September 2018 refines the development introduced last year, whereby three intake dates were adopted, and will increase the duration of each registered child on ECCE from a current average of 61 weeks, to an entitlement to 76 weeks (two programme years). This enhancement delivers fully on a commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government that is good for children, families and Early Years providers.</p>  <p>  This new measure will also address the situation where there was a wide range in the number of preschool weeks a child could avail of &ndash; between 61 and 88 weeks &ndash; and will ensure a programme that is equitable for all children.</p>  <p>  The number of entry points will revert to one at the beginning of the new programme year (September, 2018). One enrolment period at the start of the pre-school year will help streamline the administration process and will make it easier for childcare providers to operate and budget for the programme year. This will also make it easier for parents to secure places on the ECCE programme for their children.</p>  <p>  At a broader level, I announced on the 6th December 2017 that I have put a pause on the decision to remove the ECCE over age exemption so that further consultation with parents can occur. Until the consultation is complete, and both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills have time to consider its findings, the overage exemption will continue to be available. In practice, this means that my Department is continuing to accept and approve applications for the September 2018/2019 ECCE year.</p></reply>

A budget increase of &euro;5 per week per orphan, implemented from March 2018, brings the weekly rate to &euro;181 per orphan; the highest rate of weekly child income support paid by my Department.  </p>  <p>  My Department has a number of payments available to assist families with children, including &ndash; </p>  <p>  - Child  Benefit, a universal payment made in respect of children aged under 18, payable monthly at the rate of &euro;140 per child; </p>  <p>  - Family Income Supplement, a means-tested payment income support for families where one or more adult is working. (Importantly, when establishing family means for the purpose of family income supplement, any payments received in respect of guardian&rsquo;s payment or child benefit are disregarded); </p>  <p>  - Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance, an annual payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when children start school each autumn.  The allowance is paid at the rate of &euro;125 for children aged 4 to 11 and &euro;250 for children aged 12 or over attending secondary school.  Any payments received in respect of guardian&rsquo;s payment or child benefit are disregarded in determining household income for eligibility purposes; and </p>  <p>  - Supplementary Welfare Allowance which includes payments to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  </p>  <p>  While the aim of Guardian&rsquo;s Payments is to meet income support needs, it is acknowledged that the supports required by some orphans and guardians may extend beyond that of income support and additional family support services may be required.  Under the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, &ldquo;National Policy Framework for Children and Young People, 2014-2020 &ndash; Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures&rdquo;, responsibility for supporting and promoting the development, welfare and protection of children and the provision of family support services lies with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  </p>  <p>  The Guardian&rsquo;s Payments scheme was last reviewed in 2011 and there are no plans to conduct a further review at this time.  Although neither my predecessor nor I have formally met with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs or the Minister for Health on the matter to date, the feasibility of extending further (non-financial) supports to those in receipt of Guardian&rsquo;s payment is under consideration by officials of my Department and the Department of Children &amp;amp; Youth Affairs.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies these matters for the Deputy.</p></reply>

Once a person is registered to SAFE2 they can be issued with a Public Services Card (PSC). </p>  <p>  While it is a matter for each public service provider to determine the appropriate level of identity verification required for each of its services, it is Government policy that SAFE 2 registration is required for access to services that need substantial proof of a person&rsquo;s identity.</p>  <p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently published the eGovernment Strategy 2017 &ndash; 2020 which lists a number of public services for which SAFE 2 registration will be required.  Others are likely to be listed in the future.  The transition plans, including communications, will be developed by the Departments/agencies concerned working with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer (OGCIO) in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  At present, a Public Services Card (PSC) cannot be requested by any public or private body or person not included as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in the legislation in the context of conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.  At this time there are no immediate plans to expand the range of specified bodies.  Any increase in the number of specified bodies would have to be provided for in legislation and consequently would have to undergo Oireachtas scrutiny prior to enactment. </p>  <p>  However, one of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable customers to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC. </p>  <p>  The proposed legislation would not change the number of specified bodies that can request the PSC.  It would simply give individuals the option to use their PSC if they wished, as proof of identity and/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.</p>  <p>  As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a non-Specified Body such as a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-Specified Bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.  Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity - this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - simply to view/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.  This measure would be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, this alternative approach would give power to the individual to control access to and use of their PSC rather than the organisation that they are dealing with.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

The Plan identifies a wide range of targeted actions and interventions to achieve the overall objective of reducing consistent poverty.  </p>  <p>  The headline target, Ireland&rsquo;s National Social Target for Poverty Reduction (NSTPR) is to reduce the number of people in consistent poverty to 4% by 2016 (interim target) and to 2% or less by 2020, from the 2010 baseline rate of 6.3%.  In addition, the Irish contribution to the Europe 2020 poverty target is to reduce by a minimum of 200,000 the population in 'combined poverty' (i.e. consistent poverty, at-risk-of-poverty or basic deprivation) between 2010 and 2020. My Department is currently reviewing NAPinclusion, with a view to developing an updated plan for future periods.  As part of this update, my Department is also reviewing the national social target for poverty reduction.  This review is being undertaken in consultation with relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  Under NAPinclusion, my Department engages in a number of activities to monitor progress on social inclusion and poverty reduction.  These include ongoing monitoring through the biennial Social Inclusion Report and the annual Social Inclusion Monitor, and engagement in stakeholder consultation with the community and voluntary sector and people experiencing poverty and social exclusion at the annual Social Inclusion Forum.  </p>  <p>  Data from the CSO Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC), which forms the basis for reporting in the Social Inclusion Monitor, indicate that consistent poverty rose sharply after 2010, to a peak of 9.1% in 2013.  The latest SILC 2016 data, released by the CSO in December 2017, indicate that this had reduced to 8.3%.  A reduction of 6 percentage points would therefore now be required to meet the 2020 poverty target.  The rate of combined poverty fell from 33.7% in 2015 (and from a peak of 38% in 2013) to 29.2% in 2016.  </p>  <p>  The National Reform Programme (NRP) forms part of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement in the European Semester process. It reports on a wide range of targeted policies and strategies in place to address the main challenges and imbalances Ireland faces including those identified in the annual Country Report published by the European Commission and Ireland&rsquo;s country specific recommendations (covering public finances; public investment and labour market participation; and sustainable resolution of non-performing loans).  The NRP also reports on progress towards meeting the targets for poverty reduction.  This reporting draws on the ongoing monitoring activities for NAPinclusion described above.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-24a.1547.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400087#WRDD04400"><p>The Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice (VPSJ) developed a model of a minimum income standard (MIS).  The MIS is defined by the VPSJ as &ldquo;the gross income a household needs in order to reach their minimum essential standard of living&rdquo;. </p>  <p>  The VPSJ&rsquo;s Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017 (MESL) is derived from a negotiated consensus, based on focus groups with representative households, and discussions with policy-makers and experts.  According to the VPSJ, it is a standard of living which meets an individual's / household's physical, psychological and social needs, calculated by identifying the goods and services required by different household types in order to meet these minimum needs.  The costs incorporate factors such as food, clothing, personal care, health, household goods, household services, communications, social inclusion, education, fuel, transport, personal costs, insurance, savings and contingencies.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that the MESL for welfare households assumes that households are eligible for a medical card, and as such, health and insurance costs are reduced accordingly, although the cost of over-the-counter medicines and prescription charges remain.  The model for pensioners assumes that the pensioners have the Free Travel pass and the Household Benefits package.  </p>  <p>The Minimum Income figures from the Minimum Essential Standard of Living 2017 (the latest publication available) finds that social welfare pensioners in urban areas have adequate levels of income.  This is the case for contributory and non-contributory pensioners, living alone and in a couple (Appendix 6A).</p>  <p>  For social welfare pensioners living in rural areas, the VPSJ finds adequate income levels for non-contributory and contributory pensioner couples.  However, it reports inadequate income levels for social welfare pensioners living alone (Appendix 7A).  Excluding housing costs (as housing supplements are separate to weekly social welfare payments), the weekly income gap is reported at &euro;32.65 for non-contributory pensioners living alone.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that, in Budget 2018, I announced a number of improvements for pensioners.  The maximum weekly rate of the State Pension Non-Contributory (SPNC) increased by &euro;5 per week in March, from &euro;227 per week to &euro;232 per week.  The fuel allowance season was extended by one week, from 26 to 27 weeks.  A Christmas Bonus of 85% was also paid in late 2017 &ndash; for a person on the maximum rate of SPNC, this was a payment of &euro;193.</p>  <p>  I am also introducing a new telephone support allowance of &euro;2.50 per week, which is directly targeted at people in these circumstances.  Payment of this allowance will commence in June and will be paid automatically to those who are in receipt of both the living alone increase and fuel allowance, i.e., pensioners and people with disabilities of limited means.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, since the publication of the report, Budget improvements have likely reduced the identified gap.  I look forward to the 2018 Minimum Essential Standard of Living report, which is due to be published in the coming months.</p></reply>

This is to ensure that the best use is made of all available resources with a view to providing an efficient service to those who rely on the schemes operated by the Department.</p>  <p>  At the end of March 2018 there were 77.96 full time equivalents (80 people) working in the Carer&rsquo;s Allowance section. In March 2017 there were 73.50 full time equivalents (77 people) working in the section. </p>  <p>  My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are made as quickly as possible. </p>  <p>  Before a decision can be made on entitlement to carer&rsquo;s allowance, evidence must be provided in respect of the care recipient&rsquo;s care requirement, the level of care the carer provides and the carer&rsquo;s means. In general, social welfare schemes with a number of complex qualifying conditions can take longer to process. This is compounded if the documentary evidence provided at initial application stage is incomplete or insufficient; this is often the case with carer&rsquo;s allowance applications. </p>  <p>  At the end of March 2018, the average waiting time for new carer's allowance (CA) applications was 19 weeks with 5,591 CA applications awaiting decision. The volume of CA applications on hands are also a consequence of a continued increased intake of claims with the number of applications for CA in 2017 26% higher than in 2015. </p>  <p>  A redesigned application form will be published shortly; this new form will allow carers to provide more information on the type and level of care they provide, with an aim to providing Deciding Officers with the information they need to expedite decisions on entitlement.</p>  <p>  My Department is constantly reviewing the staffing needs and the processes involved in Carer&rsquo;s Allowance, to improve the service available to customers availing of this scheme.</p></reply>

Both schemes provide significant support to individuals so that they can work up to 3 days a week and still retain access to a reduced jobseeker&rsquo;s payment.  The 2018 Estimates for my Department provide for expenditure this year on the jobseeker&rsquo;s schemes of &euro;2.17 billion.</p>  <p>  An Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Social Protection, gave a commitment at D&aacute;il report stage of the Social Welfare Bill 2016 that he would ask officials to examine the issue of jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and the treatment of part-time and seasonal workers, including those categorised as having a subsidiary employment.  My Department has completed a report on jobseekers benefit and the treatment of seasonal and part time workers which I am examining.  </p>  <p>  On 7th December 2017, I published the Employment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017 The Bill delivers on the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to tackle the problems caused by the increased casualisation of work and strengthen the regulation of precarious work.  The Bill completed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 15th February 2018 and Committee Stage is scheduled for 17th May next.</p>  <p>  This very important piece of legislation will improve the security and predictability of working hours for employees on insecure contracts and those working variable hours in all sectors of employment.</p>  <p>  My Department is currently collating data on jobseekers benefit recipients in subsidiary employment.

Branch Office managers operate on a contract for service and are independent contractors.</p>  <p>  Services are provided through the Branch Offices network in areas which are not directly served by a Department operated Intreo centre.  The Department wishes to ensure that the services provided by the Department&rsquo;s Intreo Centres and Branch Offices are aligned so that all customers nationwide are provided with broadly similar services.</p>  <p>  On foot of this, officials from my Department engaged in discussions with the Branch Managers Association (BMA), a representative group of Branch Managers who presented the views of its members under the chairmanship of an agreed facilitator regarding the Department&rsquo;s proposals for a new service delivery model.  </p>  <p>  Talks between the Department and the BMA concluded on 29th March.  Non-binding recommendations were issued by the facilitator to both parties on 4th April and I am happy to report that both sides have agreed to accept these recommendations. </p>  <p>  These recommendations, together with previous recommendations from the facilitator in December 2017 on the revised remuneration model, provide a framework within which Branch Office services will be delivered on behalf of the Department by Branch Managers.</p>  <p>  It considered that the new service delivery model for Branch Offices can be achieved under the current contract arrangements with Branch Managers and that there is therefore no requirement to conclude new contracts with existing branch managers. </p>  <p>  Letters to each individual Branch Manager are currently being drafted by my officials outlining the proposed remuneration and service delivery proposals and will be issued shortly.</p>  <p>  I trust that this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2018-04-24a.1570.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1338" speakername="Regina Doherty" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2018042400088#WREE01100"><p>At present, a Public Services Card (PSC) cannot be requested by any public or private body or person not included as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 (as amended).  The Central Bank is not prescribed as a Specified Body under Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, so therefore cannot ask for or accept the Public Services Card as a proof of identification.  The PSC can only be used by public bodies specified in the legislation in the context of conducting a public transaction with the person concerned.  At this time there are no immediate plans to expand the range of specified bodies.  Any increase in the number of specified bodies would have to be provided for in legislation and consequently would have to undergo Oireachtas scrutiny prior to enactment. </p>  <p>  However, one of the provisions set out in Section 5 of the Social Welfare, Pensions, and Civil Registration Bill 2017 would, if enacted, enable customers to volunteer their PSC where they wish to use it as a form of proof of identity and/or age.  However, it is important to note that a non-specified body could not request or demand the production of a PSC. </p>  <p>  The proposed legislation would not change the number of specified bodies that can request the PSC.  It would simply give individuals the option to use their PSC if they wished, as proof of identity and/or age, in transactions with non-specified bodies.</p>  <p>  As the law currently stands, even if a card holder volunteers their PSC, a non-Specified Body such as a private sector organisation would be committing an offence by accepting it.  Customer feedback is that they should be allowed to volunteer the card to non-Specified Bodies if it suits them to do so, for the purposes of ID verification such as when signing up to a utility company contract or opening an account with a financial institution.  Customers often report that private companies insist on a State-issued photographic ID such as a Passport or Driver&rsquo;s License which they might not have and which are costly.  In contrast, the PSC is free of charge.   Furthermore, and for the sake of absolute clarity - this proposal in no way allows a private sector body to access the customer data on the card chip or on any government database - simply to view/accept the card as a form of identity and to stop it being an offence for them to accept it.  This measure would be beneficial to holders of the PSC, most especially those who do not hold a driving licence or a passport.  </p>  <p>  Additionally, this alternative approach would give power to the individual to control access to and use of their PSC rather than the organisation that they are dealing with.</p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

It requires the publication of a national low carbon transition and mitigation plan every five years and my Department is required to identify and develop sectoral mitigation measures for the built environment. </p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s National Mitigation Plan published in 2017 takes account of measures to be implemented in the buildings sector required to meet the EU's energy related targets.  These measures take into account European and International climate change targets, including the Paris climate commitments referred to.  </p>  <p>  My Department has lead responsibility for implementing the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.  This Directive sets the requirements at an EU level for Member States to improve the energy performance of buildings and to make an important contribution to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  Article 9(1) of the Directive requires Member States to ensure that by 31 December 2020, all new buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. </p>  <p>  The Directive defines a Nearly Zero Energy Building, or &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo;, as a building that has a very high energy performance and that the nearly zero or very low amount of energy required should be covered to a very significant extent by energy from renewable sources, including energy from renewable sources produced on-site or nearby.  This definition was incorporated in the Building Regulations 1997 &ndash; 2017 last year through the Building Regulations (Amendment) Regulations 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department has progressively updated Part L of the Building Regulations, relating to the Conservation of Fuel and Energy in Dwellings, over the last decade in order to improve the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance of all new dwellings to achieve these &ldquo;NZEB&rdquo; performance levels.  These incremental improvements have effectively eased the transition and minimized the additional effort required to achieve the NZEB performance for dwellings.</p>  <p>  In 2007, Part L was revised to achieve a 40% improvement in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 performance levels for new dwellings and, in addition, a mandatory renewables requirement for new dwellings was also introduced.  This review also introduced a requirement that new and replacement fossil fuel boilers should be energy efficient condensing boilers, where practical. </p>  <p>  In 2011, Part L of the Building Regulations was further revised to achieve an improvement of 60% in the energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standard for all new dwellings.</p>  <p>  In addition, I have recently published a public consultation on further improvements to Part L of the Building Regulations to achieve the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive NZEB performance requirements.  This review when implemented will represent an improvement of 70% in energy and carbon dioxide emissions performance over 2005 standards for all new dwellings commencing construction from early 2019, subject to transition arrangements. </p>  <p>  Currently 98% of all new dwellings are built to an A3 standard based on Building Energy Rating (BER) data as reported by SEAI in their recent &ldquo;Energy in the Residential Sector&rdquo; 2018 report.</p>  <p>  The new Part L performance requirement will equate to a typical new dwelling having a Building Energy Rating or BER of A2.  The amended Part L Building Regulations will stipulate that new dwellings can achieve the new standards by making provision for: - </p>  <p>  - A 70% improvement in energy efficiency for new dwellings (relative to 2005 base year standards).</p>  <p>  - A 70% reduction in CO2   emissions (again relative to the 2005 base year standards).</p>  <p>  - Providing for 20% renewables as a percentage of total building energy use.</p>  <p>  These requirements make it more attractive for builders and homeowners to further incorporate renewable technologies and move away from traditional fossil fuels. </p>  <p>  It is estimated that the cumulative improvements to regulations mean that a dwelling built to the 2011 regulations would require 90% less energy than the equivalent dwelling built in 1978 to deliver the same standards of heat, hot water and light.  Very significant progress has, therefore, been made in this area, even before the new initiatives outlined above.   </p>  <p>  The move from fossil fuels to renewable energy for space heating is expected to continue as a result of the further improvements to Part L currently at public consultation, contributing significantly to meeting Ireland's climate change commitments.</p></reply>

Funding of &euro;200 million was originally provided under LIHAF, of which &euro;150 million is funded by the Exchequer and local authorities fund &euro;50 million.  Further funding was made available as part of Budget 2018, bringing the total fund to &euro;266 million and there will be a second call for proposals in order to allocate the additional funds.</p><p>To date, I have given final approval for 30 projects under LIHAF, which will activate supply of almost 20,000 housing units and grant agreements in respect of those projects have been signed.  The cost of these projects is &euro;195.7 million, of which &euro;146.7 million will be funded by my Department and &euro;49 million will be funded by local authorities. </p><p>Funding of &euro;1.6 million was drawn down in respect of LIHAF projects in 2017, which was mainly in respect of design costs.

I expect the results of this review to be available for publication in late Summer 2018.</p>  <p>  The Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011 prescribe maximum net income limits for eligibility for social housing support for each local authority, in different bands according to the area, with income being defined and assessed according to a standard Household Means Policy, published by my Department.  The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band are based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country.  The limits also reflect a blanket increase of &euro;5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn and thereby promote sustainable communities.</p>  <p>  Under the Household Means Policy, which applies in all local authorities, net income for social housing assessment is defined as gross household income less income tax, PRSI and the universal social charge.  Most payments received from the Department of Social Protection are assessable.  The policy provides for a range of income that can be disregarded in terms of housing assessment and local authorities have discretion to decide to disregard income that is temporary, short-term or once off in nature.</p></reply>

The Place Finder Service has been successfully utilised by the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive (DRHE) across the Dublin local authorities since February 2015, with more than 2,000 households currently being supported by the Homeless HAP scheme.  A similar service began operating in Cork City in 2017. </p>  <p>  In order to further assist homeless households in exiting emergency accommodation, since January 2018, the Homeless HAP Place Finder Service can now be made available in each of the 31 local authority areas.  All local authorities are now being provided with the options to pay deposits and advance rental payments for any households in emergency homeless accommodation, in order to secure accommodation via the HAP scheme. </p>  <p>  To qualify for these specific additional supports available to homeless households, a household must have been determined by the relevant local authority to be homeless within the meaning of section 2 of the Housing Act 1988.  The operation of local homeless services, including the Place Finder Service, is a matter for each local authority.</p>  <p>  My Department collates quarterly regional performance reports from lead local authorities.  These reports show that 1,997 individuals exited homelessness through Homeless HAP tenancies in 2017; of these, 1,171 secured their tenancies prior to entering emergency accommodation, and are therefore classified as preventative interventions, with the remaining 528 related to households exiting emergency accommodation.</p></reply>
