Pre-qualification of contractors for this project had first been conducted by the design team in April 2015.  Due to the passage of time since then the design team was concerned about the possibility of legal challenges at tender stage and sought advice from the Office of Government Procurement on the matter.  The advice was that it would be prudent to run the pre-qualification process again.  My Department concurred with this advice and requested the Design Team to conduct a second pre-qualification process.</p>  <p>The pre-qualification process was concluded earlier this month and Invitations to Tender issued to 6 qualified contractors on 9 June 2017.  As a result of a technical issue which has emerged in recent days, relating to holidays in Northern Ireland and the fact that 4 of the 6 preferred tenderers are based in Northern Ireland, the deadline for return of tenders will be extended by two weeks to 28 July.</p>  <p>  However, this will result in no change to the overall target for delivery of this project as the design team will be instructed to make up this two weeks in the period of processing and assessing the tender.</p>  <p>  Subject to no further issues arising it is now anticipated that construction will commence in late 2017 and the project is, as previously advised, expected to take approximately 18 months to complete.  </p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2017-07-06a.10.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1351" speakername="John Halligan" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2017070600057#WRA00900"><p>In January this year we launched the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Action Plan for Education commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period.</p>  <p>  Last year we saw the first of the new apprenticeships developed by the Apprenticeship Council with the launch of the Insurance Practitioner and the Industrial Electrical Engineer apprenticeships.  Last month three further new apprenticeships got underway, two in the medical devices area and a polymer processing apprenticeship.  Subject to successful validation, a further ten programmes are scheduled to get underway later this year in various sectors including hospitality, accounting and financial services.</p>  <p>  A key commitment set out in the Plan for this year was the issuing of a second call for proposals to refresh the pipeline of proposals already established through the first call.  The second call issued on 4 May and will remain open until 1 September.</p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, registrations in the craft trades are rising as the employment and economic situation improves.  In 2016 there were 3,742 registrations which represents a significant recovery since the crash.  This year the upward trend continues with registrations at the end of June of 2,200 which is almost 40% ahead of the same period in 2016.  Registrations in the craft trades are predicted to grow to 5,587 over the period to 2020.</p>  <p>  A steering group, chaired by SOLAS with representatives from all key stakeholders, has recently been established to examine ways of relaunching existing traineeships and also developing new career traineeships.  To date six new traineeships have been developed.</p>  <p>  A lot has been learned in the expansion project and I am confident that we now have a clear process with strong governance to allow the efficient development of new apprenticeships and traineeships. </p></reply>

The process spans the curriculum in schools, whole school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional support for teachers.  It also involves other supports such as educational psychological services and the interface with other agencies, both nationally and locally.</p><p>All primary initial teacher education programmes include psychology of education, sociology of education and curricular studies including the implementation of the Social, Personal and Health Education (SPHE) curriculum which is taught at all class levels.  The SPHE curriculum provides particular opportunities to foster the personal development, well-being, and social and emotional health of the individual child.</p><p>To support schools, my Department has produced and distributed the <i>Well-Being in Primary Schools: Guidelines for Mental Health Promotion and Suicide Prevention </i>(2015). These guidelines are informed by consultation with key Education and Health partners, and by current research. They assist schools and the school community in (a) supporting and responding to the mental health and well-being needs of our children and (b) in providing a safe and supportive environment for building life skills and resilience and a strong sense of connectedness to school.  My Department&rsquo;s National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) is actively assisting schools and school communities in this regard.</p><p>Professional development services are provided by my Department to support teachers in addressing and dealing with mental health issues.  These services provide support across a continuum: from whole-school and classroom level, to support for some children and support for a few children.  At primary level, continuing professional development is provided through:</p><p>- The National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) which provides guidance for schools in managing and responding to critical incidents; and training in the delivery by teachers of programmes, including the <i>Incredible Years</i>programme, which aims to prevent and treat young children's behaviour problems and promote their social, emotional, and academic competence;</p><p>- The Professional Development Service for Teachers provides professional development support to teachers and schools to develop and promote student health and well-being, including mental health, in the context of a positive health promoting school environment.  In 2016, there were 8, 535 CPD engagements with teachers in this area through seminars, workshops and in school support;</p><p>- The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Support Service, will support teachers in addressing the needs of pupils with special educational needs, including needs which relate to their mental health;</p><p>- Supports are also provided through the Association of Teachers&rsquo; Education Centres in Ireland (ATECI) summer courses, the Irish Primary Principals Network (IPPN), the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) and the Centre for School Leadership. </p><p>A key theme of my Department&rsquo;s 2017 Action Plan for Education is the support of well-being initiatives to ensure that mental resilience and personal well-being are integral parts of the education and training system.  Specifically, the Plan commits to the commencement of the roll-out of the Friends for Life programme and the Incredible Years Classroom Management programme to teachers in all DEIS schools.  NEPS will deliver both programmes commencing in the autumn and are currently in the process of recruiting an additional 11 psychologist staff to undertake this work.</p><p>It is planned that during the coming academic year, some 40 Friends programmes will be organised involving some 1,000 primary and post-primary teachers and 50 Incredible Years programmes will be offered to some 1,000 primary school teachers at the commencement of a three year roll-out of the training.</p></reply>

It also contains a commitment to examine the adequacy of the present policies and provision, and their scope for improvement, particularly in relation to speech and language difficulties and early intervention.</p>  <p>  As Speech and Language Therapists are currently employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE), officials at my Department are engaging with colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to review the existing level of Speech and language therapy provision and to conduct an audit of services nationally.</p>  <p>  The review is being overseen by the Interdepartmental Cross Sectoral team which has a role to coordinate and integrate the provision of health and educational services.</p>  <p>At the Cross-Sectoral Team meeting of 24 May last, the HSE informed the group that it has reviewed the provision of Speech and Language Therapy services and that the report of the national group was completed at the end of March. </p>  <p>  The report is currently being considered by the National Directors for Primary Care and for Social Care and it is expected that this report will be circulated as soon as possible thereafter.</p>  <p>  The review of existing services will guide the implementation of the Programme for Government commitment.</p>  <p>  Pending the development of any new speech and language therapy delivery model my Department continues to provide an extensive range of supports for pupils with Specific Speech and Language Disorder (SSLD), through the provision of special classes for pupils with SSLD in primary schools, and through additional Special Educational Needs teaching supports provided to all schools.</p></reply>

The relationship between teachers and private providers of education is based on a private contract.  Issues relating to working conditions are a matter between the two parties and do not come under the remit of my Department.</p>  <p>  There is an extensive range of legislation in Ireland which protects the employment rights of workers, including English language teachers, in relation to employment contracts, payment of wages and related matters.  It is the responsibility of the employer in the first instance to ensure that their employees receive their employment rights.  Where an employee considers that their rights have been breached they may bring a claim under the appropriate legislation to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The Workplace Relations Commission is also responsible for monitoring a range of employment rights through its Inspection Service.</p>  <p>  A core component of the Government's future policy for the English language sector will be the introduction of the International Education Mark (IEM).  It is the intention that the regulations governing the IEM will include a requirement that all obligations concerning national employment legislation are complied with by education and training providers seeking to access the Mark.</p>  <p>  The necessary legislation to facilitate the introduction of the IEM is being progressed by my Department.  This legislation will also provide Quality and Qualifications Ireland, who will manage the IEM, with additional powers to examine the bona fides of providers, including English language providers.  </p></reply>

The Fund stands outside the EU multiannual financial framework and the Cohesion Fund, drawing from savings across the EU budget, subject to a maximum annual amount of &euro;150m.</p>  <p>  To be eligible for assistance there must be at least 500 redundancies in a specific company (including suppliers/downstream producers) in a 4 month period, or at least 500 redundancies in a specific sector in a 9 month period.  The threshold number of redundancies was originally set at 1,000, however this was reduced to the current 500 threshold as part of EU Member States negotiations on revisions to the EGF in 2009.</p>  <p>  Under the current EGF Regulation, workers made redundant from small companies can be included in EGF programmes in a number of ways.</p>  <p>  Company specific EGF applications can include small businesses and self-employed persons whose activity has ceased, provided that it can be demonstrated that their activity was dependent on the specific company concerned (i.e. they were a supplier or downstream producer of the company). Sectoral EGF applications can include small businesses and self-employed persons who were operating in the relevant economic sector.</p>  <p>  In small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances, applications can be made where the minimum threshold number of redundancies is not entirely met and the Member State can substantiate that there is a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy.  Cases approved on exceptional circumstances grounds cannot exceed 15% of the total EGF annual budget.  A number of Irish EGF applications have been approved on exceptional circumstances grounds.</p></reply>

I would expect the Congregation to have given very careful consideration to all relevant issues, including the education needs of the current and future students of Clonkeen College.  The Congregation has also to balance that need with the need to complete its outstanding redress contribution.  After the publication of the Ryan report, the Congregation pledged to make a cash contribution of &euro;30 million to a fund to aid survivors of abuse and have contributed &euro;21.2 million to date.  The monies are paid into a fund to aid survivors, a lot of whom are advancing in years and require services supplemental to what the State can offer.</p>  <p>  I am not privy to the deliberations or to the debates within the Congregation that led to their decision to sell off these lands for property development.  I would be reasonably confident that there are other assets the Congregation could dispose of to realise its remaining redress contribution.</p>  <p>  The Congregation has recently written to me in regard to the wider issue of the transfer of ownership of its playing fields to the Edmund Rice Schools Trust (ERST).  Proposals in regard to its playing fields had been made to the Government in 2009 and counterproposals were made which were not accepted by the Congregation or ERST to which the playing fields are, I understand, currently licensed.

Special classes offer a supportive learning environment to students with ASD who are unable to access the curriculum in a mainstream class, even with support, for most or all of their school day.  Special classes are for students who have a recommendation for a special class placement in their professional reports.</p>  <p>  With regard to Kildare in particular there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the County. Of these, 520 students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and SNA support. </p>  <p>  322 students are attending 59 ASD special classes, including 6 early intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes.  A further 100 students with ASD are placed in 4 special schools. The number of ASD classes has increased in the area by 24% since the 2013/14 school year. </p>  <p>  The NCSE intend to open an additional 4 special classes in Kildare for the 2017/18 school year, consisting of 1 Primary ASD special class, 2 Post Primary ASD special classes and 1 Post Primary Moderate GLD special class.</p>  <p>  The NCSE has informed my Department that, in general, they are satisfied that there will be sufficient special class placements available to meet demand in Kildare for the forthcoming school year.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  </p>  <p>  During the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in the Select Committee last week I indicated that I intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, the Minister will have the power to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE.  Because this power will require a school to provide land or alter existing property I am of the view that the power should be with the Minister who can engage the patron or trustees and that there should be adequate safeguards to ensure people&rsquo;s rights are protected.</p></reply>

Schools will be front-loaded with resources to provide additional teaching support to all pupils who need such support. </p><p>The NCSE notified all schools of their special education teaching allocations for September 2017 on 7 March 2017.</p><p>The NCSE also published details of the appeals process on the NCSE website: . </p><p>Schools who wished to submit an appeal were asked to do so by March 31 2017. </p><p>Schools could appeal whether the data used to calculate their school profile was correct and complete and whether it was correctly applied in the calculation of their 2017/18 allocation.</p><p>DES Circulars 0013/2017 and 0014/2017 outline the basis on which the Education Research Centre determined the allocations for all schools.  </p><p>In advance of any submission of an appeal, schools were asked to read carefully the DES Circulars and in particular the relevant sections, which relate to the breakdown of the allocation, which may be under consideration for appeal.</p><p>The NCSE is now concluding the appeal process and it is hoped that decisions will issue to schools in the coming days. </p><p>The model will also allow for some additional provision for exceptional circumstances or where a school&rsquo;s enrolment levels increase very substantially prior to the next review of the model.</p><p>It is acknowledged that there are circumstances which may arise in schools, which fall outside the appeals process put in place by the NCSE in March 2017 (NCSE 03/2017) to support the new special education teaching model.  This includes circumstances where the school profile significantly changes following the allocation process e.g. a developing school where the net enrolment numbers significantly increase year on year.</p><p>Schools have recently been advised of the qualifying criteria for such allocations.  Schools who qualify for additional allocations on the grounds that they will receive additional developing posts in accordance with the primary and post primary staffing schedules for 2017, will also provisionally receive additional special education teaching allocations, less any retained element contained within their profiled allocation.</p><p>Schools which have qualified for additional allocations on the grounds of developing status will  be notified of these allocations.  </p><p>The National Council for Special Education will support schools in managing their special education teaching allocations in the first instance.  Only in very exceptional circumstances, where it can be demonstrated that the schools profile has changed very significantly since the allocation was made to the school, may an additional allocation of hours be made to the school. </p><p>Guidelines for schools on the organisation, deployment and use of their special education teachers to address the need of pupils with special educational needs have also now been published and are available on my Departments website.</p><p>The Guidelines will support schools to reflect on how they can review and manage their timetabling practices to ensure the timetable is sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of all pupils in their school who have special needs.  The Guidelines encourage schools to ensure they deploy their resources appropriately to meet the needs of all of the children in their school who require additional teaching support, including pupils with emerging needs, or new entrants. </p></reply>

Schools are very familiar with the Staffing Schedule process and know that fluctuations in enrolment may impact on staffing allocation year on year. </p>  <p>  A central aim of the DEIS Plan is to use available resources for maximum impact, in schools where there are high concentrations of pupils at risk of educational disadvantage.  As part of an overall goal of ensuring that additional resources are correctly matched to identified need, there are a number of specific actions in DEIS Plan 2017 to ensure that the optimal level of teaching resources is established as part of the DEIS Monitoring and Evaluation Framework.</p>  <p>  Pending the outcome of this work, which will inform future provision in this area, it would not be appropriate for me to make any commitment in relation to the staffing of DEIS schools.</p></reply>

As part of Budget 2014, SOLAS have ceased making payments to Institutes of Technology (IoTs) and apprentices pay the full pro rata Annual Student Contribution.  These arrangements mean that apprentices are treated the same, on a pro rata basis for the proportion of a full academic year they spend in IoTs, as full time students in terms of the annual student contribution.  Typically an apprenticeship block is one third of an academic year, meaning that most apprentices pay &euro;1,000 (one third of the full ASC of &euro;3,000) as their ASC for that period.</p>  <p>  However, unlike full time students, apprentices are paid a training allowance by SOLAS for phases of their training spent in IoTs.  This allowance ranges from &euro;293 to &euro;647 per week depending on the trade and phase of the apprenticeship programme.  This is the equivalent to their net take-home pay on the job, and is not subject to tax or PRSI. Such allowances are not available to students in the IoTs. </p>  <p>  As the employment and economic situation improves we continue to see strong growth in apprenticeship registrations.  At the end 2015, registrations were up 17% compared to the same period in 2014.  The upward trend continues with registrations at the end of 2016 of 3,821 a further 20% increase on 2015 registrations.</p></reply>

A previous Government reduced the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011.  This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%.  Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers. </p>  <p>  Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether.  However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. </p>  <p>  The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration for public servants to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers.  The agreements have, to date, restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale.  This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly needs such as enhanced service for children with special educational needs, for disadvantaged schools, for growing schools, for Higher Education and for apprenticeships.  </p>  <p>  As a result of these changes and taking into account the proposed pay measures under the Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020, the starting salary of a new teacher from 1 October 2020 onwards will be &euro;37,692.  If full equalisation was achieved the starting salary for a post-primary teacher from 1 October 2020 would be &euro;43,879 and for a primary teacher would be &euro;41,511.</p>  <p>  Further to the this newly recruited teachers benefit from the terms of the Ward circular which reduced the qualifying period for a CID and the removal of the career break and secondment categories of objective grounds which had previously prevented some teachers from gaining CIDs.  In addition to earlier permanency, other measures of benefit to newly recruited teachers include a revised sequence for the filling of posts to enable fixed-term and part-time teachers to gain permanent, full-time jobs more quickly and easier than before.</p>  <p>  It must be borne in mind that the pay reduction for post-2011 entrants to the public service applied to all public servants and not just teachers, and that any restoration of these measures in respect of teachers would be expected to be applied elsewhere across the public service. While I am not in a position to provide an estimate of the total cost of restoring all post-1 January 2011 entrants in all areas of the public service to the pre-2011 pay scale arrangements, I can say that in the case of education and training sector employees, including teachers, the estimated current full year cost would be in the order of &euro;85 million.  Clearly, the cost across the entire public service would be substantially higher.</p>  <p>  However there are other types of equality that we must also bear in mind, for example equality between public servants and people who work elsewhere or don&rsquo;t work at all.  It would also not be equal or fair for us to do unaffordable deals with particular groups of public servants that mean that we do not have the money left in the public purse to provide increases in social welfare payments for vulnerable groups, tax reductions for people at work, or investments in improvements in public services that people rely on.</p>  <p>  Any further negotiation on new entrant pay is a cross sectoral issue, not just an issue for the education sector.  The Government also supports the gradual, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation, having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>  <p>  Accordingly, the recently concluded draft Public Service Stability Agreement 2018-2020 includes a provision in relation to new entrants which states that an examination of the remaining salary scale issues in respect of post January 2011 recruits at entry grades covered by parties to the Agreement will be undertaken within 12 months of the commencement of the Agreement.</p></reply>

GMGY is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none.</p>  <p>  In Junior Infants to 2nd Class, the children follow the GMGY programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes.  There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme.  In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four week period during GMGY time according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents.  Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping.  In third to sixth class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together. Belief-specific teaching is integrated into GMGY for these classes.</p>  <p>  As noted in the research, the manner in which Community National Schools deliver belief-specific teaching in Junior Infants to second class is evolving.  The majority of CNS schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for a four week period each year, and instead all of the children learn about different religions and beliefs together.  I see merit in this approach.</p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is to commence a review of the patron&rsquo;s programme in Community National Schools for Junior Infants to second class, starting in September 2017.  I look forward to seeing the outcome of the review. </p></reply>

Following receipt of that submission, my Department authorised the Board of Management to instruct its Design Team to commence the pre-qualification process for the assessment of suitably qualified contractors to which the project can be tendered.  This authorisation was granted by my Department in order to expedite the tender process for this project by running the pre-qualification in tandem with the finalisation of Stage 2(b).  The Design Team has commenced this process and the closing date for the e-tenders advertisement was 19 June 2017.  The Design Team has informed my Department that it expects to complete its assessment of the pre-qualification submissions in the coming weeks and will then submit its report on the shortlist of contractors to my Department. </p>  <p>  Following examination of the Stage 2(b) Report, it became apparent that the submission was incomplete and some additional items which should have been included in the original submission, were requested by my Department.  A revised submission has been received which is currently under review.  Upon completion of the review of the revised 2(b) submission my Department will immediately revert to the school with a timeframe to proceed to tender and construction stage.</p>  <p>  The Stage 2(b) submission is an extremely vital part in the design process and is the final stage prior to the seeking of tenders for the construction of the school building.</p></reply>

In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The GIS uses data from a range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  My Department is currently in the process of completing demographic exercises nationwide.  This process is detailed and rigorous and will take some time to complete.  It is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced later in 2017.</p>  <p>  My Department's 6 Year Capital Programme prioritises building projects for areas where significant additional school places are required.

I referred the Expert Group report to the Joint Committee on Education and Skills for its consideration and in order to build political consensus on the most appropriate sustainable future funding model for higher education. I look forward to receiving the recommendations from the Joint Committee once they have concluded their consultation and engagement with relevant stakeholders. </p>  <p>  Following the publication of the Expert Group&rsquo;s report, I took immediate steps to increase funding for higher education to address, inter alia, rising demographics, with an additional &euro;36.5 million being secured in 2017. </p>  <p>  Provision is also being made in the Department&rsquo;s expenditure ceiling in 2018 and 2019 for further investment and, cumulatively, in the period 2017 &ndash; 2019, this represents an additional &euro;160 million Exchequer investment in higher education.  Elements of this multi-annual funding provision will continue to be directed at meeting the costs of demographic increases.  </p>  <p>  In addition, my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently exploring the potential for a proposed Exchequer-Employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training.  The proposal under consultation seeks to deliver up to an additional &euro;200m per annum by 2020 through an increase in the National Training Fund levy.</p>  <p>  In addition, the HEA is undertaking a review of the model for allocating recurrent grant funding to universities, institutes of technology and colleges.  This will ensure that the model by which funding is allocated to our Higher Education Institutes is as efficient, effective and responsive as possible.</p></reply>

This means that religion will not be used in admissions to 80% of schools, and in fact this is already the practice in most schools.</p><p>It is in the 20% other schools that this issue now needs to be addressed.  My preference is to remove the capacity for state-funded denominational primary schools, where they are oversubscribed, to use religion as a criteria in admissions process except, in three scenarios:</p><p>- where it would not otherwise be possible to maintain the ethos of the school;</p><p>- where the school is established by a minority religion, in order to ensure that students of that religion can find a school place in a school of that ethos;</p><p>- where the school is established by a minority religion, in order to admit a student of that religion who resides in a community consistently served by that school.</p><p>As I have said recently, my intention is to introduce more detailed proposals on this in the autumn, with a view to having them enacted by the end of 2017, depending on the process in the Oireachtas.</p><p>With regard to attending religious instruction, under the Constitution children have a right to attend school without attending religious instruction.  Parents therefore have a right to have their children opt out of religion classes and it is expected that this right will be upheld by schools on foot of a parental request.  This applies at both primary and post primary levels. </p><p>The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill includes a specific requirement that school enrolment policies must include details of the school&rsquo;s arrangements for any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  This is an important measure which will help ensure transparency from the outset as to how a school will uphold the rights of parents in this regard.</p><p>In terms of the practical arrangements by which schools ensure that the right to opt out of religion classes is accommodated, these are a matter for each individual school. </p><p>I am aware that on occasion there can be practical issues around supervision and arranging class times and these have to be considered by schools at local level and worked through in a pragmatic way.  Circumstances vary from school to school and from primary to post-primary.  The precise nature of the arrangements therefore have to be considered by each school having regards to the particular circumstances  in question including factors such as the numbers of children involved, the ages of those children and the availability of staff and physical space in the school concerned.</p><p>The Catholic Schools Partnership developed in 2015 a resource for Catholic schools entitled &lsquo;Catholic Primary Schools in a Changing Ireland: Sharing Good Practice on Inclusion of All Pupils&rsquo;.  It gives suggestions on developing polices and sharing best practice with regard to inclusion of all pupils and gives practical suggestions to schools in how to engage positively in inter-cultural dialogue.</p><p>In my view, the best way of dealing with this matter to the satisfaction of whole school community is by schools communicating with parents to ascertain what their wishes are in this regard.  As the Deputy may be aware, a key aspect of the Parents and Students Charter Bill concerns how schools communicate with parents and this may provide a more appropriate opportunity for dealing with this particular issue.</p></reply>

The Programme commits to bring the total number of NEPS psychologists to 238 from the current sanctioned limit of 173.  A recruitment process is currently underway to bring the numbers of NEPS Psychologists to currently approved numbers. </p>  <p>  The Programme also includes a commitment to introduce a new in-school Speech and Language Therapy service, creating stronger linkages between parents, teachers and Speech and Language Therapists.  The programme also commits to bring the number of Speech and Language Therapists up to 1,102 (a 25% increase).</p>  <p>  As Speech and Language Therapists are currently employed by the Health Service Executive (HSE), officials at my Department are currently engaging with colleagues in the Department of Health and the HSE to review the existing level of Speech and language therapy provision and to conduct an audit of services nationally.  The review of existing services will guide the implementation of the Programme for Government commitment.</p>  <p>  In line with the recommendations of the Focussed Policy Assessment of the SNA Scheme in 2016, the Government decided to proceed with a comprehensive assessment of the SNA Scheme, currently being undertaken by the NCSE, in consultation with other Departments and State Agencies, including the National Disability Authority, to identify the most appropriate form of support options to provide better outcomes for students with Special Educational Needs, having regard to the significant amount of State investment in this area.</p>  <p>  In response to a progress report from the NCSE on the comprehensive review, I have requested the National Council for Special Education to establish a working group, comprising relevant stakeholders, to assist in proposing an alternate and improved model for providing care supports so as to provide better outcomes for students with special educational needs who have additional care needs. </p>  <p>  This Working Group will commence its work upon its appointment and the work will run in tandem with the completion of the Comprehensive Review of the SNA Scheme.  It is intended that the reports of the Working group and of the Review will be completed early in 2018.</p>  <p>  In addition, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Policy Advice on Educational Provision for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders was published in July 2016.  The NCSE consulted widely with parents, professionals and other stakeholders and interested parties while also conducting research.  The Policy advice is available on the NCSEs website www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  My Department has convened an Implementation Group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and external representatives to ensure that the Report&rsquo;s recommendations are fully and appropriately considered and that a timetable for implementation is prepared.

Following receipt of that submission, my Department authorised the Board of Management to instruct its Design Team to commence the pre-qualification process for the assessment of suitably qualified contractors to which the project can be tendered.  This authorisation was granted by my Department in order to expedite the tender process for this project by running the pre-qualification in tandem with the finalisation of Stage 2(b).  The Design Team has commenced this process and the closing date for the e-tenders advertisement was 19 June 2017. The Design Team has informed my Department that it expects to complete its assessment of the pre-qualification submissions in the coming weeks and will then submit its report on the shortlist of contractors to my Department. </p>  <p>  Following examination of the Stage 2(b) Report, it became apparent that the submission was incomplete and some additional items which should have been included in the original submission, were requested by my Department.  A revised submission has been received which is currently under review.

This legislation gives the owners of copyright works, which includes musical works, certain rights over the use of their works.  If covered by copyright, the act of making the musical work available in public is a restricted act.  In the context of music, this applies on two levels: making available in public recorded music that is owned by record companies, including also the performers involved in the recording; separately, songwriters, composers and music publishers are entitled to copyright protection where their works are made available in public.  It is for this reason that premises such as those referred to by the Deputy need to be licensed for the use of musical recordings that are broadcast via radio, tv etc. and, separately for the public performance of live acts or recorded music on the premises.</p><p>The CRRA provides the means for copyright holders to engage with Collective Management Organisations to represent their rights in relation to the public use of their copyright protected works.  These organisations are responsible for the collection and distribution of royalties to their members and operate under licence obtained from the Controller of Patents, Designs &amp;amp; Trade Marks, which licence is renewable annually.</p><p>The Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO) is a collecting organisation that operates as a licensed body under the CRRA and it represents the rights of its members i.e. songwriters, composers and music publishers in Ireland.  Music users such as broadcasters, licensed premises where music is played etc. are required by law to pay for the use of copyright music.  Phonographic Performance Ireland (PPI) is also a licensed body under the CRRA that represents the rights of record companies and performers.</p><p>IMRO, through an agency arrangement with PPI, introduced a new system of music licensing for business.  This new system of &lsquo;dual licensing&rsquo; came into effect on 1 January 2016 with the intention of simplifying the licensing process for music users.  Under this new arrangement IMRO administers the granting of copyright music licences, collection of royalties, and related activities on behalf of both organisations.  The new arrangement enables business to obtain the appropriate copyright music licences by making a single payment.</p><p>As Minister, I do not have any function in the setting of tariffs charged by organisations representing the rights of copyright holders.  However, it is open to a person affected by such charges to refer a dispute in relation to a licensing scheme to the Controller of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks, who has certain statutory functions in this area under the CRRA. </p><p>Section 152 of the CRRA provides that where a dispute arises between the operator of a licensing scheme concerned with copyright works and a person claiming that he or she requires a licence under the scheme, that person or operator may refer the scheme to the Controller for determination. </p><p>The legislation provides the Controller with two options for dealing with the referral.  The Controller can consider the matter referred and make an order, confirming or varying the scheme.  Alternatively, the Controller may refer the matter to an arbitrator for consideration.  The procedures to be followed and fees payable in relation to references to the Controller are set out in the Copyright and Related Rights (Proceedings before the Controller) Rules 2009 (S.I. No. 20 of 2009).  </p><p>Both the CRRA and the Copyright and Related Rights (Proceedings before the Controller) Rules 2009 (S.I.

I understand further that the Minister asked the Deputy to provide details of the possible misuse and undertook to have the matter examined by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. </p>  <p>  From an employment rights point of view, Ireland has a comprehensive body of employment protection legislation designed to protect employees engaged under different types of employment arrangements.</p>  <p>  The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 provides that fixed-term employees may not be treated less favourably than comparable permanent employees, unless the employer can objectively justify the different treatment.  Less favourable treatment of a worker may be objectively justified if it is for the purpose of achieving a legitimate objective of the employer and such treatment is appropriate and necessary for that purpose.  However, any justification offered cannot be connected with the fact that the employee is on a fixed-term contract. </p>  <p>  The 2003 Act also establishes a framework to prevent abuses arising from the use of successive fixed-term employment contracts.  The Act provides that where an employee has been on two or more continuous fixed-term contracts, the total duration of those contracts may not exceed four years. After this, if the employer wishes to renew the employee&rsquo;s contract, it is deemed to be a contract of indefinite duration unless there are objective grounds justifying the renewal of the contract for a fixed term only. </p>  <p>  The Unfair Dismissal Act 1977 as amended contains a provision aimed at ensuring that successive temporary contracts are not used in order to avoid that legislation.  It provides that where a fixed-term or specified-purpose contract expires and the individual is re-employed within 3 months, the individual is deemed to have continuous service for the purposes of that Act. </p>  <p>  All employers, including those in the film industry, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law.  Where an individual believes they are being deprived of employment rights applicable to employees they may refer a complaint to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) where the matter can be dealt with by way of mediation or adjudication leading to a decision that is enforceable through the District Court.  WRC inspectors can also be asked to investigate certain breaches. Complaints can be made on a single complaint form available at the WRC&rsquo;s website www.workplacerelations.ie.  Should the Deputy be aware of specific cases where there are breaches of employment laws she may wish to contact the WRC directly. </p></reply>

Based on current data all regions are on target to meet or exceed the job targets set down to be delivered by 2020 in each regional action plan for jobs</p><p><b>Site Visits by County for Quarter 1 2017</b><table><tr><th>County</th><th>Q1 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Clare</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin</td><td>82</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>23</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Laois</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan </td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath </td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>173</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Free Trade Agreements which have concluded with the provisions are as follows:<table><tr><th>Free Trade Agreement</th><th>Conclusion of Negotiations</th><th>Signed</th><th>Date of Provisional Application/Date in force</th></tr><tr><td>South Korea</td><td>2009</td><td>2010</td><td>2011/2015</td></tr><tr><td>Columbia Peru</td><td>2010</td><td>2012</td><td>2013</td></tr><tr><td>Ecuador*</td><td>2014</td><td>2016</td><td>2017</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>2014</td><td>2016</td><td>Pending</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>2014</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td></tr><tr><td>Vietnam</td><td>2016</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td></tr></table></p><p>*Ecuador joined the EU-Columbia/Peru Free Trade Agreement on 11 November 2016.  The talks for a Trade Agreement were launched in January 2009 between the EU and Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In July 2009, Ecuador suspended its participation in the talks. Negotiations for an EU-Colombia/Peru Free Trade Agreement were concluded in March 2010, with the Agreement being provisionally applied as of March 2013 with Peru and August 2013 with Colombia.  In January 2014 Ecuador formally resumed negotiations, and these concluded in July 2014.</p><p>Since 2009 the European Union has also included dispute settlement mechanisms for investment disputes in free trade agreements. These agreements are as follows;<table><tr><th>Free Trade Agreement</th><th>Conclusion of Negotiations</th><th>Signed</th><th>Date of Provisional Application/Date in force</th></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>2014</td><td>2016</td><td>Pending</td></tr><tr><td>Singapore</td><td>2014</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td></tr><tr><td>Vietnam</td><td>2016</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td><td>Pending</td></tr></table></p><p>In late 2015, the Commission proposed a new approach to investment protection based on an international Investment Court System (ICS), to replace the historic Investor State Dispute Settlement system. The new system is an independent investment court system, consisting of a permanent tribunal and an appeal tribunal competent to review decisions of the tribunal. Dispute settlement proceedings will be conducted in a transparent and impartial manner.  Provisions for the application of such a system have been included in more recent FTAs.</p><p>The ultimate aim of the European Commission is to establish a multilateral court, modelled on arbitrator panels currently operating under the WTO, and other Investment Tribunals.  It will build on the EU's approach on its bilateral FTAs and be a major departure from the system of investor-to-State dispute settlement (ISDS) based on ad hoc commercial arbitration.  The recently concluded EU-Canada trade agreement (CETA) and the EU-Vietnam trade agreement both contain a reference to the establishment of a permanent multilateral investment court. Work continues at EU level on this matter.</p></reply>

In particular, the CCPC has concerns about the extent of competition in some areas, where consumers have little, if any, choice of waste collector. Specifically with regard to anti-competitive behaviour, a number of allegations have been received but with insufficient evidence to merit the CCPC opening formal investigations. </p>  <p>  The CCPC is being asked to report on the operation of the household waste collection market in order to inform the future development of national waste management policy before the end of 2017, which will provide an evidence base to establish a regulator to prevent price gouging.</p>  <p>  Issues relating to the tax status of waste collection companies do not come within the statutory remit of the CCPC.</p></reply>

Consequently, any such sale would not count as general government revenue. Accordingly, if any such proceeds are  used for general government expenditure at any time, the general government balance will worsen. </p>  <p>  In the first instance, the proceeds would go to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF).  Such proceeds can then be transferred on to the Exchequer if the Minister for Finance so directs.  If the money were to remain with the ISIF then it could be used as part of the ISIF's investment portfolio and must adhere to the ISIF&rsquo;s double bottom line mandate of a commercial return and economic impact.  The requirement to achieve a commercial return ensure that the investment does not impact the general government balance. </p>  <p>  If the proceeds are lodged to the Exchequer, then the NTMA will, in the normal course of events, take them into account in their funding plans and, all things being equal, it would result in Ireland&rsquo;s Exchequer borrowing requirement reducing and, consequently, Ireland&rsquo;s gross debt and debt to GDP ratio being reduced.</p>  <p>  A lower level of debt is not only beneficial in terms of the fiscal sustainability of the State but would also result in reduced interest payments in future years.  The strategy of reducing the national debt is consistent with the Government policy of repaying the borrowing previously undertaken to finance the recapitalisation of the banking sector during the financial crisis.  It is my view, therefore, that because public indebtedness rose partly due to the recapitalisation of the Banks, it is appropriate to use one-off revenue from divesting the State of its banking assets to reduce debt</p>  <p>  The rainy day fund is currently under review and further information will be provided in the Summer Economic Statement (SES) to be published shortly.  The possibility of lodging the proceeds of a sale to a rainy day fund, as suggested by the Deputy, would depend on the legislation establishing the fund.  </p></reply>

Ireland has a successful track record of competing for, and winning, global foreign direct investment.  One of the key pillars of that success is the growth of the International Financial Services (IFS) sector, in particular over the past 30 years. Ireland is now recognised internationally as a leading global centre for internationally traded financial services.</p>  <p>  In March 2015, the Government launched the lFS2020 Strategy, a whole-of-government approach to further driving the growth and development of the IFS sector in Ireland.  Implementation of the IFS2020 Strategy and the annual Action Plans is driven by a public sector High Level Implementation Committee (HLIC).  The Minister of State for Financial Services chairs quarterly meetings of the IFS2020 Joint Committee, comprising of members of the public sector HLIC and senior IFS industry representatives.  Brexit is a standing agenda item at these quarterly meetings. </p>  <p>  The Government is keen to maximise on opportunities that arise from Brexit where possible.  The IFS2020 Strategy, the long-term vision for international financial services, was developed and put in place long before the UK decision to leave the EU.  However, it provides a clear framework to maximise any opportunities that might arise from that decision particularly through the annual Action Plans.  The annual Action Plans enable a tailored response to deal with these challenges and opportunities as they arise.  The IFS2020 Strategy combines long-term strategic thinking with the flexible tools to react to any domestic and international developments occurring over the period. </p>  <p>  In January the IFS2020 Action Plan for 2017 was launched, the Action Plan has two sections, the first is a contextual piece in respect of Brexit, and the second section outlines the 40 specific measures to be actioned under the plan and the lead government departments, agencies or industry bodies who lead on each measure.  </p>  <p>  Also in January, the second annual European Financial Forum was held in Dublin Castle.  The forum, which was hosted by the then Minister of State Eoghan Murphy TD is designed to showcase Ireland's financial services offering to an international audience and highlight the Government's commitment to the development of international financial services in Ireland. </p>  <p>  The former Minister of State for Financial Services has undertaken a significant number of overseas visits to promote Ireland as a destination for financial services investment and launch the IFS Ireland banner brand.</p>  <p>  The IFS2020 strategy is on track to meet and possibly exceed its job target of 10,000 by 2020.  The first 2 years of the governments IFS 2020 strategy has seen consecutive years of net job gains consisting of approximately 2,500 net job gains in 2015 and 2,000 in 2016. </p>  <p>  While some companies have chosen their preferred post Brexit location many others have yet to make a final decision on their post Brexit strategy and associated location choice.  It is anticipated that many of these companies, particularly the large more complex entities requiring extended regulatory lead times will make their decision in the coming weeks and months.</p>  <p>  It is difficult to specify the potential outcome of these companies&rsquo; deliberations as all are closely monitoring the ongoing UK-EU Brexit discussions and with view to assessing the impact on their respective operations in the UK and across the EU.</p>  <p>  Various state actors including IDA Ireland, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland as a regulator are involved in detailed discussions with numerous companies positioning Ireland as their preferred Brexit location</p>  <p>  Over a dozen firms have indicated that Ireland is their preferred choice for their post Brexit operations.  In respect of relocations not every firm will want to make the relocation decision public for commercial and other reasons.  The State continues to engage with a substantial number of other firms who have yet to make their final decision.</p>  <p>  We have a very strong offering and we've done extensive work to promote that offering.  We are aware that not every decision will go our way. There will be an ebb and flow to this, and the flow to Ireland will be strong from decisions that have already been made in our favour.  Despite the many advantages that Ireland can offer firms moving operations from the UK to Ireland because of Brexit other factors could also determine their final relocation choices. </p></reply>

Under the EU VAT Directive 2006/112/EC it is not possible to introduce a zero rate of VAT on any good or service that had not already applied at the zero rate of VAT on and from 1 January 1991.  As the services of construction of residential property was not zero-rated for VAT purposes in Ireland on and from that date, the zero rate cannot now be applied the service.</p>  <p>  With regard to the application of the 9% VAT rate, it is tentatively estimated that introducing a 9% VAT rate specific to residential construction could cost in the region of &euro;240m.  This is based on an extrapolation from a number of data sources, including residential completions, residential construction projects under current development and the average selling price of new residential homes. </p></reply>

Following a competitive tender process, Indecon Economic Consultants were appointed in April to undertake this assessment. </p>  <p>  This purpose of the project, in general, is to assess whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes are being met, what impact (if any) the scheme is having on new and second-hand house prices, and what impact the scheme is having on the residential property market generally. </p>  <p>  Any moves to amend or suspend the incentive prior to the completion of this report, which is scheduled for the end of August, would effectively pre-judge the outcome of the analysis.  Once received from Indecon, the contents and findings of the report will be considered and I will decide on any appropriate action(s) to take in relation to its findings, in the context of my deliberations as part of the annual budgetary process.</p>  <p>  Finally, I would like to reassure members of the public who may be in the process of applying for the Help to Buy incentive, or those who currently have applications pending, that speculation concerning its abolition will not impact negatively on their applications.

I note that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na this week advised the public on how to avoid such fraudulent insurance brokers, discouraging motorists, for example, from buying insurance policies from unusual sources such as social networks, or in bars or restaurants or public places.  </p><p>A valid certificate of motor insurance can be obtained either directly from an Insurance Undertaking or an Insurance Intermediary, otherwise known as a Broker.  The Central Bank of Ireland encourage anyone intending to engage with an Insurance Intermediary, to check its online register to ensure that the firm is authorised to provide the service offered.  If a firm is not registered to provide that service, individuals should avoid using it.  The registers can be checked at .</p><p>Some Insurance Intermediaries may be registered in other EEA Member States, and thus are permitted to provide services to customers in Ireland.  If in doubt, consumers should contact the Central Bank on 01 224 4000 to confirm if such firms are permitted to operate in Ireland.  </p><p>Whenever the Central Bank becomes aware of unauthorised firms in operation, it issues a public warning notice and refers the firm to the Garda&iacute;.  To date, approximately 294 unauthorised firms have been the subject of Central Bank warning notices.</p><p>It is a criminal offence for an unauthorised firm/person to provide financial services in Ireland that would require an authorisation under the relevant legislation which the Central Bank is the responsible body for enforcing.</p><p>In that respect, I am satisfied that the Central Bank has the necessary powers in order for it to carry out its functions.</p></reply>

Any delay in the collection of tax revenue impacts on the level and timeliness of the financial resources available to the Exchequer and adds to Government borrowing and public debt interest.  Accordingly, Revenue has a strong focus on making sure that everyone complies with their responsibilities to file and pay the right amount of tax on time. </p>  <p>  The person in question has a poor tax compliance record and has only recently filed her Income Tax returns for the previous five years, which has allowed Revenue to quantify the full extent of her outstanding liabilities. </p>  <p>  Revenue has confirmed that it is willing to agree a mutually acceptable phased payment arrangement with the person in respect of the outstanding amounts.

This contract is renewable annually up to a maximum duration of four years.  While the OGP established this framework contract, the OGP is not the Contracting Authority on any other taxi contracts.</p>  <p>  Prior to establishing this framework contract the OGP engaged in a market consultation process to assist in identifying market capabilities for the provision of taxi services.  The market operates on the basis of loose arrangements between Dispatch Operators and individual vehicle owners. In response to this engagement, taxi dispatch operators made it clear to the OGP that they are not in a position to force individual drivers to purchase accessible vehicles.  This matter is largely one of market structure as there are no large unitary fleet operators who can easily be compelled to meet such a requirement. </p>  <p>  The most recent figures released by the National Transport Authority (NTA), for 2016, show that 6% of the national taxi fleet is now wheelchair accessible, up from 4.2% in 2013.  The NTA has responsibility for increasing the numbers of wheelchair accessible vehicles in the national taxi fleet by means of grants or other initiatives as appropriate.   </p>  <p>  The OGP continues to monitor the numbers of wheelchair accessible taxis in the national fleet and regularly engages with the National Transport Authority on this matter.  When re-tendering for the framework contract for taxi services in the Greater Dublin Area, the OGP will give due consideration to passenger requirements, vehicle accessibility and market statistics at that time.  Appropriate and proportionate measures will subsequently be included in the tender process.   </p></reply>

However, the long-term nature of the financial commitments arising under PPPs require that the use of such arrangements must be carefully planned in order to ensure that they are used to address infrastructural needs that are not likely to change over a 25 year period, and do so in a manner that is sustainable in the long term and which the public finances can afford.</p>  <p>  It was for this reason that the last Government introduced an Investment Policy Framework for PPPs, in 2015.  The purpose of the framework was to set a limit on the extent to which the annual costs of PPPs would pre-commit capital funding available to future Governments for investment purposes, in terms of the overall aggregate Exchequer capital allocation projected to be available in any individual year.</p>  <p>  The framework applies to the future cost of unitary payment charges in respect of both existing PPPs already in place and new PPPs currently in procurement or planning, together with the up-front Exchequer costs associated with procuring the planned new PPPs.  The current requirement is that, taken together, such future costs in respect of PPPs should not pre-commit more than 10% of the overall aggregate capital funding projected to be available to future Governments in any individual year.</p>  <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a mid-term review of the Capital Plan is currently underway, the findings of which will ultimately help Government to put in place a new long term Capital Plan which is consistent with the new National Planning Framework to be published later this year. </p>  <p>  In that context, Government needs to formulate a strategic view on the extent to which PPPs should be used to assist in delivering additional infrastructure, to complement that provided directly with Exchequer funding. </p>  <p>  With that in mind, I asked my Department to review our experience of using PPPs and to advise on the scope for further use of this procurement option in the context of the Government's capital investment plans. </p>  <p>  A senior level group has been established to assist my Department in this regard, comprising relevant officials from the Departments with experience of procuring projects by PPP, together with the Department of Finance, the National Development Finance Agency and Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  This group is reviewing past experience with PPPs and its report, once complete, will provide an evidence based analysis of the potential for further use of PPPs, and concessions, as a procurement option for the delivery of additional capital infrastructure as part of the new long term capital plan.  Assessing the affordability, sustainability and value-for-money of PPP procurement will be key elements of the Group's work, while the Group will also have the opportunity to make recommendations in relation to other aspects of PPP policy and guidance, if appropriate.   </p>  <p>  The report of the Inter-departmental group will help inform a final decision on how to proceed in relation to off-balance sheet PPPs in the context of the new long-term capital plan to be published later this year. </p></reply>

The aim of European and national rules is to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money. It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of location or nationality and there are legal remedies which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p>  <p>  Public procurement procedures require applicants to meet certain standards when applying for public contracts.  In this regard applicants are required to make declarations in relation to their financial standing, their legal standing and in relation to payment of taxes and social contributions.</p>  <p>  Prior to the award of a public works contract, the successful applicant is also required to produce a current Tax Clearance Certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  Under our national rules, any non-resident contractor being awarded a public contract must provide a Tax Clearance Certificate issued by Revenue confirming that the firm&rsquo;s tax affairs are in order and that it has complied with its tax obligations in this jurisdiction. </p>  <p>  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that non-resident contractors are obliged to register for and pay relevant taxes for activities carried out in the State. This includes Value Added Tax, Relevant Contracts Tax, Employers PAYE and, depending on the circumstances, Income Tax or Corporation Tax.</p>  <p>  - VAT - all non-resident principal contractors (individuals, partnerships and companies) who are engaged in Relevant Contracts in the construction industry in the State must register for VAT and account for VAT under the VAT reverse charge rule.  Contractors based in Northern Ireland do not have any advantages over contractors based in Ireland.  Full VAT recovery applies to all purchases wherever sourced and VAT is charged and accounted for on their supplies in Ireland.</p>  <p>  - Relevant Contracts Tax (RCT) applies to payments to subcontractors on construction, operations carried out within the State.  RCT applies irrespective of whether the Principal or subcontractor or both are resident outside the State. If the work is being carried out in the State, RCT must be operated.</p>  <p>  - Employers PAYE - all employers, including non-resident employers, must register for PAYE as an employer and operate PAYE/PRSI/USC in respect of income attributable to the performance in the State of an employment.</p>  <p>  - Income Tax/Corporation Tax - a non-resident contractor which has a permanent establishment which lasts for more than 6 months is liable for Income Tax if a sole trader or Corporation Tax if a company, on the profits arising from the Permanent Establishment.  Under Ireland&rsquo;s Double Taxation Agreements the term &ldquo;Permanent Establishment&rdquo; expressly includes a building site or construction or installation project.</p>  <p>  The management of the tendering process for a public contract is a matter for each contracting authority.  It is the responsibility of each contracting authority to ensure that tenderers comply with all the requirements of the process.</p>  <p>  Once awarded, the conditions of the public works contracts require the contractor to certify compliance with employment law, to maintain records of all those employed on the site, regardless of whether they are employees of the contractor or their subcontractors, and the hours worked by them.  Where requested, the contractor must also provide details of the payments made to those employed on the site.</p>  <p>  Where the contractor fails to comply with their obligations under the contract or employment law, deductions may be made from payments due under the contract until the situation is rectified.</p>  <p>  Enforcement of tax, social welfare and employment law are matters for the relevant State authorities.</p>  <p>  All contractors in assessing the viability of a particular contract have to consider their input costs, these include such things as proximity to the works site, availability of skilled labour and material, etc.   Exchange rate fluctuation is a risk to be considered when tendering for contracts where payments are to be made in a different currency.  Since both domestic and Northern Ireland (N.I.) contractors can source materials in either jurisdiction they are equally able to exploit currency fluctuations to their advantage.  Therefore domestic contractors are not necessarily at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the cost of materials. </p>  <p>  Competition can work both ways and it is also important to remember that open tendering is a two-way street and that it provides Irish companies with opportunities to compete abroad. The public procurement market in the European Union is estimated to be valued in excess of &euro;1.94 trillion per annum. The open market regime offers opportunities for Irish companies to win business abroad. EU studies indicate that many Irish businesses are successful in this regard.</p></reply>

The PIMA for Ireland will be specifically tailored to Ireland's particular needs and will include a focus on, for example,</p>  <p>  - A review of our planning and delivery mechanisms and the mechanisms for co-ordinated planning of infrastructural provision across sectors.</p>  <p>  - A benchmarking of Ireland's infrastructure by reference to that of other comparable developed countries drawing on the relevant IMF data; and</p>  <p>  - An assessment of PPPs and public investment management in State owned entities.</p>  <p>  The findings of the PIMA are expected to play an important role in identifying how institutions and public governance systems in Ireland responsible for and related to planning, allocating and delivering public capital infrastructure might be further strengthened.  The PIMA dovetails with the ongoing mid-term review of the Capital Plan.  The assessment will contribute to the analysis of the systems in place for planning, allocating and delivering future infrastructure priorities, in the context of the preparation of a new long-term Capital Plan to be published later this year.  </p>  <p>  The full cost of commissioning the report is being borne by the IMF.  The PIMA Mission to Ireland is scheduled for 6 to 19 July.  The PIMA report will be provided to my Department at the end of the mission and is currently expected to be published later this year as an important input and supporting document to the new 10 year Capital Plan. </p></reply>

The Mid-Year Expenditure Report (MYER) will include a substantive overview of this process in the coming weeks.  In addition, a series of papers will be published with the MYER and will present the results of the analysis of the wide range of expenditure schemes and programmes that have been examined this year.  This 2017 Review is the first in a three-year cycle of 'rolling', selective reviews that will examine all day-to-day Departmental spending by 2019.  This reflects a change in approach from the 2011 and 2014 Comprehensive Reviews of Expenditure, which covered all Government expenditure in a single year.</p>  <p>  The Spending Review process operates within the wider budgetary architecture and the medium-term expenditure framework, which supports sustainable expenditure policy, anchored by reference to the fiscal rules.  The aim of the Spending Review process is not to reduce Departmental expenditure but rather to examine existing spending within this overall budget constraints by reference to the principles of efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability and impact.  By systematically examining baseline expenditure using available evidence and data, the increasing tendency to focus only on the incremental increase in expenditure can be countered.  The results of the Spending Review analysis will support budgetary decisions and facilitate the consideration of existing expenditure alongside budgetary proposals.</p></reply>

Key considerations for my Department in this matter is our policy of inclusion, where the objective is for children to be educated within the mainstream system to the greatest extent possible.  The policy of my Department is that children with special educational needs should be included where possible and appropriate in mainstream placements with additional supports provided.  In circumstances where children with special educational need require more specialised interventions, special school or special class places are also available.</p><p>My Department also considers applications under the Home Tuition Grant Scheme which provides a compensatory educational service to students with a significant medical condition which is likely to cause major disruption to their attendance at school on a continuing basis.  Eligibility under this provision is assessed with reference to a completed medical report and attendance records supplied by the school in which the student is enrolled.  Further details of the Scheme are available at </p><p>Where a problem arises in securing a school place I wish to advise the Deputy that the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, has statutory responsibility to ensure that every child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  Therefore, the Agency, through its Educational Welfare Service, is the statutory body which can assist parents/guardians who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child.  My colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has responsibility for this Agency. </p><p>My Department also funds a range of supports for young people who are at risk of dropping out of school, or who have already become disengaged from the mainstream education system,.  These include Youth Encounter Projects, Youthreach Centres, and a number of other centres, including the Centre referred to by the Deputy which receives direct funding.  Teaching resources are funded through the Education and Training Boards in many of these local community based settings to support these young people and provide opportunities to them to gain benefit from education. </p><p>In relation to the detailed supplied I can confirm that funding from my Department to the Cork Life Centre in 2016 amounted to &euro;159,340.00 consisting of &euro;77,500 in direct funding and &euro;81,840 for teaching resources delivered through Cork ETB.</p><p>The DEIS Plan 2017 sets out my Department&rsquo;s vision for education to more fully become a proven pathway to better opportunities for those in communities at risk of disadvantage and social exclusion.  One of the goals contained in DEIS Plan 2017 is for a Review of current out of school and second chance provision to inform policy for future supports in this area, including those provided through Tusla.  The review will be carried out by my Department, in corporation with  Tusla, the Education and Training Boards and Solas,  It is expected work on the review will commence over the coming months.</p></reply>

The L1 (Language 1, in Irish, Teanga 1) specification is targeted at students in Irish-medium schools and students in English-medium schools who learn one or more subjects (apart from Irish) through the medium of Irish.  The L2 (Language 2, Teanga 2) specification is targeted at other students in English-medium schools.  </p><p>The new Junior Cycle specifications for Irish (both L1 and L2) have a strong emphasis on oral language.  This is particularly highlighted in the main strand of the specifications &ndash; Communicative Competence.  This strand places an enhanced emphasis on Irish as the language of learning and communication in classrooms as well as an emphasis on the skills required to communicate effectively with other users of the language.  Communication, opportunities for use and interaction are central to classroom tasks.</p><p>A different type of assessment methodology for oral language skills (and other skills) will be used in the new Junior Cycle Irish specification.  Up to now, there was an<b></b>optiona<b>l</b>oral language test, taken by a minority of students, and generally assessed by their teachers as part of the old Junior Certificate examination.  Now, as part of the new Junior Cycle Irish specifications, the oral language skills of all students will be formally assessed.  This will be done by means of Classroom-Based Assessments (CBAs) which will be reported by schools to parents at the end of third year in the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement (JCPA).  This emphasis on oral language will ensure students are prepared to undertake the Senior Cycle Programme. </p><p>The assessment of oral language skills will no longer be optional.  I am satisfied that the new approach ensures that all students will now have the opportunity to benefit from the experience and the value of participating in the assessment of their oral language skills.  Unlike the current reporting format in which candidates receive one overall grade based on their achievement in Irish in the Junior Certificate, whether they undertake the optional oral or not, the Junior Cycle Profile of Achievement will allow students&rsquo; achievement in the CBAs to be recorded independently of the result in the state-certified examination.  This experience should lead to more motivated, confident and independent language learners and users as they embark on the study of Irish in senior cycle.</p></reply>

Psychologists use a problem solving and solution oriented consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties.  Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.</p>  <p>  If the parents of the child, the subject of this question, have specific concerns about his educational progress I would advise in the first instance that they speak to the Principal of the school with a view to raising these concerns with the assigned NEPS psychologist in regard to any direct intervention in the case.</p></reply>

The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level is the staffing schedule for the relevant school year and pupil enrolments on the previous 30 September. </p>  <p>  Budget 2012 increased the appointment and retention ratios for small schools (i.e., schools with up to four classroom teachers).  Improvements to the staffing of these schools were announced for the 2015/16 school year.  These improvements are improved retention thresholds for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th classroom teacher and also the improved appointment and retention thresholds for one-teacher schools situated 8km or more from the nearest school of the same type of patronage and/or language of instruction.</p>  <p>  In addition, Budget 2016 announced a 1 point improvement to the primary staffing schedule.  The improved staffing schedule which is available on the Department website will be implemented for the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>  Following a review of the staffing allocation for Small Primary Schools, Budget 2017 announced two adjustments in relation to one teacher schools.  Where the school is the sole primary school on an island the school will be able to appoint a second teacher.  In relation to single teacher schools generally with an enrolment of 15 or more pupils the school can apply to the staffing appeal board for a second post where the single teacher has children across 6 or more class groups.</p></reply>

Following its first call for proposals in 2015, the Apprenticeship Council has been working closely with consortia to develop their proposals into sustainable apprenticeships.  Last year we saw the first of these new programmes with the Insurance Practitioner Apprenticeship launching in September and the Industrial Electrical Engineer Apprenticeship getting underway in November.  Last month three further new programmes got underway, two in the medical devices area and a polymer processing apprenticeship.  A further 10 programmes are expected to get underway later this year in various sectors including hospitality, financial services and accountancy.</p>  <p>  In January this year we published the Action Plan to Expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland 2016-2020, which sets out a series of detailed actions and annual targets on how the commitments set out in the Action Plan for Education in the area will be met. </p>  <p>  A key commitment set out in the Plan for this year was the issuing of a second call for apprenticeship proposals to refresh the pipeline of proposals already established through the first call.  The second call issued on 4 May and will remain open until 1 September. </p>  <p>  As well as developments in new apprenticeships, registrations in the craft trades are rising as the employment and economic situation improves.  In 2016 there were 3,742 registrations which represents a significant recovery since the crash.  This year the upward trend continues with registrations at the end of June of 2,200 which is almost 40% ahead of the same period in 2016.  Registrations in the craft trades are predicted to grow to 5,587 over the period to 2020</p></reply>

Among other things, this will facilitate the creation of over 2,500 additional posts in schools, including more classroom teachers, more resource teachers and more special needs assistants.  It has allowed for continued restoration of guidance posts in schools.  It provides support for school leadership.  It supports the roll-out of the DEIS Plan 2017 to deliver equality of opportunity in schools.  It has allowed the first new Exchequer current investment in higher education since the beginning of the financial crisis. Some 20,000 school places will also be provided for through the Department's capital allocation of &euro;690m.</p></reply>

The provision of an additional 900 teaching posts is a very significant investment in the provision of additional teaching support for pupils with special educational needs in our schools.  This is additional to an increase of 41% in the number of resource teachers allocated to schools annually by the NCSE since 2011. </p>  <p>  The additional funding will provide additional supports to over 1200 schools who are identified as needing additional supports as a result of the new model.

The Department of Education and Skills invests over &euro;300m annually in providing additional resources specifically to support students with autism in schools enabling:</p><p>- 61% of students to attend mainstream schools</p><p>- 26% to attend special classes in mainstream primary and post-primary schools, and</p><p>- 13% to attend special schools.</p><p>Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p><p>- S/he has ASD, and that</p><p>- S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p><p>The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p><p>The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p><p>Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,152 across the country now, of which 888 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p><p>The NCSE will establish an additional 174 Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year of which 145 will be ASD classes.  The NCSE intend to open an additional 4 special classes in Kildare for the 2017/18 school year, consisting of 1 Primary ASD special class, 2 Post Primary ASD special classes and 1 Post Primary Moderate GLD special class.</p><p>With regard to Kildare in particular there are 942 students with ASD attending schools in the County.  Of these, 520 students attend mainstream schools and are accessing in-school supports including Resource teaching and SNA support. </p><p>322 students are attending 59 ASD special classes, including 6 early intervention classes, 41 primary ASD classes and 12 post primary ASD classes.  A further 100 students with ASD are placed in 4 special schools. The number of ASD classes has increased in the area by 24% since the 2013/14 school year. </p><p>The NCSE has informed my Department that they are satisfied that there are sufficient ASD special class placements to meet existing demand in schools in the area referred to by the Deputy for the forthcoming school year and that they will continue to monitor demand and review the requirement for special class places. </p><p>My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities. </p><p>My Departments Planning and Building Unit has advised that Special Needs Units (SNUs) are currently under construction at 3 schools including St Conleth&rsquo;s Vocational School, Newbridge, Ard Scoil na Trionoide, Athy and Ballymanny Junior NS, Newbridge.</p><p>In addition, major building projects for a number of Post Primary schools in Kildare are included on the Department's 6 Year Construction Plan, and Special Needs units (SNUs) will be included in these Developments.</p><p>The schools in question are:</p><p>- St Paul&rsquo;s Secondary School, Monasterevin</p><p>- Naas Community College, Naas </p><p>- Cross &amp;amp; Passion College, Kilcullen</p><p>- Athy Community College</p><p>- St Farnan&rsquo;s Post Primary, Prosperous</p><p>- Patrician Post-Primary, Newbridge</p><p>During the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in the Select Committee last week I indicated that I intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, the Minister will have the power to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE.  Because this power will require a school to provide land or alter existing property I am of the view that the power should be with the Minister who can engage the patron or trustees and that there should be adequate safeguards to ensure people&rsquo;s rights are protected.</p><p>Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, are available on in county order. </p><p>Parents/guardians of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places.  The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p></reply>

In order to plan for school provision and analyse the relevant demographic data, my Department divides the country into 314 school planning areas.  The GIS uses data from a  range of sources, including the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland, the Department of Social Protection and my Department's own databases.  With this information, my  Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.  My Department is currently in the process of completing demographic exercises nationwide.  This process is detailed and rigorous and will take some time to complete.  It is anticipated that decisions based on these exercises will be announced later in 2017.</p><p>My Department's six year Capital Programme priorities building projects to meet demographic demand and this includes schools in County Kildare.  The Capital Programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms, if required, for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, there are currently 29 major capital projects being progressed in County Kildare, details of which were provided to the Deputy previously.  This is in addition to the smaller scale projects that have been approved devolved funding under my Department's additional accommodation scheme.  Details of these projects may be viewed on my Department's website which is updated regularly. </p><p>I also wish to advise the Deputy that it is my intention, in accordance with the Programme for Government to replace all purchased temporary accommodation with permanent accommodation, where the need is established, over the lifetime of my Department's Capital Programme (2016-2021).  To enable this development, my Department will be carrying out an assessment of the number of prefabs being used in schools to deliver the curriculum.  This will also determine whether individual prefabs need to be replaced in the context of the long-term accommodation needs of each individual school.  When completed, this assessment will quantity the number of  prefabs to be replaced.</p><p>It is intended that this assessment, when finalised, will enable the replacement of such prefabs to commence in 2019.  A funding provision of &euro;180 million is being made available from 2019 for this initiative in the programme. </p></reply>

Under this scheme schools can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly. </p>  <p>  In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS has adopted a consultative model of service.  The focus is on empowering teachers to intervene effectively with pupils whose needs range from mild to severe and transient to enduring.  Psychologists use a problem solving and solution focused consultative approach to maximise positive outcomes for these pupils.  NEPS encourages schools to use a continuum based assessment and intervention process whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention for pupils with learning, emotional or behavioural difficulties . Teachers may consult their NEPS psychologist should they need to at this stage in the process.  Only in the event of a failure to make reasonable progress, in spite of the school's best efforts in consultation with NEPS, will the psychologist become involved with an individual child for intensive intervention or assessment. </p>  <p>  This system allows psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.  It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention. </p>  <p>  I would advise that if there are concerns in relation to the educational or social and emotional development of any student these should be raised by the parents, in the first instance, with the Principal of the school he/she is attending, with a view to Principal discussing the situation with the assigned NEPS psychologist or local NEPS service.</p></reply>

There is no change in relation to the staffing schedule of 27:1 that will apply to primary schools for the 2017/18 school year.  The staffing schedule for post primary will be 19:1 for the 2017/18 school year.

The survey showed that teachers and schools are positively disposed to using ICT and are reasonably well resourced in that regard but there remains some challenges in the areas of connectivity at primary level and in training and development.  The four Themes emerged as a roadmap for the embedding of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment.</p><p>The implementation of the Strategy is currently underway. A detailed Action Plan for 2017 was recently launched, based on the objectives outlined in the Digital Strategy.  Timelines and lead responsibility have been assigned. Progress on implementation will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and an end of year 2017 progress report will be published.  The Action Plan is available on my Department's website at: .  The Plan for 2017 has some key elements:</p><p>- The scoping of an innovative clustering model across the country to innovate, harness good practice and create pathways for accelerated collaborative innovation by schools</p><p>- A programme of curriculum reforms will see ICT embedded in all emerging curricular specifications and intense preparation for the phased introduction of Computer Science as a Leaving Certificate subject option from 2018 </p><p>- The localization of the UNESCO ICT Competency Framework though the development of a Digital Learning Framework that will give clarity to teachers and schools around the concept of embedding ICT into teaching, learning and assessment.  This Framework will help schools and teachers to identify training needs that can be targeted  by my Department and its Support Services.  The Framework will be made available to all schools from September 2017.</p><p>- Provide information to teachers on innovative ways to use digital technologies more actively in their own teaching, including exemplars of good practice, and facilitating the sharing of such practices amongst teachers.</p><p>- All professional development supports provided by my Department's Support Services will embed digital technologies and constructivism both in design, development and delivery</p><p>Funding of &euro;210m has been committed towards the implementation of the Digital Strategy.  The first tranche of this funding, &euro;30m,  issued earlier this year to some 3,158 primary and special schools and 666 post primary schools for the upgrade of ICT infrastructure.  The need to provide funding for this purpose was highlighted in the Census analysis.  The criteria for funding provides that each school is expected to draw up an eLearning Plan using a whole school approach and taking account of its context and circumstances.  The Plan will outline the vision of the school for the embedding of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment and incorporates targets and priorities for improvement and development. </p><p>Presently, all schools in the country are offered a broadband internet connection to promote and facilitate the use of eLearning Technology.  There is a vast array of internet-based digital tools in use in classrooms, including Interactive Whiteboards, laptops, desktop computers, projectors, tablet computers, software packages and apps, visualisation and mapping tools, digital content and resources. </p><p>The decision on which digital tool to use to best support teaching and learning in the implementation of the curriculum is made by each individual school.  The emphasis will now however be on the use of these digital tools to effectively embed ICT in teaching, learning and assessment in line with the Digital Strategy.</p><p>The PDST Technology in Education provides a range of support services for schools on the effective use of digital technologies in teaching, learning and assessment through a variety of means including workshops, blended learning CPD courses, good practice videos, advice on ICT equipment and digital learning tools.  It is part of the national support service, the Professional Development Service for Teachers and operates under the remit of my Department.  It also manages the Department&rsquo;s on-line Education Portal Scoilnet.ie  which is a key source of online high quality digital content made available for all schools and facilitates sharing of digital resources and good classroom practice between teachers.  The website provides in excess of 12,000 + resources aligned with the primary School Curriculum and the Post Primary Subject Syllabus. </p></reply>

This measure is designed to provide rural communities with security about the future of their small schools. </p>  <p>  With regard to school ethos, the government supports the concept of parental choice in our school system, whether that be a choice for denominational or multi-denominational education. </p>  <p>  In regard to retaining small schools, a specific commitment is given in the Programme for a Partnership Government not to close any small school without the consent of parents.

In addition to encompassing regular periodic reviews of study programmes, institutions are also encouraged to undertake quality reviews of academic, administrative and service departments and, depending on structure, unit-based reviews of schools, faculties and colleges.  Institutions may also undertake thematic reviews of institution-wide issues. </p>  <p>  The Annual Institutional Quality Assurance Report provides QQI inter alia with a listing an institutions cycle of internal reviews along with links to published review reports.  QQI has also established a Policy for the Cyclical Review of Higher Education Institutions, which take place on a periodic scheduled basis. </p>  <p>  The support for teaching and learning is a central pillar of the National Strategy for Higher Education 2030 and the promotion of &lsquo;excellence in teaching and learning to underpin a high-quality student experience&rsquo; is one of the 7 &lsquo;key system objectives&rsquo; in the Higher Education System Performance Framework. </p>  <p>  The establishment in 2012 of the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning at third level provided a key, system-level infrastructure for the support of the implementation of the National Strategy in respect of the teaching mission of higher education. </p>  <p>  The National Forum aims to ensure that opportunities for better practice are identified, mainstreamed and shared under the guidance of the Higher Education Authority and sectoral representative bodies.  The National Forum&rsquo;s Roadmap for Enhancement in a Digital World 2015&ndash;2017 and the Professional Development Framework are just two national initiatives developed for the sector. Its partnerships with students through for example, the Teaching Heroes Awards scheme, has significantly advanced the objective of enhancing student-engagement in higher education.  The National Forum therefore supports at national level the ongoing updating of teaching and learning in third level institutions in line with best practice internationally.</p></reply>

This can be due to significant difficulties in areas such as behaviour or sensory needs which have not been ameliorated, even with appropriate intervention, in mainstream.</p>  <p>  Enrolment in an ASD special class should only be considered where it has been demonstrated that a student requires the support of a special class because he/she is unable to learn effectively in a mainstream class for most or all of the school day even with appropriate supports. </p>  <p>  Students enrolling in ASD Special Classes must have a report from a relevant professional or team of professionals (for example, psychologist, speech and language therapist, psychiatrist) stating that: </p>  <p>  &bullet;S/he has ASD, and that</p>  <p>  &bullet;S/he has significant learning needs that require the support of a special class setting and the reasons why this is the case.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), in consultation with the relevant education partners, is responsible for the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas where there is an identified need.</p>  <p>  The NCSE, in looking to open special classes, must take into account the present and future potential need for such classes, taking particular account of the educational needs of the children concerned.  The NCSE will also take account of location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas.  </p>  <p>  Since 2011 the NCSE has increased the number of special classes by over 100% from 548 in 2011 to 1,152 across the country now, of which 888 are Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) special classes. </p>  <p>  The NCSE intend to establish an additional 145 ASD Special Classes for the 2017/18 school year. Details of all special classes for children with special educational needs, are available on www.ncse.ie in county order.</p>  <p>  My Department continues to work with the NCSE to ensure that there is appropriate planning in place to ensure that all children who require special class placements can access such placements in schools within their communities.  </p>  <p>  During the passage of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill in the Select Committee last week I indicated that I intend, at Report Stage, to include in this Bill a provision that will provide, based on reports and advice from the NCSE, the Minister will have the power to require a school to open a special class or increase the number of special classes in schools identified by the NCSE.  Because this power will require a school to provide land or alter existing property I am of the view that the power should be with the Minister who can engage the patron or trustees and that there should be adequate safeguards to ensure people&rsquo;s rights are protected.</p>  <p>  As the enrolment of a child to a school is a matter, in the first instance, for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school, my Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment to schools and it does not maintain details of waiting lists in schools.</p>  <p>  Parents/guardians of children with special needs who may need advice or are experiencing difficulties in locating a school placement should contact their local Special Educational Needs Organiser (SENO) as soon as possible for information on available places. The local SENO contact details are available on www.ncse.ie.</p>  <p>  My officials have been informed by the NCSE that the local SENO, Educational Welfare Officer and parent are meeting next week to discuss placement options for the child referred to by the Deputy, </p>  <p>  However as the question relates to an individual child, the matter has been referred to the NCSE for direct reply.</p></reply>

The EU collectively, as well as member states working alone, have been working hard to try to improve conditions on the ground. </p><p>The political situation in Libya remains complex.  No single government has controlled Libya since the fall of Colonel Gaddafi, and at the present time there are a number of competing governments in Libya, none of which control more than a portion of the territory.  As a result the humanitarian, economic and security situation is precarious and complicates EU engagement with the Libyan authorities, including on migration.  The formation of a functioning government in Libya is therefore a central objective for the EU, and will be a critical step towards addressing the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.</p><p>At their summit meeting in March, EU Heads of State and Government set out the EU&rsquo;s commitment to assist Libya in their Malta Declaration.  That commitment is broad-ranging including capacity building, training, and the provision of equipment and support for the Libyan national coast guard and other agencies . It also seeks to ensure that there are adequate reception capacities in Libya for migrants, including through working with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). </p><p>In April, the EU approved a &euro;90 million programme to step up protection of migrants and to reinforce migration management in Libya.  A key objective is to provide multi-sectoral assistance and protection to migrants, refugees and host communities in different locations inside Libya, in particular inside detention centres, at disembarkation points and in urban settings.  This programme is being implemented through a number of international agencies including the UNHCR and UNICEF. The &euro;90m is in addition to the &euro;120 million already announced by the EU for migration-related support for Libya.</p><p>Individual EU member states are also addressing the migration situation in Libya.  The Interior ministers of France, Germany and Italy along with the European Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, met in Paris on 2 July and agreed, <i>inter alia,</i>to enhance support to the Libyan coastguard by increasing training activities and providing additional financial support while at the same time ensuring close monitoring of activities and to provide additional support to the IOM and the UNHCR to enable facilities in Libya to reach international standards in terms of living conditions and human rights.  They also agreed to accelerate the EU Relocation scheme agreed in 2015. </p><p>Ireland has been playing its part in trying to address the migration crisis through voluntarily opting into the EU Relocation scheme; giving generous humanitarian assistance to countries housing large numbers of migrants and through our naval presence in the Mediterranean.  As regards Libya specifically, for the past two years Irish Aid has deployed two Rapid Responders from its Rapid Response Corps to the UNICEF Libya Country Office based in Tunis to support UNICEF&rsquo;s work with migrants.  </p></reply>

It is however open to any individual who may wish to become an Irish citizen to lodge an application for citizenship through naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory conditions as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, which governs the grant of citizenship through naturalisation.  The statutory conditions are that the applicant must -</p><p>- be of full age,</p><p>- be of good character,</p><p>- have had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a further total residence in the State amounting to four years,</p><p>- intend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation,</p><p>- have, <font color="#212100">before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows - </font></p><p><font color="#212100">(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and</font></p><p><font color="#212100">(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.</font></p><p>Detailed information on Irish citizenship and naturalisation, as well as the relevant application forms, is available on the INIS website at www.inis.gov.ie.  The website also contains guidance on the completion of an application for naturalisation.Under Irish law it is possible for an Irish citizen to hold dual citizenship; the acquisition of Irish citizenship is not contingent on the renunciation of the citizenship of another jurisdiction.  </p><p>As the Deputy is aware, it is our intention to maintain the existing arrangements with regard to the United Kingdom, and the Government position is to protect the Common Travel Area arrangements.  As outlined, the grant of Irish citizenship is a national competency and there are no current plans to amend the legislation.  There are also no plans to change the current position regarding the Common Travel Area in advance of knowing what will be the ultimate arrangements relating to the UK withdrawal from the EU.  Should an issue arise in this area during any negotiations between the UK and the other EU member states, the position will be revisited at that stage.  </p></reply>

No. 569 of 2011).  The application fee, stipulated at &euro;175, is payable on application for a certificate of naturalisation and a certification fee is payable on the issue of a certificate of naturalisation.  The standard certification fee is set at &euro;950, while a reduced fee of &euro;200 applies in the case of an application made on behalf of a minor or in certain cases where the application is made by a widow, widower or surviving civil partner of an Irish citizen.  In the case of recognised refugees and stateless persons the certification fee is nil.  </p>  <p>  There is no provision in the Regulations for the discretionary waiver or reduction of fees, or for differing fees to apply to different nationalities.

The Act was signed into law on 30 December 2015.  </p>  <p>  New administrative processes and support measures, including the setting up of the Decision Support Service within the Mental Health Commission, must be put in place before the substantive provisions of the Act can be commenced. A high-level Steering Group comprised of senior officials from the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Mental Health Commission and the Courts Service is overseeing the establishment and commissioning of the Decision Support Service (DSS) and this work is ongoing.  </p>  <p>  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 (Commencement of Certain Provisions) Order 2016 (S.I. No. 515 of 2016), brought some provisions of Part 1 (Preliminary and General) and Part 9 (Director of the Decision Support Service) of the Act into operation on 17 October 2016. These provisions were brought into operation in order to progress the setting up of the Decision Support Service and to enable the process of recruitment of the Director of the DSS to begin.  The recruitment and appointment of the Director of the DSS, and the appointment of DSS staff, is a matter for the Mental Health Commission (a body under the Department of Health) with the approval of the Minister for Health. </p>  <p>  It is intended that the key preparations will be put in place during the remainder of this year under the oversight of the Steering Group to allow for commencement orders for the remaining provisions of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 to be made when the Decision Support Service is ready to roll out the new decision-making support options.  It is not possible at the moment to provide an exact time line for the finalisation of these commencement orders, not least because we will need to have the Director of the DSS in place to fully ascertain the time-line.  The post of Director was advertised by the Public Appointments Service on 7 April and it is expected that the Director will be in place during the summer.</p></reply>

Ireland had been evaluated in 2014 and received 11 recommendations.  The compliance report which was adopted in March 2017 was disappointing and Ireland was found to have only satisfactorily implemented 3 out of 11 recommendations.   </p>  <p>  GRECO was satisfied that Ireland had implemented the one recommendation in relation to prosecutors.  In relation to members of parliament, GRECO found that Ireland was partly compliant and the enactment of the Public Sector Standards Bill will ensure a much higher level of compliance going forward.  My colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is progressing this Bill through the legislative process currently.  In relation to the judiciary, Ireland was deemed to have implemented none of the five recommendations.  Since this report was adopted, however, the Government has published both the Judicial Council Bill and the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill, and the enactment of these two Bills will substantially address these recommendations.</p>  <p>  Ireland had been asked to report again to the Council of Europe by 31 March 2018 on the outstanding recommendations and I am committed to achieving a significantly better result next time around.  With that in mind, I have established a senior officials compliance committee to work through the various recommendations and to ensure that progress continues to be made on implementing both legislative and administrative recommendations.</p>  <p>  Very soon, I will also be publishing a Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Bill, which will repeal and replace the seven previous Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889 to 2010 and will introduce some additional offences.  The Bill will clarify the liability of corporate bodies for corruption offences.  It will extend the range of penalties available to a court when a person is convicted to include forfeiture of public office in certain circumstances.  The Bill will make renewed provision for the main requirements of a number of international anti-corruption instruments which Ireland has already ratified, and it will provide for recommendations made in the course of evaluations of Ireland by the various European and International Bodies, including GRECO.</p></reply>

This Implementation Programme represents a combined investment of &euro;27.5m, with the Atlantic Philanthropies contributing &euro;12m and the HSE &euro;15.5m.</p>  <p>  Key elements of the initiative include: </p>  <p>  - the roll-out of a programme of Intensive Home Supports and Home Care Packages for people with dementia valued at &euro;22.1 million over a three year period; </p>  <p>  - the provision of additional dementia-specific resources for GPs, to include training materials and guidance on local services and contact points valued at &euro;1.2 million; </p>  <p>  - measures to raise public awareness, address stigma and promote the inclusion and involvement in society of those with dementia valued at &euro;2.7 million.</p>  <p>  The roll out of Intensive Home Care packages commenced in January 2015 and monitoring of the allocation and uptake of these packages to persons with dementia is ongoing.  By May 2017, the HSE had delivered a total of 217 dementia-specific intensive homecare packages at an average cost of &euro;953 per week.  There are currently 122 people with dementia in receipt of an Intensive Home Care Package with a further 16 approved and 12 applications in progress.  In addition to the Intensive Home Care Packages the HSE has continued to provide mainstream home help and routine Home Care packages to people with dementia whose needs have been assessed as requiring these supports and within available resources.  Up to 500 people with dementia and their families are expected to benefit from Intensive Home Care Packages over the lifetime of the implementation programme. </p>  <p>  It is Government policy that, wherever possible and appropriate, people should be cared for in their own homes and communities, and the National Dementia Strategy specifically restates this commitment to those living with dementia. </p>  <p>  The Department and the HSE are working on a mid-term review of the implementation of the National Dementia Strategy which will be published in the Autumn and will identify the achievements so far and set out the further work that is required to implement the Strategy over the next 12 months and beyond.  The resources required for the ongoing implementation of the Strategy can only be considered in the context of the Estimates and Budget process.  The mid-term review will assist in identifying further actions required and will be helpful in the context of budgetary considerations. </p>  <p>  I have seen the the Alzheimer Society of Ireland pre-budget submission and have noted the contents.  The proposals contained in the pre-buget submission will be considered as part of this process.</p></reply>

In that regard, ambulances must be crewed by a minimum of two persons, one whose primary role is to provide patient care, and the second whose role is combined with patient care and driving.  The Standards also require that the necessary equipment and medications are available on the ambulance to enable the practitioner to manage patients within the scope of their practice.</p>  <p>  PHECC standards are voluntary to all except the National Ambulance Service.  However, to be approved by PHECC to implement clinical practice guidelines, there is a requirement on the ambulance provider to comply with the standards.  It is understood that private health insurance companies, and the HSE, only avail of the services of PHECC approved private ambulance companies.</p></reply>

The Strategy will be implemented on a phased basis and this work will be led by the HSE National Women &amp;amp; Infants Health Programme.  Indeed, the issue of anomaly scanning is a priority issue for the Programme and, accordingly, it will develop clinical guidance regarding routine detailed scans.  In the meantime, the Programme will continue to work with the six Hospital Groups to assist in increasing access to anomaly scans for those units with limited availability. </p>  <p>  One of the current challenges to increase access to anomaly scans is the recruitment of ultrasonographers who are skilled in using these machines.  In this context, it is expected that the establishment of Maternity Networks across Hospital Groups will assist in developing a sustainable model that ensures that all women within each Hospital Group can access anomaly scans.</p>  <p>  In relation to the specific query regarding Cavan General Hospital, I have asked the HSE to reply to you directly. </p></reply>

The Programme for Government commits to a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care in order to deliver better care close to home in communities across the country. The development of a new, modernised contract for the provision of general practitioner services will be a key element in facilitating this process. </p>  <p>  The aim is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  A new contract should be flexible and be able to respond to the changing nature of the GP workforce.  It should also include provisions in relation to service quality and standards, performance, accountability and transparency.  I think this will be key in making general practice a more attractive career.</p>  <p>  Since 2015, negotiations have resulted in a number of service developments including the provision of free GP care to under 6's and over 70's, the introduction of a Diabetes Cycle of Care for adult GMS patients with Type 2 Diabetes and enhanced supports for rural GPs.  The next phase of discussions on a new GP contract commenced in January of this year.  Officials from my Department and the HSE meet with GP representatives on a regular basis to discuss a wide range of issues.  The option of salaried GPs for areas where it has proven difficult to attract and retain GP services is one of the issues I expect will be considered in this context.</p>  <p>  I understand that the discussions taking place are wide ranging and definitely ambitious in their scope.  I think it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that this will not be a straightforward process.  There will no doubt be challenges ahead for all parties involved. I would hope that everyone will remain focused on our common goal of putting suitable new arrangements in place that will work for patients, GPs, and other health care providers in primary care.  As with any negotiation-type process, and given the range and complexity of the issues to be discussed, the engagement may take some time.  While I am of course anxious to see good progress made, it is not my intention to set a deadline for completion of discussions. I look forward to significant progress being made in the months ahead.</p></reply>

Nonetheless, historically and currently a proportion of activity in public hospitals involves the provision of care to private patients and the income generated in this way is a key component of the funding of the public hospital system.  Any curtailment of this funding stream would put further pressure on the Exchequer and the taxpayer in order to maintain service levels.</p><p>The Comptroller and Auditor General identified in his 2008 Report that for 50% of private patients no private inpatient charge applied, as they were accommodated in either a designated public bed or non-designated bed.  The inability under the law to collect a private inpatient charge in such instances represented a significant loss of income to the public hospital system and to taxpayers and represented an indirect subsidy to private health insurance companies.</p><p>The Health (Amendment) Act 2013 was enacted to address the issue identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General and provided for the charging of all private patients in public hospitals, irrespective of the type of accommodation used.  </p><p>When patients are admitted to hospital they always have the option of being treated as a public patient or opting to be treated as a private patient.  Those patients opting to be treated privately have chosen to pay the consultant and the hospital in respect of the services that each provides.  The charges applied in respect of private care in a public hospital relate not only to accommodation costs but also costs associated with non-consultant hospital doctors, nursing staff, medicines, blood, medical and surgical supplies, radiology, diagnostics, operating theatres, laboratories, administration and support staff.</p><p>The HSE levies the appropriate charge for private patients in public hospitals in accordance with the Health (Amendment) Act 2013.  The private patient waiver form to which the Deputy refers has no legal standing in relation to the application of these charges.  </p><p>The operational procedures for the management of patients' treatment preferences and the collection of private inpatient charges are a matter for the HSE in the first instance and I have asked the Executive to respond directly to the Deputy in this regard.  The application of these necessary procedures must be sensitive to the health status of patients whilst in hospital and I want to ensure that patients do not experience upset at such a difficult time.  My<b></b>Department is therefore working with the HSE to ensure that the processes in place across the hospital system for implementing the law in this regard are appropriate and that a consistent approach is taken in implementing them.</p></reply>

In 2017, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (DHPCLG) which is the lead authority, assisted by the Department of Agriculture, Food &amp;amp; the Marine (DAFM)  embarked on the third review of Ireland&rsquo;s NAP  with the European Commission, with a view to having  the fourth  NAP in place by 2018, to  run from 2018 to 2021.  The further objective is that, subject to approval of the fourth NAP, the agreement with the Commission of the renewal of Ireland&rsquo;s nitrates derogation for the period 2018 to 2021.  The continuance of the derogation, which allows more intensive farmers to exceed the 170 kg/ ha nitrogen from livestock limit, is considered vital to achieve targets set out under Food Harvest 2020 and Food Wise 2025.</p>  <p>  As part of the NAP review a public consultation has taken place; 28 submissions were received including submissions from farmers and farming organisations.  All the submissions have been reviewed and considered by the Expert Group, consisting of personnel from DHPCLG, Teagasc, EPA and my Department.  These will form the basis for proposals to the Commission for a new Nitrates Action Programme; it is required that the proposals must have a scientific basis.</p>  <p>  As regards nitrates penalties, the &euro;100m Knowledge Transfer Scheme which has over 20,000 participating farmers includes a focus on environmental sustainability and in helping farmers pursue best practice, thereby reducing the risks of non-compliance and penalties.  In addition my Department is regularly communicating with farmers including providing Nitrogen and Phosphorus statements to aid compliance with regulatory requirements and issuing text messages to those farmers who may be close to their nitrates limits. </p></reply>

The UK Government had been intimating this decision for some time now.  It is nonetheless unwelcome and unhelpful as it suggests a signal of the UK intent to take a hard line on fisheries in the context of Brexit.</p><p>However, there are no immediate direct impacts for the Irish fishing industry from this action as it will not take effect for two years.  Any longer term impacts will only become clear in the overall context of the Brexit negotiations.  It is the message of intent and the potential implications of that intent in the wider 12 to 200 mile zone that causes concern for the negotiations to come. </p><p>The Convention deals primarily with the right of a number of countries to fish in each other's 6 to 12 mile fishing zones based on historic fishing activity. Most of these rights were later incorporated into the Common Fisheries Policy.</p><p>Under the Convention, the Irish fishing fleet has access to parts of the UK 6-12 mile zone while the UK fleet has similar access to parts of the Irish zone.  The Irish fleet is not significantly dependant on this limited access. We do however catch significant quantities of fish in UK waters outside of the 12 mile zone.</p><p>As Michel Barnier noted earlier this week, the UK decision to withdraw from the London Fisheries Convention will not trigger any immediate change and he is focused on prioritising the fisheries interests of the EU 27.</p><p>This will not be a piecemeal negotiation with fisheries isolated from the wider negotiations on a post Brexit EU/UK relationship.  There is a long way to go yet and nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed. </p><p>For this Government there are two clear objectives when it comes to fisheries and Brexit &ndash; the maintenance of our existing quota shares and our existing rights of access.  This has, and will continue to be, my overriding priority. </p><p>To achieve these objectives, we must have unity of purpose across the Member States directly concerned and across the fishing industry. Disunity will only strengthen those in the UK that seek to exclude all EU fleets.</p><p>As the negotiations develop unilateral sectoral announcements, like this one, will be dealt with, as this will be, within the Brexit negotiation process and there will be no room, or indeed intent, to address issues in isolation.</p><p>I am working closely with our fishing industry and held a detailed public discussion with stakeholders just last week in Galway.  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.</p><p>I strongly believe that a unified front on these matters is best for Ireland, the EU and the continued sustainability of our stocks.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to assure the Deputy that I will be unequivocal in opposing any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any limitations on our existing rights of access.  </p></reply>

The laboratories also provide valued services and advisory support to the farming community, the food industry and wider society.</p>  <p>  The ambitious targets of the Agrifood industry for growth and development over the next decade, as set out in Food Wise 2025, must be underpinned by robust systems which protect and enhance our reputation as a producer of safe and wholesome food and one of the ways in which we must respond to this challenge is by developing a long-term strategy for the laboratories - building on existing capability and expertise in animal health, food safety and plant sciences, and ensuring we achieve both operational and scientific excellence. </p>  <p>  This was the primary reason for tasking a Working Group led by Prof. Alan Reilly to undertake a comprehensive review of the Department&rsquo;s Laboratories.  This review has considered both the central laboratory complex at Backweston and the eight regional laboratories located at Athlone, Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Sligo.  The Group has presented a report to the Department, which makes recommendations on:</p>  <p>  -  Oversight and co-ordination of the laboratories activities</p>  <p>  -  Re-organisation of Divisions and support functions within the Central Laboratory complex</p>  <p>  -  Options for the future development of the Regional Laboratories - with a view to improving disease investigative and surveillance capability but with the over-riding imperative of maintaining and enhancing services to farmers and</p>  <p>  -  Human resources management within the laboratories - with a focus on grading structures, career development opportunities and workforce planning </p>  <p>  To date no decision has been taken in respect of the options proposed for the Regional Veterinary Laboratories (RVLs).

Overall, I consider that the meeting last December and the subsequent written engagement with the NGBs has generated a most useful debate in Irish sporting circles.</p>  <p>  The issue of Women in Sports Leadership will be addressed in the upcoming National Sports Policy which I hope to publish in early autumn.</p></reply>

Decisions on the transport elements of the Capital Plan were framed by the conclusions reached in my Department's Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport.  Based on the findings in that report it is envisaged that maintenance and renewal of the road network will continue to be the main priority and the bulk of the roads capital budget, approximately &euro;4.4 billion, is earmarked for such essential work with a further &euro;600 million allocated for implementation of the PPP road programme which is already under way.  Within the overall funding envelope there is, therefore, limited funding for road upgrade projects and it was not possible to include a range of projects including the projects mentioned by the Deputy.</p>  <p>  As regards the possibility of funding as part of the Capital Plan Review, my Department is making a strong case for additional funding, including the further development of a project pipeline for national road schemes.  The final decisions on allocations are, however, matters for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and Government as a whole.  As Minister I have to work within the budget available to my Department.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding funding constraints TII has been undertaking some preparatory planning work with Donegal County Council in relation to the TEN-T network in the County.  While details of the national road allocations to local authorities for the years 2011-2017 (including to Donegal County Council) are available from the Dail library, actual expenditure is a matter for TII.</p>  <p>  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's questions to TII for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you don't receive a reply within 10 working days.</p>  <p>  I have received a request for a meeting relating to road infrastructure in Letterkenny  and I am open to such a meeting subject to diary commitments. </p></reply>

To give an indication, a family accessing Community Childcare Service (CCS) on a full-time basis for 25 hours per week on the highest available band would receive a subvention of &euro;145 (the maximum amount available) which works out at &euro;5.80 per week, if the same family accessed 20 hours this would result in an hourly rate of &euro;4.00 per week. </p><p>Full details of all the permutations and eligibility requirements are available on the website www.affordablechildcare.ie.

This is a major reform as self-employed people will now have access to the safety-net of State income supports, without having to go through a means test, if they become permanently incapable of work as a result of an illness or disability.  Once such a contributor qualifies for the payment, it can be paid on an indefinite basis to pension age provided the relevant person continues to satisfy the medical and other criteria. </p><p>Consideration was not given to limiting eligibility for the payment to part of calendar years only.  </p><p>While the measure is being implemented without any increase in the rate of contribution paid by self-employed workers in 2017, consideration will need to be given to the funding arrangements in later years.  The estimated 2018 and 2019 costs are &euro;23m and &euro;38m, respectively, and these will rise further in later years.</p><p>In addition, Class S self-employed contributors have access since March last to the Treatment Benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental exams, and contributions towards the cost of hearings aids. </p><p>The last Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund was published in 2012 and did provide costings of extending two benefits - jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit and invalidity pension - to self-employed workers on the same basis as it is paid to class A employees.  It did not provide a cost for permitting self-employed workers to opt to into class A structure paying equivalent rates of contributions for cover for jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit. </p><p>It should be noted, in this regard, that there would not be a direct correlation between the cost of compulsory cover (and the rates of contributions required) for any given benefit or pension for all self-employed and with the costs of an opt in (or opt out) system.  The third report of the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare on Extending Social Insurance Coverage for the self-employed published in 2013 examined the extension of additional cover for the self-employed on a voluntary basis and concluded that &ldquo;<i>extension on a voluntary basis, through either an &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; basis, could lead to the selection of bad risks and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles that underline the social insurance system</i>.&rdquo;  Accordingly, an opt in system would require those who opted in to pay at a higher rate of contribution than would apply under a compulsory system.</p><p>The Actuarial Review referred to above was completed in 2012. A new review is now well advanced and is expected to be published next month.  This review will re-examine the projected PRSI contribution rates required to fund individual additional benefits, including invalidity pension and jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit to self-employed contributors.  Given the improvements in the labour market and the economy generally over the period since 2012, the forthcoming review will provide a more up to date estimate of the costs of extending new benefits to the self-employed.  </p></reply>

Where a customer cannot work as a result of an illness they should contact the office who will assist them with applying for a more appropriate payment.  </p>  <p>  The customer was also advised on 30 March 2017 that there was a job interview scheduled for 6 April 2017, in an area in which they held a qualification in and had expressed an interest in working in, and that non-attendance would affect her payment.  The customer did not attend the interview on 6 April and after a number of weeks of no further contact the customer&rsquo;s claim was deemed to be closed.  This initiated a review of the customer&rsquo;s rent supplement claim. </p>  <p>  If the customer wishes to continue with their claim they will need to provide the previously requested details regarding their declared casual employment.

The figures in the following table for Galway in 2015 and 2016 refer to Galway City only:<table><tr><th>County</th><th>Annual Budget 2015</th><th>Spend 2015</th><th>Annual Budget 2016</th><th>Spend 2016</th><th>Annual Budget 2017</th></tr><tr><td>Carlow </td><td>402,321</td><td>399,820</td><td>536,428</td><td>536,424</td><td>536,428</td></tr><tr><td>Cavan </td><td>556,338</td><td>535,041</td><td>741,784</td><td>732,057</td><td>741,784</td></tr><tr><td>Clare </td><td>641,506</td><td>583,828</td><td>855,341</td><td>855,341</td><td>855,341</td></tr><tr><td>Cork </td><td>2,309,073</td><td>2,297,413</td><td>3,078,956</td><td>3,077,547</td><td>3,078,956</td></tr><tr><td>Donegal</td><td>1,480,935</td><td>1,426,506</td><td>1,974,580</td><td>1,970,067</td><td>1,974,580</td></tr><tr><td>Dublin </td><td>7,149,314</td><td>6,813,594</td><td>9,532,555</td><td>9,509,363</td><td>9,532,555</td></tr><tr><td>Galway </td><td>487,093</td><td>487,062</td><td>649,458</td><td>649,456</td><td>2,251,039</td></tr><tr><td>Kerry </td><td>1,222,199</td><td>1,218,688</td><td>1,629,598</td><td>1,628,740</td><td>1,629,598</td></tr><tr><td>Kildare</td><td>765,170</td><td>765,170</td><td>1,020,227</td><td>1,011,063</td><td>1,020,227</td></tr><tr><td>Kilkenny</td><td>455,860</td><td>453,445</td><td>607,813</td><td>607,453</td><td>607,813</td></tr><tr><td>Laois </td><td>423,048</td><td>418,188</td><td>564,064</td><td>554,501</td><td>564,064</td></tr><tr><td>Leitrim</td><td>393,488</td><td>350,446</td><td>524,650</td><td>516,759</td><td>524,650</td></tr><tr><td>Limerick</td><td>1,639,070</td><td>1,632,216</td><td>2,185,427</td><td>2,184,407</td><td>2,185,427</td></tr><tr><td>Longford</td><td>383,669</td><td>364,255</td><td>511,559</td><td>506,590</td><td>511,559</td></tr><tr><td>Louth </td><td>965,881</td><td>942,742</td><td>1,287,841</td><td>1,287,708</td><td>1,287,841</td></tr><tr><td>Mayo</td><td>930,908</td><td>905,177</td><td>1,241,211</td><td>1,231,150</td><td>1,241,211</td></tr><tr><td>Meath </td><td>235,799</td><td>234,470</td><td>371,072</td><td>367,624</td><td>371,072</td></tr><tr><td>Monaghan</td><td>464,453</td><td>457,608</td><td>619,271</td><td>614,852</td><td>619,271</td></tr><tr><td>Offaly </td><td>553,736</td><td>541,373</td><td>738,314</td><td>731,383</td><td>738,314</td></tr><tr><td>Roscommon</td><td>448,762</td><td>442,318</td><td>598,350</td><td>595,357</td><td>598,350</td></tr><tr><td>Sligo </td><td>439,136</td><td>408,552</td><td>585,514</td><td>585,502</td><td>585,514</td></tr><tr><td>Tipperary</td><td>841,838</td><td>835,573</td><td>1,122,450</td><td>1,105,851</td><td>1,122,450</td></tr><tr><td>Waterford</td><td>823,835</td><td>813,254</td><td>1,098,446</td><td>1,095,322</td><td>1,098,446</td></tr><tr><td>Westmeath</td><td>574,661</td><td>559,975</td><td>766,215</td><td>755,392</td><td>766,215</td></tr><tr><td>Wexford</td><td>1,276,311</td><td>1,272,246</td><td>1,701,748</td><td>1,698,940</td><td>1,701,748</td></tr><tr><td>Wicklow</td><td>972,584</td><td>921,279</td><td>1,296,777</td><td>1,288,405</td><td>1,296,777</td></tr></table></p></reply>

My main focus currently in respect of these grants is in seeking to spread their benefits by further increasing the funding, as has been done for 2017, with a 6% increase bringing an overall funding availability of &euro;59.8m nationally.  Some 8,000 households benefitted under this Scheme in 2016, and with this additional funding, an increased number of households should benefit in 2017.</p>  <p>  There are no current plans to increase the upper limit of the grant from &euro;30,000. The average individual amount paid under this grant is already lower than the &euro;30,000 upper limit and the current arrangement, therefore, serves to spread the benefits of the available funding to a higher number of recipients.</p></reply>
