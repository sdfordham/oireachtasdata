Irish Water is responsible for water services infrastructure including water supply pipes or sewers extending from a waterworks or waste water works to the curtilage of a private property.  Under sections 43 and 54 of the Water Services Act 2007, responsibility for maintenance and replacement of any water or wastewater pipes, connections or distribution systems which are located within the boundary of a private property rests with the owner.  This was the position that pertained prior to the establishment of Irish Water when individual local authorities held responsibility for public water services and infrastructure. </p>  <p>  While the legal position is set out in the 2007 Act, my Department is engaging with Irish Water to set out clearly the respective responsibilities of Irish Water and property owners in relation to water supply and wastewater infrastructure.  As a special measure to encourage water conservation, funding has been provided to Irish Water for a first fix scheme which is offered to customers where high levels of leakage on watermains on the customer side are identified as part of the metering programme.</p></reply>

The Housing Adaptation Grants provide a strong level of funding to support older people for the continued independent occupancy of their own homes . There are three types of grants available  as follows:</p>  <p>-  The Housing Aid for Older People , which provides grants of up to &euro;8,000 to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out;   </p>  <p>-   The Housing Adaptation Grant for People with a Disability which assists people with a disability to have necessary adaptations, repairs or improvement works carried out in order to make their accommodation more suitable for their needs ;</p>  <p>-  The Mobility Aids Grant , which fast tracks grants to cover a basic suite of works to address the mobility problems of a member of a household. </p>  <p>  I am aware of the social benefit accruing from these grants and, for 2016, there is a total of &euro;56.25 million in available funding, which is an increase of some 10% over last year.  This will see over 8,000 households receiving grant aid this year, contributing significantly to the scope for people to live independently in their own homes, including those leaving hospitals.  I am committed to ensuring that these grants continue to be well funded in future years.</p></reply>

Ultimately, a shortage of supply of houses and apartments to buy and rent is at the heart of the challenges in the housing sector. The plan will build on what the previous Government has already done and will draw on the work of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The Plan will include further actions to expedite and boost supply of all types of housing in the immediate, medium and longer-terms.  Under the Social Housing Strategy 2020 , targets have been set for each local authority out to 2017.  Importantly, local authorities and approved housing bodies have a strong pipeline of construction, turnkey and acquisition projects, which will deliver some 3,900 homes, with approved budget costs of some &euro;680 million.  It is my ambition that the delivery of these homes will be accelerated and that the targets will be exceeded.   </p>  <p>  In addition , a   programme of rapid-delivery housing provision is also being implemented to mitigate the acute issues associated with homeless ness.  The units will provide accommodation for those families currently in hotels in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Again, it is my ambition to accelerate and expand the rapid delivery programme.   </p>  <p>  These and a range of other measures required to address the overall issue of housing supply will be set out in the finalised &ldquo;Action Plan for Housing&rdquo;.</p></reply>

The 10 principles on which the planning system in Ireland is based are set out clearly in my Department&rsquo;s Planning Policy Statement published in 2015.  Principle No.3 , which is particularly relevant to the issue raised by the Deputy, states:  <i>&lsquo;Planning is about creating communities and further developing existing communities in a sustainable manner by securing high quality urban design through the design, delivery and co-ordination of new development providing a good quality of life for all existing and future users of land and buildings.&rsquo;</i></p><p>My Department has issued a number of Planning Guidelines aimed at ensuring that new housing development is well located and supported by the required infrastructure. Where planning authorities have not sufficiently taken account of these national guidelines, I have statutory power to direct a planning authority to amend a development plan under procedures set out in Section 31 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p><p>At a practical level, these principles are articulated in development plans and local area plans which set the local context for the assessment of new residential development proposals.  These statutory plans have evolved over recent years to become more sophisticated in identifying the supporting infrastructure, including community and recreational facilities, required to develop sustainable communities.  At local area plan level, they now include measures to phase appropriate housing development in conjunction with the identified infrastructure to ensure the creation of high quality places for our citizens to live. </p><p>An example of the type of integrated planning which I seek to support is the recent Government decision to designate Poolbeg West in the Dublin Docklands as a Strategic Development Zone under section 166 of the Planning and Development Act 2000.  Dublin City Council will now prepare a comprehensive planning scheme for the planned development of these lands, including in excess of 2000&ndash;2,500 new homes, as well as supporting social, educational and recreational infrastructure.  The process will be undertaken in full statutory consultation with the local community and other stakeholders involved.</p></reply>

In accordance with the provisions of the Pyrite Resolution Act 2013 , the Board is independent in the performance of its functions and neither the Minister nor I have any role in the operational matters pertaining to the implementation of the scheme.  Nevertheless, my Department is in regular contact with the Pyrite Resolution Board and the Housing Agency and is satisfied that the arrangements that are currently in place will facilitate the remediation of approximately 600 dwellings by the end of this year.</p><p>The latest figures available to meindicate that approximately 1,073 applications have been received under the pyrite remediation scheme of which 790 have been approved for inclusion . The position on these 790 cases is as follows: - </p><p>-  323 are at remedial works planning stage, </p><p>-  16 are at tender / tender analysis, </p><p>-  253 are under remediation, and </p><p>-  198 are complete.</p><p>Ultimately, the Board, together with the Housing Agency, will arrange for all eligible dwellings to be remediated to a high standard and at no additional cost to the affected homeowners.  Remediation works will continue to be carried out at the earliest possible opportunity having regard to the existing demands of the scheme and the optimum use of available resources.</p></reply>

This commitment extends to providing local authorities with the direct resources and expertise that they require in order to maximise the full range of delivery mechanisms available to them, whether that is through active land and site management, partnership with approved housing bodies in relation to construction or acquisition projects, or working with private landlords in the context of rental or leasing arrangements.</p>  <p>  While each Chief Executive is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible, my Department works closely with all the local authorities in relation to their overall resource requirements, including staffing.  To this end, my Department has sanctioned over 420 extra housing staff that are either in place or are in the process of being recruited by local authorities to work on the delivery of the Social Housing Strategy.  Funding towards the cost of these staff has also been provided through revised cost recoupment and financial arrangements between my Department and local authorities. </p>  <p>  Having met personally with local authority Chief Executives, I am confident that the challenge is firmly understood and the individual responsibility in relation to the specific local authority targets is clear.  I and my Department will continue to respond to resourcing requests as we drive forward methodologies and working practices that can accelerate and expedite delivery across the range of mechanisms.</p></reply>

The Report of the Pyrite Panel (June 2012) provided the overarching framework for the pyrite remediation scheme and its eligibility criteria are reflective of the conclusions and recommendations of that report.  The independent Pyrite Panel was clear in its view that only dwellings with significant damage due to pyritic heave should be remediated and that it would be unreasonable to expect dwellings not exhibiting such damage to be remediated unless or until they exhibit significant pyritic damage.  This remains the position with regard to dwellings which do not display significant pyritic damage.   </p>  <p>  The pyrite remediation scheme is a scheme of &ldquo;last resort&rdquo; and is limited in its application and scope.  The scheme is applicable to dwellings which are subject to significant damage attributable to pyritic heave established in accordance with I.S. 398-1:2013 - Reactive pyrite in sub-floor hardcore material &ndash; Part 1: Testing and categorisation protocol.  It is a condition of eligibility under the scheme that an application to the Board must be accompanied by a Building Condition Assessment with a Damage Condition Rating of 2. I have no proposals to amend this eligibility criterion.   </p>  <p>  While dwellings with a Damage Condition Rating of 1, or a 1 with progression, do not qualify under the scheme, some may be considered for inclusion at a later stage if the Board is satisfied that exceptional circumstances apply in accordance with the provisions of section 17 of the Act.  My Department also understands that, in a number of cases, dwellings which had a Damage Condition Rating of 1 when their Building Condition Assessments were first completed have now progressed to a Damage Condition Rating of 2; these dwellings have now been included in the pyrite remediation scheme.</p></reply>

The overall aim of the Directive is to maintain high and good status waters where they exist and to restore waters that do not currently adequately support aquatic ecosystems.  River basin management planning, structured in 6-year cycles, is the tool prescribed by the Directive for achieving these aims.  In July 2010, the first-cycle River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs) for Ireland were published, covering the period up to 2015.  The RBMPs, which were adopted by all the local authorities, describe the measures planned to protect and improve Ireland&rsquo;s water environment covering rivers, lakes, groundwater, transitional (estuarine) and coastal waters. </p>  <p>  Member States are required to outline in RBMPs the planned steps to implement Article 9 of the Water Framework Directive, which requires Member States to take account of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, in accordance with the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle.  This is in order to ensure that water pricing policies incentivise the efficient use of water resources and, thereby, contribute to achieving the environmental objectives of the Directive.  The first-cycle RBMPs set out the then Government&rsquo;s intention to introduce domestic water charges and this was recognised in the European Commission&rsquo;s 2012 report to the European Parliament and the European Council on the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Ireland.</p>  <p>  The second-cycle RBMPs for the period up to 2021 are in preparation at the moment, and the draft plans are due to be published in December 2016.  A six-month public consultation process will take place in the first half of 2017, and the finalised second-cycle RBMPs are due for completion by the end of 2017.  As such, the question of amending the second-cycle RBMPs does not immediately arise.   </p>  <p>  Nonetheless, it is clear that the RBMPs will have to take account of the Government&rsquo;s commitment, under the confidence and supply arrangement agreed in the context of facilitating the formation of the current Government, to introduce and support legislation in the Oireachtas within six weeks of its appointment to provide for the suspension of domestic water charges for a period of nine months from the end of the current billing cycle (that is, from 1 July 2016).  This will allow for the Oireachtas to decide on the enduring funding model for Irish Water upon consideration of the recommendations of an Expert Commission that is to be established within eight weeks of the Government&rsquo;s appointment.  The proposed details of the suspension will be set out in the legislation when published.</p>  <p>  I expect that the Expert Commission will take full account of the requirements of the Water Framework Directive in its deliberations and I look forward to a constructive process of engagement in this area in the coming months.</p></reply>

Feedback from these deliberations and from surveys of local authority members and chief executives suggests that the revised structures are generally operating well but will need more time to bed down fully.  The work of the Group is proceeding.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to the preparation of a report for Government and the Oireachtas by mid-2017 on potential measures to boost local government leadership and accountability and to ensure that local government funding, structures and responsibilities strengthen local democracy.  This will include consideration of specific issues such as directly elected mayors in cities, devolution of new powers to local authorities, size of local electoral areas, and town and borough councils.  The results of the recent operational review of the revised local government structures will provide a key input to inform the consideration of these issues. </p>  <p>  On the question of funding for the municipal districts, in 2014 General Purpose Grant allocations to local authorities were made in respect of the local authority area as a whole taking account of any former borough or town councils within the area.  To ease the transition of local authorities to new financial arrangements because of the move of water related costs from local authorities to Irish Water in 2014, and funding of local authorities from the Local Government Fund through the introduction of Local Property Tax in 2015, the Government decided that no local authority would receive less income from LPT in 2015 and 2016 than they received from their General Purpose Grant allocation in 2014. </p>  <p>  Accordingly, the LPT allocations for 2015 and 2016 take account of the historical General Purpose Grant funding provided to any former borough or town councils within the local authority area. It is a matter for the individual local authorities themselves to decide on their priorities for funding of services.</p></reply>

However, I believe that the key issue raised by the Deputy&rsquo;s Question relates to how we find ways to address current housing development and supply issues.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department is progressing a range of key actions aimed at addressing these very issues. It is clear that over the longer term we need a functioning housing supply system and availability and viability of large ready to go housing development sites, along with house builders capable of supplying, is a key part of that system.</p>  <p>  By mid-summer I intend to finalise an &ldquo;Action Plan for Housing&rdquo; which will look at all options to accelerate delivery of supply and ensure that we are building the right mix of housing types in the right locations and for the various categories of people that need housing, particularly in city centre areas, avoiding cities and towns expanding exponentially physically and creating a range of wider infrastructural challenges, such as in the schools and transport areas.  The preparation of the Plan will take account of the commitment in the Programme for a Partnership Government to review the CPO powers available to local authorities in order to fast-track the opening up of land.</p></reply>

The Government has enabled and facilitated NAMA in playing an important role in the delivery of housing supply generally and social housing in particular. In that context NAMA affords public bodies first option on the acquisition of land and property required for demonstrable public purposes.    In Budget 2016, the Minister for Finance announced that NAMA, having carried out a review of residentially zoned sites under the control of its debtors and receivers, is aiming to fund the delivery of a target 20,000 additional new homes before the end of 2020.</p>  <p>  With regard to land currently available for social housing development, the Housing Agency, in consultation with my Department and local authorities, is updating data and developing a detailed database and GIS map of local authority owned lands, as well as the Land Aggregation Scheme lands, showing their location, size, boundaries and other information.  This exercise has identified some 700 such sites nationally.  This map will be updated during the lifetime of the Social Housing Strategy to record the development and use of lands.</p></reply>

In fact, Chapter 2 and Page 16 in particular of the adopted GDA Transport Strategy, clearly set out where the strategy fits into an integrated spatial and transport planning hierarchy at national, regional and local levels.  In addition, the GDA Transport Strategy will be a factor in the preparation of the National Planning Framework (NPF) as the successor to the NSS and subsequent Regional Spatial and Economic Strategies (RSESs). </p>  <p>  The suggestion that the Strategy will impact adversely on job creation in Wicklow and the GDA is unsubstantiated.  Based on projected growth in population and employment, the Transport strategy identifies the East Wicklow M11 corridor as the most significantly growing part of the Region in terms of travel demand, outside the Dublin Docklands area and M4 corridor, much closer to Dublin City.</p>  <p>  It is critical that the Dublin City Region has a long term transport plan in place to guide and inform future strategy and investment decisions and to ensure that bottlenecks can be addressed before they become seriously damaging to the economy of the region and the country as a whole.  The ambition of and potential for growth in Wicklow can be best realised in the context of such a Regional strategy, through local implementation plans.</p></reply>

Close to one-third of households living in the sector are in receipt of housing support in the form of rent supplement or other State support and, as such , the sector is also of key importance for the provision of social housing.  This is recognised in the Social Housing Strategy 2020 goal to meet the needs of 75,000 households in the sector, primarily through the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) scheme.  Under the Strategy, the State will also take measures to enhance the capacity of the sector to contribute in a more sustainable and cost effective way to deliver social housing supports.</p>  <p>  A particular application of this is the roll-out of HAP on a phased basis to all local authority areas.  HAP is currently operational in 19 local authority areas with more than 9,000 households currently in receipt of housing support under the scheme.  The scheme provides for a better integrated and more streamlined service for households seeking support from the State and gives local authorities greater flexibility to provide assistance to those in need of social housing support.  HAP provides a stronger and more secure form of State housing support in the private rental sector. </p>  <p>  HAP also provides households with the opportunity to move to other forms of social housing as they become available, by accessing the local authority transfer list.  The scheme also avoids a potential poverty trap and incentivises people to work, by providing for recipients to work full-time but to retain benefits.</p>  <p>  The Government also recognises that, in order to meet the housing needs of varying household types, more options beyond full State social housing or full private home ownership or rental are required.  In that regard, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to delivering an Affordable Rental pilot scheme within the first 100 days of this Government.  The scheme, which will be a priority for delivery under the &lsquo;Action Plan for Housing&rsquo; being prepared by the Government, is currently being developed in my Department.</p>  <p>  &euro;10m has been made available for the scheme in 2016.  This is to be an on-going annual commitment to secure a long term increase in the supply of housing for affordable rental.  The scheme is expected to work on the basis of tenants paying the majority of the rental cost from their own resources, with the State helping to meet the shortfall. It is intended that the scheme would be made available to employed households on low to moderate incomes.</p>  <p>  With regard to the operation of the private rental sector more generally, the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) Act 2015 introduced a series of major reforms to the private rental sector in Ireland, by providing rent certainty and safeguards for both tenants and landlords.  My intention is to build on that, by developing a national policy for the private rented sector to support the creation of a vibrant sector underpinned by greater security of tenure, a more stable investment framework and measures to support greater supply in key demand areas.</p></reply>

A housing authority may provide short-term emergency housing to persons who are forced to leave their homes because of domestic violence, without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s housing waiting list.  Such support can be provided where victims of domestic violence meet the homeless definition set out in the Housing Act 1988, which is not prescriptive and in practice will generally include victims of domestic violence.  </p>  <p>  Where a social housing assessment is an appropriate longer-term response to a case of domestic violence, the household concerned may be determined by the relevant housing authority to be in need of social housing support where, in accordance with the Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011, the authority considers that the household&rsquo;s current accommodation is unsuitable in terms of adequate housing provision, having regard to particular household circumstances or exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.  This allows a housing authority to consider a victim of domestic violence as having a housing need and to be placed on a housing list, subject to the household meeting all other eligibility criteria. </p>  <p>  In the past there may have been difficulties for separated persons in meeting the alternative accommodation eligibility criterion for social housing support where no deed of separation existed and no determination had been made as to the future of the family home. In order to provide more flexibility to housing authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was amended in 2014 to allow authorities to provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement.</p></reply>

For the year 2020 itself, the target set for Ireland is that emissions should be 20 per cent below their value in 2005.  This is jointly the most demanding 2020 reduction target allocated under the ESD and one shared only by Denmark and Luxembourg.  The 2013 target is based on the average of emissions for the years 2008-2010.  The target for each of the years 2014 through 2019 is on a straight-line trajectory between the targets for 2013 and 2020, and surpluses in one year can be used to cover deficits in any subsequent year.  The average incidence of these targets is a 12% reduction relative to 2005. </p>  <p>  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published in March 2016 projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland&rsquo;s emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6-11% below 2005 levels.  On a cumulative basis, Ireland will have a deficit of between 4 and 12 Megatonnes Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e).  The projections suggest that Ireland may have a cumulative deficit of units in 2018 or 2019.  Some of this deficit can be addressed by means of the retirement of units carried forward from the 2008-2012 period, and some additional purchases may be required depending on the outturn.  It is not possible to quantify these at present, having regard to both the quantum and price of carbon units to be purchased at the time.</p>  <p>  A Member State demonstrating compliance with an annual target retires Annual Emissions Allocations (units from the Kyoto Protocol Flexible Mechanisms) approximately 18 months after the year end, so it is unlikely that any expenditure required will occur before 2020 at the earliest. </p>  <p>  The extent of the challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with our EU and international commitments, is well understood by the Government, as reflected in the National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 which was enacted in December 2015.  The National Policy Position provides a high-level policy direction for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050. Statutory authority for the plans is set out in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. </p>  <p>  In accordance with Section 4 of the Act, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must submit a National Mitigation Plan to Government for approval by June 2017 at the latest.  Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050.  The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that. </p>  <p>  The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this low carbon transition vision by 2050.  In that context, the National Mitigation Plan will have regard to Ireland&rsquo;s obligations under the current 2009 Effort Sharing Decision, the Paris Agreement and any likely future EU and international obligations that may arise, including new national targets to be agreed under the 2030 climate and energy package.   </p>  <p>  The Paris Agreement sets out a long term goal to put the world on track to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.  In this regard it is noted that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been tasked with evaluating what will be the specific policy implications of this goal with a special report to be published in 2018.  Notwithstanding this, the overall outcome of the Paris Conference means that the long-term objective that Ireland has already established in the National Policy Position, and that is now underpinned by the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, namely to pursue substantial decarbonisation of the energy, transport and built environment sectors as well as pursuing neutrality in the land sector, will now be undertaken within a broader international context.</p>  <p>  This means that the more ambitious actions that will be required over time can be taken on the basis of shared experience and cooperation with other States and regions, in the knowledge that all countries will be moving in the same direction, crucial for a small open economy like Ireland&rsquo;s that competes in global markets.</p></reply>

The strategy is a whole of Government approach aimed at combatting domestic and sexual violence and its implementation is a priority for my Department.  Many of the strategy's actions are the responsibility of other Government Departments and agencies.  The strategy was devised in such a way that all of the actions in the strategy can be delivered within current resource allocations.  As stated in the Strategy at the time of publication the Strategy's action plan is intended to be a living document which will continue to be revised, added to and updated on an ongoing basis.

However, it is important to remember that the incidents at issue took place some time ago and there have been widespread reforms and improvements to Garda practices in the intervening years.</p>  <p>  The new Garda training programme which is being rolled out to recruits since 2014 will significantly address the supervision and note taking weaknesses which Mr Justice O'Higgins found.  Under the Trainee/Probationer Programmes in phase 2 of the training programme, the trainee Garda&iacute; are allocated to stations with a permanently appointed supervisory Sergeant who is thoroughly familiar with their responsibilities. In addition, the new training provides for enhanced opportunities to equip the trainees in the full range of policing skills, including opportunities to solve authentic policing problems. In Phase 3 of the Programme, a module is specifically devoted to Crime and Incident Policing.   </p>  <p>  There are comprehensive procedures around the supervision of front-line Garda&iacute;.  The ranks of Garda Sergeant and Inspector have primary responsibility for Garda front line supervision, and their roles are set out clearly in the Garda Code.

We consider the UPR process, by which the international community holds each UN Member State to account in relation to its individual human rights record, as a real and practical expression of the fact that human rights are not solely of domestic concern, but rather a legitimate concern of the international community. </p>  <p>  In this constructive spirit, Ireland engages actively in the UPR of other States and we were pleased that 93 other States took the opportunity to intervene in the UPR of Ireland.  I and the members of the delegation that I led listened carefully and with an open mind to all 262 recommendations made during the review of Ireland.  We were able to confirm immediately that 152 recommendations have been accepted, 13 recommendations are not accepted and that we will constructively examine the remaining 97 recommendations and provide our responses for the 33rd Human Rights Council session in September 2016.   </p>  <p>  As mentioned in Ireland&rsquo;s National and Interim Reports, the Government is firmly committed to combatting and challenging any and all manifestations of racism.  We recognise that the impact of hate crime is devastating; being the target of a crime simply for being who you are, or for being perceived as &ldquo;other&rdquo; is unacceptable and cannot be tolerated.</p>  <p>  There are robust mechanisms in place in legislation to deal with discrimination, hate speech and racist crime.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 makes it an offence, inter alia, to use words, publish or distribute written material, or broadcast any visual images or sounds which are threatening, abusive or insulting and are intended, or, having regard to all the circumstances, are likely to stir up hatred. The word "hatred" is defined as "hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the Travelling community or sexual orientation".</p>  <p>  In addition, where criminal offences such as assault, criminal damage, or public order offences are committed against a person based on their race, religion or belief, the offences are prosecuted as generic offences through the wider criminal law. However, a racist or religious motivation, for example, may be taken into account as an aggravating factor at sentencing. </p>  <p>  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I recently approved a review of the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act 1989 in the light of reports by civil society, international obligations and the experience of other jurisdictions, given the age of the legislation, the changes in Irish society and the use of the internet and social media since its enactment.  The outcome of this review will inform the case for legislative change.</p></reply>

I will be working closely with my Government colleagues in the coming months towards achievement of these aims.</p><p>The position is that the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, which came into operation on 1 December 2009, applies only to mortgages created after that date and any amendments to this legislation would not be effective in dealing with cases of mortgage arrears which are coming before the courts. For that reason, I would like to draw the Deputy's attention that a number of measures have already been put in place with the aim of providing assistance to those finding themselves in mortgage arrears. These include: </p><p>-  enactment on 28 July 2015 of the Personal Insolvency (Amendment) Act 2015, and commencement on 20 November 2015 of the new Court review procedure under section 115A which applies to cases in which lending institutions refuse a personal insolvency proposal on the borrower&rsquo;s home;</p><p>-  development of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) as the Government&rsquo;s &lsquo;one-stop shop&rsquo; point of information and guidance for homeowners in mortgage arrears, working closely with the Insolvency Service; </p><p>-  establishment and staffing of Dedicated Mortgage Arrears MABS centres in key locations with nationwide coverage, which offer specialised expertise on mortgage debt; and</p><p>-  the presence of MABS and the Insolvency Service at courthouses to provide information and &lsquo;signposting&rsquo; support for householders issued with repossession proceedings involving their homes (operating nationwide since 1 October last, following a successful pilot in July 2015). This initiative is facilitated by the Courts Service, and is currently provided for all Circuit Court repossession hearings. </p><p>In addition, the Government will shortly be putting in place a new Government-funded Scheme to help those who are insolvent, and in mortgage arrears on their home, to access independent expert financial and legal advice.  The new scheme has 3 components:</p><p><b><i>Provision of financial advice and assistance </i></b></p><p>This involves the provision of advice and assistance from a Personal Insolvency Practitioner, or other financial adviser as appropriate, drawn from panels agreeing to provide specified levels and amounts of services under the Scheme at fixed cost. This will be provided without cost to an insolvent borrower, under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and will be accessed through MABS working in conjunction with the Insolvency Service and the accountancy bodies. </p><p><b><i>Provision of legal advice and assistance</i></b></p><p>This involves the provision of advice and assistance from a solicitor, drawn from panels to be set up by the Legal Aid Board, who agrees to provide specified levels and amounts of services under the Scheme at fixed cost. The scheme will provide assistance and representation for insolvent borrowers in repossession proceedings involving their home, via a panel of &lsquo;duty solicitors&rsquo; at repossession hearings, operated by the Legal Aid Board. </p><p>Again, this assistance will be provided without cost to an insolvent borrower, under a &lsquo;voucher&rsquo; system, and will be accessed through MABS, working in conjunction with the Legal Aid Board.</p><p><b><i>Provision of legal aid</i></b></p><p>This involves the provision for legal aid for insolvent borrowers seeking the new Court review under s. 115A Personal Insolvency Acts, where a borrower&rsquo;s proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement including mortgage arrears on their home is refused by their creditors. This component will be operated by the Legal Aid Board. </p><p>The overall objective of the new Scheme is to help those who are unable to pay their debts in full as they fall due and are in serious mortgage arrears on their homes, to access independent expert financial and/or legal advice and assistance, which will help them to find the best possible solutions, with the aim of remaining in their homes where possible.</p></reply>

As such, the reports include details of, inter alia, the number of incidents and individual children and young people referred to the Diversion Programme and the outcomes of such referrals.  The reports also include details in relation to the resources deployed by the Garda Commissioner to support the operation of the Programme. </p>  <p>  Arrangements in relation to the publication of the 2014 Report of the Monitoring Committee are currently being finalised.  In its 2014 Report the Committee reports that 9,991 children and young people were referred to the Diversion Programme.  This compares with 10,420 children and young people referred in 2013 and continues the downward trend in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years.  The Committee also reports that in 2014 there were one hundred and twenty three Juvenile Liaison Officers (JLO), including eight Sergeants. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is compiling figures on the number of JLOs by county and this will be provided to the Deputy directly once completed.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, the Garda Diversion Programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the Diversion Programme, through the network of JLOs, is to deal with young people who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the young offender away from the Courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending. The Programme embraces, whenever possible, the principles of restorative justice and, at all times, pays the highest regard to the needs of victims. The Programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting children and young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to them and their families.  This is evident from the continuing fall in the number of children and young people referred to the Programme in recent years. </p>  <p>  The work of the JLOs is supported by my Department through the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) which funds and oversees over 100 Garda Youth Diversion Projects (GYDPs) across the country.  In this regard the Programme for Government includes a commitment to extend the network of Garda Youth Diversion Projects for young people promoting restorative justice approaches. Six of the GYDPs currently funded by my Department also incorporate Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) projects.  GYDPs are community based multi-agency crime prevention initiatives which primarily seek to divert young people who have become involved in criminal or anti-social behaviour.  There are currently one hundred and three of these projects in place nationally with an additional seven due to come into full operation very shortly.  The projects aim to bring about the conditions whereby the behavioural patterns of young people towards law and order can develop and mature through positive interventions and interaction with the project. The projects are particularly targeted at 12-17 year old &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; youths in communities where a specific need has been identified and where there is a risk of them remaining within the criminal justice system. </p>  <p>  In addition, the work of the Probation Service is supported through a national network of community based Young Person Probation Projects (YPPs) which are also funded by my Department through the IYJS.  Nationally, there are 16 YPPs developing  and delivering  services to young offenders in their communities. The management and monitoring of the YPP projects is undertaken directly by the Probation Service. These projects offer services to offenders who would otherwise not be in a position to avail of a mainstream service opportunity, thereby enhancing the work of the Probation Service in changing offending behaviour. The services provided by YPP projects to young offenders in local communities include training and education programmes, offender management programmes, residential accommodation, and drug and alcohol treatment programmes, the purpose of which is to address offending behaviours and reduce the likelihood of re-offending. </p>  <p>  Just under &euro;17 million has been allocated in 2016 to the IYJS through my Department to support the operation of all of these community based projects.  The funding to support the GYDPs and several YPPs is part supported by the Government and the European Social Fund as part of the ESF Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning 2014-2020. In addition, some &euro;2.8 million additional funding has been provided in 2016 to further support a number of Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Youth Diversion and Probation Service projects under the Dormant Accounts Scheme.</p></reply>

The transport of passengers and their accompanying baggage is exempt from VAT in Ireland under an historic derogation, while in the majority of other EU Member States VAT is charged on public transport. In this respect, rural public transport services are exempt from VAT, where VAT is not charged on the transport. This also includes the hiring of a bus or coach with a driver.</p><p>While persons who are VAT exempt cannot recover any VAT incurred on goods and services incurred in relation to their business such as, fuel, tyres and mechanic charges, there is a special provision within the VAT code to allow a refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of touring coaches. Under VAT Refund Order SI. 266 of 2012, coach operators who are exempt from VAT may, subject to the conditions in the Order, be entitled to a refund of the VAT paid on the purchase of touring coaches that are no more than 2 years old and are within specified dimensions.</p><p>With regard to removing VAT from bus tyres, the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. It is not possible under EU VAT law to remove VAT from the supply of tyres.</p><p>Buses are assigned to VRT category C (commercial vehicles, buses and mini-buses with a seat capacity above 10). This category currently enjoys a greatly reduced rate of VRT, at a flat rate of &euro;200.  Category C vehicles are not subject to the carbon emissions-based graded scale of VRT, as applies to private cars. Private cars are subject to VRT rates ranging from 14% to 36% of the open market selling price of the vehicle. Therefore depending on the open market selling price of the car, and its carbon emissions grade, VRT can cost up to over 1/3 of the price of a new car. The current VRT rate applied to category C vehicles is therefore very significantly lower than that applied to private cars.</p><p>Motor tax rates applied to large public service vehicles are already subject to relatively favourable rates. The current rates are contained in the following table:<table><tr><th>Seating Capacity</th><th>Annual &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>9 - 20</td><td>154</td></tr><tr><td>21 - 40</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>41 - 60</td><td>403</td></tr><tr><td>61 or more</td><td>403</td></tr></table></p><p>The policy in this area is a matter for the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p>I have also introduced a diesel rebate scheme which offers a partial refund of excise, depending on the price of fuel, for qualifying road transport operators including passenger transport operators.</p><p>Most vehicles (excluding cars) qualify for wear and tear allowances as plant and machinery under section 284 TCA 1997 at the rate of 12.5% per annum.  This allows 100% of the purchase cost to be written down over a period of 8 years.</p><p>As regards income tax incentives for the purchase of commuter bus passes, the Deputy may be aware of the Travel Pass (Taxsaver) scheme. The scheme operates on the basis that an employer pays for the Travel Pass on behalf of an employee at the start of the year and the payment is deducted from the employee's emoluments over the course of the year. The incentive operates on the basis that, although such a payment out of an employee's income should be made out of after-tax income, section 118B of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides that the remuneration foregone shall be exempt from tax. This has the effect of reducing the cost of the Travel Pass to the employee by the amount of tax that would have been paid on the equivalent amount of income at the employee's marginal rate (the highest rate of tax at which the employee is paying tax). In this way the employee, over the course of a year, only suffers the net cost of the Travel Pass, deducted on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis, with the total initial cost met by his or her employer.</p></reply>

Therefore, the services of private bus transport operators are exempt from VAT. Persons whose services are exempt from VAT are not required to register for VAT or charge VAT on the supply of their services. This means that they cannot recover VAT in relation to their business costs including those referred to by the Deputy such as the purchase of fuel, lubricants and tyres.</p><p>While private bus operators whose services are VAT exempt cannot recover VAT incurred on the purchase of goods and services, I would point out that there is a special provision to allow a refund of VAT incurred on the purchase of touring coaches. Under VAT Refund Order S.I. 266 of 2012, coach operators who are exempt from VAT may, subject to the conditions of the order, be entitled to a refund of the VAT paid on touring coaches that are no more than 2 years old and are within specified dimensions.</p><p>The Deputy has pointed out the different VAT treatment of private bus operators between Ireland and the UK. The VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law, primarily Council Directive 2006/112/EC. VAT law in Ireland and the UK must comply with the EU VAT Directive. As passenger transport was exempt in Ireland on 1 January 1978, it is possible under the VAT Directive to continue to apply that exemption. As passenger transport services were charged at the zero rate in the UK on 1 January 1991, the UK are entitled to continue to apply a zero rate to passenger transport services. It is not possible under EU law for Ireland to apply a zero rate to the services of private bus operators as we did not apply a zero rate to them in 1991. Further to this, the rate of excise duty applied to diesel is 48c per litre, this compares favourably against the rate of excise in Northern Ireland which is 74c (as of 12 May 2016). Revenue conducted a cross border price survey on 12 May and a litre of diesel was 22c more expensive in Northern Ireland. I have also introduced a diesel rebate scheme which offers a partial refund of excise, depending on the price of fuel, for qualifying road transport operators including passenger transport operators.</p><p>Information furnished on statutory VAT returns does not require details of the VAT yield from particular sectors to be identified. It is therefore not possible to give an estimate of the loss to the exchequer of VAT if the private bus operators had an entitlement to reclaim the VAT incurred on their business costs. However, a flat rate of &euro;200 Vehicle Registration Tax applies to Category C vehicles which includes minibuses and large buses. The motor tax rates applied to large public service vehicles are subject to relatively favourable rates.  The current rates are contained in the following table:<table><tr><th>Seating Capacity</th><th>Annual &euro;</th></tr><tr><td>9 - 20</td><td>154</td></tr><tr><td>21 - 40</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>41 - 60</td><td>403</td></tr><tr><td>61 or more</td><td>403</td></tr></table></p></reply>

The Senior Medical Officer for the relevant local Health Service Executive administrative area makes a professional clinical determination as to whether an individual applicant satisfies the medical criteria. A successful applicant is provided with a Primary Medical Certificate, which is required under the Regulations to claim the reliefs provided for in the Regulations. An unsuccessful applicant can appeal the decision of the Senior Medical Officer to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, which makes a new clinical determination in respect of the individual. The Regulations mandate that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions to ensure the integrity of its clinical determinations. After six months a citizen can reapply if there is a deterioration in their condition.</p>  <p>  To qualify for the Scheme an applicant must be in possession of a Primary Medical Certificate. To obtain a Primary Medical Certificate, an applicant must be permanently and severely disabled within the terms of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994 and satisfy one of the following conditions:</p>  <p> -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs;</p>  <p> -  be wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs;</p>  <p> -  be without both hands or without both arms;</p>  <p> -  be without one or both legs;</p>  <p> -  be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg;</p>  <p> -  have the medical condition of dwarfism and have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs. </p>  <p>  The Scheme represents a significant tax expenditure. Between the Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT foregone, and the repayment of excise on fuel used by members of the Scheme, the Scheme represented a cost of &euro;50.3 million to the Exchequer in 2015, an increase from &euro;48.6 million in 2014. These figures do not include the revenue foregone to the Local Government Fund in the respect of the relief from Motor Tax provided to members of the Scheme.</p>  <p>  I understand that there are sympathetic cases of individuals, such as those who have suffered a stroke, that do not come within the remit of the Scheme. Furthermore I recognise the important role that the Scheme plays in expanding the mobility of citizens with disabilities. I have managed to maintain the relief at current levels throughout the crisis despite the requirement for significant fiscal consolidation. Unfortunately, the current context is still one of constrained resources. In the still challenging fiscal environment and given the scale and scope of the Scheme, I have no plans to expand the medical criteria beyond the six currently provided for in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></reply>

The purpose of the relief is to encourage more landowners to lease out land on a long term basis to active farmers thereby encouraging more productive use of the land. The farm land must be used by the lessee for the purpose of carrying on a trade of farming or market gardening (the occupation of land as a nursery or garden for the purpose of growing produce for sale.) </p><p>Land in use for afforestation is not market garden land and is therefore not considered to be occupied for the purpose of husbandry. Similarly, land in use for the planting and harvesting of Christmas trees is treated as woodland for tax purposes as opposed to farm land. Therefore the exemption will not be available in respect of long term leases of land for afforestation or Christmas tree production. However, under Section 232 of the TCA, a separate tax exemption is available in respect of profits or gains arising from the occupation of woodlands which are managed on a commercial basis.</p><p>In relation to land leased to a company for solar energy generation, in general, such a company would not be considered to be carrying on a trade of farming and therefore would not be a qualifying lessee for the purpose of the exemption.

However, I would point out that the number of mortgages in negative equity is reducing. As noted in the Spring Quarterly Economic Commentary published by the ESRI, the numbers of mortgages in negative equity has fallen below 100,000 for the first time since 2008. This figure had been above 300,000 in 2011.</p><p>With regard to the taxation of rental income, the Deputy will be aware that landlords are liable to tax on their net rental profit after deduction of allowable letting expenses, and not on the gross rental income received. A landlord may be allowed a deduction of 75% of the interest paid on borrowed money used to purchase, improve or repair rented premises when calculating rental income. There are also a number of other allowances and deductions available to reduce the tax on rental income paid including the cost of maintenance, repairs, insurance and management of the property, and the cost to the landlord of any goods provided or services rendered to a tenant.</p><p>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has published a guide to the income tax treatment of rental income. It sets out the amount of rental income to be taken account of for income tax purposes and provides a comprehensive list of expenditure items that are allowable for deduction in computing rental income for tax purposes. This guide is available at: <i></i>.</p><p>The Deputy may also be aware that in Finance Act 2015 I introduced a new relief which will allow a full 100% mortgage interest deduction where a landlord undertakes, for a period of at least three years, to provide accommodation to tenants in receipt of social housing supports and registers such undertakings with the Private Residential Tenancies Board within certain time limits. Further information on this relief is available in section 97 of the Revenue Commissioners Notes for Guidance Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 Finance Act 2015 Edition Part 4 Principal Provisions Relating to the Schedule D charge, which is available at:</p><p><i></i>.</p><p>Furthermore, the taxation of all rental property in the State is dealt with under the same legislation, and an attempt to carve out a cohort of 'accidental' landlords would therefore prove problematic. There are many reasons why individuals might choose, or feel obliged, to let out a property which they own while also renting a separate property for their own accommodation, and all are treated equally by the tax system. The provision of additional tax deductions to one sub-set of landlords could also create difficulties in the rental marketplace as a result of the advantage obtained over other landlords of similar residential property.</p><p>As regards future measures, the Programme for Government contains a commitment, working with the Oireachtas, to publish a medium-term income tax reform plan for consultation with the Oireachtas Committee on Finance. The focus of the plan is to be on keeping the tax base broad, while reducing excessive tax rates for middle income earners, including landlords, and limiting the benefit for high earners.</p></reply>

The Fund also commits to operating to high international standards, investing in line with both the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which focus on the management of environmental, social and governance factors to improve sustainability of investment returns, and the Santiago Principles, which are the globally accepted best practice principles for sovereign investment funds. </p>  <p>  To-date, any exclusions from the Fund on the basis of ethical considerations are those mandated by legislation. In this regard the only relevant legislation impacting on the Fund's investments is the Cluster Munitions and Anti-Personnel Mines Act 2008. </p>  <p>  In relation to carbon neutral and carbon negative energy funds, the ISIF has a close working relationship with the Department of Communications, Climate Change &amp;amp; Natural Resources and is committed to investing in the energy sector is a manner that is consistent with the State's commitment to make the transition to a low carbon, climate resilient and sustainable economy. This State commitment is reflected in the Climate Change and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 and in the Paris Agreement, signed recently by Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government on Ireland's behalf.</p>  <p>  In line with its investment strategy, the Fund has been seeking investments that are consistent with broader Government policy and, in particular, the theme of decarbonisation. </p>  <p>  To date the Fund's investment commitments in this regard include:</p>  <p> - significant investments in renewable energy generation - via a joint venture with NTR, via an investment in the Irish Infrastructure Trust and via financing of Gaelectric and Mainstream Renewable Power by Bluebay SME Credit Fund (in which ISIF has been the cornerstone investor);</p>  <p> - Dublin Waste to Energy project, which will have capacity to process up to 600,000 tonnes of waste when complete and generate clean renewable energy for up to 80,000 homes;</p>  <p> - forestry; and</p>  <p> - a designer and manufacturer of high power density high efficiency power supplies.</p>  <p>  I am informed by the NTMA that it will continue to seek out further investments for the Fund that are consistent with its mandate and are aligned with national decarbonisation and energy security objectives and with the Government's broader energy policy. The investment pipeline for the Fund currently includes possible opportunities in the areas of biomass, wind, waste management and solar.</p>  <p>  The Fund's current investment holdings in fossil fuel companies are among the legacy global investments inherited from its predecessor fund, the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), which are being gradually sold over a period of years to finance investments in Ireland, as they materialise. </p>  <p>  The National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014 also provides that the Fund shall review its investment strategy after 18 months of operation and that in reviewing its investment strategy shall consult with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and that the Minister for Finance may consult with other Government Ministers as appropriate.  The issue of whether legislative changes are required in relation to any aspect of the Fund's investment strategy will be considered as part of the review to be conducted in the second half of 2016.</p></reply>

Section 89 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act (CATCA) 2003 provides for 'agricultural relief'. The relief takes the form of a 90% reduction in the taxable market value of the gifted or inherited agricultural property.</p>  <p>  The person taking the gift or inheritance (the 'beneficiary') of the agricultural property must qualify as a 'farmer' for the purpose of section 89 CATCA 2003. This means that a beneficiary's agricultural property must comprise 80% by gross market value of the beneficiary's total property at a particular date. The Revenue Commissioners take the view that land that is used for the production of renewable energy (such as solar panels) is not agricultural property for the purpose of establishing whether or not a beneficiary satisfies this '80%' test. Thus, depending on the particular proportions of both agricultural and non-agricultural property comprised in a gift or inheritance, the use of agricultural land for the production of renewable energy  may result in a beneficiary's failure to satisfy the '80%' test and to qualify for agricultural relief.</p>  <p>  A condition for agricultural relief that applies in relation to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 1 January 2015 is that a beneficiary, or a lessee where the beneficiary leases the agricultural land, must actually farm the land for a period of at least six years after taking the gift or inheritance. As it would not generally be possible to farm any land on which equipment for the production of renewable energy is installed, the change in the use of land from farming to the production of renewable energy within the required six-year period would result in a withdrawal of some, or all, of any agricultural relief that had been granted, depending on how much of the land is diverted to this alternative use.</p></reply>

However, such engagement is dependent on open and honest discussion by the taxpayer, including a clear commitment to agree a solution. Revenue advise me that the persons concerned failed to engage with them in regard to a tax debt due. The consequences of non-compliance and failure to engage with Revenue are that interest is due on late payment and sheriff fees are payable where the debt is referred to the sheriff for collection.  The persons concerned would have been aware of Revenue's intention to enforce collection of the debt in the event of non-engagement and that is what happened in this instance.</p>  <p>  I am advised that while the tax due has since been paid, the sheriff's fees and interest are still due.

The exclusion of aircraft investment would therefore have no impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio. The majority of intangible investment is also imported. In fact, the substantial increase in intangible investment in 2015 was mainly attributable to the bringing onshore of intellectual property assets which were imported throughout the year. However, as the CSO does not publish data on the exact import content of intangible investment it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the impact of excluding intangible investment on the debt-to-GDP ratio.</p></reply>

In addition, as per Section 60(3) of the NAMA, assets remaining at the eventual dissolution of NAMA will be transferred to the Minister or paid into the Exchequer.</p>  <p>  NAMA is currently progressing its objectives, which includes funding the delivery of 20,000 residential housing units, on a commercial and profit maximising basis, by end 2020, on sites securing NAMA's loans.</p>  <p>  Any surplus funds paid into the Exchequer following the wind-up of NAMA would most likely be recorded in the General Government accounts as a withdrawal of equity under Eurostat rules.  This means that such proceeds would not count as General Government Revenue and, therefore, have no beneficial impact on Ireland's General Government Balance (GGB). Furthermore, it will not have any effect on the calculation of available fiscal space.</p>  <p>  If NAMA hands over any remaining assets to the Minister for Finance, this would most likely be recorded as a withdrawal of equity in kind and similarly would have no impact on GGB or available fiscal space.  The use of such assets will be a matter for the Minister and the Government when and if there is such a transfer.</p></reply>

As the Deputy is aware, all post primary schools receive at least 100mbts connectivity through a programme undertaken jointly between the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources (now the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources) and my Department. That programme is now fully funded and operated by this Department.</p><p>  Through the Schools Broadband Access Programme, the Department provides for the supply of internet connectivity for all recognised schools. A framework involving 14 providers was put in place in 2012 which has ensured improved solutions are available to primary schools. The most recent draw down off the framework last September saw approximately 90% of school connections retendered, with over 1,100 schools awarded connections of 30Mbit/s or greater. Approximately 400 of these connections have been installed to date and the remainder will be installed in the coming months.</p><p>  Under the current programme the Department continually reviews the availability of services and upgrades schools where the opportunity arises, within the parameters of the programme and in compliance with procurement and contractual obligations.</p><p>  However, the need to improve broadband connectivity to primary schools is recognised in the new Digital Strategy for Schools and the Department will collaborate with the Department of Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources to address this as a priority action. Work on the implementation of the Strategy is now underway.</p></reply>

This improvement takes effect from next September. It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year.  This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota.</p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the survey the Deputy refers to but it is not clear how this survey could take into account the improved allocation for guidance announced in the Budget, given that it only applies from September next.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p>  <p>  That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support.

This improvement takes effect from next September. It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. </p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the survey the Deputy refers to but it is not clear how this survey could take into account the improved allocation for guidance announced in the Budget, given that it only applies from September next.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p>  <p>  That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support.

A pilot of this new allocation model is currently under way.</p>  <p>  A review of the Pilot has commenced which will allow us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot. On conclusion of the review, a decision will be taken on the timeframe for the full implementation of the proposed new allocation model. </p>  <p>  Pending the introduction of this proposed new allocation model, my predecessor as Minister for Education and Skills announced in 2015, that additional resources will be allocated to schools, as an interim measure, to support those children with Down syndrome, who were not already supported through the (NCSE) low incidence resource teaching annual allocation process. </p>  <p>  Provision was made for the NCSE to make additional allocations of 2.5 Resource Teaching hours per week to schools, in respect of any child with Down syndrome, who was not currently eligible for Low Incidence resource teaching hours. </p>  <p>  The allocation of 2.5 hours per child reflects the allocation rates for children in the mild general learning difficulty range, including those with Down syndrome, prior to the introduction of generalised allocations for schools. </p>  <p>  This measure was introduced in recognition of the length of time it will take to introduce the new resource teacher allocation model and also in recognition of the fact that children with Down syndrome may experience a cluster of difficulties relating to this syndrome, in addition to general learning difficulties, including speech and language developmental delays.</p>  <p>  It was intended that this would address a central concern parents had, that children with Down syndrome with a Mild General Learning Difficulty did not have, adequate support, or certainty of the support they would receive, under the General Allocation schemes, as schools have many competing demands in this area.</p>  <p>  In relation to the number of children in mainstream education who have Down syndrome, as Down syndrome had not previously been designated as a distinct category for low incidence resource allocation purposes, it is not possible to state the number of children who have been diagnosed with Down syndrome who are currently attending main stream education, many children with Down syndrome will be receiving support under a different resource allocation criteria, such as Assessed Syndrome in conjunction with another low incidence disability.</p>  <p>  I can advise, however, that the NCSE has made additional allocations to schools for 183 children with Down syndrome, who were not already supported through the NCSE annual allocation process.</p>  <p>  I can also advise that the Health Service Executive estimates that the prevalence rate of Down syndrome is 1 in 550 births. On this basis, based on the birth rate of 71,674 in 2012 the rate equals 130 births per annum. </p>  <p>  Assuming 14 years of education, including transition year, this would mean that there are an estimated 1,820 children of school going age who have Down syndrome. However, it should be noted that some such children may be attending special schools and classes.</p>  <p>  The interim allocations will remain in place until such time as the proposed new model for allocating teaching supports to children with Special Educational Needs comes into force.

In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015. </p><p>The increase in SNA numbers has been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.</p><p>This is a higher level of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support than ever before, which will ensure that children with special educational needs can continue to participate in education and be supported in a manner appropriate to their needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) is responsible for processing applications from schools for special educational needs supports. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in making recommendations for support, which is set out in my Department's Circular 0030/2014. </p><p>All schools were asked to apply for SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29th February 2016. The NCSE continues to accept applications in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed. The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September. </p><p>The NCSE will advise all schools of their allocations for SNA support for 2016/17 before the end of the current school year.</p><p>It should also be noted that SNA allocations are not made to individual children, but are made to schools to support the care needs of children with assessed special educational needs.</p><p>All schools have the contact details of their local SENO, while Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available the NCSE website.</p><p>As the Deputy's question relates to the allocation of SNA support by the NCSE to an individual child, I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

With regard to the institute of technology sector, the Strategy recommended significant reforms to position the sector to meet national strategic objectives. In particular, the Strategy recommended consolidation within the sector and a pathway of evolution for those consolidated institutes of technology, to allow them to demonstrate significant progress against robust performance criteria and to apply to become technological universities. </p><p>The intention has always been that a Technological University would be distinctly different from traditional universities and institutes of technology by virtue of their mission relating to graduate formation, applied research and scholarship, dissemination of knowledge to meet the needs of society and enterprise with a very strong regional focus.</p><p>Consortiums who have applied:As part of the implementation of the Strategy, the Higher Education Authority in 2012 published a four-stage process and criteria for applicant groups of institutes of technology wishing to apply to become technological universities.</p><p>The designation process consists of four stages as follows:</p><p>- an expression of interest,</p><p>- the preparation of a plan to meet the criteria,</p><p>- an evaluation of the plan, and</p><p>- an application for designation.</p><p>There are currently four consortia engaged with the process to become designated as TUs. These are TU4Dublin (Dublin Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Tallaght, Institute of Technology Blanchardstown), Technological University for the South-East (TUSE &ndash; consisting of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow), Munster Technological University (MTU &ndash; consisting of Cork Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Tralee) and the Connacht Ulster Alliance (CUA &ndash; consisting of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, Institute of Technology Sligo and Letterkenny Institute of Technology). </p><p>Status of Consortia: At the end of 2014, two consortia successfully passed stage 3 of the four-stage process. These are the TU4Dublin consortium and the Munster Technological University consortium. </p><p>In early 2015 the Connacht-Ulster Alliance also expressed an interest in merging and in applying to become a technological university. This application was approved to proceed to the next stage. In line with the process for designation as a Technological University, Stage 2 of this process involves the preparation of a plan by the Connacht-Ulster Alliance, to meet the criteria for designation as a Technological University.</p><p>With regard to the Technological University for the South-East, consisting of Institute of Technology, Carlow (ITC) and Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT), following the publication of the Kelly report, a preliminary facilitation process which was under way since September 2015, has recently been completed and a Report of the process was received by my Department on 13 May 2016. There was strong engagement in the process by both parties. This facilitation process has been an important building block in terms of building trust between the parties and in developing a strong working relationship between the Presidents and Chairs of both institutions. As part of this process, the Presidents of the two institutions, have jointly developed an initial work-plan to support the development of a joint TU proposal.</p><p>In addition to this both Institutions made a recent joint presentation and submission to the Higher Education Authority, seeking funding to underpin the next phase of engagement. This was part of the latest call issued by the Higher Education Authority regarding the restructuring of the higher education landscape. The call sought submissions for funding support in respect of the costs arising from mergers as part of the implementation of the National Strategy for Higher Education.</p><p>In relation to the position of the Technological Universities Bill, this Bill was at Report Stage at the time of dissolution of the previous D&aacute;il in February 2016. I recognise that there were a significant number of matters raised in respect of the Bill at both Committee and Report Stage. It is my intention to now consult with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to both the matters raised during the legislative process and the commitments contained in the Programme for Government.</p><p>Following the finalisation of this consultation process I will then advance the legislation having determined a position in relation to any matters raised as part of this consultation process.</p></reply>

This resource was allocated in accordance with pupil enrolment. 42% of second-level schools at the time were allocated at least 22 hours per week in respect of guidance (22 hours being the equivalent of one teaching post) while the remainder of the schools were allocated between 8 and 17 hours of guidance per week.</p>  <p>  Since September 2012 at post primary level guidance provision is now being organised by school management from within the staffing schedule allocation. Guidance is a whole school activity and schools have autonomy on how best to prioritise their available resources to meet the requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to students. This operates at local school level and therefore the information requested by the Deputy on the number of guidance counsellors in secondary schools is not available centrally within my Department. </p>  <p>  The current budget provides an improved staffing allocation to second level schools for the purpose of enhancing guidance provision. This improvement takes effect from next September. It brings the basis of allocation from 19:1 to 18.7:1 for the 2016/17 school year. This improvement of 0.3 in PTR allocation is a restoration of 50% of the teaching resources that were removed when the allocation of guidance posts was brought within quota. </p>  <p>  The delivery of the 50% restoration through a change in the staffing schedule will allow each school to determine how best to allocate the additional resources to meet the guidance needs of the school. The circular issued earlier this year by my Department outlining the allocation of teaching resources clearly stated that this additional resource is to complement existing resources in order to best meet the guidance needs of the school in line with the school's guidance plan.</p>  <p>  I am aware of the survey the Deputy refers to but it is not clear how this survey could take into account the improved allocation for guidance announced in the Budget, given that it only applies from September next.</p>  <p>  It is important to note that in previous changes to guidance counselling allocations in 2012, as a consequence of the Budget adjustment which had to be made at the time, all 195 DEIS schools were effectively sheltered from these changes as a result of the more favourable staffing schedule of 18.25:1. This was a 0.75 point improvement compared to the current PTR of 19:1 that applies in non-fee-paying second-level schools.</p>  <p>  That was a very important protection for the cohort of our schools in DEIS most in need of support. DEIS schools will also further benefit from the 0.3 improvement to the staffing schedule which will give them an enhanced allocation on the basis of 17.95:1 in respect of the 2016/17 school year.</p>  <p>Given that the DEIS schools were protected at that time it will require further analysis and discussion with the Institute of Guidance Counsellors to see what dynamic gave rise to what was reported as DEIS Schools having borne the brunt of reduced guidance provision. </p>  <p>  In the next Budget I will consider the best approach to further meeting commitments in the Programme for Government.</p></reply>

The costings do not therefore necessarily have regard to other developments which may have been underway or planned increases in expenditure in particular policy areas.</p><p>As such, it is not possible to desegregate the cost expenditure associated with each particular policy advice recommendation, from the totality of expenditure for that particular policy area, for example, such as expenditure for teacher training, the provision of additional resource teaching support, or the establishment of new special classes.</p><p>Consideration of the recommendations contained in the NCSE reports is ongoing and the continued implementation of the recommendations will take place in the context of available resources. It will also take account of the very significant levels of increased expenditure in the area of special educational needs provision in recent years.</p><p>Funding for special education provision in 2016 will amount to some &euro;1.4 billion, which is equivalent to approximately 17% of the gross overall current allocation for education and training.  It has increased by 10% in the past two years.</p><p>This funding provides for a range of supports and services including additional learning and resource teaching support, access to care support, special transport arrangements, building adaptations, enhanced capitation, funding for the purchase of specialised equipment and the services of the National Educational Psychological Service.</p><p>The funding also provides for enhanced levels of capitation in Special Schools and Special Classes and additional teacher training.  It also provides for Home Tuition support for pupils with special educational needs who are awaiting a school placement.</p><p>This year, 12,040 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) are available for allocation to primary and secondary schools, to the end of the 2015/16 school year, which is an increase of almost 14% in the number of posts available since 2011.</p><p>There are currently over 11,800 learning support and Resource Teacher posts in mainstream primary and post primary schools providing additional teaching support to pupils with special educational needs.</p><p>The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has allocated 6,832 Resource Teaching posts to mainstream schools this year, which is an increase of 29% over the numbers allocated since 2011.</p><p>In addition, over 150 new Special Classes have been opened for the 2015/16 school year, which means there are now over 1,000 special classes in place, compared to 548 special classes in 2011.</p><p>125 special schools also provided specialist education for those pupils who need it.</p><p>The combination of supports provided in mainstream schools along with the increased special school and special class provision, means that school places are available for all children with special educational needs, regardless of their level of need.</p><p>As committed to in the Programme for a Partnership Government, I plan to examine the adequacy of the present policies and provision, and their scope for improvement, particularly in relation to speech and language difficulties and early intervention.  In doing so, I will also take into account the recommendations contained in the NCSE policy advice papers.</p></reply>

Work already underway in my Department envisages legislative change to Section 28 of the Education Act 1998, and creating an ombudsman with powers to externally review school actions would require new legislation that could be progressed in tandem.</p>  <p>  The remit of a possible Ombudsman for Education will be examined by the relevant Oireachtas Committee when they consider both programme commitments.  Any decisions on the timeline for establishing an Ombudsman for Education Office can only be considered after the relevant Oireachtas Committee have completed their work on reviewing both programme commitments.</p></reply>

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>  <p>  This year, 12,040 SNAs are available for allocation to primary and secondary schools, to the end of the 2015/16 school year, which is an increase of almost 14% in the number of posts available since 2011.  In the same period the number of children accessing SNA support has grown from approximately 22,000 to some 30,000 by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  The increase in SNA numbers has been supported by a very significant increase in the Budget for SNAs, rising from &euro;332 million in 2011 to &euro;402 million by the end of 2015.</p>  <p>  This is a higher level of SNA support than ever before, and has ensured that all children with special educational needs who qualify for access to SNA support, in accordance with the terms of my Departments criteria, as set out in DES Circular 30/2014, have been able to access such support.</p>  <p>  Separately, the NCSE allocates additional resource teaching hours to schools for children who have been assessed within the low incidence, or more complex, category of special need.  Budget 2016 made additional provision, increasing the number from 6705 at the end of 2015 to 6852 at the end of June 2016, which is an increase of 29% over the numbers allocated since 2011.</p>  <p>  Provision has been made for 7452 posts to the end of 2016.</p>  <p>  This additional provision has meant that resource teaching allocations have been provided to schools in respect of all children who have qualified for resource teaching support, in accordance with the terms of my Departments criteria which are set out in DES Circular 02/05.</p>  <p>  All schools were asked to apply for Resource Teaching and SNA support for the 2016/17 school year by 29th February, 2016.  The NCSE continues to accept applications in recognition that enrolments may not have been completed or where assessments were not completed.  The NCSE will consider these applications and make further allocations to schools in respect of valid applications which have been received to September.</p>  <p>  The NCSE advised schools of their resource teaching allocations for the 2016/17 school year in May of this year and will advise all schools of their allocations for SNA support for 2016/17 as soon as possible in advance of the coming school year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy's question relates to the number of invalid applications received by the NCSE for resource hours and SNA support I have referred this question to the NCSE for their consideration and direct reply to the Deputy.</p></reply>

These factors include the level of diversity of provision in the area and the ability or otherwise of existing school sites to facilitate the extra accommodation.</p>  <p>  My Department's focus at this time is on the need to prioritise available funding towards the provision of essential school classroom accommodation.  It is open to all schools to submit an application for capital funding.  My Department prioritises applications on the basis of an immediate accommodation requirement because of increased enrolments and where an additional teacher is being appointed.</p>  <p>  My Department uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) to identify where the pressure for school places across the country will arise.  The GIS uses data from the Central Statistics Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Department of Social Protection together with information from my Department's school databases.  With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.</p>  <p>  The outcome of the latest demographic exercises was that in November 2015 the establishment of 13 new schools to open nationwide in 2017 and 2018 was announced.  All school planning areas including Tullow, Co. Carlow are being kept under ongoing review by my Department to take account of updated child benefit data and enrolment data and also the impact of existing and planned capacity increases to schools in these areas.</p></reply>

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-24a.442.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052400057#WRH02300"><p>Supplementary pension is a top-up pension paid by the occupational pension provider in the period between retirement and age 66 (previously age 65) to public servants who paid Class A PRSI during some or all of their employment.  Supplementary pension is paid in order to ensure that these public servants are not disadvantaged between the date of retirement and state pension age.  It is a rule of the pension scheme that a supplementary pension should cease or be abated as appropriate when a pensioner applies for and comes into receipt of the state pension.  The limited circumstances in which supplementary pension is payable is included in documentation which issues to pensioners at their retirement.  Responsibility in the first instance rests with the pensioner to inform the occupational pension provided (the Department in this case) once the person applies for and becomes eligible for a social welfare payment from the Department of Social Protection.</p>  <p>  The advent of new pension legislation in late 2012 facilitated the sharing of information between this Department and the Department of Social Protection.  In late 2012/early 2013 the Department conducted an analysis of those pensioners over age 65 who were in receipt of a supplementary pension.  On completion of this analysis and a follow-up exercise some c320 teacher-pensioners, out of a total population of more than 25,000 retired school staff, were identified as in receipt of a supplementary pension to which they were no longer entitled as they were also in receipt of a state pension from the Department of Social Protection.  Payment of supplementary pension to these pensioners was ceased in May 2013.  Payment of the occupational pension has continued in the normal way.  Additionally the pensioners continue to benefit from receipt of their social welfare pension.</p>  <p>  Overpayment of individual supplementary pension was subsequently calculated.  Gross overpayment amounted to &euro;2.7 million.  It is estimated that the overpayment net of statutory deductions (PAYE, PRSI etc.) is likely to be in the region of &euro;1.5m however net figures have not yet been finalised as a small number of complex cases are still being worked through.</p>  <p>  The Department was conscious that the recovery of the overpayment would have implications in terms of tax treatment for the individuals.  Revenue rules provide that relief from income tax paid is granted on repayment only where the overpayment occurs within the previous 4 years.  In the instance of these cases some proportions of the overpayment accrued in a period outside the 4 year Revenue limit.   In the case of overpayments which fall outside the 4 year Revenue limit, the Department has put in place a method which involves repayment of a net amount calculated using historic pay data from the P60 statements of the individual.  This method allows the pensioner to repay the overpayment net of statutory deductions.  This approach, which, following consultations with the Revenue Commissioners, was agreed with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, represents a fair and equitable response to the issue as it ensures that those affected do not refund pension overpayments to the State to which they subsequently cannot claim tax refunds.</p>  <p>  The pension paid by the Department was correctly calculated based on the information provided by the pensioners in question but the overpayment arose when those pensioners also came into receipt of a state pension from Department of Social Protection.  The pensioners were not entitled to concurrent payment of supplementary pension and state pension.</p>  <p>  To-date just over 200 of the 320 pensioners who incurred the overpayment have already entered into repayment arrangements with my Department or discharged the overpayment in full.  My Department is continuing to received undertakings and cheque payments on a daily basis.</p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to work with remaining individuals with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory arrangement for repayment.  While the Department's approach to the arrangements for repayment will continue to be flexible in terms of method and timescale for repayment, it must insist on recovery of the outstanding amounts.  The statutory superannuation provision for teachers, under which pensions are awarded, provide that where at any time a person receives payment of pension and the person is not entitled to it under the Scheme or receives payment of pension which exceeds those which are appropriate under the Scheme, the person shall repay the amount to the Minister on demand.  In addition in default of payment, the amount shall be recoverable as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>  <p>  The Department operates an Internal Disputes Resolution process for pension matters generally where a person is aggrieved by any decision affecting their pension.  Additionally a person who is not satisfied with the outcome of the Internal Dispute Resolution may refer the complaint or dispute to the Pensions Ombudsman who will determine whether or not this is an issue which falls under his jurisdiction.</p></reply>

All applications for reasonable accommodations are considered within a published Framework of Principles established by an Expert Advisory Group.</p>  <p>  The Board of the SEC is currently undertaking a review of the operation of the RACE Scheme.

With this information, my Department carries out nationwide demographic exercises at primary and post-primary level to determine where additional school accommodation is needed.

Section 3 of this Act provides that the fund established shall be under the control of the Minister for Finance. As such, my Department has not carried out an assessment of this Act.  </p>  <p>  Work has been undertaken within my Department to consider the potential of a securitisation arrangement comparable to that undertaken previously, in accordance with the Securitisation (Proceeds of Certain Mortgages) Act 1995, in respect of certain local authority loans.</p>  <p>  In 1995 and 1996 my predecessor as Minister directed, under section 14 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992, that certain housing authorities should assign debt in respect of certain of their housing loans, in accordance with section 3 of the Securitisation (Proceeds of Certain Mortgages) Act 1995.</p>  <p>  Under section 14(4) of the Housing (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1992, an assignment which is the subject of a direction by Minister is an executive function.   </p>  <p>  A similar model for the securitisation of local authority mortgage loans as a means of raising additional funds for the provision of social housing was examined by my Department in 2015, with input from the Housing Finance Agency and local authority sector. Under such an arrangement the income stream from existing loans would be sold as an asset and the proceeds used for the development of social housing.</p>  <p>  Following a detailed examination of the matter, it was considered that there were significant practical and policy challenges in proceeding with this as a model. The position of mortgage holders in respect of these loans was identified as a policy concern. The matter of whether any funding received could be used for the purpose intended was a further factor examined. It was recommended that securitisation not be pursued as an option at the present time, as there was considered to be an unacceptable imbalance between risk and reward.</p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay-by- weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p>  <p>  In terms of the per kilogramme and service fees which will be charged under pay by weight, the legislation requires that the collector will charge for each kilogramme of waste collected (although it is intended a nil cent per kilogramme fee may be applied for recyclable waste).  The collector may also charge a service fee, which will typically cover staff, collection, administrative and back office, capital and overhead costs.  The Government has set a minimum mandatory fee per kilogramme for the different types of household waste: 11c for black bin (residual waste), 6c for brown bin (food/organic waste) and I have decided that a zero cent minimum fee per kilogramme should be set for green bins (recyclate).  It is a matter for the collector to set charges at the level they consider to be competitive, in compliance with the requirements of the legislation.  Householders will be able to compare the charges more easily under the new system and choose the option that suits them best or is most cost effective.   </p>  <p>  Research indicates that over 440,000 tonnes of waste material could be diverted from landfill under pay-by-weight charging and its introduction will undoubtedly assist the State in achieving regional waste targets, in complying with national recycling and landfill targets under EU legislation as well as making sure that we are well placed to meet future more ambitious and sustainable targets.</p>  <p>  In terms of the prices currently being charged by private operators, this is a contractual matter between collectors and householders.</p></reply>

A number of specific measures have been, and will continue to be, introduced to reduce the amount of waste generated in the State and to increase the segregation of waste which cannot be prevented in line with Government policy.  The introduction of pay by weight charges for the collection of household waste is one such measure.</p>  <p>  During the period in which local authorities were directly involved in the collection of household waste, a minority of individual Councils offered different levels of discount to selected households, based on different qualification criteria.  As local authorities exited the waste collection market, some required the private operators which took on the Councils&rsquo; customers to provide a level of discount for existing waiver customers only, and even then for a limited time.  The vast majority of such contractual commitments for private operators to provide a waiver have now expired.  In that context, the number of households in receipt of waiver discounts is likely to decline over time, especially as some householders were able to take advantage of special reduced offers elsewhere which actually undercut the waiver price.  However, selected private operators still offer some level of discount to former waiver customers on a voluntary basis.  In addition, a very limited number of local authorities make financial contributions towards the cost of, or pay for, the collection of waste from certain households.  Again, the qualification criteria and level of support differ from area to area. Such expenditure means that these local authorities divert funding from other areas to support these waiver provisions.</p>  <p>  With the exception of one or two municipal districts, local authorities no longer collect waste and the market is now serviced by a diverse range of private operators, where the fees charged are a matter between service provider and customer and the services offered vary across the country.  In that regard, it is becoming increasingly apparent that a national waiver scheme could not be imposed in the context of an open market for waste collection.</p>  <p>  However, under pay by weight charging for household waste collection, there is an opportunity for everybody to have more control over their waste charges and to minimise their waste costs by preventing waste and segregating waste through using the food waste and recyclable waste bins properly.  In this regard a pay by weight awareness campaign, launched on 18 May 2016, will be rolled out at national, regional and local levels in the coming weeks and will give invaluable advice to householders on minimising their waste management costs under pay by weight charging.</p></reply>

A scheme exists whereby a local authority (LA) can acquire ownership of properties with unsustainable local authority mortgages, thus enabling the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (LA- mortgage-to-rent).  The other scheme provides for an Approved Housing Body (AHB) to acquire ownership of a property with an unsustainable private mortgage, which also enables the household to remain in their home as a social housing tenant (AHB-mortgage-to-rent).  Both schemes assist families with income difficulties whose mortgages are unsustainable, and where there is little or no prospect of a significant change in circumstances in the foreseeable future.  Both schemes are part of the overall suite of social housing options and an important part of the mortgage arrears resolution process.</p><p>The package of commitments on mortgage arrears announced by Government in May 2015 included a number of amendments to the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme which will enable more properties to qualify, and make it more flexible and accessible to borrowers.  Amendments made with effect from July 2015 include raising the valuation thresholds for properties, flexibility in relation to the size of properties, more efficient assessment of a borrower&rsquo;s eligibility for social housing support and flexibility to allow cases of marginal positive equity to avail of the scheme.  LA-mortgage-to-rent scheme was subsequently amended with effect from March 2016 to align that scheme with the AHB-mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Together these amendments have the effect of providing more householders with access to the schemes with the impact already being evidenced by an increase in the number of applications being made. </p><p>Information in relation to local authority mortgage arrears, the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP), LA&ndash;mortgage-to-rent and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website: . </p><p>My Department continues to keep the operation of both Mortgage to Rent Schemes under review.</p></reply>

In total, 110,000 new social housing units are targeted for delivery with 35,000 new units to be delivered by local authorities and approved housing bodies, and 75,000 households to be supported mainly through the Housing Assistance Payment Scheme.  The Social Housing Strategy 2020 is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:<font color="#0000FF"> </font>.</p><p>Under the Strategy, targets have been set for each local authority out to 2017.  Importantly, local authorities and approved housing bodies have a strong pipeline of construction, turnkey and acquisition projects, which will deliver some 3,900 homes, with approved budget costs of some &euro;680 million.  I am keen that local authorities advance these as soon as possible, but I recognise that all projects must proceed through the planning process and this and other factors can have a direct impact on the timing for the advancement and the delivery of the approved construction projects.</p><p>At my meeting with local authority Chief Executives on 12 May 2016, I outlined my ambition that the delivery of homes under each of the social housing programmes should be accelerated and that the targets should be exceeded if possible.  In that regard, I have asked all local authority Chief Executives for their ideas and proposals to expedite the delivery of social housing. </p><p>My Department does not collect data on the number of social housing units that have been delayed due to delays in the planning process.  However, in light of the need to find appropriate solutions to accelerate the delivery of social housing developments, my Department is examining the scope to streamline further the consultation process for the advancement of social housing projects, in accordance with section 179 of the Planning and Development Act 2001, as amended, and Part VIII of the Planning and Development Regulations 2000-2015, balancing both the need to accelerate delivery and the need to get the public's feedback on those projects.</p></reply>

These follow either national or EU procurement requirements, depending on the cost involved, as required by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>  <p>  Carrying out procurement as part of a social housing build development is the responsibility of the local authority or approved housing body implementing the project and does not directly involve my Department.  Accordingly, my Department does not retain records on the average length of time of procurement processes carried out by local authorities or approved housing bodies. </p>  <p>  I would point out that as major public sector bodies, local authorities deal with procurement on an ongoing basis across many areas of activity and accordingly, they have a strong level of experience and expertise in the area.</p></reply>

These arrangements have been determined locally in line with the &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; approach to rural development.   </p>  <p>  Two broad implementation approaches have emerged as part of the ongoing LEADER local development strategy selection process.  In this regard, the programme will be implemented across the 28 LEADER areas by a mix of local development companies on the one hand and by Local Community Development Committees working in partnership with local development companies as implementing partners on the other.   </p>  <p>  The allocation of additional funding to LEADER groups, which is referred to in the new Programme for Government, will be considered in due course.  I believe there is sufficient funding allocated under the programme to meet demand in 2016 and 2017.  It is likely, therefore, that the allocation of additional funding will be considered for the latter years of the programme when applications for funding and expenditure traditionally reach their peak.  Notwithstanding this, any additional allocation of funding to LEADER groups will be made in accordance with EU rules and with a view to securing optimum outcomes for rural areas.</p></reply>

Under this programme, the EPA assesses general physico-chemical parameters (nutrients, oxygen, temperature, salinity) and biological quality elements (phytoplankton, macroalgae and angiosperms).</p>  <p>  Since January 2016, the EPA has taken on the entirety of the operational monitoring function which had previously been shared with the local authorities.  On the ground sampling is conducted by local authorities and operational and surveillance samples are then brought to EPA laboratories (and to Dublin City&rsquo;s laboratory for the eastern region).  Investigative samples continue to be assessed by local authority laboratories.   </p>  <p>  This collaboration between local authorities and the EPA optimises the resources available and has come about as a result of detailed discussions between the EPA, the local authorities and my Department.  It has been operating very effectively since the start of this year and there is no material diminution of the level or quality of monitoring on the ground.  It allows local authorities to focus more resources on investigative monitoring and provides for the highest level of assessment consistency and data quality control.   </p>  <p>  There are currently 51 chemistry river sites and 169 biological river sites designated for WFD operational and surveillance monitoring in the Kerry region for the 2016-2018 period.  Under the national programme, two of the tributaries of Lough Currane are monitored namely Cummeragh stream (21C04) and Isknagahiny Lough Stream (21I03).  This programme has not changed since the original programme was put in place in 2007.  The status of Lough Currane in the most recent assessment period was good status. </p>  <p>  While the EPA is responsible for the analysis of samples taken for the national surveillance and operational monitoring programme for lakes and rivers there is no barrier to the local authority undertaking additional monitoring and analysis for local purposes.</p></reply>

This shared service is responsible for a range of functions including monthly payments to landlords and the collection of weekly differential rent from tenants and provides a range of efficiencies to the operation of the scheme.  Accordingly all funding supplied by my Department relating to rent payments for landlords is made directly to the central transactional shared service centre.</p><p>In order to cover staffing and administrative costs arising from the operation of the HAP scheme in their area, local authorities are provided with a direct once-off administrative payment of &euro;150 per household set up under the HAP scheme.

Since then the programme has been expanded on a number of occasions to provide for new types of supply and to involve a greater range of agencies and bodies in providing accommodation.  SHCEP supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners, developers and Approved Housing Bodies (AHBs).  Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants, in accordance with the relevant local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  The Department recoups the cost of the agreements that are made with private property owners, including AHBs, to the Local Authorities.  Expenditure includes the ongoing cost of contractual arrangements and relevant cost of new contracts made within the year.</p><p>Details of the funding provided and drawn-down by Local Authorities under SHCEP are provided in tabular form.<table><tr><th>Local Authority </th><th>2009 </th><th>2010 </th><th>2011 </th><th>2012 </th><th>2013 </th><th>2014 </th><th>2015 </th><th>2016 To Date

This funding facilitated the delivery of 2,712 units under the Capital Loan Subsidy Schemeand 4,339 units under the Capital Assistance Scheme.  Full details on social housing units constructed and acquired in respect of all local authorities and approved housing bodies and funded by direct capital investment by my Department, is published on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link:http://www.environ.ie/housing/social-housing/social-and-affordble/overall-social-housing-provision.

In addition, funding is also made available from the Social Housing Current Expenditure Programme (SHCEP), previously referred to as the Social Housing Leasing Initiative which had been introduced in February, 2009.  The programme has been expanded on a number of occasions to provide for new types of supply and to involve a greater range of agencies and bodies in providing accommodation.  SHCEP supports the delivery of social housing by providing financial support to local authorities for the long-term leasing of houses and apartments from private owners, developers and Approved Housing Bodies.  Properties made available under the programme are used to accommodate households from local authority waiting lists.  Leased properties are allocated to tenants, in accordance with the relevant local authority&rsquo;s allocation scheme.  The Department recoups the cost of the agreements that are made with private property owners, including Approved Housing Bodies, to the local authorities.  Expenditure includes the ongoing cost of contractual arrangements and relevant cost of new contracts made within the year.

SICAP is a key priority of Government and its vision is to improve the life chances and opportunities of those who are marginalised in society, living in poverty or in unemployment through community development approaches, targeted supports and interagency collaboration, where the values of equality and inclusion are promoted and human rights are respected.  SICAP is delivered locally by Programme Implementers, who operate a range of community schemes and programmes.</p>  <p>  The programme&rsquo;s target groups are, children and families from disadvantaged areas, lone parents, new communities (including refugees, asylum seekers), people living in disadvantaged communities, people with disabilities, Roma, the unemployed (including those not on the Live Register), travellers, low income workers/households, young unemployed people from disadvantaged areas and NEETs - young people aged 15-24 who are not in employment, education or training.  There is a strong focus on community activation, social inclusion and community development, in addition to prioritisation of those most hard to reach in our communities. </p>  <p>  While SICAP does not provide grants, Programme Implementers do fund activities to address and respond to local needs and priorities.  For example, people with disabilities can receive a range of supports i.e. to develop community groups to address and respond to their needs, increase their engagement at community level, access education or training or to bring them closer to the labour market, in line with the Programme&rsquo;s goals.  Supports to deal with mental health issues are often provided as part of a holistic approach to support the development and participation of programme beneficiaries.</p>  <p>  As other Government Departments may have specific grant schemes under their respective remit which relate to the matter referred to in the Question, the Deputy may wish to make direct contact with the Departments of Health, Social Protection and Justice and Equality.</p></reply>

In relation to commercial rates local authorities have been asked by my Department to continue to strive for reductions in commercial rates and other local charges in 2016.  Authorities have responded well to such requests in recent years with a decrease in average Annual Rate on Valuation from 2010 to 2014.  Figures for 2015 and 2016 are not directly comparable with previous years due to the unification of town and borough councils into single local authority structures which were accompanied by a statutory requirement for those authorities to harmonise the rates which previously applied in town councils.</p></reply>

Following the necessary preparatory work the new Scheme came into operation on 1 January 2016.  The Scheme is open to eligible tenants, including joint tenants, of local authority houses that are available for sale under the Scheme.  To be eligible, tenants must meet certain criteria, including having been in receipt of social housing support for a minimum period of one year and having a minimum reckonable income of &euro;15,000 per annum.</p>  <p>  The provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are designed to enable the development of mixed tenure sustainable communities.

The continued development of mixed tenure communities remains central to promoting social integration.</p>  <p>  The new scheme is in the very early stages of implementation and my Department is monitoring its operation in consultation with housing authorities.

Local authorities, the Water Services Transition Office, Irish Water, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and my Department are represented on the working group.  One of the tasks of the group is to ensure that there is appropriate integration of the Department's Rural Water Programme and Irish Water's Capital Investment Programme so as to fully support rural development and address any environmental issues that may arise.</p><p>The working group is also considering a number of areas where there are potential boundary issues with Irish Water or legacy issues which need to be addressed and new approaches in this area will be informed by a number of demonstration projects or pilot schemes.  A number of pilot projects relating to the takeover of group water schemes have been undertaken as pathfinders to identify and standardise the processes and documentation required at each step of the taking in charge process.  The information and experience gained has fed into an overall governance framework which is to be utilised by Irish Water and relevant local authorities on all future schemes to be taken in charge.</p><p>In January 2016, my Department wrote to local authorities advising them of a new multi-annual approach to the funding of group water schemes for 2016 and beyond under the rural water programme.  This will ultimately lead to the development of appropriate prioritised lists of schemes for funding and a series of demonstration projects which will assist in further evolving the programme of investment.  Details of the new multi-annual programme are available on my Department&rsquo;s website at .</p><p>My Department is currently considering local authorities' bids for funding and allocations to authorities under the new programme will be provided shortly.</p></reply>

This map will be updated over the course of the Social Housing Strategy to record the development and use of these lands.</p><p>Accordingly, sites that have either been transferred to the Housing Agency under the Land Aggregation Scheme or comprise of other suitable local authority lands will be amongst those first considered in order to support the implementation of the Strategy.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2014, my Department, in conjunction with Local Authority Planning Departments, carried out a national survey of all lands zoned for residential development in statutory local authority development plans and local area plans across Ireland.  This exercise, The Residential Land Availability Study, determined the location and quantity of lands that may be regarded as being undeveloped and available for residential development purposes at 31st March 2014.  The results of the survey indicated that there was 17,434 hectares of residential zoned lands nationally which could theoretically enable the construction of over 414,000 dwellings.  My Department&rsquo;s web browser contains a detailed map of the residential land availability study.</p><p>In relation to housing in the Dublin Region the Government published Construction 2020 - A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector (May, 2014) which included a commitment to establishing a Housing Supply Coordination Taskforce for Dublin with an immediate focus on addressing supply-related issues(Action 2 of the Strategy).  This Task Force was convened by my Department and includes representatives of the four Dublin local authorities.

Ultimately, a shortage of supply of houses and apartments to buy and rent is at the heart of the challenges in the housing sector.  The plan will build on what the previous Government has already done and will draw on the work of the Special Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The Plan will include further actions to expedite and boost supply of all types of housing in the immediate, medium and longer-terms.  Under the Social Housing Strategy 2020, targets have been set for each local authority out to 2017.</p>  <p>  Importantly, local authorities and approved housing bodies have a strong pipeline of construction, turnkey and acquisition projects, which will deliver some 3,900 homes, with approved budget costs of some &euro;680 million.  It is my ambition that the delivery of these homes will be accelerated and that the targets will be exceeded.</p>  <p>  In addition, a programme of rapid-delivery housing provision is also being implemented to mitigate the acute issues associated with homelessness.  The units will provide accommodation for those families currently in hotels in the first instance, offering a greater level of stability while move-on options to long-term independent living are identified and secured.  Again, it is my ambition to accelerate and expand the rapid delivery programme.</p>  <p>  These and a range of other measures required to address the overall issue of housing supply will be set out in the finalised &ldquo;Action Plan for Housing&rdquo;.</p></reply>

A range of measures have already been taken to reduce the monthly repayments of these borrowers.</p><p>The Index Linked Shared Ownership Scheme which operated from 1999 until 2002 has been revised with regard to the annual indexation of the rental equity balance and rental payments.The amendments, which came into effect on 1 July 2015, reduce the monthly cost for these borrowers and avoid existing rental equity balances increasing for the remaining term.  My Department has issued directions to local authorities outlining the measures and I understand that these changes are being applied to individual loan accounts.</p><p>In addition, the Local Authority variable mortgage interest rate was cut by 0.20% and this has helped many Share Ownership borrowers.  The rate cut brought the variable mortgage interest rate charged to local authority borrowers down to 2.55% with effect from 1 July 2015, saving borrowers around &euro;17 per month on a typical mortgage of &euro;100,000.</p><p>An innovative Shared Ownership Restructuring Option has been available to Shared Ownership borrowers from 1 April 2016 and is being offered to borrowers by local authorities.  This new restructuring option involves rolling-up all outstanding debt under a SO arrangement into a single annuity loan - i.e. the new restructured loan principal will comprise any outstanding annuity loan balance; rental equity balance, plus any arrears - with an all-sums-owing mortgage charge applying to the property.  The term of the annuity loan will be determined by the amount of the monthly repayment deemed to be affordable and sustainable for each SO borrower.  This restructuring option allows the borrower to have a regularised, restructured repayment solution which is more easily understood.  The restructuring option can lead to full homeownership for the borrower and as such allows for up or down sizing to suit household needs.  This arrangement may be of particular benefit to those SO borrowers who are nearing the end of their annuity term but who have not made sufficient provision for the repayment of their Rental Equity balance. The feasibility of this new option for each SO borrower will be determined by their local authority, and may not be appropriate in all cases.  For example, in some instances, continuing with the current SO arrangement may be the best option for both the SO borrower and the local authority, or in other cases where the outstanding debt may not be sustainable for the borrower in the long-term, the Local Authority Mortgage to Rent (LAMTR) option might ultimately be the appropriate solution.</p><p>In every case both in a restructured or standard arrangement repayment of SO loans is facilitated by local authorities and no penalties apply.</p><p>Local authority borrowers are encouraged to engage with their local authority at the earliest opportunity if they are having difficulty making the repayments on their Shared Ownership arrangement.  Information in relation to local authority mortgage arrears, the local authority mortgage arrears resolution process (MARP) and the help available to borrowers is also available on my Department&rsquo;s website: <i>. </i></p></reply>

The Directive requires that certain minimum levels of monitoring are carried out for the purposes of assessment and management of air quality.  The EPA monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants, based on data obtained from the 31 monitoring stations that form the national ambient air quality network.   The EPA publishes an annual report on air quality, primarily based on the monitoring requirements of the CAFE Directive.  The most recent report, Air Quality in Ireland 2014 &ndash; Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality, was published in September 2015 and provides an assessment of air quality in Ireland for 2014, compared to the CAF &Eacute; Directive standards, as well as assessments in relation to more stringent World Health Organisation (WHO) air quality guidelines for the protection of human health and the European Environment Agency (EEA) estimated reference levels.</p>  <p>  The report indicates that NOx values, arising primarily from the transport sector, are showing a slight increase over 2013 figures at some locations, and indicates a risk that growth in economic activity will lead to an increase in NOx levels.  Similarly, the report indicates that levels of particulates (PM 2.5) and compounds (PAH) have increased at some stations.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these points, I welcome the fact that n o levels above the EU limit value were recorded at any of the ambient air quality network monitoring sites in Ireland in 2014.  However, I also note that Ireland exceeds WHO air quality guideline values for particulate matter (PM) in some areas.  Particulate matter levels are of concern, particularly during the winter heating season in some areas where the sale of smoky coal is permitted.  Because of this, levels of particulate matter in smaller towns can often be similar to, or higher than, those in cities where the sale and use of smoky coal is banned.  To help protect our good air quality, consumers must become more aware of their choice in home heating fuel and the potential impact that this choice can have on local air quality and on human health.</p>  <p>  To this end, my Department has commenced work on the first ever national Clean Air Strategy which will provide an overarching strategic policy framework within which clean air policies can be formulated and given effect in a manner consistent with national, EU and international policy considerations and priorities.  The Strategy will set a progressive vision for managing and improving Ireland&rsquo;s air quality across the broad range of Government Departments and Agencies, and will seek to integrate such considerations into future sectorial policy and expenditure decisions.  The development of the Strategy is especially timely, in the context of the EU&rsquo;s Clean Air Package, as it will act as a policy framework for the implementation of the provisions of the Package in Ireland, but it will also complement and add value to it, by having a particular focus on national priority areas not addressed by EU legislation.</p>  <p>  The Clean Air Strategy will target priority air pollutants in Ireland in an integrated manner, addressing the relevant sectors including transport, industry, agriculture and residential heating with the aim of identifying cost-effective short, medium and long-term goals and action for reducing air pollutant levels.  The Strategy will seek to ensure continued and on-going compliance with current and future EU legislation, but also improved health outcomes and wider environmental benefits.  Importantly, the Strategy will also aim to align relevant sectorial strategies, in particular, climate change and clean air policies, to ensure complementary actions to avoid policy conflict, maximising co-benefits and thus cost effectiveness.</p></reply>

These are based on the analysis of returned data from tendered social housing schemes over an extended period.  Construction cost is reflective of building costs to include VAT inclusive of normal site works and site development.  All-in cost reflects a composite figure to include the addition of site purchase cost, design team fees, utilities, site investigations, surveys, etc. as appropriate.  Abnormal costs are excluded from these figures.  <table><tr><th></th><th>1-Bed.</th><th></th><th>2-Bed. (1 storey)</th><th></th><th>2-Bed.

At that point, the likely cost of the projects of different scale will be on a more reliable footing.  While substantial numbers of new social housing construction projects have been approved, these must all proceed through the planning process and this and other factors will have a direct impact on the projects in terms of house type, timing for advancement and costs.</p><p>Other factors that will directly influence the cost of new social housing developments of different scale will be their geographic location and land costs and conditions.  The prevailing economic conditions at present suggest that housing costs, including social housing costs, are more likely to rise rather than fall during 2016.  This is due to the fact that, in general, housing supply currently falls significantly short of housing demand and that construction input costs are subject to inflationary pressures as the construction industry transitions from under-activity over an extended period to significant growth in all sectors (i.e. residential, commercial and civil construction).</p><p>Information on capital-funded construction projects that have been announced since the launch of the Social Housing Strategy is available on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following links: <i>, </i></p><p><i> .</i></p></reply>

My Department is currently examining the rent limits in the context of the Government commitment and it is my intention that revised rent limits will be introduced as early as possible, subject to agreement by Government.</p><p>At this time of constrained supply, the Department continues to implement a targeted, flexible, case-by-case approach where rents exceed limits.<b></b>This ensures that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  Currently, over 8,000 households are supported through this approach.</p><p>The strategic policy direction of my Department is to return rent supplement to its original purpose of being a short-term support scheme mainly for unemployed people, addressing long-term support needs through Government initiatives such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) Scheme.  HAP is being implemented on an incremental basis and is currently available in 19 local authorities across the country. </p><p>Where HAP is not in operation, in order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement.  A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by a local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.  In all other cases, a new applicant who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority.  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement. </p><p>Where a person&rsquo;s safety and well-being are at risk due to domestic violence, Department officials operating the rent supplement scheme have discretionary powers to expedite the award of a payment to the person in question. </p><p>This Department may also make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure.  It is expected that the expenditure on the ENP scheme in 2016 will be in excess of &euro;30 million.  ENP&rsquo;s are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, including those in a domestic violence situation, in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance. </p></reply>

Social welfare legislation provides that the yearly value of property (including capital) owned but not personally used or enjoyed is assessable for means testing purposes.  However, it does not include property such as the family home a person is personally using or enjoying i.e. residing in or a premises or a farm of land used by the claimant in carrying out a business. </p><p>Where the property is not being used to carry on a business or is not being farmed the current market value of the property or land is established (having regard to local property prices) as well as the amount of any outstanding mortgages, if any.  The balance (market value less outstanding mortgage) is assessed by reference to a notional formula. </p><p>The assessment method involves disregarding an initial amount of capital (&euro;20,000 for most social assistance schemes such as jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, farm assist and the state pension non-contributory), and applying an increasing notional weekly value for amounts in excess of the disregarded amount, as outlined. </p><p><i>Social Welfare Capital Means Assessment (excluding Supplementary Welfare Allowance and Disability Allowance*)</i><table><tr><th>AMOUNT OF CAPITAL</th><th>WEEKLY MEANS ASSESSED</th></tr><tr><td>Up to &euro;20,000</td><td>Nil</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;20,000 - &euro;30,000</td><td>&euro;1 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>&euro;30,000 - &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;2 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr><tr><td>Over &euro;40,000</td><td>&euro;4 per each &euro;1,000</td></tr></table></p><p>For the purposes of the State pension non-contributory and carer&rsquo;s allowance the amounts above are doubled in the case of a couple.  From 2007, the amount disregarded in the case of disability allowance is &euro;50,000, up from &euro;20,000, and in the case of supplementary welfare allowance is &euro;5,000, up from &euro;520. </p><p>This approach reflects the policy of ensuring that those with property and capital of modest amounts receive the most available support, while those with larger amounts of capital contribute, at least partially, towards meeting their needs. </p><p>The Programme for Government contains the commitment to review the farm assist scheme, recognising the challenges facing farmers on low incomes.

This process began in January 2014 with the abolition of the State pension (transition) previously available at 65, thereby currently standardising State pension age for all at 66 years.  The changes introduced in 2011 were on foot of a Government commitment included in the National Recovery Plan published in 2010 and in the subsequent Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/ECB/IMF.</p>  <p>  The purpose of these changes is to make the pension system sustainable in the context of increasing life expectancy.  More people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  In this context, the duration for which an average pension will be paid will continue to increase.  The number of pensions is increasing by approximately 17,000 annually as a result of demographic change.  This has significant implications for the future costs of State pension provision, resulting in an additional cost of some &euro;1 billion every 5 years, before other factors, such as rate increases, are factored in.</p>  <p>  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  While its abolition would not realise that saving in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (although at a lower rate than that of the State pension), and some may have claimed for Qualified Adults on their spouse&rsquo;s pension, it is estimated that well over half of that cost may have been saved each year as a result of this measure. </p>  <p>  The Deputy should note that there is no general retirement age in the State, and the age at which employees retire is a matter for the contract of employment between them and their employers. </p>  <p>  In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment.  Jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66.  Where a jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit claim spans two benefit years, a new Governing Contribution Year requirement is not applied to the second benefit year of a claimant aged 65 (effectively this means that they may receive payment in both years based upon eligibility in the first year). </p>  <p>  There has not been an economic impact assessment of the effect of the abolition of the State Pension (transition).  In terms of the broader economy, an increase in experienced people working longer in the economy would be expected to increase total economic output, and improve tax revenues.  Furthermore, the Exchequer savings generated by the abolition of the State pension (transition) has eased pressure on Exchequer finances, and allowed the rate of pension to be maintained and increased in Budget 2016.  The net financial impact on individuals aged 65 years will vary quite significantly, depending on their circumstances.  Some will continue working and receive a higher income as they are still in employment, some may claim alternative social welfare payments (such as jobseeker's benefit or illness benefit) and they may have a reduced income for the duration of that year, while others who do not wish to work or claim benefits may qualify for an Increased Qualified Allowance on a spouse&rsquo;s social welfare payment.  There may also be a further cohort who may cease work at 65 but may decide against making a claim for any social support.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to introduce legislation to change from the current position, as doing so would result in a significant cost to the Exchequer and further undermine the sustainability of the pension system, which already faces significant demographic challenges.</p></reply>

First, to help jobseekers to secure the work experience vital to enhancing their employment prospects and break the vicious circle of &lsquo;no experience no work but no work no experience&rsquo;.  And second to support employers in taking the first step in recruitment at a time when access to finance was very limited and business risk was very high.  JobBridge also addressed the anomaly in the social welfare code whereby unemployed jobseekers who voluntarily undertook unpaid work experience or internships lost their entitlement to a jobseeker payment.  Under JobBridge participants retain their jobseeker payment and in addition receive a top up towards the cost of work of &euro;52 per week.</p>  <p>  JobBridge has been very successful in meeting its objectives over the past five years.  It has helped about 19,000 mainly small employers to provide valuable work experience to nearly 48,000 unemployed jobseekers.  An independent evaluation of JobBridge published in 2013 found that overall satisfaction levels with the scheme were very high.  Two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member, and levels of abuse of the scheme by employers were very low.  Most notably the evaluation found that about 61% of participants progressed into paid employment within a short period of about completing their internship.  This is a very high progression rate and suggests that JobBridge has been instrumental in helping about 30,000 jobseekers to secure employment.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding these achievements JobBridge has been subject to a high level of criticism much of which is based on anecdote or very small scale surveys by various interest groups.  I intend to address these criticisms, insofar as it is appropriate or possible to do so, in the design of a new scheme.  It is however important that the design of a new scheme be informed by the best evidence possible. </p>  <p>  It is for this reason that I intend to await the results of a second large scale evaluation of JobBridge currently underway.  The results of this evaluation, which is again being undertaken by Indecon, are expected in September and I will announce my proposals for a new scheme shortly thereafter.</p></reply>

Jobseeker's Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance payments are made in arrears and this means that the customer&rsquo;s payment for this week is based on last week&rsquo;s entitlement.</p>  <p>  This payment calculation method for Jobseekers is easy to facilitate for the majority of customers as their income position does not change from week-to-week.  My Department&rsquo;s payment systems ensure that jobseeker's payments are available on the same day each week to be collected from the relevant post office.</p>  <p>  Different payment arrangements are in place for jobseekers who are also employed on a casual basis.  This difference arises as these customers tend to have varying levels of income.  Consequently, it is not possible to calculate their weekly entitlement until the end of their working week. </p>  <p>  My Department has processes in place where the customer is required to declare his or her days of employment and to have these details certified by their employer at the end of each week.  The weekly employment details are then submitted to my Department where an officer arranges to facilitate the payment of the relevant rate of jobseeker's payment.</p>  <p>  Payments for casual jobseeker customers were not paid through the post office and these customers were paid by cheque.  Recent system improvements within my Department have allowed for the payment of casual workers by electronic funds transfer (EFT) into a nominated bank account, rather than payment by cheque.</p>  <p>  There are currently some 65,000 jobseekers customers who are also employed on a casual basis.  All have been contacted and advised of the option available to be paid by EFT rather than by cheque.  Approximately 50,000 of these have opted to switch payment method from cheque to electronic funds transfer.  Feedback has been very positive from the customers themselves who are making the switch.  If customers wish to continue to be paid by cheque they can make their preference known to the local Intreo Centre or Branch Office which handles their claim.</p>  <p>  Many of my Department&rsquo;s customers are in employment.  My Department&rsquo;s focus must be on our customers and to this end, my goal is to make payment to in-work customers directly to bank accounts rather than having such customers inconvenienced by their having two separate payment methods; payment from an employer by EFT and payment from my Department by cheque.  The option for payment in cash at An Post is not being considered for casual customers due to delays this would cause to customers expecting their money on their regular payment date.</p></reply>

It provides financial support to community companies that provide revenue generating services of a social inclusion nature.  Many of these companies are also funded from other sources and generate revenue from the public use of their facilities and services.  The CSP provides a contribution to the wage costs of the companies on the basis that the services are not fully self-financing or the cost of provision would be prohibitive on users.  My Department does not set the wage rate but requires the payment of appropriate rate consistent with local norms.</p>  <p>  At December 2015, 398 companies employing some 2,800 employees were directly supported by the CSP.  The Department estimates that, at the end of 2015, some 60% of these employees were being paid above the level of the minimum wage, in keeping with the social inclusion and social benefit objectives of the programme.  The Deputy should note that the CSP accounts for less than a third of the resources generated by these companies.</p>  <p>  Contracts of up to three years duration are provided for under the CSP.  Arrangements whereby individual companies may be able to access additional financial resources to compensate for the welcome increase in the minimum wage have been put in place.  Submissions are being assessed on a case-by-case basis, with the annual funding commitment being adjusted where it is found to be warranted.  An advance of 50% of the contract value for 2016 has been paid to companies currently in the programme which ensures that any immediate cash-flow requirements are supported.</p>  <p>  Overall, I am satisfied that the level of resources available to the CSP in 2016 at just over &euro;45 million will be adequate to meet the on-going funding needs of the programme.</p></reply>

The 2016 Estimate provides for expenditure of &euro;410.3 million on the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme and a 10% increase in 2016 FIS expenditure would cost just over &euro;41 million in 2017.</p><p>2.  The cost of increasing the rate of Jobseeker&rsquo;s Allowance, paid to those under 26 years of age, to the maximum rate of &euro;188 per week in 2017 is &euro;148.4 million.  This measure involves increasing the &euro;100 rate by &euro;88 per week and the &euro;144 rate by &euro;44 per week.  The cost also includes proportionate increases for any qualified adults.</p><p>3.  The Living Alone Allowance is currently paid at &euro;9 per week to pensioners and people with disabilities who live alone.  A &euro;9.50 per month increase equates to a &euro;114 increase per annum, which rounds up to &euro;2.20 per week.  The cost of a &euro;2.20 increase in the Living Alone Allowance, from &euro;9 to &euro;11.20 per week, is estimated to cost &euro;22.2 million, based on the estimated number of recipients in 2016.</p><p>4.  The cost of &euro;20.5 million for the introduction of the Bereavement Grant is based on the most recent CSO Vital Statistics detailing the number of deaths (Quarter 3, 2015 and the preceding year) and assumes a similar take-up rate to that in 2013.</p><p>5.  Disability Allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment which is paid to persons aged 16 to 66 who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition (subject to satisfying the relevant medical criteria).  The estimated cost in 2017 (and a full year) of increasing the weekly personal rate of Disability Allowance by &euro;20, from &euro;188 to &euro;208 per week, is &euro;131.2 million.  Each &euro;1 increase in the weekly personal rate would cost &euro;6.6 million in 2017 and a full year.</p><p>There is an analogous social insurance payment, Invalidity Pension, which is paid to persons who are permanently incapable of work (subject to satisfying the relevant medical criteria and a minimum number - 5 years - of paid Class A PRSI contributions).  Each &euro;1 increase in the weekly rate of Invalidity Pension would cost &euro;2.9 million in 2017 and a full year.</p><p>In addition, Blind pension is available for those aged 18 to 66 who are blind or visually impaired.  The cost of a &euro;1 weekly personal increase in the Blind Pension is &euro;0.07 million in 2017 and a full year.</p><p>It should be noted that (i) in the event of the Disability Allowance weekly rate exceeding the Invalidity Pension rate, some Invalidity pensioners (number not determinable) would transfer to the means tested Disability Allowance scheme to avail of the higher rate on that scheme; (ii) the costs shown above do not include the cost of proportionate increases for qualified adults; (iii) any additional costs which might arise as some persons in receipt of other welfare schemes might potentially apply for and qualify for Disability Allowance thereby also benefitting from a higher rate of payment than that which applies to their current scheme or (iv) offsetting savings on the Rent Supplement scheme as the additional weekly increase would reduce the level of entitlement under that scheme.</p><p>6.  All of the costings above are provisional and may be subject to change in the context of emerging trends and associated revision of the estimated numbers of recipients.  The costs outlined above are based on recipient data for 2016.</p></reply>

The project was delivered by the Walkinstown Association for People with an Intellectual Disability (WALK). </p>  <p>A key criterion applied when selecting projects was that the learning from this activity should be capable, where appropriate, of being mainstreamed in the future.  Therefore, it is important to note that the projects were never intended to become ongoing service delivery organisations in their own right,   no matter how successful the projects might have been. </p>  <p>  The objective of the DACT programme was to explore a variety of routes towards ensuring that people with disabilities were enabled to avail of progression, education and development opportunities within the world of work.  It was on this basis that each of the DACT projects was awarded funding with a specified end date of 30 April 2015.  </p>  <p>  However, in the closure phase of the programme, it was recognised by the Department that there would be a number of people still actively participating on some of the DACT projects, so a decision was made to provide funding to seven of the projects, which included the WALK PEER project, for a short period to the end of July 2015.  This funding was provided so as to allow projects to ensure that their participants finished their involvement in an orderly manner.  All DSP funding to WALK PEER ceased at the end of July 2015. </p>  <p>  I understand that the WALK PEER project was subsequently successful in obtaining additional funding from a private sector organisation and I believe that it is this source of support that is referred too and that will terminate in July. </p>  <p>  Given the circumstances set out above, there is no provision in the Department's estimates to provide funding to this project and it is not possible to provide a costing for replicating the current arrangements.  </p>  <p>  I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p></reply>

In 2016, &euro;6.976 billion will be spent on pensions, which represents 35% of the Department&rsquo;s total current expenditure.  While expenditure on pensions is increasing by approximately &euro;1 billion every five years because of demographic pressures, this is being successfully managed within the overall welfare budget.  A number of significant reforms to State pensions were introduced in recent years which have allowed my Department maintain the value of the State pension, and indeed increase it in Budget 2016. </p>  <p>  Firstly, from September 2012, new rate bands for State Pension contributory were introduced.  These additional payment rate bands more accurately reflect the social insurance history of a person and ensure that those who contributed to the Social Insurance Fund more frequently during their working life will, generally, benefit more in retirement than those who made less frequent contributions.  People who qualify for a lower contributory pension as a result, but who have an income need, may still claim the means-tested State pension (non-contributory), the maximum rate of which is 95% that of the State pension contributory.  At the time this measure was introduced, the net exchequer savings arising were estimated to be in the region of &euro;2.8 million in 2013, &euro;5m in 2014 and &euro;8m in 2015.  While a projection was not made at that time for 2017, it is now estimated that a figure of approximately &euro;13.8 million would apply.  </p>  <p>  Secondly, in order to provide for sustainable pensions and to facilitate a longer working life, the Government decided to increase State pension age in three separate stages.  In 2014, the State pension age was standardised at 66.  This will be increased to 67 in 2021 and 68 in 2028.  This process saw the abolition of the State Pension Transition payment from 2014.  In 2013, the cost of the State pension (transition) was &euro;137 million.  Its abolition was not expected to save that amount of expenditure in full, as some people who were affected would alternatively claim working age payments such as Jobseeker's Benefit (albeit at a lower rate than the rate of the State pension), or may claim an Increase for a Qualified Adult in respect of their spouse&rsquo;s pension.  However, it is anticipated that well over half of that cost has been saved each year as a result of this measure, and this would be expected to increase as (a) the number of 65 year olds increases, and (b) the change results in a higher percentage of people working while aged 65.  It is estimated that the net saving in 2017 is likely to be in the region of &euro;75-80 million.</p>  <p>  Thirdly, with effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State Pension increased from 260 paid contributions to 520 paid contributions.  At the time this measure was introduced, the annual exchequer savings were expected to be in the region of &euro;6m per annum in the short term, with the savings expected to increase significantly over the longer term.  There are currently no more up-to-date figures available.</p></reply>

My Department would not have access to these projections and therefore cannot provide these costings.</p>  <p>  However, the Deputy should note that the current supports provided, outlined below, ensure that lone parents can complete a course of education with support from my Department regardless of the age of their youngest child.</p>  <p>  Former one-parent family payment (OFP) recipients who transitioned from the scheme on 2 July 2015 and who were in the middle of a course of education were allowed to complete their course on OFP and then transition to an appropriate payment.  </p>  <p>  From 2 July 2015 onwards lone parents who transition to the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment (JST) have a youngest child of 7 years of age.  These customers then have two options if they wish to complete a course of education while on JST.  Where the course can be completed within the 7 years that they have access to JST (i.e. until their youngest child is 14 years of age), these customers can avail of the SUSI grant and a JST payment subject to the conditions of both schemes (eligibility for a SUSI grant is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills). </p>  <p>  Where the course cannot be completed within the potentially 7 years available on JST, for example if the course is over 3 years and the youngest child is now 12, the customer can instead avail of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) when s/he commences the course.  This allowance will continue to be paid, subject to the conditions of the BTEA scheme, until the course is completed even when the customer&rsquo;s youngest child reaches 14 years of age.  </p>  <p>  All lone parents on a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or JST payment have access to activation supports from my Department. </p>  <p>  JST recipients receive for the first time a one to one meeting with a case officer from my Department who will assist them to produce a personal development plan and guide them towards appropriate education, training and employment opportunities.  While the customer is on the JST payment this support is available and is not limited to the 12 month engagement that applies for other jobseekers from their one to one meeting.  </p>  <p>  Through the JST payment, lone parents with children aged between 7 and 13 years are provided with a very long transition period of seven years within which to engage with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  The aim of this broader support is to improve the individual&rsquo;s education and employment prospects.</p></reply>

The eligibility rules that govern the payment of a student maintenance grant are a matter for the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  My Department remains committed to supporting lone parents who wish to pursue education and training courses.  Given that there is no work conditionality attached to the OFP payment, recipients of the payment can participate in training and education programmes and remain on OFP.  The SUSI grant is available to lone parents on OFP and the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment.  The maintenance grant is disregarded for means on the OFP payment. </p>  <p>The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme remains an attractive scheme for social welfare recipients who wish to further their education.  It is open to lone parents to apply for BTEA on return to education and receive a payment equivalent to their OFP.  While the SUSI maintenance grant is not payable with BTEA, these students may be considered for the student contribution under the grant. </p>  <p>  At the end of April 2016, there were 916 former OFP recipients on BTEA.  If all of these qualified for an average SUSI maintenance grant of &euro;4,500 per annum, the cost would be in the region of &euro;4m per annum.</p></reply>

Ireland is the best performing EU member state in reducing poverty through social transfers.  The poverty reduction effect at 58.9% is the highest in Europe, almost twice the EU average.</p>  <p>  The latest poverty data are for 2014 and do not fully reflect the impact of the recovery in economic growth and employment.  The unemployment rate in 2014 was 11.3%, down from a peak of 15% in 2012. Since then, the unemployment rate has fallen further, to 8.4% in April 2016.  As unemployment is strongly linked to poverty, we can expect to see further decreases in basic deprivation and consistent poverty.</p>  <p>  The Pathways to Work Strategy 2016-2020 sets out comprehensive plans to increase labour market participation and make work pay.  It continues to prioritise the activation of the long-term and young unemployed people, with supports provided through the network of Intreo offices.</p>  <p>   A range of welfare and income tax measures were introduced in Budget 2016 to further incentivise work and improve living standards.  The social impact assessment of the Budget shows greater rewards for working, with over 80% of the unemployed substantially better-off in work. The Government is committed to restoring living standards to ensure that everyone will benefit from the recovery.</p></reply>

The JobPath service is delivered by 2 companies - Turas Nua Limited and Seetec Limited.  The companies deliver services directly and also engage with a range of local subcontractors, including training and employment service providers.

JobPath is thereby increasing the Department&rsquo;s overall capacity to engage with, support and assist jobseekers to enter/re-enter and sustain employment.</p>  <p>  In 2016 the Department agreed contracts with the LES to provide a more intensive level of engagement with jobseekers.  In order to assist the LES to undertake a more intensive level of engagement the number of jobseeker referrals was correspondingly reduced.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-24a.868.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052400065#WRQ00700"><p>The average appeal processing time for appeals determined by summary decision and following an oral hearing in the years 2011 to date in 2016 broken down by all social welfare scheme types is as outlined in the following tables.</p><p>The unprecedented increase in appeal receipts since 2009 placed considerable pressure on the appeals office and impacted adversely on processing times.  The overall number of appeals received increased from an average of 15,000 per year up to 2009, to a peak of 35,500 in 2012, reducing annually thereafter to just below 25,000 in 2015.</p><p>Significant effort and resources have been devoted to reforming the appeals process in recent years:</p><p>- Additional appeals officers were appointed to the office;</p><p>- An overhaul of the operating model was undertaken;</p><p>- New technology to support appeals officers was introduced;</p><p>- Work was undertaken with the Department to reduce delays in responding to requests from the appeals office for appeal submissions. </p><p>This resulted in a marked improvement in overall appeal processing times.  The average time taken to determine an appeal requiring an oral hearing reduced from 52.5 weeks in 2011 to 25.5 weeks in 2015 and the average time taken to finalise an appeal decided by way of a summary decision dropped from 25.1 weeks in 2011 to 18.1 weeks in 2015.  This downward trend in overall appeal processing times has continued to date in 2016 to 24.3 weeks for an oral hearing and 17.3 weeks for a summary decision.</p><p>The quasi-judicial nature of the appeals system means that there are inevitable time-lags involved.  The system is designed to be flexible and fair and allows for review and submission of further information up to and including the oral hearing.  The time taken is proportionate to the complexity of many of the issues under appeal, which require a high level of judgement and often involve complex legal questions.</p><p>A number of elements within the process are time-consuming including the need to ensure due process, natural justice and compliance with the statutory obligation to obtain the Department&rsquo;s appeal submission.  If an oral hearing is requested by the appellant or is required to resolve conflicts, the processing time is prolonged.</p><p>The Chief Appeals Officer assures me that appeals processing times are continuously monitored and that, although significant progress has been made in reducing appeal processing times in recent years, continued improvement in this area remains a priority. </p><p>I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.</p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01/2011 to 31/12/2011</b><table><tr><th></th><th><br /><br />Average processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions</th><th><br /><br />Average processing times (weeks) Oral Hearings</th></tr><tr><td>Adoptive Benefit</td><td>27.9</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Blind Pension</td><td>20.4</td><td>69.8</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Allowance</td><td>31.3</td><td>57.9</td></tr><tr><td>Carers Benefit</td><td>21.8</td><td>59.4</td></tr><tr><td>Child Benefit</td><td>47.6</td><td>66.0</td></tr><tr><td>Disability Allowance</td><td>27.4</td><td>55.6</td></tr><tr><td>Illness Benefit</td><td>38.2</td><td>59.8</td></tr><tr><td>Domiciliary Care</td><td>25.4</td><td>55.8</td></tr><tr><td>Deserted Wives Benefit</td><td>19.2</td><td>46.0</td></tr><tr><td>Farm Assist</td><td>20.9</td><td>57.9</td></tr><tr><td>Bereavement Grant</td><td>22.1</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Family Income Supplement</td><td>19.9</td><td>31.8</td></tr><tr><td>Invalidity Pension</td><td>36.4</td><td>58.9</td></tr><tr><td>Liable Relatives</td><td>31.6</td><td>84.1</td></tr><tr><td>One Parent Family Payment</td><td>24.3</td><td>57.5</td></tr><tr><td>Maternity Benefit</td><td>25.1</td><td>62.1</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Contributory)</td><td>24.9</td><td>55.3</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Non-Cont)</td><td>20.6</td><td>54.6</td></tr><tr><td>State Pension (Transition)</td><td>24.4</td><td>66.0</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit</td><td>30.7</td><td>54.8</td></tr><tr><td>Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)</td><td>77.8</td><td>65.0</td></tr><tr><td>Disablement Pension</td><td>48.0</td><td>59.7</td></tr><tr><td>Incapacity Supplement</td><td>-</td><td>48.3</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Con)</td><td>36.2</td><td>62.7</td></tr><tr><td>Guardian's Payment (Non-con)</td><td>23.9</td><td>59.0</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-Retirement Allowance</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance (Means)</td><td>18.0</td><td>54.8</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Allowance</td><td>23.8</td><td>47.9</td></tr><tr><td>Jobseeker's Benefit</td><td>15.1</td><td>34.0</td></tr><tr><td>JA/JB Fraud Control</td><td>13.7</td><td>24.9</td></tr><tr><td>Respite Care Grant</td><td>23.4</td><td>60.8</td></tr><tr><td>Insurability of Employment</td><td>34.0</td><td>72.1</td></tr><tr><td>Supplementary Welfare Allowance</td><td>6.3</td><td>17.6</td></tr><tr><td>Treatment Benefits</td><td>28.8</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Con)</td><td>27.5</td><td>55.3</td></tr><tr><td>Survivor's Pension (Non-con)</td><td>18.1</td><td>53.1</td></tr><tr><td>Widows Parent Grant</td><td>22.0</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>All Appeals</td><td>25.1</td><td>52.5</td></tr></table></p><p><b>Appeals processing times by scheme 01/01/2012 &ndash;

The parent in question must submit with the child&rsquo;s passport application a detailed statement outlining his/her claimed periods of lawful residence.  S/he must also provide proofs to verify such residence.  The kind of proofs that are acceptable in the context of a passport applications are immigration stamps on passports and/or registration cards which are issued by the Garda National Immigration Bureau. </p><p>- Irish citizenship can also be demonstrated if the child&rsquo;s parent has a permission under the immigration laws of the United Kingdom to reside in Northern Ireland without any restriction on his/her period of residence.  In this case, the parent&rsquo;s passport containing the relevant stamp would have to be submitted with the child&rsquo;s passport application. </p><p>- If the child was born outside the State, s/he may qualify for Irish citizenship through an Irish-born grandparent.  This citizenship process is known as Foreign Birth Registration (FBR) and is administered by the Consular Section in this Department.  FBR certificates are issued to those applicants who can successfully establish their family link to Irish-born grandparents.  This certificate must be submitted with a passport application form to demonstrate the person&rsquo;s Irish citizenship.

This certificate would be acceptable evidence of his/her Irish citizenship in any future passport application.  More information about naturalisation is available on <i>.</i></p><p>Identity </p><p>In terms of identity, the proper Garda witnessing of the child&rsquo;s application form and photographs along with the submission of his/her long form birth certificate and the entry of the child&rsquo;s PPS number on the application form will be sufficient to meet the Act&rsquo;s identity requirements. </p><p>Guardianship consent </p><p>The Act requires the witnessed of the child&rsquo;s guardian(s).

The turnaround time for first time applications is longer at 25 working days due to the additional anti-fraud measures required and the need to establish citizenship.</p>  <p>  Applications made for Irish passports from outside the jurisdiction can take up to six weeks.</p>  <p>  Throughout this year the demand for passports has been exceptionally high.  From 1 January to 20 May the Passport Service has received a total of 335,473 applications for passport books and 10,490 for passport cards.  This represents a significant increase of almost 15% in applications for passport books compared to the same period last year. </p>  <p>  To address the anticipated increase over the summer season, the Passport Service has recruited Temporary Clerical Officers who will work a total of 5,122 weeks this year.  Additional Temporary Clerical Officers will be recruited shortly for a total of 780 weeks to manage the significant increase in phone calls and customer queries over the remaining peak period to August.  In view of the sustained increase in applications over last year processing work has been redistributed across passport offices in recent months and staff re-deployed from other areas of the Department as needed to respond to the increased workload. </p>  <p>  The Passport Office provides a free reminder service to passport holders when their passport is approaching its expiry date &ndash; I would encourage passport holders to register on the Passport Office website to avail of this reminder service. </p>  <p>  I strongly recommend that citizens check that the expiry date on their passports, prior to booking overseas travel.  While Passport Express passport renewal applications can take up to 15 working days to process, it is best practice for prospective travellers to allow at least six weeks for passport applications to be processed and to take special care to ensure that application forms are correctly completed (for example failure to submit the necessary documentation required by an application can often cause a delay in processing turnaround time).  Submission of applications in good time is particularly important during the peak season which runs from April until August. </p>  <p>  The Passport Service will continue to closely monitor the situation to ensure the effective deployment of staff resources.</p></reply>

It will ensure that the identity of first-time applicants for Irish passports is further verified to a high standard. </p><p>The Public Services Card is used increasingly as an efficient and secure means to access government services including social welfare services and for the purposes of free travel.  Already over 1.8 million PSCs are in circulation. </p><p>This new requirement was announced by my Department on 10 March and received extensive press coverage.  Information notices have been posted in the Passport Offices in Dublin and Cork, as well as in Department of Social Protection offices, to advise customers they will be required to present a Public Services Card when applying for a Passport.  These information notices were also circulated to all Garda stations.  Additionally my Department&rsquo;s website advises first time applicants of the requirement for this card and answers frequently asked questions. </p><p>This new requirement to hold a valid Public Services Card dispenses with previous photo identification requirements for passport purposes such as a certified copy of a driving licence or college identification.  It also dispenses with the requirement for proof of name. </p><p>Where a person does not currently have a Public Services Card, they can get one through a secure process of face-to-face registration at the offices of the Department of Social Protection.  Customers will have to produce relevant documents to complete the PSC registration.  An online appointment booking service is available at <i>. </i></p><p>I would underline that the new measure applies only to first time adult applicants and in cases of passports issued before 1 January 2005 which are lost, stolen or damaged.  It does not apply in the case of applications for renewals of passports or to applications for children. </p><p>The indications so far are that this year will see a significant increase in outbound travel from Ireland.  I would take this opportunity to encourage applicants to check their passport validity before they book their travel.  If a new passport is needed, then it is best to apply at least six weeks in advance of the intended travel date.  It is particularly important to keep an eye on the validity for children&rsquo;s passports as it is shorter than for adults. </p><p>When renewing passports, applicants should select the service which will have their passports returned to them in time for travel.  For people travelling in three weeks or more, the Passport Express Service operated by <i>An Post</i>remains the cheapest and most convenient way to apply.  For those travelling in less than three weeks, an appointment should be made at the Passport Offices in Dublin or Cork through the Passport Service webpage. </p><p>The Deputy, or applicant, may wish to contact the Passport Service, (Ms. Liz Finn, Head of the Molesworth Street Passport Office) to discuss the specifics of this individual case.</p></reply>

Some 80% is accounted for under the budget allocation to Vote 27 - International Co-operation of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which manages the Irish Aid programme.  The remaining 20% is accounted for by Ireland&rsquo;s share of the EU Development cooperation budget and by development contributions by other Government Departments, mainly to Multilateral and International Organisations.</p><p>Since 2011, Ireland has provided in excess of &euro;3.8 billion in ODA.  This has involved very significant annual contributions in excess of &euro;600 million, at a time of great economic difficulty.  It is a clear demonstration of our commitment to Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme.  For the record a summary of annual contributions since 2011 is set out in the following table:  <table><tr><th></th><th>Other ODA  </th><th>Vote 27 </th><th>Total ODA</th></tr><tr><td></td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td><td>&euro;m</td></tr><tr><td>2016 (Budget) </td><td>155.00</td><td>486.04</td><td>641.04</td></tr><tr><td>2015 </td><td>165.82</td><td>481.69</td><td>647.51</td></tr><tr><td>2014</td><td>138.57 </td><td>476.29 </td><td>614.86 </td></tr><tr><td>2013</td><td>140.39 </td><td>496.70</td><td>637.09 </td></tr><tr><td>2012</td><td>121.52</td><td>507.38</td><td>628.90</td></tr><tr><td>2011</td><td>136.86</td><td>520.18</td><td>657.04</td></tr></table></p><p>In 2015, Ireland&rsquo;s budget allocation for ODA was &euro;601 million while the final outturn was &euro;647 million.  This represented an increase of almost &euro;33 million or just over 5% on the 2014 level.  In the current year - 2016, Ireland&rsquo;s budget allocation to ODA is just over &euro;641 million - an increase of 7% on the 2015 budget allocation.  I expect, based on past experience, that the final outturn for 2016 may exceed the budget allocation. However this final figure will not be available until early 2017. </p><p>The Government&rsquo;s policy for international development &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, clearly articulates our commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  This commitment is restated in the Programme for Government, in which we have committed to making progress towards the UN target as resources permit. </p><p>As Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery strengthens and consolidates, we are committed to make good on that commitment, and moving towards the UN target in a managed and sustainable manner.</p></reply>

An early resumption of negotiations and progress on the core issue of a political transition are central to achieving a political solution.

Our Embassy in Washington and Consulates elsewhere in the US are active in advocating immigration reform and the issue is also regularly addressed in high level political contacts between Ireland and the US Government.</p>  <p>  During the recent visits to Washington for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day the Taoiseach and I met President Obama, Vice President Biden, Speaker Ryan, Senator Schumer and other key Congressional contacts from both sides of the aisle.  During these meetings we emphasised the plight of the undocumented Irish in the US and encouraged both Houses of Congress to work towards a comprehensive package of immigration reform measures.</p>  <p>  In his speech at the Speaker&rsquo;s lunch at Capitol Hill, the Taoiseach also addressed the issues of immigration reform and urged Republicans and Democrats to work together to address the concerns of the undocumented Irish in the US.

An estimated 400,000 people have been killed, and some 13.5 million people within Syria need humanitarian assistance.  The UN estimates that more than 4.8 million Syrians have now fled to neighbouring countries.  The Syria crisis threatens the sovereignty, stability and national unity of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan through a massive refugee crisis.</p>  <p>  A peaceful solution to this conflict is essential.  The Assad regime has consistently sought to undermine all avenues which could lead to a political solution, repeatedly choosing further violence against its own population over an inclusive political solution.  Alleviating the suffering of the millions of Syrians affected by the actions of the regime, and by the crimes of Daesh and other terrorist groups, is a priority for Ireland and for the EU.</p>  <p>  Negotiations within a UN framework offer the best avenue for action, and an early resumption of UN-sponsored negotiations is central to progress on the core issue of a political transition, and, ultimately, to achieving a political solution. Ireland strongly endorses the efforts of the United Nations to renew peace negotiations based on the 2012 Geneva communique principles and UN Security Council Resolution 2254.  These principles include the ending of violence, the formation of a transitional governing body with full executive powers and a constitutional reform process which would protect Syria&rsquo;s multi-ethnic and multi-sectarian character.  With our EU partners, and at the UN, Ireland will continue to support all efforts for a peaceful solution to the interlinked conflicts across the region.  I discussed these issues with my EU colleagues at the Foreign Affairs Council yesterday, underlining the need for a clear EU voice and strong EU policies on achieving a political solution and addressing the humanitarian crisis.</p>  <p>  In addition to action at EU level, I believe that there must also be legal accountability for victims of the Syrian conflict and in 2014 Ireland co-sponsored a resolution called for referral of the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.</p>  <p>  This war has given rise to a humanitarian crisis of unprecedented scale.  The UN has appealed for over $7.7 billion in humanitarian funding for 2016 alone.  The European Union and its Member States have together mobilised more than &euro;5 billion since the onset of the crisis.  At the London Syria Conference in February 2016, the EU and its Member States pledged a further &euro;3 billion to meet the needs of the Syrian people.</p>  <p>  Ireland has pledged &euro;20 million in support for the Syria crisis this year, which will bring Ireland&rsquo;s total humanitarian assistance to Syria to &euro;62 million since 2012.  We are working with our UN, EU, Red Cross and NGO partners to maximise the effectiveness and impact of this funding. In allocating Irish Aid funding, I have sought to balance the needs of those inside Syria, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas, with the needs of those who have fled to neighbouring countries.</p>  <p>  Ireland is strongly committed to providing ongoing humanitarian support, which is crucial to alleviating suffering, but aid cannot by itself resolve the crisis.  I call on all parties, including all members of the International Syria Support Group, to support the UN&rsquo;s efforts and to commit themselves to work for a nationwide ceasefire, and for a negotiated peace agreement which will protect the rights of the Syrian people and which will preserve the pluralistic character, unity and sovereignty of a free and democratic Syria at peace.</p></reply>

I would expect that discussions on prison issues will continue with the incoming Northern Ireland Minister for Justice once appointed.</p>  <p>  The murder of prison officer Adrian Ismay in March this year has severely damaged trust in Maghaberry between prison staff and prisoners associated with so called dissident republican groups.  As the Deputy will be aware, this relationship was already fragile.  I deplore this reprehensible killing.  There is no excuse for such criminal activity.  My sympathies are with the Ismay family, his friends and his colleagues.</p>  <p>  Officials from my Department engage on a regular basis with a range of interlocutors across the devolved and non-devolved prison authorities, the Red Cross, and the independent assessors to discuss, explore and encourage progress on a wide range of issues within Maghaberry Prison.  Indeed, a senior official of my Department recently met with the Red Cross in this regard.</p>  <p>  The implementation of the Independent Assessment Team recommendations of the Stocktake Report of 2014 remains on the agenda and is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  I have met with members of the Independent Assessment Team, as well as other contacts, and my officials continue to keep me fully up to date on developments in the prison.  It remains my strong view that the full implementation of the recommendations of the Independent Assessment Team is dependent upon the establishment of a reasonable level of trust between prisoners and prison staff.  The murder of Adrian Ismay, and that of David Black in 2012, have undoubtedly set back the prospects for building trust and making progress on the implementation of these recommendations.</p>  <p>  The report of November 2015 by the Criminal Justice Inspector, Brendan McGuigan, into conditions at Maghaberry Prison was also deeply concerning.  I expressed my concerns at the deficiencies identified in the Report during my previous discussions with former Minister Ford.  The inspection report profiled conditions in Maghaberry in May 2015 and it noted that the deficiencies identified affected the entire prison population and staff, not just those in the separated regime.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice Inspector returned to Maghaberry in January to monitor progress and the initial findings of the inspection team were published in February.  The inspection team found that the prison had stabilised and some progress had been made in addressing the concerns raised in the November 2015 report.  However, it also noted that the progress made was fragile and a significant amount of work remained to be done to make the prison safer for prisoners and staff.  In particular, mental health provision had deteriorated and the level of vulnerability of prisoners had increased since the May 2015 visit.</p>  <p>  The inspection team announced its intention to conduct a series of announced, low-impact visits to Maghaberry over the following 18 month period in order to support the prison governors and to oversee the delivery of the inspection recommendations from the November 2015 report.  The commitment to regular visits is to ensure that the fragile progress made is strengthened.  I welcome the progress made to date and the intention of the Criminal justice Inspector to remain engaged.</p></reply>

Through its provisions, the Agreement is delivering an unprecedented structural increase of almost 15 million additional working hours annually in the productivity of the Public Service.  That productivity is contributing to the maintenance of our public services and is a core enabler for a sustainable reduction in the cost of the public service pay bill.  These extra hours were negotiated and implemented by sector and grade and had different impacts on individual public servants depending on existing hours of work.  The overarching objective of the additional hours are to reduce the requirement for paid overtime hours and agency costs; to allow management to maintain services against the backdrop of reduced staff numbers; and to facilitate amendments to the supervision and substitution allowance in the education sector.  Under the terms of the Agreement some &euro;131 million in paybill savings were attributed to increased working hours due to reduced overtime, reduced hiring of Agency staff and some &euro;125 million in the Education Sector in relation to Supervision and Substitution.</p><p>The issue of addressing the difference in incremental salary scales between those public servants, who entered public service employment since 2011 and those who entered before that date was addressed with the relevant union interests under the provisions of the Haddington Road Agreement (HRA).</p><p>During the period 2008 to 2014 the Exchequer pay bill reduced from a peak of &euro;17.5 billion gross to &euro;13.8 billion (net of PRD), a reduction of &euro;3.7 billion.  This reduction was achieved primarily through the reductions applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Acts, supported by a reduction in the number of serving public servants together with other cost reduction and productivity measures.  From the period 2009 to 2013 the FEMPI Acts introduced pay reduction measures.  These measures, together with the Public Service Pension Reduction implemented in January 2011, are estimated to have resulted in over &euro;2.2bn in direct reductions in public service remuneration and pensions.  Details of the &euro;2.2bn are contained in the 2015 Annual Review of the FEMPI legislation which is available on my Department's website <i>.</i></p></reply>

The CFRAM Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the Office of Public Works, working in partnership with local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans.</p>  <p>  Under the Shannon CFRAM Study, draft predictive flood maps have been produced and were the subject of a Public Consultation event in Adare on 14th April, 2015.  In addition, on 9th December, 2015 a further Public Consultation event was held to present preliminary options to manage the assessed flood risks in Adare AFA.  The draft maps are now being finalised following the conclusion of the national statutory public consultation process on 23rd December, 2015.</p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures that can address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified.  The draft Plans will include a prioritised list of measures to address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  These Plans will be available for public consultation in 2016.</p>  <p>  The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Plans.</p></reply>

Inclusion on the Record of Protected Structures places a duty of care on the owners and occupiers of protected structures and also gives planning authorities powers to deal with development proposals affecting them and to seek to safeguard their future.</p>  <p>  Under Section 54 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a planning authority may add to or delete from its record of protected structures a structure, a specified part of a structure or a specified feature of the attendant grounds of a structure.  Such a structure, specified part of a structure, or specified feature remains on the record of protected structures until such time as the planning authority deletes it.  Provision is made in the Act for the carrying out of works to protected structures either by way of planning permission or on the foot of a declaration received from a planning authority that certain works that would not materially affect the character of a structure are exempted development.  There is a duty of owners and occupiers to protect structures from endangerment.  Where structures become endangered or unauthorised development has been or is being carried out, the planning authority has the powers to take appropriate action.</p></reply>

The Terms and Conditions of the Lease were agreed by all parties at the time of the execution of the Lease. Since the commencement of the Lease, the rent payable has been reviewed by two Independent Arbitrators on two separate occasions. As already indicated above all monies due on foot of the lease have been paid.</p>  <p>  Having had the matter thoroughly reviewed the Director General, in his letter to the Clerk of the Committee of Public Accounts has confirmed that he is satisfied that the HSE has acted appropriately at all times and has adhered with the Terms and Conditions of the Lease.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.  Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33m from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18 November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people and disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he raised.  If you have not received a reply from the HSE within 15 working days please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.</p></reply>

These are:</p><p>- A national Environmental and Health Unit should be formed to assess alleged risks to public health from environmental stressors;</p><p>- This unit should put a surveillance system in place to monitor health data and assess any unusual incidents of disease or syndromes in the population; and</p><p>- As there is currently no national register for rare diseases including Guillan Barre Syndrome, consideration should be given to establishing such a register as per the recommendation in the National Rare Disease Plan for Ireland 2014-2018 for an All-Ireland Network of Rare Disease Registries.</p><p>These recommendations are solely within the remit of the HSE and I have asked Dr. Kevin Kelleher, Assistant National Director, Health and Well Being, Public Health at the HSE to reply directly to the Deputy in this regard. </p></reply>

The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  The Review included a general examination of the operation of the Scheme, as well as the balance between residential care and care in the community.  A number of key issues have been identified for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies, including the treatment of business and farm assets for the purposes of the financial assessment element of the Scheme.  In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) made a submission in this context on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  The Interdepartmental/Agency Working Group set up to progress the recommendations contained in the Review has held three meetings to date, with a further meeting due to take place in the coming weeks.  This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The Group will consider the submission already made by the Irish Farmers' Association and will then consider whether an additional presentation by the IFA would be appropriate.  Any significant changes ultimately deemed necessary to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will require legislation and will accordingly be addressed together at the conclusion of the Review implementation process.</p>  <p>  Significant progress has already been made in relation to the implementation of recommendations relating to the administrative reforms to the Scheme.  The Working Group is due to make a preliminary report on its progress to the Cabinet Committee on Health in June 2016.</p></reply>

As staff recruitment takes time, however, the 2016 Service Plan provided that time-related savings of approximately &euro;12m from the &euro;35m would be used, on a once-off basis, to maintain services in home care and transitional care beds and for vaccine procurement.  </p>  <p>  In 2016, it is proposed to advance the following development priorities from the additional funding: continued development of counselling services across both primary and secondary care including the provision of three new Jigsaw mental health services in Cork, Dublin city centre and Limerick; the continued development of Community Mental Health teams; improved 24/7 response and Liaison Services; Psychiatry of Later Life; Perinatal Mental Health, and two new mental health clinical programmes, specifically ADHD in Adults and Children, and Dual Diagnosis of those with Mental Illness and Substance Misuse.  </p>  <p>  In addition to new developments, the HSE is committed to the ongoing development of adult and child &amp;amp; adolescent services.  Up to 1,150 posts have already been filled up to end 2015 from the developmental funding provided since 2012, with 270 posts approved for the Child &amp;amp; Adolescent Services. </p>  <p>  The Department of Health is currently examining proposals from the HSE relating to the development of these priority services, as well as proposals for the ongoing development of a range of existing and new specialist mental health services.

There are a variety of ways in which complaints can be made and all staff in the HSE are enabled and empowered to appropriately handle complaints with designated Complaints Officers in place to ensure the effective management of complaints throughout their relevant areas of responsibility.  In addition complainants have a right of an independent review by a Review Officer while the Office of the Ombudsman can also examine complaints about certain actions of the HSE.  The HSE&rsquo;s National Advocacy Service is also available to assist people make complaints.</p><p>While the Mental Health Commission does not investigate individual complaints, the Mental Health Act 2001 provides that during the annual inspection of approved centres, the Inspector of Mental Health Services shall see every patient whom he or she has been requested to examine by the resident himself or herself or by any other person.  In this regard, the Inspector of Mental Health Services can make enquires of the relevant approved centre on subsequent inspection.</p><p>The Expert Group Review of the Mental Health Act 2001 which was published in 2015 looked at the complaints procedures that currently exist within the mental health service and examined a suggestion of providing for a separate Mental Health Ombudsman.  It was felt by the Group that as complaints about mental health services already have access to the existing Office of the Ombudsman and the fact that a separate complaints system for mental health patients could be seen as discriminatory, it would be premature to recommend a Mental Health Ombudsman at this juncture, however it was recommended that it should be re-examined as part of the suggested five to ten year review of any new Act.</p></reply>

This strategy  contains a detailed and clear plan to achieve each of the goals it proposes, with defined actions and a lead agency and key partners in place for each individual action; however the implementation process for Connecting for Life is particularly complex because it is a cross-cutting, whole-of-society strategy, which requires consistent co-operation and communication between relevant stakeholders.</p>  <p>  The Cross-Sectoral Connecting for Life Implementation Steering Group met on 23 February 2016.  At this meeting, the members discussed the current position on suicide trends in Ireland and the challenges involved, the background to the development of the new Strategy, and the establishment of the Steering Group, including detailed discussion on what form implementation will take.</p>  <p>  The Department of Health plans to hold the second meeting of the National Cross-Sectoral Steering &amp;amp; Implementation Group in June.  The Implementation Template has been finalised and comprises an action template for each lead government department or lead agency with responsibility for one or more actions in the strategy.  This has been sent to members, with a progress report on all actions due at the June meeting.</p></reply>

It is worth highlighting that the net budget for long-term residential care in 2016 is &euro;940m and the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will support 23,450 clients (on average per week)- an increase of 649 clients per week on 2015 projections.</p>  <p>  Public Nursing Units are an essential part of our national nursing home infrastructure.  They provide 5,000 long stay residential care beds i.e. approximately 20% of the total stock of nursing home beds.  They also provide about 2,000 short stay beds.  &euro;385 million in capital funding has been secured for a programme for the replacement and refurbishment of public nursing homes across the country over the next five years which will consolidate our existing public stock and is expected to provide 250 additional beds.  </p>  <p>  With regard to private facilities, it was announced in Budget 2016 that nursing home expansion works would henceforth be included in the Employment and Investment Incentive Scheme.</p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  This Review was published in July 2015 and identifies a number of key issues for more detailed consideration across Departments and Agencies.  The Review recommends that the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) review the present pricing arrangements with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative cost for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the NTPF, and has commenced its work in this area. </p>  <p>  On-going consultation with all stakeholders and the public in general is already a standard feature of our approach across policy issues.  There is already a broad consensus on the direction that our approach to caring for older people should take, including the importance of allowing more older people to stay at home and in their own communities for as long as possible, the need to cater for people at the lowest appropriate level of complexity and the need to provide residential care when and if this is needed.  The Programme for Government commits to increasing funding for Home Care Packages and Home Help year on year, additional funding for the NHSS and seeking ways to incentivise private nursing home investment and new supported living/assisted living arrangements.</p>  <p>  The decisions that remain to be taken are therefore less about what we be need to do, but about how to do it.  This relates in a large part to resourcing and balancing of priorities within the health sector and within Government overall.  This is not an area that can be readily progressed by the kind of forum that is proposed by the Deputy.  Further, it would be inappropriate to delegate elements of public policy, possibly including budgetary policy, to any consultative forum, particularly where some of those represented may have a commercial vested interest in the outcome.</p></reply>

The NTPF has statutory independence in the performance of its function, and negotiates with each nursing home on an individual basis.  The Department of Health has no role in such individual negotiations.  The NTPF may examine the records and accounts of nursing homes as part of the process with the objective of setting a fair price which delivers value for money to the individual and the State.</p>  <p>  In negotiating with nursing homes, the NTPF has regard to:</p>  <p>  - Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p>  <p>  - Price(s) previously charged;</p>  <p>  - Local market price; and</p>  <p>  - Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p>  <p>  During 2015 the Department of Health commissioned DKM Economic Consultants to conduct an analysis of potential measures to encourage the provision of nursing home and Community Nursing Unit facilities.  This analysis is a useful input to policy in this area, but the DKM Report reflects the views of the consultants rather than those of the Department of Health.</p>  <p>  When the Nursing Homes Support Scheme commenced in 2009, a commitment was made that it would be reviewed after three years.  In advance of the Review, submissions were sought from groups or bodies who wished to make a contribution, and Nursing Homes Ireland made a submission in this regard on which they expanded at a subsequent meeting with officials of the Department of Health.  The Report of the Review was published in July 2015.  A number of issues have been identified for more detailed consideration, including a review of pricing mechanisms by the NTPF, with a view to:</p>  <p>  - Ensuring value for money and economy, with the lowest possible administrative cost for clients and the State and administrative burden for providers;</p>  <p>  - Increasing the transparency of the pricing mechanism so that existing and potential investors can make as informed decisions as possible; and</p>  <p>  - Ensuring that there is adequate residential capacity for those residents with more complex needs.</p>  <p>  The Terms of Reference of the NTPF pricing review include consideration being given to the appeals mechanism.  However, it is not deemed feasible to effectively address this issue in isolation and it must be considered as part of the totality of the pricing system.</p>  <p>  A Steering Committee has been established to oversee the review of the pricing system for private long-term residential care facilities.  This Steering Committee is chaired by the NTPF and includes representatives from the Department of Health, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the NTPF, and has commenced its work in this area.  The NTPF are in the process of developing an implementation plan that inter alia will include appropriate engagement with stakeholders.</p></reply>

That decision is unequivocally supported by this Government and by me as Minister.  As announced in June 2016, it is intended that the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital will relocate to the campus in time, achieving tri-location of paediatric, maternity and adult services on one campus.  Tri-location has benefits for children, adolescents, newborns and mothers.  In all cases, the benefits of tri-location are maximised where the adult hospital provides the broadest possible range of clinical sub-specialties and expertise, and delivers significant breadth and depth of clinical and academic research on site.  St James's Hospital has the widest range of sub-specialties and highest level of clinical complexity of all hospitals in the country, as well as a strong and well-developed research infrastructure, making it the hospital that best meets the criteria to be the adult co-location partner.</p>  <p>  I am delighted at the decision by An Bord Plean&aacute;la to grant planning permission for these vital new facilities.  The decision means that enabling works can begin this summer.  It is expected that the satellite centres can open in 2018, significantly enhancing access to urgent care and outpatient services for children from the Greater Dublin Area.  Building work on the main site will be completed in 2020, providing  380 inpatient rooms, all of which will be single en-suite rooms with in-room parent accommodation, 93 daycare beds and 20 operating theatres.  The hospital will also include play areas, external gardens and courtyards.  During the design process, there has been extensive engagement and consultation with families, young people and children who are former or current users of the service, with staff from the existing three children&rsquo;s hospitals and with local residents.  This has led to the development of a world-class building which has been designed to enable staff to deliver the best possible clinical care for children and young people.</p></reply>

In line with practice in other EU Member States, the HSE, through the National Contact Point (NCP) office, provides information for patients on the Cross-Border Directive on its website and also by phone.  The principal function of the NCP (which is the mechanism specified under the Directive for the dissemination of information on the Directive by Member States) is to facilitate exchange of information for patients concerning their rights and entitlements relating to receiving healthcare in another Member State, in particular the terms and conditions for reimbursement of cost and the procedures for accessing and determining those entitlements. </p>  <p>  Under the Directive, insured patients are entitled to have costs of cross-border healthcare service reimbursed if the healthcare service in question is among the benefits to which they are entitled in their Member State of affiliation. The HSE is proactive in advising potential users of the Scheme that reimbursement will be at the cost of the treatment availed of abroad or the cost of providing the healthcare in Ireland whichever is the lesser. The patient is notified of this by the HSE in numerous ways: via the HSE website or in response to phone queries; on the Pro-forma invoice to be used for cases where an overnight in-patient stay is not required; and the letters issued in response to prior authorisation applications for cases involving an overnight in-patient stay will advise the actual amount to be reimbursed, based on the treatment code/s provided by the treating/referring consultant in the application form.</p>  <p>  The HSE also advises where a patient is in any doubt as to the need to seek prior authorization before availing of a consultation or treatment abroad to contact the NCP. The NCP is happy at that stage to advise patients of the reimbursement rate that will apply to the assessment/treatment being accessed.</p>  <p>  The HSE endeavours to reimburse the cost of treatment incurred or the cost of providing such healthcare in the State, which ever is the lesser, to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of a claim for reimbursement, in line with Prompt Payment Legislation.</p></reply>

The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has brought forward a new model of supports to facilitate the full participation of children with a disability in the ECCE Programme.  The new model will provide supports including enhanced continuing professional development for early years practitioners; grants for equipment, appliances and minor alterations; and access to therapeutic intervention.   Funding of &euro;15m has been provided to phase these supports in during 2016.  Full year costs for these supports are estimated to be &euro;33 from 2017 onwards.  This model of supports was launched on 18th November last by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs with the full support of both the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills.</p>  <p>  The Government is committed to providing services and supports for people with disabilities which will empower them to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives.  This commitment is outlined in the Programme for Partnership Government, which is guided by two principles: equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>  <p>  Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Building on additional investment in recent years, funding of &euro;8m is being provided to the HSE in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and the further development of early intervention therapy services under the Progressing Disabilities Programme to facilitate the inclusion of children with a disability in mainstream pre-school settings, as part of the roll out of the new inclusive pre-schools model.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that while the Health Services executive has no statutory obligation to provide assistant supports for children with special needs wishing to avail of the ECCE scheme, it has, to date, worked at local level and in partnership with the relevant disability services to address individual needs as they arise.  This has been done for example, by funding special pre-schools that cater specifically for children with disabilities.  In some limited and specific cases at local level, disability services have in the past also facilitated children with a disability to attend mainstream pre-schools by providing additional supports where possible and where resources are available.  The provision of such additional supports should not be confused with Special Needs Assistants, who are funded by the Department of Education and Skills to support children with special educational needs in primary and post primary school settings.</p>  <p>  Within this context, I have asked the HSE to respond directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual case he raised.

Regulations were made in 1971, 1973 and 1975 specifying the conditions covered by the LTI Scheme, which are as follows: acute leukaemia; mental handicap; cerebral palsy; mental illness (in a person under 16); cystic fibrosis; multiple sclerosis; diabetes insipidus; muscular dystrophies; diabetes mellitus; Parkinsonism; epilepsy; phenylketonuria; haemophilia; spina bifida; hydrocephalus; and conditions arising from the use of Thalidomide. There are no plans to extend the list of conditions covered by the LTI Scheme.</p>  <p>  Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than &euro;144 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.</p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the Health Acts, medical cards are provided to persons who are, in the opinion of the HSE, unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants.

This Group is chaired by the Department of Health and includes representatives from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HSE, the Revenue Commissioners and, when required, the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  The Group will consider a submission already made in this context by the Irish Farmers' Association and will then consider whether an additional presentation by the IFA would be appropriate.  Any significant changes ultimately deemed necessary to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme will require legislation and will accordingly be addressed together at the conclusion of the Review implementation process.  </p>  <p>  The Working Group is due to make a preliminary report on its progress to the Cabinet Committee on Health in June 2016.</p></reply>

I have no role in the process of authorising medicinal products.  Under European and Irish legislation, before a medicine can be placed on the Irish market, the manufacturer must seek an authorisation from the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) or, in the case of certain medicinal products, the European Medicines Agency. A determination on an application for authorisation of a medicine is based on a rigorous scientific assessment of the application against the criteria of safety, quality, efficacy, legal and regulatory requirements. </p>  <p>  Where a medicine is not authorised in Ireland, a licensed wholesaler may import it if it has been prescribed by a doctor for a patient under his/her care, on his/her direct responsibility and in order to meet the special needs of a patient. The process for this is described in the &lsquo;Guide to the Notification System for Exempt Medicinal Products&rsquo; which is available on the HPRA website. For this notification scheme, there are a number of specialist wholesalers which deal with the importation of &lsquo;exempt medicines&rsquo; into Ireland, via pharmacies and subject to a prescription.</p>  <p>  CBD is derived from cannabis which is a controlled drug. If a CBD oil product does not contain an ingredient which is a controlled substance, it may be feasible to have that product imported and used in Ireland, in accordance with specific conditions, should a patient&rsquo;s doctor be of the opinion that this is an appropriate treatment.</p>  <p>  My Department is aware that cannabis for medicinal use has been legalised in some countries and that there have been several studies internationally on the therapeutic effects of cannabinoids for a number of medical issues. In July 2014, the Misuse of Drugs Regulations were amended to allow for certain cannabis based medicinal products to be used in Ireland. Subsequently the HPRA granted a marketing authorisation for a cannabis based medicinal product which is indicated for the relief of certain symptoms for people with multiple sclerosis. </p>  <p>  My Department will continue to keep developments in relation to cannabis based medical products under review.</p></reply>

A priority of these discussions will be the inclusion of chronic disease management for patients.  It is not possible in advance of completion of the negotiation process to foresee what the outcome of the review may be and its consequent effect on the average cost of providing those services.</p>  <p>  Therefore, depending on the outcome of these negotiations and their implications for the future scope and content of the service, and the relevant fees and payments to GPs, the estimated cost of extending free General Practitioner care to all citizens will vary. However, the deputy may be aware that the HSE has recently published the Primary Care Reimbursement Service Statistical Analysis of Claims and Payments 2014, which indicates that the average GP cost per eligible person is &euro;235, and that the extension of free General Practitioner care to all citizens would encompass a further 2.4 million people approximately.</p></reply>

Its establishment followed the completion of the work of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility.  The 2014 "Keane" Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility found that it is not feasible, desirable, or ethically justifiable to list medical conditions for medical card eligibility.  The membership of the Clinical Advisory Group includes clinical experts from specialist services and professions, as well as patient representatives.  The Group reports to the National Director of Primary Care on a quarterly basis. The Clinical Advisory Group is continuing its work on the development of guidance on assessing medical card applications involving significant medical conditions.  The Clinical Advisory Group continues to meet on  regular basis and it is expected that the Group will make a report to the Director General of the HSE when it has completed its work in the near future.</p></reply>

Section 41 of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 provides that the NTPF shall notify the HSE of cost of care arrangements.  The HSE may then publish such information relating to those arrangements as it considers appropriate.  </p><p>In negotiating with nursing homes the NTPF has regard to:</p><p>- Costs reasonably and prudently incurred by the nursing home and evidence of value for money;</p><p>- Price(s) previously charged;</p><p>- Local market price; and</p><p>- Budgetary constraints and the obligation on the State to use available resources in the most beneficial, effective and efficient manner to improve, promote and protect the health and welfare of the public.</p><p>The Nursing Homes Support Scheme covers the cost of the standard components of residential care which are:</p><p>- Nursing and personal care appropriate to the level of care needs of the person;</p><p>- Bed and board;</p><p>- Basic aids and appliances necessary to assist a person with the activities of everyday living; and</p><p>- Laundry service.</p><p>In relation to the cost of care in public residential facilities, Section 33(2) of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 provides for the HSE to charge for the cost of care in long-term residential care settings.  The components that make up the cost of care are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p><p>It should be noted that more complex and highly dependent residents are catered for by the public system whereby private nursing homes may not have the available skillset and multidisciplinary personnel to cater for such complex needs.  In addition, conditions of employment and tenure differ between private and public residential care facilities.  </p><p>It is important that public facilities operate as efficiently and economically as possible, and towards that end the HSE is already engaged in a comprehensive exercise to review and streamline the operation and cost structures of public facilities.  The Department of Health will conduct a Value for Money Review of public nursing home costs to identify more fully the factors that may be increasing costs and any areas that require correction.</p></reply>

Among these was the making available of more flexible state aid support.</p>  <p>  This additional flexibility would allow Member States to provide support to farmers up to a maximum amount of &euro;15,000 per farm this year in circumstances where they either:</p>  <p>  (i) made a commitment to freeze or reduce production compared to a given reference period, or</p>  <p>  (ii) used the funds to bridge a liquidity gap.</p>  <p>  Aid would be granted in the form of direct grants, loans or guarantees in the case of freezing/reducing production, and in the form of loans or guarantees in the case of liquidity assistance (remunerated in the form of an interest payment).  The latter could also be provided in grant form if accompanied by a commitment to freeze or reduce production.</p>  <p>  I do not plan to avail of the option to provide national funding to support the freezing or reduction of milk supply compared to a given reference period.  Indeed, Ireland has been to the forefront in expressing its concerns about the linkage between access to new state aid flexibility and the requirement to control supply.  On the question of liquidity, my Department is at present commissioning an ex ante appraisal to examine the merits of including a provision for financial instruments in its Rural Development Programme, and is continuing to engage with the banks concerning the provision of flexible finance to farmers.</p>  <p>  My Department is also continuing to monitor market developments very closely, and will continue to work with the Commission and with other Member States in developing appropriate responses.  Member States now have a suite of measures that have been made available since September 2015, and will respond in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  To date Ireland has used the targeted aid package of &euro;27.4m (&euro;13.7m EU and &euro;13.7m national funding) to support producers in the dairy and pigmeat sectors, and has pushed for appropriate changes in the operation of market support measures such as aids to private storage.</p></reply>

Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector.  The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play.  These measures are not enough on their own, however.  The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers.  I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.</p>  <p>  As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to provide constructively in terms of relevant issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector.  Recent meetings of the dairy forum and its subgroup have had as their aim proactive engagement in the sector with respect to cash flow issues for producers.  In this respect, the Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cashflow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly.</p>  <p>  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level.  Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016.  Factors contributing to this global price volatility include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side.  The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will continue to be a challenging year.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a facility to phase the final superlevy payment over three years was introduced by the EU Commission last year at Ireland&rsquo;s request.  Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017.  The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6m in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2m).</p>  <p>  The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017.  A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017.</p>  <p>  These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August.  The co-ops will then forward the money each month to the Department.  This approach was also agreed as part of the sanction given by the Minister for Public Expenditure Reform.</p>  <p>  As part of the discussions in the run-up to the March Council of Agriculture Ministers, Ireland proposed a further deferral of the payment to 2017 and 2018, to ease the financial burden on liable farmers in 2016.  However the European Commission advised that the legal basis for the Regulations under-pinning the scheme are no longer in existence and therefore further amendments were not possible.  While Ireland suggested a possible alternative legal approach, it was clear that the proposal enjoyed very little support from other Member States and was therefore unlikely to succeed.</p>  <p>  On that basis the focus turned to other measures in the package which can be of assistance to Irish dairy farmers to help them through current difficulties, including the doubling of intervention fixed price buying-in thresholds.  I did however raise the matter with Commissioner Phil Hogan, in our recent bilateral meeting, as well as at last week&rsquo;s Council of Ministers meeting and encouraged him to reflect again on whether a legal basis could be found to facilitate a further deferral in superlevy repayments for farmers.</p></reply>

At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs. The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015. In addition my Department recently paid &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms. </p><p>I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool. My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. </p><p>The facility to phase the final superlevy payment over three years was introduced by the EU Commission last year at Ireland&rsquo;s request. Farmers availing of the facility must pay at least one third of the bill in each of the first two years (2015 and 2016) with the balance to be paid in 2017. The Department implemented the scheme nationally and 3,741 farmers (out of a total of 6,109 farmers who incurred the levy) deferred repayments of &euro;35.6m in superlevy liability, (out of a total national levy liability of &euro;71.2m). </p><p>The mechanism required the Exchequer to pay the superlevy liability to the EU in full in 2015, and to recover the levy from farmers over the three years from 2015 to 2017. A wide process of consultation in the design of the scheme was undertaken with farm organisations and co-ops and it was agreed that once the initial farmer instalment was paid in 2015, the optimum repayment model for the balancing payments would involve ten equal instalments from the months of May-September in 2016 and 2017. </p><p>These amounts will be deducted by co-ops from a farmer&rsquo;s <font color="#1F497D"> </font>monthly milk cheques to coincide with the peak milk supply months of April to August.

Among these was the making available of more flexible state aid support.  It will now be possible for farmers (SMEs) to access temporary finance up to a maximum amount of &euro;15,000 per farm per year in circumstances where they either:</p>  <p>(i) make a commitment to freeze or reduce production compared to a given reference period, or</p>  <p>(ii) use the funds to bridge a liquidity gap.</p>  <p>Aid as provisionally envisaged would be granted in the form of direct grants, loans or guarantees in the case of freezing/reducing production, and in the form of loans or guarantees in the case of liquidity assistance (remunerated in the form of an interest payment).  Interaction and discussion with the Commission is ongoing in respect of finalising the details of such provisions.</p>  <p>  The Department is continuing to monitor market developments very closely, and will continue to work with the Commission and with other Member States in developing appropriate responses.</p>  <p>  Member States now have a suite of measures that have been made available since September 2015, and will respond in accordance with their domestic circumstances.  To date Ireland has used the targeted aid package of &euro;27.4m (&euro;13.7m EU and &euro;13.7m national funding) to support producers in the dairy and pigmeat sectors, and has pushed for appropriate changes in the operation of market support measures such as aids to private storage.</p>  <p>  There are no plans to avail of the option to provide national funding to freeze or reduce milk supply compared to a given reference period.  On the question of liquidity, the Department is at present commissioning an ex ante appraisal to examine the merits of including a provision for financial  instruments in its Rural Development Programme, and is continuing to  engage with banks and with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland on the provision of flexible finance to farmers.</p>  <p>  As the Deputy may be aware, a facility to phase the final superlevy payment over three years was introduced by the EU Commission last year at Ireland&rsquo;s request.

    <reply id="com.kildarestreet/answers/2016-05-24a.1441.r" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/dail2016052400074#WRZ02500"><p>I am fully aware of the pressures on dairy farmers right now and I am committed to working with all players in the sector here to address these issues and ensure that we have a sustainable dairy sector going forward.  As one of the proposers of the Dairy Forum my goal is to ensure that it continues to work constructively as a vehicle for addressing issues of concern to farmers and others in the sector.  The Forum has come forward with some good initiatives for farmers already, including an initiative on improving cashflow planning at farm level, which will be rolled out shortly.  The price of milk and dairy commodities is determined by a range of factors, including supply and demand at international level.  Food commodity markets including dairy markets have been characterised by significant levels of volatility for a number of years and this trend has continued throughout 2015 and into 2016.  Factors contributing to this global price volatility include the Russian Ban and the softening of Chinese demand on one side, coupled with increased production among key global producers, including the EU on the supply side.  The longer term demographic and demand perspectives remain positive, but there is no doubt that 2016 will continue to be a challenging year.   </p>  <p>  Dealing with price volatility is a major challenge for the sector.  The Single Farm Payment provides some measure of income stability, and EU market support measures will have a role to play. These measures are not enough on their own, however.  The sector needs to look at measures to reduce costs on farms, and at the development of new tools, including fixed price contracts, futures markets and more flexible financing arrangements for farmers.  I expect all of the stakeholders in the sector, including processors and banks, to play an active role in the development of such instruments.   </p>  <p>  I very much welcome the EU Presidency conclusions on a package of support measures to address challenges in the dairy and pigmeat sectors agreed in Brussels at Council in March.  This follows on from an earlier package of measures agreed in September of last year and takes account of the ongoing difficulties in the sector.   </p>  <p>  The package includes a number of proposals by Ireland to the Commission in advance of Council, in particular the doubling of the intervention ceiling for skimmed milk powder and butter. </p>  <p>  In terms of input costs at farm level, Ireland has called on the Commission to consider temporarily suspending EU import tariffs on fertilisers.  I understand that the Commission is examining this request at present.  At national level, I will continue to support the work of Teagasc, the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation and Animal Health Ireland to increase on farm efficiency and reduce input costs.  The EU Presidency conclusions also refer to the possibility of advance payments under CAP, as was done in 2015.  In addition my Department recently paid &euro;26.4m in direct aid to dairy farmers, co-funded by the exchequer and the EU, to assist with liquidity and cash-flow issues on dairy farms.   </p>  <p>  I also welcome the proposal for the European Investment Bank (EIB) and member states to work together with the Commission on the feasibility of an EU export credit tool.  My Department will continue to engage with the Irish banking system to ensure there is a full appreciation of the temporary impact of downward price volatility on farm enterprises which are financially sound in the medium term. </p>  <p>  I have also recently raised the question of a further extension of the period for payment of superlevy with Commissioner Hogan.   </p>  <p>  It remains clear that we need to deal urgently and effectively with this temporary problem.  We must ensure that EU farmers are protected from the worst impacts of low commodity prices in an appropriate way, but remain well placed to avail of emerging opportunities when markets recover.  Ireland is strongly positioned as a competitive producer of dairy, and while conditions are extremely difficult at present, Irish dairy farmers will be well placed to avail of the opportunity presented by market recovery in due course.</p></reply>

In general terms an eligible hectare is one that is used for an agricultural activity or, where the area is also used for a non-agricultural activity, is predominantly used for such activities.  An area is predominantly used for agricultural activity if that activity can be exercised without being significantly hampered by the intensity, nature, duration and timing of the non-agricultural activity. </p><p>While cases involving solar panels will be examined on an individual basis, the European Commission has advised that the area covered by the solar panels will be deemed ineligible for the purposes of claiming BPS. Furthermore, in line with the Department&rsquo;s current approach on land eligibility, where the area of a parcel covered by solar panels is 70% or greater of the overall parcel, that parcel will be wholly ineligible.  If less than 70% is covered by solar panels and the agricultural activity is not hampered by the presence of the solar panels, the area not covered by solar panels may be eligible. </p><p>With regard to entitlements it is important to note that a farmer must use all entitlements at least once every 2 years.  Therefore, if the land is deemed ineligible for BPS the farmer would lose the entitlements after 2 years unless he (a) got a comparable amount of eligible land to activate his entitlements, (b) leased out his entitlements or (c) sold the entitlements.</p><p>Finally it is important to note that all agricultural land used to claim BPS must be owned/leased, used and managed by the applicant.  If the applicant is not the owner of the land, they must have a lease or rental agreement in place with the owner of the land.  There must be independent and suitable access for animals and/or machinery for the farming enterprise being conducted. Independent access means access by public or private roadway or by a defined right of way.  Access over adjoining landowners land, or over land which is subject to a lease or rental agreement to another person, is not acceptable.</p><p><font color="#0D0D0D">  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has informed me that before a final decision is taken on introducing a new support scheme - which may include support for solar PV - that Department will run a public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to participate in the development of the scheme. Details of the next public consultation will be advertised on their website </font><i><font color="#0D0D0D">. </font></i><font color="#0D0D0D"> Before any such scheme could be introduced, it would have to secure Government approval and State aid clearance from the European Commission.</font></p></reply>

It  includes an allocation of &euro;275m for the National Broadband Plan (NBP). This allocation provides the initial stimulus required to deliver the Government's intervention and it is expected that further funding will be available over the lifetime of any contract(s).The scale of the planned intervention means it is likely that the overall cost will be significant.</p><p>Funding of &euro;75m is committed through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). This will be drawn down as part of the overall initial funding envelope of &euro;275m.  </p><p>The State Intervention under the NBP sets out minimum speeds that will be expected from any State funded network.  The Intervention Strategy published in July 2015 available at sets out a detailed service specification including a requirement that the State-funded network must be capable of delivering high-quality, high speed broadband of at least 30mbps download and 6mbps upload with latency of no more than 25 milliseconds. It must also be capable of catering for higher performance in the future so as to keep pace with future consumer demand.  The emphasis therefore is on putting in place a high quality infrastructure network that is capable of delivering at least 30mbps download and 6mpbs upload and higher speeds over time as demand increases. </p><p>The scale of the planned intervention means it is likely that the overall cost will be significant and the &euro;275m allocated under the Capital Plan represents a portion only of the overall cost, which will be spread over the 25 years of the contract.  While the Department has completed  costings for the Plan,  it would not be appropriate to publicise the expected cost of building the network or the likely cost to the State while a major public procurement process is underway.  In any case, the costs will depend on a number of variables including the ownership model, the duration of the contract and whether there is a single contract or multiple smaller contracts. Ultimately, the costs will also depend on the price that bidder(s) quote in the tender process which, in turn, will reflect the strategic value they place on winning the contract.</p><p>In terms of the procurement, five responses have been received from prospective bidders to this stage of the competitive procurement process by the deadline of 31 March 2016. The five responses are being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlisted qualified bidders that will proceed to the next stage of procurement.  </p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders. I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month. The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process. Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the Intervention Strategy document. The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that a contract will be awarded by June 2017. Rollout will commence once the contract is in place. </p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business need and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.</p><p>I am in discussion with Minister Heather Humphreys on the detailed arrangements to give effect to commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government regarding her Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the rollout phase of the National Broadband Plan. That role will include leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces and working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

The EMP included a cessation of commercial fishing for an initial three year period, after which the plan was reviewed and conservation measures renewed for a further three years.  The review included a robust public consultation process and a detailed scientific assessment.  A similar review was carried out in 2015 and the EMP will again be reviewed in 2018.  Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) is currently developing a range of scientific eel fisheries in designated catchments. Expressions of interest have been sought from experienced fishermen who wish to partake in this process. The fisheries will be catch and release scientific operations with IFI staff on site to take biological measurements of eels.  The fisheries will provide more detailed scientific information and facilitate an assessment of the potential for a return to commercial fishing for the 2018 review. </p>  <p>  There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation is not relevant or appropriate, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts. </p>  <p>  I am advised that the Deputy&rsquo;s reference to EU funding, in a case where a permanent cessation of  fishing activity has taken place, may relate to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF).  This is a European Union programme and the Competent Authority for administering the EMFF in Ireland is the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine. I will ask the relevant Minister to respond directly to the Deputy on what opportunities may exist under this mechanism.  </p></reply>

An extract from the CBA report showing the qualitative benefits entitled Benefits of High Speed Broadband was published on .  It is clear from this report and other research conducted by my Department that enterprises across Ireland will benefit from the rollout of high speed broadband and delivery of the National Broadband Plan is therefore a priority for Government. </p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the establishment within 100 days of a mobile phone and broadband Taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  My Department will be engaging with the Department of Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht in relation to the terms of reference for the task force including its membership to ensure delivery of the Programme for Government commitment within the timelines set out. </p><p>In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. The commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband services including acquiring spectrum under ComReg's 2012 Multi-Band Spectrum Auction for rollout of 3G and 4G mobile services. These investments will further improve the coverage and quality of broadband and mobile voice and data services throughout the country although I understand that some temporary disruptions to service have been encountered when upgrades are taking place. </p><p>The Department is working with  the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the  Department of Environment, Community and Local Government with a view to removing planning and other infrastructure barriers to telecommunications infrastructure rollout. </p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) aims  to deliver high speed broadband service to every city, town, village and individual premise in Ireland.  The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority. The procurement process is already underway and five responses have been received from prospective bidders to the first stage of the competitive procurement process. These are being assessed in line with the criteria set down by the Department with a view to shortlisted qualified bidders proceeding to the next stage of procurement.  </p><p>The second stage in the procurement process will be a formal invitation to Participate in Dialogue (ITPD) to shortlisted bidders. I expect that my Department will move to this stage in the next month. The third stage of the procurement process involves the issue of final tender documentation which follows the dialogue process. Following the submission of final tenders by bidders, a winning bidder(s) will be selected for the contract which will comprise one or two lots as set out in the Intervention Strategy document. The Department will then enter into formal contract negotiations with the winning bidder(s). It is expected that a contract will be awarded by June 2017.</p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and / or high demand. This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan. A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Regional Development, Rural Affairs, Arts and the Gaeltacht. </p><p>I am in discussion with Minister Heather Humphreys on the detailed arrangements to give effect to commitments in the Programme for a Partnership Government regarding her Department&rsquo;s role in relation to the rollout phase of the National Broadband Plan. That role will include leading on the establishment of county or regional broadband taskforces and working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices, LEADER Groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.</p></reply>

It works with operators to encourage them to use the MANs to provide downstream services. The MSE does not, itself, offer services directly to retail customers. enet is currently the MSE for the MANs and further details relating to the MANs are available at , or by phone at (061) 274000.</p><p>The MANs are now used by some 62 licensed telecoms operators and it is estimated that in excess of 600,000 end users are benefitting from services provided through the MANs. While 3 of the 88 MANs - Banagher, Belmullet and Knock &ndash; are not currently in use, they are available and ready to meet demand for services as it arises.  The decision to avail of the MANs is ultimately based on the service provider&rsquo;s own commercial business case. </p><p>Under EU State Aid rules, the State can only intervene in cases of clear market failure. Any question of subsidising connections to the MANs would come within the area of State Aid.  The current focus of my Department is on the delivery of the National Broadband Plan and in particular, the procurement process, which is now underway, and is the subject of detailed State Aid discussions with the European Commission.  MANs and other available telecoms infrastructure may contribute to the delivery of services under the Plan but I cannot mandate the use of any particular assets as part of competitive bids by prospective tenderers. </p><p>Demand for bandwidth continues to increase exponentially with the development of the digital economy and the increase in MANs usage is expected to continue, irrespective of the NBP procurement.  As service providers bring optical fibre closer to their end users to meet this demand, the MAN networks are well placed to serve the needs of service providers and their end users throughout their regional footprint.  </p></reply>

ComReg is independent in the exercise of its functions.  Accordingly, I have no statutory function in this matter.</p>  <p>  I am aware however that licences issued by ComReg apply terms and conditions on Mobile Network Operators, such as quality of service and minimum population coverage obligations.  The design of the network is a matter entirely for the operator concerned although operators tend to exceed their minimum coverage requirements for commercial reasons.  ComReg monitors compliance with licence requirements by means of bi-annual drive tests. I understand that current testing is designed to cover all primary and secondary national routes, with measurements being performed on all Mobile Networks.</p>  <p>  Notwithstanding the independent role of ComReg, the Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the establishment within 100 days of a mobile phone and broadband Taskforce which will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.  I am in discussion with my colleague Minister Humphreys in this regard and arrangements are being made to put this in place as a matter of priority.</p>  <p>  In the meantime, my Department continues to liaise closely with industry and relevant other Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks.

Difficulties for service providers in erecting masts and antennas due to planning issues can also impact negatively on the quality of coverage experienced by consumers, and Local Authorities can play a strong role in supporting the roll out of telecommunications infrastructure. </p>  <p>  The Government is aware of public frustration with the quality of mobile and broadband coverage. Delivery of the National Broadband Plan and establishment of the mobile phone and broadband Taskforce are therefore top priorities in the Programme for a Partnership Government.</p></reply>

It is expected that 70% of all premises in Ireland will receive high speed services from the commercial telecommunications market. The remaining 30% (over 750,000 premises) are the focus of a major State procurement process to make high speed broadband access available to all premises.</p><p>The NBP will make high speed broadband accessible at all premises. It is however for owners or occupiers to decide whether to subscribe to a broadband service at any premises. In the case of hospitals it is for each hospital operator to decide whether or not to make broadband access available to patients. It is also for each hospital operator to decide the quality of service it will make available, the platform or technologies it will use and any terms and conditions it will impose, if it is decided to provide broadband access for patients.  Where hospitals are located in cities and towns, high speed broadband should already be available, through commercial telecoms operators.</p><p>The Programme for a Partnership Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority. My Department&rsquo;s current related priority is to complete all elements of the procurement phase of the NBP market intervention. At this time, my Department has no plans to conduct market surveys on profiles of  customers&rsquo; of broadband services providers or, in the case of hospitals,  the number of hospitals providing broadband access  to patients, the quality of service provided or the terms or conditions imposed as conditions of access. The focus currently is on ensuring that hospitals, schools, homes and enterprises have access to such services, and this is being achieved through a combination of investment by the telecoms sector, and the procurement process currently underway as part of the State Intervention.  Individual premises can be viewed by entering the relevant Eircode on the Department's High Speed Broadband Map (); this will show whether those premises will be covered by commercial telecoms investment or by the State intervention.</p></reply>

It has not, therefore, been possible to provide funding for a range of road improvement schemes.</p>  <p>  The Capital Plan published by the previous Government in September 2015 provides for the gradual build up in expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of the road network over 7 years. The bulk of expenditure is scheduled to be spent on maintenance of the road network with some limited investment in new projects.  A Northern Relief road for Ennis is not one of the projects included in the Capital Plan.</p>  <p>  When allocating grant funding my Department has emphasised that the commitment of local authorities to contribute significantly from their own resources towards the cost of improving and maintaining the regional and local roads network is essential and that full consideration needs to be given to utilising the Local Property Tax to boost own resources expenditure on regional and local road maintenance and renewal.</p></reply>

One method is to directly award the contracts to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and the other is to invite operators to tender for the right to operate the services and then grant the successful tenderer the right to operate the services for the contract period.</p>  <p>  Across Europe, there has been an increasing move to invite operators to tender for the right to operate PSO bus services. These systems are now well established in various countries and cities across the European Union and experience demonstrates that savings of between 5% and 30% have been achieved from an open competition for public transport service provision as opposed to directly awarding the contracts.</p>  <p>  In accordance with its statutory powers under the Act and following a public consultation process and assessment, the NTA made a decision to tender approximately 10% of PSO bus services currently operated by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann. Tendering will give the opportunity to test market pricing and offer possibilities to improve efficiency and customer service. The contract will go to the tenderer who can provide the best service for the least subsidy and should assist in securing efficient and cost competitive services for passengers; it will also give a value for money outcome for taxpayers. The NTA will announce the outcome of the tender process later this year, with the new public service contracts expected to commence in early 2017.</p>  <p>  In line with international experience elsewhere, I have been advised that it is expected that savings will indeed occur in the operational cost of the routes that are being tendered as compared to present; however, obviously the quantum of such savings can only be measured following completion of the tendering competition. </p>  <p>  I think it is vitally important that we not only strive to ensure integrated and quality public transport services but also that we strive to ensure value for money in the allocation of taxpayers' money. I believe that the process underway will allow us to capture potential benefits as regards value for money and quality and I look forward to the NTA's announcements as regards the competitions later this year.</p></reply>

A Special Speed Limit may also include a periodic speed limit which can be designed to apply and operate at specified periods, for example when children are arriving at, or leaving a school during term time. The consent of the Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is required when Special Speed Limits are being applied on national roads. To assist local authorities in the application of Special Speed Limits, my Department's Guidelines for Setting and Managing Speed Limits in Ireland, published in March 2015, provides detailed guidance on the application of Special Speed Limits outside of schools and is available to all local authorities. These Guidelines reiterate that the making of Special Speed Limit bye-laws is a matter for the Elected Members of local authorities, subject to following Department Guidelines and to the consent of TII in the case of national roads.   In consideration of a nationwide 30 kilometres per hour speed limit outside schools during term time, in view of the statutory provisions already available to local authorities, it is my view that the introduction of Special Speed Limits can be best addressed through discussions between all interested parties locally, including council officials and Elected Members, community groups, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and TII rather than being centrally imposed.</p></reply>

The purpose of the Regulation is to ensure transparency in the subvention paid for public transport services by requiring all PSO transport services to be subject to contracts. Public money made available to operators in line with the Regulation's requirements ensures compliance with the general EU legal framework regarding State Aid. The Regulation is supported in domestic legislation by the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 (as amended).</p><p>By the very nature of this regulatory framework, the PSO services in question are services deemed to be socially necessary but financially unviable and therefore Bus &Eacute;ireann is not operating 'below cost selling' on these PSO routes. Each year the fares charged on the Bus &Eacute;ireann PSO services are determined by the NTA and each year the NTA audits the assignment of costs between Bus &Eacute;ireann's PSO services and its other commercial services to help guard against the potential for cross-subsidisation of commercial services by Exchequer funding.</p><p>As I've just alluded to, Bus &Eacute;ireann does also operate commercial services under the Expressway brand. These services are not in receipt of any Exchequer funds and are subject to competitive pressure from any other licensed operator. The third major area of operations for Bus &Eacute;ireann is of course the school transport scheme which it administers on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills.</p><p>The Deputy is probably aware that in October 2014 the European Commission completed a State Aid investigation into alleged unlawful State Aid granted to Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus. The Commission's decision is available to view at <i>.</i></p><p>The Commission Decision found that the PSO scheme was 'existing aid' and for this reason was not considered unlawful State Aid. However, the Commission decision determined that aspects of the School Transport Scheme were not compatible with EU rules and that 'appropriate measures' would need to be agreed to ensure that the scheme, in its future implementation, was compatible. The Department of Education and Skills is leading Ireland's response on this issue with my own Department providing input as necessary.</p><p>The various data sought by the Deputy in his questions are an issue for the NTA and I have therefore forwarded the Deputy's questions to the NTA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a response within ten working days.</p></reply>

Works on those roads are funded from the Council's own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.  In January this year, my predecessor announced the 2016 regional and local road allocations, including an allocation of &euro;15.9 million for Tipperary County Council.  Grants for remedial works on bridges are made under my Department's Bridge Rehabilitation Grant scheme.  Local authorities submit a list of bridges in order of priority for consideration for funding. Ardfinnan Bridge was placed some way down the list in Tipperary County Council's application.  Taking into account the overall amount of funding available a grant allocation of &euro;60,000 was made in respect of Ardfinnan Bridge with a view to facilitating progress on initial remedial works at this bridge.   It is a matter for the local authority to select, prioritise and agree its regional and local road work programme each year.  The purpose of Exchequer funding for regional and local roads is to supplement the own resources of local authorities, not to meet the full costs of all schemes.</p></reply>

Ireland&rsquo;s body of employment rights legislation protects all employees who are legally employed on an employer-employee basis, regardless of what title is given to them. Therefore, once it is clear that a person is working under a contract of employment (written or verbal), on a full-time or part-time basis, that person has the same protection under employment law as other employees, including entitlement to the national minimum wage. </p>  <p>  The recent WRC decision regarding an individual working as an Au Pair does not constitute any change to existing employment law and any persons working under a contract of employment must continue to have the full protection of employment law. </p>  <p>  All employers, including those in private homes, carry the same obligations in relation to compliance with employment law. Where the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC), which is responsible for securing compliance with employment legislation, receives a complaint involving somebody described as an au pair, the WRC will investigate with a view to establishing whether a person has statutory entitlements under employment law. Complaints involving au pairs are considered on a case-by-case basis, in the light of the facts of each case. </p></reply>

As part of the restructuring of Shannon Development in 2014, its enterprise support functions were transferred to IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to ensure continuation of support to both foreign direct investment and indigenous enterprises in the region. Since IDA Ireland has taken over the enterprise support remit, there has been an increase of site visits year-on-year to Clare with five in 2013, nine in 2014 and 12 in 2015. For reasons of client confidentiality and commercial sensitivity, however, IDA Ireland does not provide information on the number of site visits to specific locations.</p>  <p>  It should be noted that substantial progress has been made in securing projects for the Mid-West Region over the past 18 months.

Parents may agree to their children being taken into the care of Tusla on a voluntary basis, or, Tusla may apply to the court for a care order.</p><p>Foster care (including relative foster care) is the main form of alternative care provided by Tusla for children in need of care.  Fostering involves caring for someone else&rsquo;s child in one&rsquo;s own home, providing family life for a child or young person who cannot live with his or her own parents.  All foster carers, including relatives, undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence.  It should be noted that some 93% of children in State care are in foster care.  Culture, ethnicity and religious affiliation are taken into account when placing any child in foster care.</p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Justice and Equality has primary responsibility in the area of asylum and immigration.  Any child under the age of 18, which might include children from Syria, arriving at a port of entry or at the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC), and who is not in the custody of an adult, will be referred to Tusla. </p><p>Tusla has a dedicated social work team for separated children seeking asylum.  The social workers carry out an immediate assessment of need and risk, and make appropriate arrangements for the accommodation, care and protection of the child in accordance with the Child Care Act 1991.  Children are placed in the most appropriate placement option depending on their assessed needs.  Again, the most common form of placement is with a foster family.  An equity of care principle applies to separated children, which affords them the same standard of care provision as any other child in State care. </p><p>Tusla has advised me that the process for fostering a Syrian child is the same as the process for all fostering applications in Ireland.  People who are interested in becoming foster carers express their interest either directly to a local fostering team or they can make enquiries on line ().  Social work departments in the area follow up with them to check that they understand what fostering entails and if they remain interested in it.  If so, a link social worker is assigned to them and the assessment process commences. </p><p>The issue of any proposed inter-jurisdictional transfer of a child from Syria or a third country is a separate matter.  Apart from immigration requirements, the determination of whether it would be in the best interests of any child to be moved from their country of origin or habitual residence for the purposes of providing alternative care is a matter for the appropriate authorities in the country of origin or habitual residence of the child.  Such transfers are rare and, in the main, are associated with relative care or guardianship arrangements if a child has been orphaned or abandoned.</p></reply>

Boards are also requested to ensure that their memberships are of a size and composition that supports effective governance, operation and continuity.</p>  <p>  Guidance from my Department also indicates that membership should be determined by the contribution or influence an agency/organisation/individual can have on the planning, development, resourcing or alignment of services within the county/city.  In the absence of direct representation of a key agency, constituency or attribute, liaison arrangements should be put in place to ensure that there are opportunities to source requisite knowledge, expertise or information in order to ensure timely access as may be required.</p>  <p>  My Department is available to provide support to the Boards towards securing appropriate representation and calibre of membership. </p></reply>

The establishment in 2014 of Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, was a key commitment of the previous Programme for Government. It represented an essential response to reports on child protection failings, including inconsistency and fragmentation in service provision.</p>  <p>  Tusla brings a dedicated focus to child protection, family support and other key children&rsquo;s services. The Agency is as broadly based as possible and includes services that (i) may prevent problems arising for a family in the first instance, (ii) identify problems and provide supports at an early stage, and (iii) assist children and families in managing serious problems requiring specialised intervention beyond their own resources. The range of services includes child welfare and protection, family support, educational welfare, early years provision and pre-school inspection, domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services, and other community-based initiatives.</p>  <p>  It is important to stress that many children and families never need to engage with Tusla. Some children and families may come into contact with the Agency for a specified purpose over a defined period of time, whereas others may require a longer term engagement with the Agency. All interactions are based on assessments of need, with a view to assisting families to function independently and for children and young people to achieve their full potential.</p>  <p>  In 2015, my Department published a &lsquo;High-Level Policy Statement on Supporting Parents and Families&rsquo; aimed at strengthening and growing parenting and family support as an effective prevention and early intervention measure to promote the best possible outcomes for children. The Statement, together with relevant legislative provisions, constitute a clear policy platform under which Tusla provides family support services and is currently engaged in developing capability in the area through the Prevention, Participation and Family Support Programme which it launched in 2015.</p>  <p>  In relation to foster care, a range of supports are in place to assist families throughout a child&rsquo;s time in care, which can often extend beyond their eighteenth birthday. Aftercare planning is an important support, where the most important requirements for young people leaving care are for continuity of relationships, secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training. </p>  <p>  Tusla has statutory responsibility for the care and protection of victims of domestic, sexual or gender based violence whether in the context of the family or otherwise. At all times, Tusla&rsquo;s key priority is to ensure that the needs of victims of domestic and sexual violence are being met in the best way possible. Tusla also has a key role in the implementation of Children First, and ensuring that all child protection concerns are brought to its attention without delay.</p>  <p>  Section 41 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013 provides for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to develop a Performance Framework to provide the Agency with policy guidance, direction and prioritisation parameters for the preparation of its Corporate Plan, which will in turn include the Agency&rsquo;s key objectives, outputs and related strategies. This is an important function, and regular engagement takes place between my Department and Tusla in relation to its ongoing business priorities. I have already met with the Chair of the Tusla Board and the Chief Executive Officer. I look forward to active engagement with Tusla within the statutory framework, and am committed to ensuring the sufficiency of resources necessary for Tusla to achieve its many objectives.</p></reply>

Residential centres are based in domestic style houses in the community, staffed by social care workers. There are, at a minimum, two staff on duty and when needed this number is increased.  There is an average of two young people per centre, although the number of children in a centre will range from one to four.  Residential care is usually for older children, where their needs may not be met in a foster care placement.  At the end of December 2015, there were 153 children's residential centres nationally. </p><p>The age profile of children in residential centres has risen over the last number of years, and now just over half the young people placed are aged 16 and 17 years. Some of these young people will have come into care recently, while others will have experienced the breakdown of other care placements, including foster care. In some instances the complex needs of the young person will have triggered the breakdown.</p><p>As of the 29<sup>th</sup>February 2016, there were 337 children in residential general care nationally, with 188 (56%) of these in private residential placements and the remainder in centres run by the statutory and voluntary sector.  </p><p>Tusla closed its children's residential centre in Co. Donegal as a result of findings from a recent HIQA inspection. Services were suspended owing to quality issues associated with the protracted absence of the substantive Centre Manager and difficulties arising replacing same with a suitably qualified and experienced candidate.  It is envisaged that the facility will reopen when a Centre Manager is secured and the recruitment process to fill this vacancy has commenced.  </p><p>Tusla has confirmed that the three young people were informed shortly after the decision was taken on May 10<sup>th</sup>/11<sup>th</sup>to close the Centre temporarily. Two young people were moved the following day and are settled in a suitable alternative placement. The other young person is moving to a local foster care placement. The young people are being supported through the transition by their social workers.</p><p>Decisions on the return or otherwise of former residents to the unit will be taken at the appropriate time and in the context of the social work care planning process.</p></reply>

The funding schemes support national and local youth work provision to some 380,000 young people. The voluntary youth sector involves approximately 1,400 paid staff, including youth workers and 40,000 volunteers working in youth work services and communities throughout the country.</p><p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that Budget 2016 provided an additional &euro;1.1m in current youth funding to my Department bringing the total allocation for the youth services to &euro;51m in 2016. This additional funding will be used for programmes that target disadvantaged young people and to assist national youth organisations in their work to support local voluntary youth services.

When a child cannot live with their parents and is received into care, it is Tusla policy to place them in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. However there are a small number of children in care, currently 17 in number, who do not live in Ireland. Reasons for a child in state care to live abroad include where a foster family have moved abroad and have, in consultation with the Courts, applied to have the child in care remain with their family. Another situation is when a child placed in relative care is with a relation living abroad.  A small number of children are placed in specialised therapeutic residential centres.  </p>  <p>  A very small minority of children under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behavioural or other difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability.  The care needs of these children are generally met by directly provided residential services or a privately commissioned service within Ireland.  While services continue to be expanded and improved in Ireland, including the development of secure mental health facilities, there may be instances where the need for a particular specialised placement is not available here.  On these occasions, Tusla is required to make arrangements for the placement of these children in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and therapeutic services and sometimes secure psychiatric treatment not currently available in this country.  This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  Placements where a child will be detained in a secure facility are made under the order and supervision of the High Court. </p>  <p>  The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and Tusla is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.  Tusla ensure that these placements are suitable and a care plan is in place, which is reviewed within the statutory framework.  The child's social worker visits regularly and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit. </p>  <p>  As of the 30th April 2016, there were 17 children in an out of state placement, including foster care, general residential and other specialised secure care placements.  I have requested information on the cost of such placements from Tusla, and I will respond to the Deputy separately when I receive the figures. </p></reply>

Youth Caf&eacute;s offer young people a safe, alcohol and drug free space, for recreation, non-formal learning and youth activities and they make an important contribution to facilities for young people at local level.  Recent research undertaken by my Department indicates that there are now more than 150 youth caf&eacute;s throughout the country.  In the main, these have been developed, over the years, by local communities with the support of different funding sources.

No such interest was expressed at that time.  My officials also met with local representatives and officials from Westmeath County Council to discuss the future of the Barracks.  </p>  <p>As the Deputy is aware, my Department was approached by the Westmeath GAA County Board for the use of the Barracks as a training centre on a short term lease with a possibility of a future purchase and development by the GAA.  It would now appear from recent discussion with the Westmeath County Board that this outcome will not be achieved.   At present the former Barracks is used by the County Board, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service for training purposes.  A number of other local groups including the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA), the Order of Malta and the Midland Youth Services have also been allocated units in the Barracks.  My Department has also received numerous requests from other community groups wishing to avail of accommodation within the Barracks.  </p>  <p>  In January this year Officials from the Department again met with the CEO of Westmeath County Council to discuss the long term future plans for the Barracks.  At the meeting the Council indicated that they do not have the resources to take over the running Barracks on behalf of the community.  </p>  <p>  While the Department supports the ongoing use of the Barracks by the local community, the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the Barracks cannot be sustained given that the Barracks is no longer required for military purposes.  </p>  <p>I would be happy to receive proposals from any interested group, for the possible purchase and future development of the site for the benefit of the local community.  However, to date we have received no indications that this is likely to occur.  The option of disposing of the property by public auction is now being considered.  This is in keeping with the Department&rsquo;s policy to dispose of surplus property no longer required for military purposes.</p></reply>
